         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The coppie of a Letter written
by a Gentleman of account, sent to a Ladie
in England, concerning the present state
of the Lowe Countries.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable Ladye
to whom I am in all duety
bound: the dispatch of my
last letter sent away with
such great speede concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the yeelding vp of the
Sconce and towne of <hi>Zut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
made me ouerslip to acquainte your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship
with one peece of seruice don at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
by a straunger in our Campe, a thinge
worthy to bee remembred, which was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
After we had obtained the Sconce of
<hi>Zutphen,</hi> we set forward towardes the town,
against which hauing placed our ordenaunce,
with full resolution by force to enter it: there
issued foorth of the said towne of <hi>Zutphen</hi> an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian
hauing so sterne a countenaunce, and
beeing so mighty a man of person, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he seemed
more like a monster then a man: this Italian
carryinge a countenaunce as it had beene a
young Giant, vaunted him selfe, and made a
<pb facs="tcp:19679:3"/>
proud challenge before our General the <hi>Graue
van Maurice,</hi> offering to combate hand to hand
with any Gentleman hee had in all his armie,
for the estate of the whole towne. But the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
made slight accounte of his challenge,
and was very vnwilling that any one shoulde
fight with him, the rather for that he seemed to
bee so mightie a man at armes.</p>
            <p>Hereupon a young youth (borne in the Low
Countries) stepte before the Generall beeing
scarce 19. yeeres of age hauing no haire on his
face, and vpon his knee besought the General
that hee might be permitted to Combate and
fight with this mightie Champion, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Generall woulde hardlye condecend
by reason of the youngnes of his yeares, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
at the importunate sute of the
young man whose name was <hi>Rihouen,</hi> the
Generall gaue his consent, commaundinge
him to be mounted vpon a great horse who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well armed and prouided for that purpose,
set vpon this challenger, they beeing bothe
singled foorth in the plaine fielde, began to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
and run at eache other with their Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which beeing broken, <hi>Rihouen</hi> suddainly
began to drawe foorth his Cutlace wherwith
he entending to haue smitten the Italian (from
whom he also looked to receiue the like curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie)
suddainely espied this challenger to haue a
dagge charged which he was discharging at
<hi>Rihouen,</hi> wherupon <hi>Riechouen</hi> fiercely stroke
a him and at the first blowe cut of his right
arme, so that the arme, dagge and all fell to the
<pb facs="tcp:19679:3"/>
ground. Whereupon <hi>Riehouen</hi> tooke him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
and brought him before the Generall,
who not onely commended him but bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
rewarded him for his honourable seruice.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good to certifie vnto
your good Ladiship the thing beeing trueth, &amp;
besides here withall to signify vnto you, our
good successe and affaires happened since that
time. May it therefore please your Ladiship
to vnderstand, that so soone as wee had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Zutphen,</hi> wee marched with our forces to
<hi>Deuenter,</hi> wher hauing planted our ordinance
before the weakest part of the towne, we pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied
vpon it with the Cannon, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> on the first
night, our Souldiers were lodged vnder the
walles thereof.</p>
            <p>On the next morning early, the enemy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
our great preparation and whot as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
and that we were resolued to enter the
towne by force, craued a parley being no way
able to withstand vs, whereupon the Lord of
<hi>Fama</hi> being General of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinance with some
of the cheefe commanders of our army, asked
them if their demaund were in good earnest or
not, which they affirmed by a great oath to be
don in earnest.</p>
            <p>Wherupon we presently appointed two cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the one called <hi>Vandernots,</hi> and the other
<hi>Lennits,</hi> these two we appointed to go into the
Citty accompanied with some few souldiers.
On the Enemies side, two of their Captaines
came into our campe as pledges the one being
a Spaniard, the other a Wallonne, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:19679:4"/>
when his excellency had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ferred, he granted
vnto them after a ripe deliberation with his
councell at war, the same conditions that he
had graunted before vnto the towne of <hi>Zut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
the coppie wherof was as followeth.</p>

Captaines, officers and souldiers, as

Citty of <hi>Deuenter,</hi> of what quallitie or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>And if it happen that some of the said Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,

or any of the cittizens be not able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
their affaires so soone, we then graunt
vnto them moreouer the space of three daies
free, wherein to dispatch all their busines: and
that it shall be lawful for them to depart when
so euer they please. And those that shall bee
willing to remaine where they are, whether
they are spirituall or temporall shal be vsed as
the other inhabitants of the vnited prouinces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19679:4"/>
And to the ende that they may bee the more

Conuoy and sixe horses, vpon condition not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding:
that their Liefetenant Collonel
shall promise and binde him selfe to see them

               <p>These conditions beeing ratified and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
vnder the hande and seale of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
on the tenth day of Iune, the said towne
was immediatelye yeelded vp vnto the sayde
Lord Generall to the vse of the States.</p>
               <p>After wee had thus obtained the towne of
<hi>Deuenter,</hi> we gaue some small assault against
the towne of <hi>Nimmingham</hi> where we made
no tariaunce. Then we passed toward <hi>Grun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen,</hi>
and in our way we assaulted a town of
great strength called <hi>Delits Ile:</hi> beeinge eight
English mile from <hi>Giunningen,</hi> which towne
was strongly fortified and entrenched: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
wee had not lien before it aboue two
daies, but the towne was constrained by force
to yeelde vnto vs, for wee entered the Sconce,
where we had a fierce battaile: but in the end
wee put many of the Enemies to
the sword, without the
losse of any store of
men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19679:5"/>
THe towne of <hi>Delftes Isle,</hi> (after we had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it,) wee fortified it and sent our army
immediatly towards <hi>Stenwick,</hi> before which
town we nowlie, hauing daily some small skir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mishes: In this towne it is supposed that the
Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> abideth, whose strongest
power at this present is not aboue three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
We receiued certaine newes from <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>

wonderfully well prouided both for horse and
foote, I trust verye shortly to aduertise you of

which forthwith we meane to put in

all the secreet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of Christe Iesus
which might bee founde in

officers and ministers to attache and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
such as did any way deale contrary to the
lawes of their holy house, or varrie in religion
from the ordinaunces and detestable decrees
of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For wee are to note
and may easilye coniecture that although the
people of <hi>Spaine,</hi> are for the most parte gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to imbrace Idolatrie and superstition, yea
and to be aduersaries and sworne enemies to
gods truth and to the fauourers thereof: yet
may we be assured that among so many, there
is doubtlesse some that are of the contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
such as not onely feareth God, but also
are secret imbracers of his truth, yea and such
<pb facs="tcp:19679:7"/>
as shunneth not to teach and instruct othersse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
in the principles of Christian religion.
Among whom one Doctor <hi>Cacalla</hi> a very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man, who sometime had beene Chaplin
vnto the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> he fifte, beeing
heereof greatly suspected, was suddainely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
and openly accused to be a Lutheran,
Heriticke, and thereby an vtter enemie to the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> whereupon he with sundry
others his fauourers were sent to prison who
remained there a longe space while in the
meanetime, the whole house, stocke and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of <hi>Madam de biuero,</hi> were all also atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and sent to prison for the said cause, who
would not shunne in prison openly to saye and
offer to prooue with the losse of their liues,
That the religion of <hi>Spaine</hi> was false, abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
full of superstition and idolatry, and
that God blessed <hi>England</hi> for professing of his
truth. The names of which persons, the
Popes ministers there neuer ceased till they
had giuen ouer vnto the Inquisitors who soone
after being openly denounced for Heretickes,
were brought to <hi>Veledolid,</hi> the place where
for the most part the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> commonly
kept his Court, there was the sentences pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
against those Godly professors, where
according to the tenour thereof the prissoners
were to bee executed for example to others,
with many circumstaunces and seremonies
hereafter insuing.</p>
            <p>Whereupon as well for the proceedinge to
iudgement, as also for the due execution of
<pb facs="tcp:19679:7"/>
their sharpe and bitter lawes continually put
in execution in those causes, there was erected
a large Skaffold in the middest of the greate
market place of the said Citty of <hi>Valedoled,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
S. <hi>Frauncis Church</hi> and the holy house.
Whereupon was placed a chaire of sixe steps
high, for euery man to behold, right against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
face of the towne house, vnder which was
seates very broad and so large steps that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
people might thereupon sit and be placed.</p>
            <p>At the one side of the scaffolde there was
made a gallery leading from the towne house,
aswel to auoide the preace of people, as also for
the cheefe states &amp; Princes of the blood, to haue
free recourse too and fro, in which Gallery was
placed a ritch seate towards the market place,
onely appointed for the Princes and Kinges
sister and Regent of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the kings bastard
sonne, and for diuers other Princes and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
to heere the sentence and to see the law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
prosecuted.</p>
            <p>The appointed day beeing come, there was
such a multitude of people assembled to heere
the sentence and so see the execution of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
(because the prisoners were of great
account,) that not onely al windows and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were full of beholders, but also al the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
place &amp; streets ther about were stored with
such great prease, that hardly might the traine
haue passage to the place skaffold.</p>
            <p>Whereupon about tenne of the clocke of the
same day, there arriued the princes Lady <hi>Iane</hi>
sister to King <hi>Phillip,</hi> beeing first Regent of the
<pb facs="tcp:19679:8"/>
Kingdome of <hi>Spaine</hi> beeing accompanied with
the Kinges great stewarde and sundrye other
Lords and nobles and attended on with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of knights, the guard, the Archers, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Halberders, issuing forth of the kings
Pallace, who marched on horsebacke directly
to the towne house, with foure Harraldes of
Armes going before her and the Earle of <hi>Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
carried the naked sword.</p>
            <p>When these Princes and nobles were come
to the place and set in degrees one nexte vnto
an other, vpon the aforesaid scaffold: presently
the Archbishop of <hi>Ciuill,</hi> the cheefe Iudges of
the spirituall court, and the counsell of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors
togeather with the Bishop of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>
rid through the towne vnto a scaffolde for
them appointed, but the whole traine of the
rest of the spirituall courte and those of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
house went all vpon an other scaffolde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
the gallery.</p>
            <p>The prissoners beeing in number thirtye,
were brought foorth and led, as it had beene in
a triumph, one carying in the middle of them
the picture of a deceased gentle-woman: These
prisoners did all seuerally weare the <hi>Sambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito</hi>
as the Spaniards call it, which is a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
coate made like a fooles coate full of red
crosses before and behinde with vglye faces
painted vpon the coates, all carrying in theyr
handes waxen lightes, or wax candels.</p>
            <p>Nowe the cheefest malifactors as they tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them, namely those that before were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlie
appointed to bee burned, had on their
<pb facs="tcp:19679:8"/>
heads Miters or crownes of paper, called in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<hi>Crocas,</hi> vppon the which was also painted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
and vglie faces, before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> was carried a crosse
couered ouer with black lining, in token of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
&amp; after them issued a bundance of people, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, and reuiling them in most clamarous &amp; foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
manner.</p>
            <p>Immediatly after that, the Iudges and chiefe
Inquisitors were placed vpon the Skaffold, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
were placed also in order, beeing brought in
euery one led between two false brothers, Officers
to the Inquisition, called <hi>Familiars,</hi> such as to a
mans face will speake him fayre, and seeke to cutte
his throte behind his backe. Nowe were the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
sette vpon the sixe steps before the Chayre, and
as a principall partie, Doctor <hi>Cacalla</hi> aforesaid, was
set upon the first step, and so euery one in order, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the quallity of his offence. Then was
there a Friar of S. <hi>Dominicks</hi> order called <hi>Melchior
Cano,</hi> thys Fryar made a sermon to the companie
and prysoners, which continued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> space of an houre,
which being ended the L. chiefe Iustice, went from
his first place to another Chayre, purposely made
ready for him. The Archbishoppe of <hi>Ciuile</hi> went also
from hys Skaffold, vnto that Skaffold where the
Princes sate, and aduised them to sweare, (hauing
theyr fingers layd vpon a crosse, which stoode pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in a Masse-booke) namely, that they should vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theyr honors, support, maintaine, fauour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the holy Inquisition, and thereunto to shewe
daily theyr good affection towardes it, neuer to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theyr intentions, but to gyue them full power
heereafter, to burne all those, that (departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the
Romish Church) should followe the doctrine of the
<pb facs="tcp:19679:9"/>
               <hi>Lutheran</hi> Hereticks, without exception of person, of
what age, state, qualitie or calling so euer. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they should force and commaunde theyr sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
to submit themselues to the Romish Church,
and to obserue theyr Lawes without force or any
violence. The Princes tooke thys oath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the Archbishop gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> with his forefingers
hys benediction or blessing, saying, God sende long
lyfe to your Highnesses. Which being dooue, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
sentences and iudgements of the prysoners,
were them read before them, and afterwarde pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
pronounced by the Official, who called vnto
him Doctor <hi>Augustine Cacalla,</hi> priest in <hi>Valedolid,</hi>
who being come from his seate, was set vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the sayd Officiall, to heare the sentence of
Condemnation, namely, for that it was known vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, that the said <hi>Cacalla,</hi> was the chiefest prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of that new secte &amp; eronious doctrine, (as they
termed it) to those that were of that Conuenticle,
that therfore hee was first to be disgraduated, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be burned, and hys goods confiscated to the
benefite of the Iustice.</p>
            <p>After his sentence was read &amp; pronounced, <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
de biuero,</hi> Priest of <hi>Valedolid,</hi> and brother to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
named <hi>Cacalla,</hi> receiued like iudgement, and to
the end he should speake nothing against the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
abuses of the Spanish Inquisition, and theyr
detestable doctrine, as he had before very constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doone, as well without as within the prison, the
said <hi>Frauncis biuero</hi> (beeing very well beloued of
the Common people) had his mouth gagged, by
meanes wherof he could not speake one word. The
next was Mistris <hi>Blanch de biuero,</hi> called &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as her brother was before. The fourth was
<pb facs="tcp:19679:9"/>
               <hi>Iohn de biuero,</hi> brother to the rest, and hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to perpetuall imprisonment, and there to
weare the <hi>Sambenito</hi> or fooles coate as is aforesayd,
all the dayes of his lyfe. The next was Madame
<hi>Constance de biuero,</hi> sister to the aforesaide Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
being the widdowe of <hi>Ferdinando Ortis,</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
before in <hi>Valedolid,</hi> she followed the rest in lyke
iudgement, and was condemned to be burned. The
sixt sentence was denounced against Madame <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onore
de biuero,</hi> mother to those persons, aforesaide,
who beeing dead and buried long since in <hi>Valedolid,</hi>
yet forasmuch as in her life time she had greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
all true professors of the Gospell of Iesus
Christ, &amp; had suffered many godly assemblies and
Sermons to be made in her house, as appeared by
the confessions of sundry, examined to that purpose,
her bones were commaunded to be digged foorth of
the graue, and beeing brought thether in a Coffin,
were condemned to be burnt, for that (as they sayd)
they were the reliques of a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Hereticke, and
that all her goods should be confiscated to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of the Magistrate: and finally, that the house
wherein she dwelt in her life time, shoulde bee raced
downe to the ground and left vacant. And that the
occasion of racing the said house, might be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowne to all persons, it was ordained at that
present, that a pyller of stone should be erected in the
same place, and the occasion thereof to be engrauen
in the sayd pyllar: which thing was presently put
in execution and performed forthwith<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the stone
pyllar standeth still in memory heereof. The next
was, <hi>Alphous Pieres,</hi> Priest of <hi>Valentia,</hi> he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
first to be disgraduated, and afterwarde to
be burned, and his goods confiscated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19679:10"/>
After these 7. had receiued their sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
the Bishop of <hi>Valencia</hi> put on his episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
ornaments, and clothed Doctor <hi>Cacalla, Frauncis</hi>
his brother, and <hi>Alphonse Pierze,</hi> with the vestments
appertaining to Priests, each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> holding a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
in their hands, but he presently vnclothed them
againe. When they were now disgraduated, &amp; that
all the holy Oyle was cleane scrapt off from the
crownes of theyr heads &amp; their fingers endes, then
was the <hi>Sambenitoes,</hi> namely the coates of shame and
dishonor cast againe ouer theyr shoulders, and their
Miters of paper in scorning manner set again vpon
their heads. This doone <hi>Cacalla,</hi> opened his mouth,
desiring the Princes and other Nobles there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to giue him audience, but hee might not obtaine
that fauour. Neuerthelesse, he openly protested be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole assembly, that his fayth, for which he
was so rigorously handled, was not false, but true,
agreeing with the worde of God, for the which hee
was ready to dye as a true Christian, and not as a
seminary Hereticke, as they reputed him to be.</p>
            <p>The eyght man condemned, was <hi>Don Piero Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta</hi>
Knight, of the order of <hi>Alcantera,</hi> sonne to the
Marquesse of <hi>Poza,</hi> who after he was declared to be
an Hereticke, was condemned to were the coate of
dishonor all the dayes of his lyfe, and so to remaine
prisoner, besides, to be displaced of his estate of
knight-hood, and forbidden for euer, to weare anie
gold, siluer, pearle or precious stones whatsoeuer.
Next to him his owne Lady was declared to be an
Heretick, and therfore condemed with her husband,
and in the like sorte adiudged to sustaine imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Next after them was called <hi>Don Lowys de
Royas,</hi> heyre to the Marquesse <hi>De Poza,</hi> who beeing
<pb facs="tcp:19679:10"/>
declared an heretick, was condemned to weare the
<hi>Sambenito</hi> perpetually, yet at the importunate sute of
his friendes and Allies, he wore the coate but from
the Skaffold to the Towne-house, neuerthelesse, he
had all his goods confiscated, and so was released.</p>
            <p>After him was called the Lady <hi>Anne Hentiques,</hi>
dwelling in <hi>Toro,</hi> daughter to the Marquesse <hi>Dalca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uizes,</hi>
and mother to the aforesaid Marquesse <hi>De Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi>
shee also was condemed to were the <hi>Sambenito</hi> to
the Towne-house, and had her goods confiscated.
Next after was called <hi>Christofell del Campo,</hi> Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
of <hi>Zamora,</hi> he was condemned to be burned, and
his goods confiscated. <hi>Christophell Padilla</hi> receiued
the same sentence. <hi>Alphonso de Huesuuelo</hi> dwelling
in <hi>Toro</hi> and being a batcheler, was declared to be an
hereticke, wherefore his goods was confiscated and
he condemned to be burned. And forasmuch as hee
did speake his conscience to the Nobilitie, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to speake a fewe words to the people, he had an
yron violently thrust through his lyps, onely to hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his speech. <hi>Katherin Roma</hi> was next called and
condemned to be burned, &amp; her goods confiscated.
After whom <hi>Isabella de strado,</hi> and <hi>Iane Valasques,</hi>
receiued the like sentence. There was also a Smith
condemned to be burned, for keeping watch for the
Congregation while they were at prayer. And a
Turke condemned to the fyre for reuolting to hys
Turkish opinions, after he had beene christened.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the wife of <hi>Iohn de Biuera</hi> was also
condemned to perpetuall imprisonment. <hi>Leonora
de Lisneros, Martin de Saranedra,</hi> and <hi>Daniell Quadra,</hi>
were all condemded to perpetuall prison in like sort.
The Lady <hi>Mary de Royas,</hi> sister to the Marquesse of
<hi>Royas,</hi> because she had beene in a Monasterie, &amp; come
<pb facs="tcp:19679:11"/>
of great kindred, she was fauoured by wearing the
coate from the stage to the Towne-house, &amp; awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to doo pennance all the dayes of her life. At the
same time there was <hi>Anthony Dominick</hi> a Skots
man, and <hi>Anthony Baser</hi> an Englishman, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
together, the Skots man had three yeeres
imprisonment, and in that space to weare the coate
of dishonor, but the Englishman was conueied into
a Monastery, to be instructed in the Romish Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Then Trumpets sounded, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes with
the Iudges departed, but the prisoners immediatly
were layd hands on by the executioners who forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
did set them vpon Asses backs, garded by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Souldiours, who did beate and misuse them
greeuously in the way to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of execution, which
was about a quarter of a myle without he sayde
Cittie, where 14. wodden stakes were sette vp, of
equall distance one from another, euery one hauing
a seate with three steps, to goe vp and downe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
all, hauing on the tops of those stakes a peece cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
ouerthwart, whereunto they bound the armes
of the prysoners. Some of them they strangled for
curtesie, and burned them afterwardes. Making a
very soft fyre vnder some of them, especially to those
whose mouthes were pinned vp, who continued in
great payne many howers.</p>
            <p>Thus these true Christians suffered death, for
professing of the Gospell, betrayed and innocentlie
slain, euen as sheepe led to the slaughter, yet comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one another, while the beholders and standers
by, meruailed greatly at their inuincible constancie
and stedfastnes.</p>
