            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat notwithſtanding the indefatigable pains of this Honourable Houſe, for the redreſſe of all the Grievances of this Kingdom (which your Petitioners do with all humble and poſſible thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe acknowledge) they do to their grief obſerve by your late Remonſtrance, that by reaſon of the obſtructions of your proceedings in the Houſe of Peers by the Popiſh Lords and Prelates, your godly endeavours want their deſired effect: Diſtractions and fears encreaſe amongſt us more and more; the Kingdom is not yet put into ſuch a Poſture of defence, as theſe dangerous times require; the Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> prevail to the extream hazard of that Kingdom, for want of ſpeedy ſupplyes; the very Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (our dear and undoubted right) have been very much impeached. And beſides theſe common evills, your Petitioners conceive themſelves above others in other Counties, in ſpeciall, endangered. Firſt, By fear of forraign invaſion, which we ground upon continuall rumours, tending to that purpoſe, and upon the ſituation of this County in a ſort inviting, it being Champion, and bordering on the Sea. Secondly, By the now more then uſuall flocking together, and poſting up and down of Papiſts, eſpecially by night, together with their contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and inſolent carriage. Thirdly, By the dangerous conſequences that may reſult from the preſent decay of the Trade of Clothing (the main ſupport of the poor of theſe Parts.) And laſtly, After all theſe imminent dangers, by being leſt almoſt wholly deſtitute of means to prevent them; for ſince the late removall of the laſt Lievtenant, we have no Captains appointed over our Trained Bands to draw them together upon occaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, or to diſcipline them in the mean time.</p>
            <p>All theſe weighty conſiderations enforce us to make our inſtant addreſſe to this honourable Houſe, humbly craving the continuance of your uttermoſt endeavours for the removall of that obſtructive party from the Houſe of Peers; and that our poor diſtreſſed brethren in <hi>Ireland</hi> may be forthwith aſsiſted, and the whole Kingdom (eſpecially this County ſpeedily put into a Poſture of defence, by ſetting fit and able Captains over the Trained Bands, and furniſhing them with lawfull power to exerciſe and train their Companies; As alſo by appointing the leavying of more Arms in ſupply of thoſe many that were carried away and loſt in the Northern expedition.</p>
            <p>Which ſhall engage and enable your humble Petitioners (as our Duty and your Deſerts obliege us) for the defence of His Majeſties Royall Perſon and Dignity, and the Perſons and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of this great Councell of Parliament, with our deareſt lives and eſtates.</p>
