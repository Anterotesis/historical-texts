            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS</hi> Wee the Gentlemen and Freeholders of this County of <hi>Berks,</hi>
were generally met together at <hi>Abingdon,</hi> upon ſome intimation of an Election
of a <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Shire,</hi> in purſuance of your Order, for <hi>the filling up of this
Parliament;</hi> and that ſome ſolicitations were uſed throughout the County
for <hi>Voyces,</hi> and being jealous to be ſurpriſed therein by any Clandeſtine
carriage of the <hi>Writ:</hi> And whereas at this Meeting it was further taken
into conſideration, that this <hi>County</hi> have with the reſt of this <hi>Nation</hi> been
deeply ſenſible of many <hi>inſupportable grievances</hi> and <hi>oppreſſions</hi> of late dayes,
occaſioned through the want of a <hi>real, ſetled,</hi> and <hi>regular Government;</hi>
and in particular, that <hi>the Commiſſioners for the Militia</hi> having formerly
charged the Countrey to provide <hi>Arms,</hi> which was done accordingly, the
ſaid <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> do yet direct their Warrants for the bringing in of
<hi>Twenty ſhillings</hi> for every <hi>Foot Arms;</hi> which we are very confident is beſides the intent of the Act which impowers
them, and are ignorant otherwiſe by what Authority they proceed therein; That therefore, having ſeriouſly conſulted
the Remedies which might be proper for theſe and the like Inconveniences for the future, and by Gods bleſſing reduce
us unto a <hi>firm, free, and legal ſettlement</hi> of our Rights, Civil and Religious; Wee conceived it to be our duty
towards God and our <hi>Countrey,</hi> without any private ends whatſoever, to declare our ſelves in this ſenſe; <hi>That we
take the moſt ſatisfactory expedient for</hi> it, will be, the <hi>recalling of all thoſe Members that were ſecluded in</hi> 1648. and
<hi>that before the firſt force upon the Parliament.</hi> And, <hi>that in the Elections which ſhall be of any other Members in the
vacant places,</hi> ſuch due courſe may be <hi>taken,</hi> as that <hi>the Countrey may not any way be ſurpriſed or over-awed therein:</hi>
And, <hi>that the ſecluded Members may be admitted to Sit without any Oath or Engagement to reſtrain their Freedome in
the leaſt;</hi> Wherein we ſhall be ready to <hi>defend You and Them</hi> with whatſoever is deareſt unto us, <hi>againſt all oppoſition:</hi>
And pray unto Almighty God for his aſſiſtance to the happy <hi>accompliſhment of what may beſt conduce to the Peace
and Safety of this Nation.</hi>
