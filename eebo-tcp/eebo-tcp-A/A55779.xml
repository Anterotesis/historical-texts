            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Houses of Parliament, the common safety of the people being the supream and soveraign end both of Parliament and Armies; by all this it appears that they had authority, <hi>rebus sic stantibus,</hi> to do what they have; They are a rightfull authority, being those that were chosen by the people, and did adhere unto the ends of their first Election, when the test did not.</p>
            <p>Secondly that they had sufficient <hi>reason</hi> for the altering of the Government they have declared; and because the reason thereof is not impleaded but the Authority, therefore I shall wave that.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they had an opportunity hereunto by the power of the Army, as you very well know, for the thing was done, and they had been unfaithful in their trust, having such a means at hand to save the Nation, had they not made use thereof accordingly, so that you see the grounds why we cannot grant that the present authority did come by their authority by unjust means, though they got it by force of arms, and that against the consent of the major vote of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; for here were votes against votes, the former contrary to the latter, those importing the peoples good, these their hurt, those made when the Parliament was free, these when they were under new fears of bringing in the late King by force of arms; those votes beckt with reason and arguments <note n="*" place="margin">Feb 11. 1647.</note> certified by the Parliament to the whole Nation; these grounded upon pleasure. We know that a Parliament may vote and revoke, and revote again and again, order, unorder, and reorder, ordain, repeal, and reordain, the same things over, and over, all conducing in their best apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to common safety; and faithfulness to their trust, may require them so to do, because it is the end, <hi>viz.</hi> common safety, and not the means, <hi>viz.</hi> their Votes, Orders, Ordinances &amp;c. that must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate them; and as the case may stand, we may be bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to submit thereunto; but when they have praepossessed our reason and judgement not by bare votes, orders, and ordinances, but by strong and effectuall reasons and arguments against treating <note place="margin">Decl. of the 4 of <hi>March,</hi> 1647 <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> with the then King, as <hi>bringing upon them (and consequently the whole Nation) all the bloud that hath been shed in these wars, yea, as plucking up the foundatation of ever setling a peace with him which should be just and sure; yea, that it tended to the apparent destruction of the persons which have engaged, and loss of the ends for which both the Nations of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland <hi>did engage in these wars,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

themselves thereby (according to their own Declaration) <hi>base and dishonorable, being in that condition as they were in to treat under the Gallows: to treat as traitors, their cause being not justified, nor the Declarations against them as rebels recalled;</hi> yea, and <hi>Fools</hi> too, <hi>being possest of the Sword according to their right not to secure it to themselves and posterity, before they treated of any thing, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor their posterity might be put to play another bloudy game for the same thing:</hi> when we say, they themselves did thus praepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess our judgements, should those of them that did stil remain faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto the Nation, suffer the rest (because the major vote) having an opportunity in their hands thus to ruine themselves and friends, and must the people submit unto such votes so conducing, because the major part turn base and dishonorable; yea, fools, and take upon them the guilt of traitors; must the minor part of a contrary mind be concluded, and not hinder and prevent such things if they can? Can a Parliament vote down their own reasons and arguments which they have argued up in the minds and judgements of others? doubtless the people ought to acquiesce rather in those votes enforced by reason then in those contrary Votes evidenced meerly by voting; there they have their reason, here their will. Can we think that it is the duty of the Army, or others in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or out of Parliament, to content themselves with, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto the meer wil and pleasure of the Parliament in such things as according to their ownjudgements and reasons, yea, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the argued, demonstrated grounds and principles of reason of those very persons that (after without shewing any reason for what they did) decline the same, that in such a case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, having an effectuall opportunity (a well resolved power and strength) to prevent the same? No surely. They that told us that a Kingdom must not be ruin'd at the meer will and pleasure of a King have taught us to infer the like touching the meer will and pleasure of a Parliament; if it be not <hi>salus Regis,</hi> it cannot be <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas Parliamenti,</hi> but <hi>salus Populi,</hi> that is the supream law; surely he that did never appoint that the lives of millions of men should be prostrated to the meer arbitrary will and pleasure of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52463:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>In the third place, have you not <hi>protection</hi> by this government? and doth not <hi>protection</hi> oblige unto <hi>subjection</hi> in lawfull things? is it not such a peice of inhumanity, as is not to be mentioned, but with utter abhorrency, <hi>viz.</hi> for a man to seek to <hi>destroy</hi> that which <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth</hi> him? is it not <hi>Iudas</hi> like to betray those in Authority into the hands of the rude multitude (as he did his Lord) who through much difficulty and hardship endeavor to save and preserve you? did not you as well as others (nay were not you the leaders of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who did) but as yesterday, <hi>Spread your garments and Palm Branches</hi> before those in Authority who (contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the late King, his party of Lords and Commons) did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto the common interest of the people, and those that would not joyn with him, by whom you have been protected every since, and cry'd out unto them <hi>Hosanna, Hosanna;</hi> and shall you not only now in your own persons oppose them, but still be leaders of the people and rude multitude, to withstand them, crying out in your Pulpits in effect, <hi>crucifie them, crucifie them?</hi> doth not your non <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> unto our governors in lawfull things disoblige them unto your <hi>protection?</hi> non <hi>submission</hi> in such cases renders you no <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> but <hi>enemies,</hi> no <hi>friends,</hi> but <hi>foes;</hi> and is it policy for a State to protect their enemies, and that in their work of generation and multiplying their parties by Sermons and prayers calculated for that purpose?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You do not only receive the benefit of Protection, but also You claim the benefit of Provision established by our present Rulers in all cases of self-accommodation; And is not this likewise an <hi>obligement</hi> unto <hi>acknowledgment</hi> and subjection? If any of you be injured or wronged, you fly to the Law, and the present mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of justice under our present Rulers for releif and satisfaction; if it be but in case of non payment of Tythe or any thing else, without hesitancy you will seek a remedy from our present Rulers: Is it equitable or just that you should have the benefit and interest of the present Government in all matters accommodations: and your selves be lawless and not at all commanded in lawfull things? surely the provision of peace, of right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the law makes, is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52463:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the subject, and not for the opposite; or is this <hi>ingenuity</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ministers of the Gospell to render <hi>evil</hi> for <hi>good, cursing</hi> for <hi>blessing,</hi> to give <hi>Vinegar and gall</hi> for <hi>milk and honey?</hi> I mean trouble, ruine, and destruction unto our present governors for that peace, plenty, and preservation which through Gods mercy you enjoy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, if you who are the <hi>teachers of the people</hi> may take liberty of casting behind your backs the lawfull commands of our present authority, why may not all others do the like? and if so, then should we have no government at all (as the case stands) and would not this publique <hi>liberty</hi> be publique <hi>licentiousness?</hi> would <note place="margin">Tolle peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clun—&amp; vaga prosiliet fraenis natura remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> not every mans <hi>lust</hi> be every mans <hi>law,</hi> and every neighbor prove a tyger each to other? and would not such liberty quickly prove the greatest slavery when the lawless multitude shall command all? what would become of <hi>your order</hi> and men of your <hi>function</hi> in this case, suppose you should charm up among the common people a spirit of scorn and contempt upon our governors, and prevail with them to rise up as one man against them, and so wrest the government out of their hands and cut their throats (for thats the English of your insinuations)? do you suppose that you can charm them into a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential and awful respect of your cloth, and that while they cry out concerning our present governors <hi>crucifie them, crucifie them,</hi> they will in an awful manner (as the giddy men of <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sileano)</hi> observe your nod, obey your commands, go when you bid them go, and come when you bid them come, and fall down before the Presbyterian Clergy, saying, <hi>Hath masters and worship you?</hi> be not deceived; though you think happily that you will for the present make use of the Malignant and Royall Party to lift up Presbyterie and intend to make them <hi>hewers of wood and drawers of water</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you and your party; yet had you but your eyes in your head, you should quickly perceive that <hi>rebus mutatis de vobis fabula nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabitur,</hi> and the <hi>Revenge of blood</hi> should as severely be taken from your party as you now happily expect from another party; were it not better we should have <hi>any</hi> government then <hi>none at all?</hi> that of the great Turk, then of the rabble rout? will not mens <hi>wants</hi> be measured by their <hi>wils</hi> and their <hi>appetites</hi> be their <hi>purveyors?</hi> Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted irregularity is the consequence of Anarchy, and such licentious liberty the greatest tyranny; well, though you rather chuse the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards

of more bloody fierce and cruel wars, and take pleasure in trumpeting up the people hereunto by your preachments, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and tamperings, then obey the present Government in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things; Yet how you will be able to stand before the Lord, <hi>when he maketh inquisition for blood,</hi> let God and your own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences secretly debate and determine.</p>
            <p>To shut up all, let the response of your consciences in three questions, witness your designs in the presence of the Lord.</p>
            <p>First, whether if the great Turk had made war with this Nation, and by force of Arms destroyed the late King, altered the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Established Mahumetisme onely for the people of his own Nation, set up himself as supreme onely in things civil, but should have made a Law that the Christians of the Presbyterian way and Government onely (and no others) should be tolerated in their serving of God according to their judgements, and enjoy their houses, lands, and estates; no man upon pain of death should kill them or rob them, that they should meet as often as they pleased in publike or private, and exercise themselves in the worship of God, no man daring to molest them: provided alwaies they should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe an Engagement never to interrupt the publike peace nor raise up the people against them, but that they should promise to obey them in all civill and lawfull things not violating their profest prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether in such a case you would not willingly and gladly subscribe that engagement and exhort others to do the like, and bless God with all your hearts for such mercy, and favor shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, yea and pray for their preservation, and rather desire the Lord to reward their kindness for that grace, by preserving them, and converting them unto himself, then to preach and pray, and write, and tamper, and strive, and struggle to ruine and destroy them as you now do our present Governors?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether if this present Parliament (thus constituted, every way thus acting as they do and have done) had by the joynt concurrence and unanimous assistance of our present Army, lifted up Presbyterie according to your own orders and prescriptions, subjecting all men within their jurisdiction to the same, suppessing (as you should direct them) all those dissenting brethren or others whom you now call Hereticks, Sectaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether in such a case you would not have prayed for them, and preacht them up as the

great repairers of <hi>Sion</hi> and builders of the house of God, the <hi>Davids,</hi> the <hi>Solomons,</hi> the <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> of our Age, the Nursing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church of God: whether you would not have cursed all those that cursed them, and blessed those that blessed them: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would not have represented their act of justice upon the late King as the most glorious piece of justice that ever was acted upon the face of the earth, and the return of the many prayers oft put up by you, <hi>That God would return your prayers upon his heart or upon his head?</hi> That his execution was nothing else but the fullfilling of the many promises made of old touching the honor of his Saints in the latter dayes, that they should binde kings in Chains and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in fetters of Iron; that they were the <hi>Gideons,</hi> the <hi>Ioshuahs,</hi> the <hi>Calebs</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> that pull down the pride of Princes, and cause the feet of his Saints to tread upon the necks of Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in case any party in this Nation, or from other Countries should have combined against the Governors of the Nation thus acting for you, you would not have exhorted all men upon pain of <hi>Meroz</hi> curse, to come out and help the Lord against the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, whether in case you your selves had the same power over your dissenting brethren as they have over you; and that your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did sit upon the high places of Government in the Common-wealth, you would thus suffer them openly to pray against you, to preach against you, scorn your commands, orders and ordinances; to stir up the people by all possible means in City, in Country and elsewhere, and all this while treat them kindly, continue them their liberties, protect them from violence, give them an equall share of all the priviledges and Government of the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord (the righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth) judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and us in these things.</p>
