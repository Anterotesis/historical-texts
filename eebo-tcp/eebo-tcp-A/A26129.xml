            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>OH, this is a blessed day (M. <hi>Speaker</hi> and <hi>mervailous in our eyes,</hi> to see you become our <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> now that we have cut off the <hi>Kings head.</hi> And as (I take it) it is one main reason of this heavenly Thanksgiving to my Lord <hi>Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> and Mr. <hi>General's</hi> Excellency for their great pains in the business. Verily (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) I cannot chuse but weep for joy to think on't; and yet I cannot tell you for what, though I shall tell you by and by — In the mean time — <hi>prethee M.</hi> Steward, <hi>set aside a couple of Custards, and a Tart for my wife</hi> — In the mean time (I say) I see no reason but why I may cry as well as baul. I say <hi>Sir,</hi> I can baul as well as my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> here, or any man else my mouth was made for bauling; and I think you all know it well enough in the <hi>House</hi> upon occasion; For you may remember, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> how I baul'd at the <hi>Apprentices,</hi> two years since, when the House of <hi>Commons</hi> had like to have gon to wrack like a <hi>Bawdy-house</hi> I am sure I was Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> then; for you look'<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But having scap't this <hi>scouring</hi> (M. <hi>Speaker</hi>) and lived to see this glorious day, now let us sing the song of old <hi>Simeon,</hi> and depart in peace: but first let's have our <hi>belly-fulls.</hi> O death, I defie thee, for here's a good <hi>dinner</hi> coming in.

it's well season'd. I'll pass my word for the <hi>Cooks</hi>; for I was one of the <hi>Committee</hi> that examined them, and put them <note n="*" rend="inter">

I hope he will lend us some of them. And now Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> you are welcome; in the name of my <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Representative</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> I bid you heartily welcom; you may eat, drink, and be merry; for, you have laid up goods for many years, and now you are laying up the <hi>Kings Goods.

                  </gap>w daintily things are come about, (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) as well as you and I! For, as I take it, you and I, and many more here have been at all <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> these 7. years. We have waited upon his old Excellency <hi>Essex</hi> and the Admiral <hi>Warwick,</hi> and sung <hi>Psalms</hi> with the <hi>Assembly men</hi> here over and over: And now those <hi>Black-birds</hi> are all flown, and out of Tune: here's not a man of them but <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> and he is every jot as honest a man as his name-sake <hi>John</hi>; for neither of them cares much for saying <hi>Grace,</hi> Therefore sit down (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) we have his <hi>new Excellency</hi> here now, and General <hi>Cromwells</hi> honour, that cares as little as they. Indeed, you must sit down first, and my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> next; for, the <hi>Army</hi> (I am sure) made us vote it so, and that the <hi>City-Sword</hi> should be yielded up to you to make a <hi>Thanks-giving Trencher-Knife</hi> and so you were as good a man as the <hi>King,</hi> and a better than my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi>; and so you might have been still, had you not giv<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n him his <hi>Sword</hi> again, for you lose your place in yielding up the <hi>sword</hi>: and leave the <hi>Supream Authority</hi> in my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and the <hi>Army.</hi> Howsoever sit still (<hi>Sir,</hi>) I hope the <hi>General</hi> will not oppose the <hi>Votes</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> now that it is the <hi>Armies</hi> own <hi>House,</hi> but let them pass an't be but <hi>for fashions sake</hi>: and therefore (M <hi>Speaker</hi>) <hi>for fashions sake</hi> you may sit uppermost, and next to you my <hi>Lord Mayor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think too, for fashions sake (my <hi>Lord General</hi>) your <hi>Excellency</hi> may sit down next. I would be loth to d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>splease Mr. <hi>Lieutenant Generals</hi> honour, I hope he will not be angry at your <hi>Excellency,</hi> nor me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could wish you had voted all your places before you came hither: But your <hi>Excellency</hi> may sit, I suppose; for Mr. <hi>Lieut Gen.</hi> looks as if he gave you leave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On my Conscience that's a meek humble soul, and will take some other time to set you beside the <hi>saddle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for you (my Lord <hi>President</hi> I should have placed you uppermost; for, I know none so fit to have represented the <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi> as you that commanded the cutting off that <hi>Head</hi> of it! Oh, how th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s <hi>Scarlet-gown</hi> becomes your honour! It suits exceeding well with mine and my <hi>Lord Mayors</hi>; for, you sentenced the old <hi>King</hi> as a <hi>Traytor,</hi> and we have proclaimed the young <hi>King</hi> to be no <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>Traytor,</hi> when we can catch him. It was a dangerous piece of work indeed; I was as affraid as you are of following Docter <hi>Dorista</hi>; the people did so threaten, as if they would have torn us for the very raggs of Authority, and cried up <hi>Charles the second,</hi> louder than we could cry him down. I think the rest of my <hi>Brethren</hi> carried it little better than my self; for, my <hi>guts</hi> began to crow after their, old tune, and wrought like bottle-beer, insomuch that I wish't for Coll. <hi>Pride</hi> to stop the <hi>Bung-hole,</hi> till the <hi>Troopers</hi> reliev'd us.</p>
               <p>But now (my good Lord <hi>President</hi>) let's comfort one another: And though you deserve to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost, yet sit down and be content with your place. For <hi>fashion's sake</hi> M. <hi>Lieutenant-General</hi>'s honour is content to let it be so, till he finds it convenient to turn you off as well as his <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> Pray take it not ill that I whisper this in your ear; for, now that he hath made you serve his ends, he cares not so he were rid of you; since you may serve them all as you did the <hi>King,</hi> in a new High Court of <hi>Justice,</hi> because you are pleased to let it be so.</p>
               <p>The next place (Mr. <hi>Lieut. Gen.</hi>) must needs be yours. By his <hi>Excellencie's</hi> leave, you are the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the three Kingdoms.</hi> You are he that hath filled our hearts this day with Thanksgiving and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. You trained the King into a snare at <hi>Carisbrook</hi> Castle, and fooled and routed all his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. You set up a <hi>High Court</hi> to cut him off, and you lie at catch for his <hi>Son.</hi> You have made us a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> that is (as <hi>Malignants</hi> say) have given us power to put a finger in every mans <hi>purse</hi> and <hi>

                     </gap>ocket.</hi> You have made the people the <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi> and left them no <hi>Laws.</hi> And well done (Sir) for what should we do with any <hi>Law</hi> but the <hi>Sword</hi>? Or what <hi>Law</hi> like <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> met together? You it is that lead his <hi>Excellency</hi> by the nose like a <hi>Bear,</hi> and at last will bring him to the <hi>stake.</hi> You have new moulded the City. You are the <hi>joy of our hearts,</hi> the <hi>light of our eyes,</hi> and the <hi>breath of our nosthrils,</hi> though <hi>Cavaliers</hi> call you the <hi>cut-throat</hi> of our lives and liberties. For all which we set this day apart to give <hi>thanks</hi> to God, and a <hi>dinner</hi> to you, and somwhat else into the bargain, as you shall see after <hi>dinner.</hi> In the mean time fall to a <hi>short life and a merry</hi>; (may it please your <hi>Honour</hi>) <hi>a short life and a merry</hi>; and so give me leave to conclude heartily with part of the <hi>Lords-Prayer</hi> (though I do not use it) <hi>Thy Kingdom come</hi>; or as the <hi>Thief</hi> did upon the Cross, <hi>remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdom,</hi> and I promise you faithfully I will never beshite the <hi>Palace.</hi>

               <p>For my part, I ble<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l,</hi> and carrying on that glorious work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> which though I began in desperation, yet you have brought it to perfection. Henceforth therefore all Generations shall call you blessed, and me no <hi>mad man,</hi> though I have been as mad as any of you all; and yet I think I am fit enough to deliver the sense of the <hi>City</hi>; who by me returnes you thanks for the great pains you have taken in purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the malignant <hi>Presbyterians</hi> out of the <hi>Common council,</hi> as well as the <hi>House</hi>; by which means you made shift to new-model the <hi>City,</hi> as you did the <hi>Army,</hi> turning out all that were not of your own temper; so that we are all now of one soul and one mind, and lay all <hi>things in common</hi> for the use of the State, but what is our own.</p>
               <p>Add to these things your borrowing money of the City, but never paying them again, your brea<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

For all which unexpressible fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, with the extirpation of <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> and the suppressing of the <hi>Levellers,</hi> they conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound to return an acknowledgment, and rejoyce in the opportunity of dedicating this day of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> unto you and your <hi>Bellies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But since man lives not by <hi>bread</hi> only, but by killing of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>loyall Subjects,</hi> and seizing on their goods and estates, and turning them into money. Since Gold is the only Goddess of this <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> cannot establish their <hi>Kingdom</hi> without it; since your <hi>Excellency,</hi> and your Lieutenant-General Guardian, have vouchsafed us this favour of a visit which you denyed to the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> we here present your <hi>Excellency,</hi> with the same <hi>golden Bason</hi> and <hi>Ewer,</hi> which you refused from their hands. It cost them one <hi>thousand pounds,</hi> and because it was of their providing we can the more freely bestow it upon you. I have been an old <hi>Thanksgiving</hi>-Sinner, as well as M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> or any of them all, in the days of old <hi>Essex,</hi> who (I am sure) never received such a <hi>present</hi> for all his pains, but was content to be fobb'd off with a <hi>Close stool</hi> and a pipe of <hi>Tobacco</hi>; which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (I conceive) why my brother <hi>Atkins</hi> here in those days, kept so close to him after dinner.</p>
               <p>And as for you (M. <hi>Lieutenant General</hi>) though your merits out-weigh whatever we can present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and though in all the before-named exploits we must allow you the greatest share, yet be pleased to accept of the less requital, a poor pittance of 300 l. in Plate, and a <hi>Vision</hi> of golden <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in a purse, to the value of 200 l. all the cost of our own <hi>Fraternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the rest of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> here present, I hope they will excuse us, and think themselves well satisfied with their <hi>dinner</hi>: And in particular, you my Lord <hi>President,</hi> who deserve much in the settling of this <hi>Republick.</hi> But having done but one single Act towards it, if you expect more than a <hi>dinner,</hi> we must leave you to the consideration of M. <hi>Lieutenant-General,</hi> who set you on work and in the end (no doubt) will pay your <hi>wages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have but one word more to say, and that is this: We have great cause to rejoyce in the happy settlement of this <hi>Common-weath</hi>; but I fear we shall not be quiet yet. God bless us from untoward dreams and restless nights, and send us well to digest this <hi>Thanksgiving-Dinner,</hi> and to have no more of them, nor occasion for them in hast: for the frights they put us into before-hand are terrible, and the dinners themselves are chargeable and will prove very chargeable indeed, if <hi>Malignants</hi> speak truth, who say this very days Thanksgiving will costs us no less than our <hi>heads,</hi> if not our <hi>souls</hi> too into the bargain. Therefore (<hi>Gentlemen</hi>) in a word, I think we have but one play, and that is to hold up the <hi>State</hi> as long as we can, and to make sure of our heads and estates, and pillage other mens, when we can hold it no longer.</p>

               <p>I Must tell you, I have been half the world over, and yet I am come back again; and by my Faith (Sirs) I must tell you, I never saw such a godly jolly crew as are here, all heigh Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows together. 'Tis merry when <hi>Malt-men</hi> meet; and (they say) some of us here have been <hi>Brewers,</hi> and of worse Trades too: But uh — uh — let that Pass. I defie <hi>Brewing,</hi> for, I have been all over your <hi>Wine Cellar,</hi> and that's another world, but it's as slippery a world as this, and runs round too. What a <hi>Nicodemus</hi> is the Butler! he was loth to own Me but by night; he bad me stay till night, and then I should have my <hi>belly-full</hi>: Now (<hi>Sirs</hi>) I conceive a <hi>belly-full</hi> is a <hi>belly-full</hi>; and if a man have not his <hi>belly-full,</hi> it is no <hi>Thanksgiving:</hi> And if you (<hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>City</hi>) have not a <hi>belly-full</hi> of this <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> I say you may have a <hi>belly-full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had D. <hi>Dorista</hi> been so wise as to have staid at home, he might have had another kind of <hi>belly-full</hi> then he had at the <hi>Hague</hi>: But a <hi>belly full</hi> still is a <hi>belly-full,</hi> and <hi>Grocers-Hall</hi> is a better <hi>Ordinary</hi> than a <hi>Dutch Ordinary</hi> for a <hi>belly-full.</hi> Pox o' your <hi>Dutch Ordinaries,</hi> I think they will become <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> and give us all a <hi>belly-full</hi>; but in another kind (I fear) then I gave my <hi>Dutch Land-Lady</hi> and her <hi>Daughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But no matter for that, a <hi>belly-full</hi> is a <hi>belly full:</hi> their <hi>bellys</hi> were empty, and so was mine; for I had not so much as a <hi>stiver</hi> to bless my self, and they would never let me be <hi>quiet,</hi> and I scor'd up still, and so I got my <hi>belly-full,</hi> and they got their <hi>belly-full</hi>; which was one <hi>belly-full</hi> for another, and so at length I was quit with them.</p>
               <p>Then I went to <hi>New-England,</hi> and there I saw a blessed sight, a world of wild Women and Men lying round a fire, in a ring stark naked. If this custom should <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
