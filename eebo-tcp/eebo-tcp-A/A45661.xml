            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE DEFENCE OF THE <hi>SCOTS Settlement</hi> AT DARIEN, ANSWER'D.</head>
            <p>WHEN this Pamphlet came firſt to my Hands, theſe bold and unaccountable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations, with which I found it ſtuff'd up from the very beginning to the end, invited me to make ſome Reflections upon it, for my own Diverſion, and the Uſe of ſome few of thoſe whom I knew to be both my Friends, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Adherers to the preſent Government in <hi>England;</hi> not queſtioning but that ſome more able Pen than mine would take this Task in Hand, and convince the World of the unreaſonableneſs of ſuch an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking by a private Hand, which amounts to no leſs than charging both His Majeſty, and the preſent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government with Injuſtice, and a miſtake of their own Intereſt; as will more evidently appear out of the following Sheets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53874:3"/>
The Dedication, which if rightly conſidered, is nothing elſe but an Introduction to the reſt, is to make the World believe, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtand much indebted to the <hi>Scots,</hi> for ſuffering themſelves to be united with them under one Head, and cannot diſcharge this Obligation, unleſs they maintain them in their preſent Settlement of <hi>Darien,</hi> which if they don't do, they muſt expect to be treated as an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and Unjuſt People, by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who, if we will take this Gentleman's Word for it, are power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough, either by themſelves, or with the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Allies, to reduce us to a more pliable Temper.</p>
            <p>That this is the main deſign of the Dedication, as well as the whole Treatiſe, will ſufficiently appear to any one who will take the Pains carefully to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe them; for tho' he is pleaſed to tell His Majeſty at the beginning of the Dedication, that his Deſign is to vindicate the Settlement of the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Darien,</hi> againſt the Aſperſions of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Memorial; yet, when not long after he ſays, That thoſe cannot be look'd upon as Friends to His Majeſty's Dignity as King of <hi>Scots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who call in queſtion what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland;</hi> I ſay, theſe Words are an undeniable Proof, that the whole is more levell'd againſt <hi>England</hi> than <hi>Spain.</hi> I will not pretend to make particular Reflections upon each Paſſage here, becauſe I ſhall have occaſion to do it hereafter, but I cannot forbear to take notice of that unaccountable Arrogance which has emboldened ſome of our Modern Writers to foſter the Inventions of their own Brains, and their ſpeculative Politicks upon the World, under the Cloak of the Royal Authority: Will not Poſterity ſtand amazed when they ſee a Perſon, whoſe Faith has not only been call'd in queſtion, but alſo condemn'd by a legal Sentence, to cover his Zeal, Self-Intereſt, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Paſſion, under the Veil of His Sacred Majeſty's Name? But we will proceed to the Book it ſelf, which begins thus.</p>

               <p>We have likewiſe a large Account, and a full Confirmation of the War and perpetual Enmity betwixt the <hi>Dariens</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Hiſtory of the Buccaneers of <hi>America, Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>Part</hi> 4. wrote by <hi>Baſil Ringroſe,</hi> who was one of their Company. There he informs us, That the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> are commonly at War with one another; and that the Buccaneers were invited into that Country, and join'd by the <hi>Darien</hi> Princes, Captain <hi>Andreas,</hi> Captain <hi>Antonio,</hi> and the King of <hi>Darien,</hi> who aſſiſted them in the taking of <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> and their attempt upon <hi>Panama;</hi> and the King, whoſe Daughter the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſtole away, promiſed to joyn the Buccaneers with 50000 Men. This is the more remarkable, becauſe thoſe very Princes or their Succeſſors are now in League with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and have joyfully receiv'd them into their Country. So that it is the ſtrangeſt poſition that can be put upon any Nation, and one of the moſt audacious Affronts that ever was put upon ſo Great a Prince as K. <hi>William,</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to pretend a Right to <hi>Darien,</hi> and accuſe him of a Breach of the Peace, becauſe a Colony of his Subjects have ſettled themſelves there: when it is ſo well known to the World, that the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> has no manner of Title to that Province.</p>
               <p>Then as to any Claim by virtue of Poſſeſſion, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have not the leaſt ground of Plea: All they can alledge on this Head, is, That they were once admitted by the Conſent of Captain <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ego,</hi> another of the <hi>Darien</hi> Princes, to work on ſome Golden Mines within 15 Leagues, or there abouts, of the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement.

'Tis poſſible ſome of his Countrymen have been told ſo, by ſome of the <hi>Dariens;</hi> but this will be but a ſlender Argument againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> It is moſt unqueſtionable, that there is much more probability on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſide than on the other. For how can it be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have conquer'd ſuch a vaſt Tract of <hi>America,</hi> and ſeveral Plantations there, ſhould not have been able to force a few petty <hi>Indian-Lords,</hi> who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within their Dominions, to a Submiſſion? His Arguments, by which he would prove them a free People, is much more ridiculous, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Conqueſt of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that a few Cottages, inhabited by a barbarous and unarmed People, headed by many Leaders, reſembling the Heads of <hi>Clans</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire neither a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Governour nor Garriſon. What he alledges concerning the Hatred they bear to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and their joyning with the Bucca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers againſt them, does not in the leaſt invalidate the Title of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Darien;</hi> And all what <hi>Wafer, Dampier,</hi> and the Hiſtory of the Buccaneers, ſays,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53874:6"/>
upon this Subject, proves no more, than that thoſe Petty <hi>Indian</hi> Lords, who formerly, either volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily or by force, ſubmitted to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> took this opportunity to ſhake off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke, and to Revenge themſelves upon their Conquerors; For if they had been in a Condition to make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them without a foreign Aſſiſtance, What need had there been for them to call in the Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caneers, and to allow them ſo large a ſhare in the Booty?

What he alledges of Captain <hi>Sharp</hi>'s being acquitted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by reaſon of his Commiſſion from one of the <hi>Darien</hi> Princes, can in no wiſe affect the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Title; for, ſuppoſing the Court of <hi>England</hi> was at that time not ſufficiently inform'd concerning their Pretenſions, What detriment could that be to their real Pretenſions?

               <p>It remains then that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can lay no other Claim to <hi>Darien</hi> but what they plead <hi>from the Pope's general Grant of</hi> America, <hi>its being bounded by their Dominions, and the Treaties with</hi> England, which ſhall be conſider'd in their Order.</p>
               <p>To urge the Pope's Grant amongſt Proteſtants is ridiculous, and amongſt Papiſts themſelves but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious: But admitting it were ſufficient to juſtifie their Title, it is eaſie to prove that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have forfeited all the Right they can Claim by virtue of that Grant.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not publickly own her Power to grant a Right of Conqueſt, but in order to propagate the Faith, and not that neither, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Infidel Prince or People be guilty of a Breach of Treaty. So that the Pope's Grant with thoſe Reſtrictions is ſo far from eſtabliſhing the Title of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that it plainly overthrows it.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Indians</hi> were committed to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. on condition that they ſhould teach them the Chriſtian Religion, is prov'd by Don <hi>Bartholomew de las Caſas,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> in his <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the firſt Voyages and Diſcoveries made by the</hi> Spaniards <hi>in</hi> America, <hi>and the Relation of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd Cruelties, Pag.</hi> 195. and there he likewiſe owns, <q rend="margQuotes">That by their acquitting themſelves ſo ill of that Commiſſion, they ought to make Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all they have taken from them under this pretext.</q> And <hi>Pag.</hi> 200. he charges them with breach of the Terms preſcrib'd by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Brief, tho' Queen <hi>Iſabella,</hi> to whom it was granted, earneſtly intreated them in her laſt Will to keep exactly to it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 218. he ſays, That the Title of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the <hi>Indians,</hi> is founded only on the Obligation he had taken upon himſelf

               <p>But this is not all: for contrary to the expreſs Words of that ſame Treaty, they attack the <hi>Scots</hi> by Sea and Land, who had done them no Injury, but acquainted them that they came thither peaceably, without any hoſtile deſign againſt them, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People, and were ſo generous as to reject the Motion of Captain <hi>Andreas,</hi> one of the <hi>Darien</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and their Ally, when he offer'd to make them Maſters of <hi>Panama,</hi> if they would but joyn him with 500 of their Men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have alſo, contrary to the 10th and 11th Articles of the Treaty concluded at <hi>M drid, July</hi> 8/18 1670. concerning <hi>America,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners who were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a ſhoar at <hi>Carthagena</hi> by Shipwrack, tho all ſuch Practices be expreſly provided againſt by the ſaid Articles: And they have alſo violated the 14th Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of that Treaty which forbids Repriſals, except in caſe of denying or unreaſonably delaying Juſtice.

               <p>The next Topick to be inſiſted upon, is, The Advantage or Diſadvantage that may redound to <hi>England</hi> from this Settlement. We ſhall begin with the Diſadvantage which conſiſts in the ſuppoſed Damage it may do to the Trade of <hi>England;</hi> and that it may, as is pretended, occaſion a Rupture betwixt them and <hi>Spain.</hi> To this we may eaſily Reply, That being a diſtinct and Independant Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are not oblig'd to conſult their Intereſt,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53874:12"/>
any further than they conſult ours; and that we have as much reaſon to maintain this Colony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Advantage it may bring to our ſelves, as they have to oppoſe it, becauſe of the Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that they fancy may ariſe from thence to <hi>England.</hi> But withal we deny that it can be any damage to their Trade, which from that part of the World conſiſts chiefly in Sugar and Tobacco, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which are yet to be found in <hi>New Calidonia.</hi> But that which we look upon to be a compleat An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Objection, is this, That they may be Sharers with us in the Settlement if they pleaſe, and by conſequence Partners in the Profits and Trade, and lay it under ſuch Regulations as may prevent its endamaging the Commerce of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas it is further Objected, That by the great Immunities and freedom from Cuſtoms grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Scots</hi> Company for ſo many years, we ſhall be able to Under Sell the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, foreſtall their Markets, and leſſen His Majeſty's Cuſtoms: We Anſwer, That this Objection is in a great meaſure obviated, ſince we do not now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſet up an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade; but admitting it were true, it will be to the general Advantage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſince the Buyers are always more than the Sellers.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e better for the Kingdom in general, that every one who has occaſion for Muſlin or <hi>Indian</hi> Silks, &amp;c. ſhould ſave ſo many Shillings <hi>per</hi> Yard or Piece in their Pockets, than that ſome two or three Merchants ſhould once in an Age get Money enough to make a Daughter or two a Counteſs or Dutcheſs. Nor can it be denied, but it's better for <hi>England,</hi> that Houſe-keepers in general ſhould ſave that Money to buy Proviſions for their Families, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes our own Product, than that a dozen of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſhould be enabled by the extravagant Prices of thoſe Commodities to keep their Coaches. Add to this, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> if they pleaſe by joining with the <hi>Scots</hi> may have an equal ſhare of all thoſe Immunities; and if there ſhould be for ſome time a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53874:13"/>
leſſening of the King's Cuſtoms, of which there is at preſent no manner of proſpect, it will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently made up in time to come by a large Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if that Colony proſpers; ſo that the King's Bounty in that reſpect is but like the beſtowing of charge to improve barren or waſte Ground, which will return with treble Intereſt to him or his Heirs.</p>
               <p>There's another Objection made againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Company, That by their Conſtitution ſuch Ships as belong them muſt break Bulk no where but in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which will diminiſh the number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships and Seamen, and make <hi>Scotland</hi> the only Free Port of all thoſe Commodities. To which it's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That tho' our own Ships are obliged to break Bulk no where but at home, they don't lay the ſame Obligation upon others, but, allowing them a free Trade to <hi>Darien,</hi> they may carry their Goods where they pleaſe; or upon fair Propoſals, there's no doubt but the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> will give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> all poſſible Liberty as to that matter.</p>

               <p>Allowing the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation to be Independant, (tho' this has been queſtioned by ſome) our Author, tells us, They are not obliged to conſult the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> further than they conſult theirs; which indeed is the beſt Argument he has made uſe of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto in the Defence of the new Settlement: But then I hope, he will alſo grant, That this being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal betwixt theſe two Nations, he ought not to blame the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if they won't Sacrifice their own Intereſt to that of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and take all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and legal Precautions againſt their Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the Diſadvantage of our Trade.

               <p>This will appear to be no vain Speculation, to thoſe that conſider the Temper of the Popiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the Inſolence of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſitors, who ſo daringly reflected upon the late Alliance of <hi>Spain</hi> with Proteſtant Princes and States, tho' abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve that Nation from being ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by <hi>France.</hi>

               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>Moſt People, I am apt to believe, will ſoon agree with our Author in this point, That the <hi>French</hi> would be by far the more dangerous Neighbours to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> both in reſpect of their Power, and the influence they might have over the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America</hi> upon the ſcore of their Religion; but I hope he will alſo grant me, that it is much more for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt, not to be troubled with any Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at all there, that may be in any probability to interfere with them either in Power or Traffick; but whether the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will be able, as the caſe now ſtands, to gain this point, is what muſt be the preſent Object of our conſideration.</p>
               <p>I will for once ſuppoſe the <hi>Scots</hi> to be ſo unanimous in this matter, as our Author would have them, yet it is much to be doubted whether they would be ſo fond of a Project that is ſubject to ſo many Caſualties, and to no ſmall danger of ſucceeding, as the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gentry, and others, to mortgage their Eſtates upon that Score; but ſuppoſing they ſhould, it would ſtill be a queſtion, Whether they could be in a condition to procure time enough, ſuch a number of ſerviceable Ships, and other Neceſſaries requiſite
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53874:21"/>
for the maintaining themſelves at <hi>Darien</hi> even againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alone. For, granting they ſhould not be in a capacity to force the <hi>Scots</hi> from their Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, they have other means to annoy and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their Convoys, which, conſidering a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication betwixt the <hi>Engliſh West-India</hi> Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement, is taken off, may in all likelihood reduce them to a ſtarving condition there, or at the beſt put the <hi>Scots East-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny under a neceſſity of providing their Ships with ſuch ſtrong Convoys, at ſo great a diſtance, that the Charge may ſurmount the Profit, notwithſtanding the hopes of their rich Mines.</p>
               <p>What our <hi>Calidonian</hi> ſays of giving Commiſſions to the Buccaneers, is little to the purpoſe, it being evident that they have no power ſo to do by vertue of their Letters Patents, and that conſequently by ſo doing, they muſt put themſelves in the ſame range with them, which would be the ready way for them to forfeit all the Title they can pretend to upon that Settlement.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould put the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo hard to it, as to be obliged to ſeek for aid by the <hi>French,</hi> who at this juncture ſeem to be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to purchaſe their good will at any rate, it is very probable that they may have their Aſſiſtance upon much eaſier terms, than the Surrender of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien</hi> into their Hands; neither is it to be queſtioned, but that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are jealous of the <hi>French</hi> to the higheſt degree, might take ſuch ſure Meaſures as to the Number and other Circumſtances of the <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries, as might free them from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ſurprized by them, eſpecially at this time, when the <hi>French</hi> are ſo cautious of creating a Jealouſie in that Nation.</p>
               <p>What our Author alledges of <hi>Ceuta,</hi> is no paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to this; the only reaſon of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> refuſing the Offers of the <hi>French</hi> as to the relief of that place, being no more, than that they thought it inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with their Grandeur, to leave the Glory of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving a place, which is ſo near them, to a Foreign

               </p>
               <p>It may alſo be conſider'd, That the <hi>French</hi> have not ſhewn ſo much inclination to get a firm footing in <hi>America,</hi> as our Author would fain perſwade us; for what reaſon I will not pretend to determine; but certain it is, that when Monſieur <hi>de Ponti</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> they might with as much probability have defended themſelves there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as the <hi>Scots</hi> in their Settlement at <hi>Darien.</hi> And if <hi>Darien</hi> was of ſo much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to <hi>France,</hi> what could hinder them from ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling there, when Monſieur <hi>de Ponti</hi> touch'd at that place in his way to <hi>Carthagena.</hi> Which makes it very evident that the <hi>French</hi> did not think it for their Intereſt to plant any Colonies at this time in <hi>America,</hi> or at leaſt not at or near <hi>Darien.</hi>

Theſe things, together with a long continued Amity and Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and their Union in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, are ſufficient to evince that the <hi>Dutch</hi> would become our Partners in <hi>America</hi> with little Courtſhip. That they are able to aſſiſt us in that caſe with a Naval Force ſufficient, is beyond contradiction; and that they would ſoon be convinc'd it is their Intereſt to do it, to prevent that monſtrous Increaſe of the French Monarchy, is obvious enough from the Part they Acted in the late War.</p>
               <p>But admitting that none of thoſe Conſiderations ſhould prevail with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and that they ſhould likewiſe abandon us; it is not impoſſible for us to obtain an Alliance and Naval Force from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Crowns: It's well enough known that thoſe Kingdoms abound with Men and Shipping, and that they would be glad with all their hearts to make an Exchange of theſe for the Gold and Silver of <hi>America<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that means fall Heir to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, he would certainly draw the Court of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi> This the <hi>Scots</hi> were ſo far from being ignorant of, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobility and Gentry did expreſs their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the Union of the Crowns, as well knowing that it would reduce our Kingdom into a Subjection and Dependance upon <hi>England,</hi> and drain us of what Subſtance we had; and therefore ſome of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd themſelves on that occaſion, That <hi>Scotland</hi> was never Conquer'd till then: Yet ſuch was our Zeal for the Common Welfare of the Iſland, the Intereſt of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and of <hi>Europe</hi> in general, which were then almoſt in as much danger by <hi>Spain,</hi> as they have been ſince by <hi>France,</hi> that we quietly and freely parted with our King, and ſuffer'd him to accept the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, rather than that Nation ſhould be involv'd in War and Confuſion, and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> endanger'd by another Succeſſor, as it muſt neceſſarily have been, had the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe Title was then promoted by the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Intereſt, ſucceeded. And all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we had for this Condeſcenſion and Kindneſs, was a Contemptuous and Diſdainful Refuſal, on the part of <hi>England,</hi> of an Union of the Nations when propoſed, tho' the ſame would viſibly have tended to the Benefit of the whole Iſland, the general Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Security and Increaſe of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt.

And by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of that ſame Faction in <hi>England,</hi> who are ſtill our Enemies, he made Innovations both in Church and State.

               <p>His Son King <hi>Charles</hi> I. had ſcarce aſcended the Throne, when we had new Proofs of the Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we labour'd under by that Union; for he by the Advice of ſome Enemies to our Nation, did in

an Imperious and Arbitrary manner ſend for our Crown, tho' the only Monument almoſt left us of our Independency and Freedom; but was generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer'd by him that had it in keeping, That if he would come and be Crown'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he ſhould have all the Honour done him that ever was to his Anceſtors; but if he did not think it worth his while, they might perhaps be inclin'd to make choice of another Soveraign, or to that effect; as recorded in the Continuation of Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi>'s Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Another Diſadvantage we had by that Union of the Crown, was this, That that Unfortunate Prince being inſpir'd with an Averſion to the Conſtitution of our Country, by his Education made War upon us to bring us to a Conformity with <hi>England</hi> in Church-Matters.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not here offer to debate which of the Churches was beſt Conſtituted, or moſt agreeable to the Scripture-Pattern: It ſuffices for our Argument, That we were Injur'd in having a Foreign Model of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be obtruded upon us, which was the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Union of the Crowns, and of having our King Educated in another Nation; but that was not all, another miſchievous Effect of the Union was this, That whatever King <hi>Charles</hi> had deſerv'd at our Hands, yet out of Natural Affection, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Honour, we were oblig'd to do what we could to prevent his Illegal Trial and Death, and to defend his Son's Title, which threw us into Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions at Home, occaſion'd us the loſs of ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and expos'd our Nation afterwards to Ruine and Devaſtation, by our implacable Enemy the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, which together with the Ungrateful Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions made us by the Government after the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, were enough to have wearied any Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heav'n, but our ſelves, of the Union of the Crowns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For the reſt, it is ſufficiently evident, That if General <hi>Monk</hi> had at that time any Thoughts of recalling the King, (which I much queſtion) he had more Prudence than to Communicate it to the <hi>Scots</hi> or any body elſe; For if the Rump had had the leaſt ſuſpicion of his deſign, they would ſcarce have made him General of all the Forces in the three Nations.</p>

But we muſt go on to ſee how he winds up the thread of his Arguments.</p>
            </div>

               <p>We ſhall conclude this matter with one or two more Arguments to prove, That it is the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to joyn with us in this Affair; by which alſo it will appear that there is nothing advanc'd in theſe Sheets out of any ill Deſign againſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation, or to perſuade to a diſuniting of the Crowns; but on the contrary, that a ſtricter Union is abſolutely neceſſary, that both Nations may have but one Intereſt, which will render us leſs liable to Convulſions and inteſtine Commotions at home, and put us out of danger of being attacked by Enemies from abroad.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument is this; That by incouraging our Settlement at <hi>Darien, Engliſh</hi> Ships that have occaſion to paſs by thoſe Coaſts will there be certain of a place of Retreat in caſe of attack either by Enemy or Tempeſt, without danger of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and having their Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to be perpetual Slaves in the Mines.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we be incouraged in our <hi>American</hi> Colony, it will contribute much to heighten the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Product; ſince what we have not of our own, or wherein we are wanting either as to quality or quantity, we ſhall ſupply our ſelves, for the uſe of our Plantation, in <hi>England;</hi> which may be of great benefit to the Northern Counties eſpecially, whence we may conveniently furniſh our ſelves with Beeves for Victualling our Ships, our own Cattel being for the moſt part too ſmall for that uſe; beſides many other things that we ſhall have occaſion to export from <hi>England</hi> for the uſe of the Plantation, and to maintain a Commerce with the Natives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By joining with us in this Colony, and ſecuring a Poſt on the South-Sea, which the Princes of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien</hi> will no doubt very readily agree to, they may
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53874:36"/>
ſhorten their Voyages to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and by that means be able to out-do all their Rivals in that Trade; but if they will be ſo far wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to ſuffer thoſe advantages to fall into the Hands of others who are Enemies to our Religion and common Country, they cannot blame the <hi>Scots,</hi> who have made them ſuch fair Offers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If after all, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould continue in their Oppoſition to us, as their late Proclamations in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> and other Paſſages would ſeem to imply they have a mind to, the World cannot blame the <hi>Scots</hi> to provide for themſelves by ſuch other Alliances as they ſhall think meet; ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, eſpecially ſince the Reſtoration of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. to which we did ſo much contribute, that without our Concurrence it could never have been effected. This will appear to be incontrovertibly true, if we conſider that in the time of K. <hi>James</hi> I. we were under no Reſtrictions as to matters of Trade more than they, except as to the Exportation of Wool, and a few other Things of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Product; and ſo we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd till the Reſtoration, when K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did very ungratefully lay ſuch Precluſions and Reſtrictions upon us contrary to the Laws rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Poſtnati,</hi> by the 12 <hi>Car.</hi> II. <hi>For the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and increaſing Shipping and Navigation;</hi> and the 15 <hi>Car.</hi> II. <hi>For the Encouragement of Trade;</hi> by which we are put in the ſame Circumſtances as to Traffick with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and in a worſe Condition than <hi>Ireland</hi> that is a Conqueſt; which is ſo much the more unreaſonable, ſince we are always involv'd and ingag'd in the Wars betwixt <hi>England</hi> and other Countries: And thoſe with whom they have moſt frequent Wars, being <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the only two Nations with whom the <hi>Scots</hi> have almoſt any Commerce, our Trade muſt of neceſſity ſink du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch Wars, whereas <hi>England</hi> hath ſtill a great Trade to other parts of the World; and by this means we are forc'd to be ſharers in their Troubles, tho' they will not allow us to partake of their Profits,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53874:36"/>
nor ſuffer us to take any meaſures to procure ſuch as we may call our own.</p>
               <p>It is plain from the Inſtance of <hi>Darien,</hi> and the Proclamations in the <hi>Engliſh American</hi> Colonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Subjects entertaining any Commerce with our Settlement there, that we are in a worſe condition than ever; for when any thing happens wherein the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> ſeems to be contrary to ours, it is certainly carried againſt us; ſo that in this reſpect we are in a worſe condition than any Foreigners, with relation to <hi>England;</hi> for if a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign People diſcover any thing that may be of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them, they are at liberty to purſue it by themſelves, or to take in the Aſſiſtance of others; and if they find themſelves aggriev'd by <hi>England,</hi> they have their reſpective Governments to make Application to for Redreſs.</p>
               <p>To let them ſee that it is their Intereſt as well as ours it ſhould be ſo, we ſhall only deſire them to conſider how fatal it may be, if by any Emergency we ſhould be forc'd to break off the Union of the Crowns, and enter again into a <hi>French</hi> Alliance. It's in vain for them to Object, that in ſuch a caſe we ſhould betray our Religion; for we ſee the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted <hi>Hungarians</hi> were protected in that by the <hi>Turks,</hi> tho' ſworn Enemies to it: Nor is it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but there may be a change as to that matter in <hi>France; L.</hi> XIV. is not immortal: And even <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate himſelf found it his Intereſt for ſome time to protect the Orthodox Chriſtians, whom he mortally hated. But ſuppoſing, (as indeed there's no great likelihood of it) that no ſuch Alliance as this ſhould ever happen; yet however, if theſe two Nations be not more cloſely united, it may be of ill Conſequence to <hi>England</hi> if any of their Kings at any time ſhould be ſo far diſguſted as to betake themſelves to us: What a Field of Blood and Slaughter muſt <hi>England</hi> have become, had we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. when he came to our Army, or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What great Efforts did a Party of our Nation make to inthrone K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. when <hi>England</hi> was againſt him?

How ſoon did our Eſpouſing the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Intereſt turn the Tables upon thoſe that oppoſed him in <hi>England?</hi> And if our Nation had likewiſe Eſpous'd his Cauſe before the Revolution, the Viſcount of <hi>Dundee</hi> gave a ſufficient proof what we could have done for him. This makes it evident, That it is not the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to ſlight an Union with us ſo much as they have done: For ſo long as we remain divided, any King that is ſo minded, may make uſe of us; and any envious Neighbour, whoſe Intereſt it is to keep this Iſland low, will be ſure to blow the Coals. If they'd but turn the Tables, and make our Caſe their own, they would quickly be ſatisfied of the Truth of what we advance. Suppoſing that the Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould traverſe the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Government of <hi>England,</hi> in relation to their Trade, &amp;c. as they have done ours; and ſuppoſing that a Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when the King were there, ſhould queſtion him for the Navigation Act, and that for the Incouragement of Trade in <hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. which lays us under ſuch hard Circumſtances and Reſtrictions, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would certainly very much reſent it, and ſpeedily tell us we meddled with what did not belong to us: Then why ſhould they deny us the like liberty in reference to their Proceedings againſt us, ſeeing we are a free Nation as well as they?</p>
               <p>Nor can any thing leſs than joining with us, and protecting that Settlement againſt all oppoſition in caſe of Attacks by the <hi>French,</hi> or others, ſufficiently atone for what is already done, or heal the Wound thoſe Proclamations have giv'n to the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Iſland.</p>

We ſhall not trouble our ſelves with the Deſcription of any more of it than is in the poſſeſſion of the Natives, which is in length from E. to W. on the N. ſide from the mouth of the River <hi>Darien</hi> to Port <hi>Scrivan,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 140 Italian Miles; from <hi>Caret</hi> Bay to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Cheapo</hi> on the Southſide, it is about 160 in length. It is ſuppoſed to take its Name from the great River of <hi>Darien,</hi> that bounds its Northern Coaſt to the Eaſtward. It is bounded on the North and South with the vaſt Oceans that carry the names of the North and South Seas. Its Situation is very pleaſant and agreeable, and very commodious for a ſpeedy and ſhort Communication of Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the North and South Seas, and preventing that vaſt Compaſs that muſt otherwiſe be fetch'd round either of the Extremes of North and South <hi>America.</hi> By this means alſo it lies convenient for a ſpeedier Communication of Trade betwixt <hi>Europe</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> than any that hath hitherto been found out.

The Rivers on the Northern Coaſt are generally ſmall, becauſe their Courſe from the above-mentioned ridge of Hills is but ſhort; yet the River of <hi>Darien</hi> is very large, but the depth of its entrance not anſwerable to its width, yet further in it is deep enough, and hath a good Harbour in <hi>Caret</hi> Bay which is ſome Leagues up the River, hath two Iſlands of pretty high Land, cloath'd with variety of Trees lying before it, and two or three Streams of freſh Water falling into it. From this Bay to the Promontory near <hi>Golden Iſland,</hi> the Shore is indifferently fruitful, and the Soil on the Northern Coaſt is generally good, but ſwampy here and there to the Sea.</p>
               <p>To the Weſtward of the Promontory, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the River, is a fine ſandy Bay with three Iſlands, one of them <hi>Golden Iſland</hi> lying before it, which make it an extraordinary good Harbour. <hi>Golden Iſland</hi> is rocky and ſteep all round, except at the Landing Place on the South ſide, ſo that it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fortifi'd.

The <hi>Calabaſh</hi> whoſe Shells ſerve for Cups and other occaſions, is curiouſly painted; the ſweet ſort of 'em is eatable, and the bitter ſort Medicinal.

               <p>WE come next to give an Account of their Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of our Men there; how they were receiv'd by the Natives; what <hi>Indian</hi> Princes there are in their Neighbourhood; in what ſtate they found the Affairs of the Country; and of the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of our Colony.</p>
               <p>On the 27th of <hi>October</hi> 1698. our Ships came to an Anchor in a fair ſandy Bay, three Leagues W. off the Gulph of <hi>Darien;</hi> upon which, two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes, with ſeveral <hi>Indians</hi> came on board, were very free with our Men, told them they had been long expected, and were very welcome: Our Men gave them ſome old Hats, Looking glaſſes, and Knives, with which they were extremely well pleas'd, and went off. When our Ships ſtood fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Bay, they ſaw about 20 <hi>Indians</hi> drawn up on the Shore, being arm'd with Bows and Lances; upon which a Boat being ſent aſhoar, and making a ſignal of Peace, they unſtruug their Bows, talk'd familiarly, and told our Men, that two Great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains would in a little time come on board our Ships. Accordingly, on <hi>November</hi> the 2d, in the morning, Captain <hi>Andreas,</hi> one of their Princes, accompanied by 12 Men, came on board, and ask'd their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53874:43"/>
He was anſwered, That we came to live among them, and Trade with them, and would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them <hi>European</hi> Commodities cheaper than any other People. He ask'd if we were Friends or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and was anſwered, that we were at Peace with all Men, and would make War upon no Man, except they injur'd us. He took us for Buccaneers, and told us, He knew Captain <hi>Swan</hi> and Captain <hi>Davis</hi> in the South-Sea, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them as Men of Valour. We heard that part of his Diſcourſe with much Coldneſs, and told him we came on no ſuch deſign as thoſe Men did, but had Authority for what we undertook. We treated him civilly, gave him a Hat lac'd with Gold, and ſome Toys: And ſo he parted, promiſing in a little time to come again; which he accordingly did, and brought <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> another of their Princes or Captains, with him. Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> was freer with us than at firſt, plainly own'd that he took us for Buccaneers, and complain'd that ſome <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> of that ſort had after great pretences of Friendſhip, carried off ſome of their People; and therefore <hi>Don Pedro</hi> would not come aboard us till he had further aſſurance of us.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> is a Perſon of a ſmall ſtature; he affects the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gravity, as having been often among them at the Mines of <hi>Santa Maria, Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> &amp;c. and formerly had a Commiſſion under them as a Captain, upon which he values himſelf above others: The <hi>French</hi> hate him mortally, becauſe of ſomething he did againſt ſome of their Nation for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. When he came on board us, he had a ſort of a Coat of red looſe Stuff, an old Hat, a pair of Drawers, but no Stockings nor Shoes; and the reſt that came with him were all naked, excepting their <hi>Penis,</hi> which was covered by Extinguiſhers, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mention'd.</p>
               <p>Upon further Communing, Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> was very well pleas'd with us, offered us what part of the Country we would chuſe, and accepted a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from us; and at the ſame time we gave

him a Basket-hilted Sword, and a pair of Piſtols; upon which he promiſed to defend us to the laſt of his Blood.</p>
               <p>Some of the Princes on this ſide the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> had been in Peace with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for ſeveral years, and ſuffered a few of them to reſide amongſt them, to give notice to <hi>Panama</hi> of what Ships came upon theſe Coaſts; but upon ſome freſh diſguſt, about two months before we arriv'd, Captain <hi>Ambroſio,</hi> who is the moſt noted Prince amongſt 'em, had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd them to enter into a common Alliance againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> and cut off ten <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who liv'd upon <hi>Golden Iſland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Place where we are ſettled is four miles Eaſt of <hi>Golden Iſland,</hi> within a great Bay. We have an excellent Harbour, ſurrounded with high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, capable of holding a thouſand Sail Land-lock'd, and ſafe from all Winds and Tempeſts. The Mouth of the Harbour is about random Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot over, form'd by a <hi>Peninſula</hi> on the one ſide, and a point of Land on the other. In the middle of the Entrance there is a Rock three foot above Water, upon which the Sea breaks moſt terribly when the Wind blows hard; and within the Points there is a ſmall Rock that lies a little under Water. On both ſides theſe Rocks there's a very good wide Channel for Ships to come in: That on the South-ſide is 3 Cables long, and 7 Fathom deep; and that on the North two Cables long. From the two outermoſt points the Harbour runs away Eaſt a Mile and an half; and near the middle, on the right hand, a point of Land ſhoots out into the Bay; ſo that by raiſing Forts on the ſaid Point, on the Rock in the middle of the Entrance, and the two outer-moſt Points, it will be the ſtrongeſt Harbour, both by Art and Nature, that's in the known World. The Bay within is for the moſt part 6 Fathom Water, and till you come within a Cable's length of the Shoar, three Fathom and an half: So that a Key may be built, to which great Ships may lay their Sides, and unload. The <hi>Peninſula</hi> lies on the Left-Hand,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53874:44"/>
is a mile and a half in length, very ſteep, and high towards the Sea: So that it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult for any body to Land, till you come to the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> where there's a ſmall ſandy Bay that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ships may put into, but is eaſie to be ſecured by a Ditch and a Fort. There are ſeveral little Rivers of very good Water that fall into the Bay; and it abounds ſo with excellent Fiſh, that we can with eaſe take more than it's poſſible for us to deſtroy, having ſometimes caught 140 at a Draught: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others there be Tortoiſes, which are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Meat, and ſome of them above 600 weight.</p>

We found ſome <hi>French</hi> Refugees in the Country, who are willing to ſettle under us; and having been ſeveral years in theſe Parts, and underſtanding the Language of the Natives, are very uſeful to us. We have ſeen ſome Sand in the Rivers, which looks as if it were mixt with Gold, and in ſome places the Earth ſeems to be very much mixt with it: So that it's concluded there's more Gold-Duſt here, than in any part of <hi>Guinea.</hi>

The firſt of theſe Princes we ſhall name is Captain <hi>Diego;</hi> he commands from the bottom of the Gulph of <hi>Orba</hi> on this ſide <hi>Caret</hi> Bay, and has 3000 Men under him; he has been at War with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeveral years, occaſion'd by an Inſult his People had receiv'd from them, when they came to demand their ſhare in the Mines which they had diſcover'd to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their Country, on condition of being Partners with them: But when they came to demand it, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> treated them villanouſly; beat and abus'd them; upon which they attack'd the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> cut off 20 of their Men, and three Prieſts that belong'd to the Mines.</p>
               <p>The next is Captain <hi>Pouſigo.</hi> He is an <hi>Indian</hi> Clergy-man, and Brother-in-Law to Captain <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas.</hi> The Peninſula that we poſſeſs, lies betwixt his Territory and that of Captain <hi>Andreas,</hi> who together with his Brother, commands from <hi>Golden Iſland</hi> to the River <hi>Pinas.</hi> Their Command is greater than that of <hi>Pouſigo,</hi> but not ſo great as that of <hi>Diego.</hi> Theſe Princes are very uſeful to us, becauſe of their Neighbourhood and Conſanguinity to one another.</p>

Captain <hi>Ambroſio</hi> commands from the River <hi>Pinas</hi> to the <hi>Samballoes:</hi> He is a Man of about 60 years of Age, but ſtrong and vigorous, well limb'd, and of a ſtern Countenance: He is a mortal Enemy to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom he hath had a long War: He is eſteemed the braveſt of all the <hi>Indian</hi> Captains. His Son-in-Law <hi>Don Pedro</hi> having been taken by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and kept by them as a Slave at <hi>Panama,</hi> he can never forget nor forgive it them: This young Man is a great Friend to the <hi>French,</hi> who they are made to believe deſign to come and ſettle among them. <hi>Ambroſio</hi> and his Son-in-Law preſt us much to come and ſettle in their Dominions, and join with them to make War on the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> We gave them fair Words, and promis'd to come and view their Coaſts, which we accordingly did; and in our way thither, four Leagues Weſtward of our Settlement, we found an excellent Harbour, capable of 10000 Sail; but it can't be defended without many Forts: Here the Privateers us'd to come and careen. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Ambroſio</hi>'s Houſe lies about a League from the Water-ſide, on the Bank of a River, having twelve leſſer Houſes about it: When we drew near it, he advanced 50 Paces to meet us, being attended by 20 Men in white looſe Frocks with Fringes round the bottom, and arm'd with Lances: He ſaluted us kindly, and gave us a Calabaſh of Liquor almoſt like Lambs-wool, made of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn and Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes. His Houſe is 90 foot long, 35 broad, and 30 in height, curiouſly thatch'd with Palmetto-Royal, and over that Cotton-Leaves. The Floor is of firm Earth like Tarras, very ſmooth and clean. The ſides are compos'd of large Canes, as thick as a Man's Leg. In this Houſe live <hi>Ambroſio</hi> and his Son-in-Law <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> with both their Families, conſiſting of about 40 Perſons. We ſaw <hi>Ambroſio</hi>'s Grandmother there, who is 120 years old, and yet was very active in getting things ready for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. She has ſix Generations deſcended from her now in the Houſe with her. The People live here to 150 and 160 years of Age; but thoſe

that converſe much with <hi>Europeans,</hi> and drink ſtrong Drink don't live ſo long.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>Samballoes</hi> to the River of <hi>Conception,</hi> the Country is commanded by one <hi>Corbet,</hi> who is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, he having contracted a Friendſhip with their Priveteers 7 years ago, and done them many good Offices. They promiſed to reward him if he would go to <hi>Petit Guaves,</hi> and in his way thither he was taken by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Privateer and carried to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> whence the Governor of <hi>Petit Guaves</hi> got him releas'd. He was with <hi>Ponti</hi> at the taking of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and has a Commiſſion from the <hi>French</hi> to be General of all the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Forces on that Coaſt, and to take, ſink, and deſtroy <hi>Spaniards</hi> or any other Enemies. Yet the <hi>French</hi> themſelves, and the ſenſible part of the <hi>Indians,</hi> don't put any confidence in him; and <hi>Ambroſio,</hi> who is the braveſt of all thoſe <hi>Indian</hi> Captains, keeps him in Awe and within Bounds.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Corbet,</hi> there's another of their Captains call'd <hi>Nicola,</hi> who is ſaid to be a wiſe, brave and good natur'd Prince; inſomuch that the <hi>Indians</hi> had a mind to have ſet him up inſtead of <hi>Ambroſio,</hi> who is of a rugged military Temper. But <hi>Ambroſio</hi>'s Authority and Power is ſo great, that they did not find it practicable. <hi>Nicola</hi> is a mortal Enemy to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and can never entertain a good thought of them, ſince the Governor of <hi>Porto-Bello</hi> robb'd him of a curious Fuſee that had been preſented him by ſome of the Buccaneers; and being out of order, he ſent it thither to be mended; upon which the Governour taking a liking to it, kept it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſent <hi>Nicola</hi> another ſorry piece inſtead of it.</p>
               <p>Since we came hither, there have been an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> a <hi>Dutch,</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> Ship in our Bay.

with all poſſible Civility, yet we are ſince inform'd that he hath been a days Journey into the Gulf, and endeavour'd to incenſe the <hi>Indians</hi> againſt us, telling them that we were Privateers, and that the King of <hi>England</hi> would not protect us. He left ſome Men in the Bay, who had ſince kill'd ſome <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and came to us for Arms and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but we told them, we could not grant them any, and that they had done what they could not juſtifie. We gave them however what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſitting up a Boat; and as a Reward, they intic'd away the Carpenter and Mate of one of our Ships call'd the <hi>

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ship that put in here, was that which was order'd to carry back the Church Plate, &amp;c. to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> did afterwards bulge on a Rock, and was caſt away in our Harbour. We ſav'd all their lives, and Captain <hi>Pincarton</hi> our Commodore endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd his own life to ſave that of the <hi>French</hi> Captain. He inform'd us, That the <hi>French</hi> had four Men of War of 50 Guns each, who thinking we had a Deſign on the River <hi>Miſſiſſipi,</hi> were gone to the Gulf of <hi>Mexico</hi> in queſt of us. The <hi>French</hi> have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry induſtrious in cultivating their Intereſt, both with the Natives and <hi>Spaniards</hi> in this part of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and doubt not of having a good ſhare in thoſe Countries after the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Death. They have got a great Intereſt with Captain <hi>Ambroſio</hi> by means of his Son-in-Law <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> whom they careſs extreamly, and deſign'd to have carried him to <hi>Petit Guavus,</hi> and from thence into <hi>France,</hi> to acquaint the <hi>French</hi> King with the favourable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents the <hi>Indians</hi> have entertain'd of the <hi>French,</hi> and of their deſign to ſurrender themſelves to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:53874:46"/>
This has been projected by the <hi>French</hi> a long time, but the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Indiſpoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to that Crown, made them refer it: and there's no doubt but our Settlement will quicken thoſe Reſolutions. Captain <hi>Andreas,</hi> Captain <hi>Pedro</hi> his Brother, Captain <hi>Diego,</hi> and Captain <hi>Pouſigo</hi> our Neighbours have no manner of Correſpondence with the <hi>French.</hi> The latter hath acquainted us that there are ſeveral Gold Mines within two Miles of our Settlement which he hath promis'd to ſhew us; and he hath actually let us ſee ſeveral Samples of fine Gold.</p>
               <p>This being the Subſtance of ſeveral Journals that were ſent from our Colony in <hi>Darien</hi> upon their firſt Settlement there, we hope it's ſufficient of it ſelf to ſatisfie our Neighbours in <hi>England</hi> of the Juſtice of our Cauſe, of the Equity of our Proceedings, of the true Reaſon why the <hi>French</hi> are ſo much our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in this matter, of the greatneſs of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that has put us in poſſeſſion of that Poſt, and that it is <hi>England</hi>'s Intereſt to joyn with and protect us, by which the Deſigns of the <hi>French</hi> againſt <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Great Britain</hi> in particular, may be defeated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Engliſh Weſt-India</hi> Trade ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd.
