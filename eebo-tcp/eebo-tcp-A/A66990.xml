         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Judges VII. 20.</bibl>
               <q>The Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE may through all the Course of Holy Scripture,
plainly behold that when the Almighty design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to work out a Deliverance to his People, he
made them sensible that it was not so much the
Arms of Flesh, as his immediate power that saved them.
The <hi>Israelites</hi> at the time that God raised up <hi>Gideon</hi> the Son
of <hi>Joash</hi> to be an Instrument in his Hand of saving them,
were oppressed by the <hi>Midianites</hi> &amp; <hi>Amalakites,</hi> a cruel and
wastful People that spared no means that force or fraud
could invent to vex them, and lay their Country desolate,
to draw them away to Idolatry, and the Worship of strange
Gods, which their Fathers had not known; and least they
should seem to attribute the Victory to Multitudes, and not
give the sole Glory to the God of Battles; this great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
had an express Command, to try first their Courage
and Resolution, and after that proving too many, they
were selected at the Water-Brook, where three hundred
only were chosen, and with that small number, the mighty
Army was overthrown, destroyed, broken, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at first onset by the breaking of Pitchers, &amp; sounding of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35270:3"/>
Trumpets, and crying, <hi>The Sword of the Lord, and of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi>
Judges 7. 20. <hi>Let but the Lord arise,</hi> (says Holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid)
and his Enemies shall be scattered:</hi> (And again) <hi>God is
our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will we not fear though the earth be moved, and though the
Mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea; though the
Waters thereof roar, and be troubled,</hi> Psal. 46. 1, 2, 3. we find
that when <hi>Samaria</hi> was Besieged, and even Famine raged in
the City to a degree, that a Woman was forced to eat the
Fruits of her Womb, when all visible means failed, and an
Insulting Enemy every day expected to enter the City, and
bring it to final Desolation; that only a noise being heard
in the Hills and Mountains, raised the Siege, and gave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of plenty to the besieged, according as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
had foretold. And <hi>Senacharibs</hi> Hoast trusting in the
Arm of the Flesh, and the multitude of Horses and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots,
found themselves insensibly defeated by the Revenging
Sword of the Destroying Angel, falling dead, by the
mighty stroak of an Invisible power, whose force they felt,
but knew no way to resist, or fly from, till 80000 of them
were fetter'd in the Chains of Death. And upon conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of these, and the like Deliverances, Holy <hi>David</hi>
says to comfort himself, and his people, <hi>viz. The Lord of
Hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge; come, behold
the Work of the Lord, what desolation he hath made in the earth,
he maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the earth, he breaketh
the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder, and burneth the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
with fire: Be still, and know that I am God, I will be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongst the Heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. The
Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>is our refuge,</hi> Psal.
46. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. For although God makes Man for the most
part the instrument in his hand, the more visibly to bring
about his purposes; yet without the Operation of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power and Wisdom, Mens Devices are brought to nought,
for here we find, that when <hi>Gideon</hi> came to behold the Camp
of the enemy, <hi>The</hi> Midianites, <hi>and</hi> Amalakites, <hi>and all the
Children of the Host <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay along in the Valley like Grashoppers for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35270:3"/>
multitude, and their Camels were without number, as the Sand
of the Sea,</hi> Judges 7. 12. Yet this great Army that had so
long been the wastful terrour of the Country, was put into
such a fear at the cry of the <hi>Sword of the Lord, and Gideon,</hi>
that they were utterly confounded, and knew not what they
did; for as we find it in <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. of the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>viz. And they stood every man in his place round about
the Camp, and all the Hoast ran, and cryed, and fled, and the
three hundred blew the Trumpets, and the Lord set every mans
Sword against his fellow even throughout all the Hoast, and the
Host fled,</hi> &amp;c. By this we may see, it was more through
fear and distraction they were broken, than through any
slaughter the three hundred <hi>Israelites</hi> were capable of making
amongst so great a company of men. <hi>David</hi> incouraged by
God, pursued the <hi>Amalakites</hi> that burnt <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and with
four hundred Men fell upon those that had taken the spoil,
and with four hundred Men defeated their great Army, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
what ever had been taken away. <hi>Barach</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi>
defeated <hi>Jab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi>'s great Hoast, destroying it together

with h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s;</hi> so that we see that God confounds strength
with weakness, for when men presume too much on the
Arm of Flesh, they frequently deceive themselves; and in
the midst of their security are overthrown: Therefore let
a good Christian consider that his strength is in the Lord,
and if God be on his side, he need not be afraid, though dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
bes<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him round about; but be comforted, and made
valiant by the words of the Kingly Prophet, <hi>viz. The Lord
is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear; the Lord is
the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid: When the
wicked, even mine enemies, and my foes came upon me to eat up
my flesh, they stumbled and fell: Though an Hoast should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp
against me, my heart shall not fear, though War shall
arise against me, in this will I be confident,</hi> Psal. 27. 1, 2, 3.
This ought to be the confidence, and courageous resolution
of every Christian, especially Soldiers, who carry their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35270:4"/>
Lives in their hands, and are said to live on the brink of the
Grave. Above all in a good Cause, and the defence of
the Sacred Truth, when their Religion is in danger, and
the enemy seeks not to gain a Dominion over their bodys,
but over their souls to obscure the light of the Gospel, and
cloud a Kingdom in darkness and ignorance: Let them take
example by the valiant <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who when they beheld
their Holy things prophaned an I trampled under foot by
an Idolatrous people, their Altar polluted, and their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarys
in danger to be defiled; they took up the Sword of
<hi>Gideon,</hi> and stood more for their Religion than for their
Lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor was the Sword of the Lord wanting to give them
success over their Enem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, and to redeem their bleeding
Country from the distraction and desolation it, groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
nor may we spare to come nearer home, and find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
instances of God's raising up <hi>Gideons</hi> to save these
Kingdoms, not only from Barbarous Nations, who in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
times have invaded them but from a Papal Tyranny from
Plots, and Conspiracys that have laboured to make their
glory set in blood and ruine. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight was raised

Rev. 21, 4. Though never so many Storms and Tempests
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35270:5"/>
threaten; yet a good Christian ought not to be dismayed,
though in a time, even when danger does beset them:
yet it is required, they should Humble themselve; before
their Maker, and Rely on him, who is able to save to the
utmost, all that trust in him: For indeed, Sin is that
which provokes him to with-hold his mercy, and bring
calamities on Nations, and Kingdoms; it was always well
with the seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they cleave fast to the Rock
of their Salvation; but when they grew Regardless, he
gave them up to the oppressing Nations, who grieved his
chosen Heritage, for as 'tis said Psal. 18. ver. 25, 26.
27. <hi>viz. With the Merciful, thou wilt shew thy self Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and with an upright man, thou wilt shew thy self upright;
with the pure, thou wilt shew thy self pure; with the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
thou wilt shew thy self froward: For thou wilt save
the afflicted people, but will bring down high looks. Niniveh</hi>
humbling her self in Sackcloath and Ashes before the
Lord, was saved from impendent Wrath, when Stubborn
<hi>Sodom,</hi> and Impenitent <hi>Gomorrah</hi> sunk in Sulpherous
fire; let us turn then to the Lord with our whole hearts,
and sing praise unto our deliverer, that our Enemies, and
all those that seek to hurt us, may fall before us: 'Tis
a good consceience, and an assurance in gods mercy's
that makes men valiant; <hi>Abraham</hi> on this score persued
the Kings, and Rescued his Brother <hi>Lot, &amp;c.</hi> out of their
hands: <hi>David</hi> in this assurance undauntedly marched
against the mighty Champion of the <hi>Philistims;</hi> and with
inconsiderable Weapons, as knowing God saves neither
by Spear nor Shield, no more than by weak means,
when he resolves to manifest his power; or intends to
save, he overcame the man that had so long desied the
Armies of <hi>Israel:</hi> For when the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to show his last Judgment upon <hi>Pharoh;</hi> and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Host in the Red Sea, and <hi>Israel</hi> cryed out for fear, they
were only commanded to stand still, and see the Salvation
of the Lord, and they even without contributing any help
of their own, found themselves not only secured from the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35270:6"/>
danger they feared, and a little before had threatned them,
but saw their desire upon their Enemies; the Element
heard the voice of its Creator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and returned with violence
to let the stubborn monarch know, that the highest Rules
in the Kingdoms of men, in whose hands are all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the Earth, and all the breath of life. There is a Sword
of the Lord, and a Sword of Man; against the first there is
no prevailing, but the latter is weak, if the first be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
God if he pleases can arm all the Elements to sight for
his Servants, as he did the Hail in the time of <hi>Joshua,</hi> by
which there fell more than by the Swords of the <hi>Israelites;</hi>
or inclose his people with Fiery Camps of Armed Angels, as
he did <hi>Elisha,</hi> when his life was sought for by the <hi>Assyrians.</hi>
Trust in the Lord, and he will be to his Servants a Wall of
defence, and a strong Tower, a Buckler, a Shield, and a
mighty Deliverer; who has power to do what he pleases:
In Heaven, and Earth, whose Will is Fate, and whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
are irresistable, and Irreversable: Let us but call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him sincerely, with a true heart and unfeigned lips, and
he will hear us, and deliver us out of all our trouble: Let
us not then be afraid of their terrour that seek to harm us,
but assuredly rest secure in his protection, whose mercys are
over all the Works of his Creation, and he will keep us
from the Arrows that fly by Night, and the Shafts, though
go abroad by day the Adversary shall have no advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us: Therefore let us acquit our selves like men, and
not faint, or grow weary: Let fear fly our Breasts, and let
us arm our selves with Courage in a good Cause; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that the God of Battles, the Lord of Hosts is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposer
of all things, and if the Lord be with us, who shall
be against us, and prosper, for there is a Sword of the
Lord, and a Sword of <hi>Gideon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus by extraordinary means does the Almighty save,
when he bares his Arm to make his power known to the
Sons of Men; then happy are all they that trust in him, for
they shall never be confounded, their Enemies shall come
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35270:6"/>
out one way, but flee seven; the <hi>Lord</hi> shall draw a Sword
after them, and they shall be scattered, even from Heaven
shall they be discomfited, and scattered o'er the face of the
earth, as in <hi>Judges 3. 2. They fought from Heaven, the Stars
in their courses fought against</hi> Sisera. If Heaven be on our
side, in vain is the Combination of man, for who is able
to stand before that mighty God, whose very looks drieth
up the deep, and whose wrath maketh the Mountains to
melt, before whose Majesty <hi>Job</hi> confesseth himself to fail
and tremble, like one in a stormy Tempest, and that his
fear was so great that he was not able to bear it; nor can
his hand be shortened, that he will not save those that stand
for his truth, such as are valiant for the promotion of God's
Honour, are said to fight the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Battle; that is, he
owns them to be his Soldiers, and he puts power and
strength into their hands, as he did into his Servant <hi>Joshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s
when he made the Heavenly bodies contrary to the
course of nature, obey a Mortal Voice, the Sun and Moon
stood still till his people had accomplished their desire upon
their Enemies, as we find it in <hi>Joshua,</hi> 10. 13. and when
<hi>Moses</hi> held but up his hand the <hi>Israelites</hi> prevailed, for there
is nothing too hard for the <hi>Lord,</hi> when he designs to bring
about his purposes: <hi>I called on the Lord in my distress</hi> (says
Holy <hi>David) the Lord answered me, and set me in a large
place; the Lord is on my side, I will not fear what man can do
unto me: The Lord taketh my part with them that help me,
therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me; it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes, all
Nations compassed me about, but in the Name of the Lord will
I destroy them,</hi> Psal. 118. v. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Thus we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
how a good cause puts life into the Soul, and makes
the Spirit rise to the extreamest height of valour, banishing
the image of fear by a confident assurance of success<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes
men bold as <hi>Lyons,</hi> and unwary in their undertakings.
This made <hi>Nehemiah</hi> courageous for the House of God,
and for his Sanctuary, when he caused the very Work-men
to arm at their labour, having their Swords in their hands,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35270:7"/>
even whilst they were building, and repairing the City of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to prevent and repel their treacherous Enemies
who sought always to surprize and bring them to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
Let us take Courage then, and faint not but acquit
your selves like men.</p>
