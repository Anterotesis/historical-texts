            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it hath been a custome of long continuance, as well in Rome the Capitall City, as in diuers other renowned Cities of the world, to haue the liues of Princes and worthy men, acted in their Theatres, and especially the conquests &amp; victories which their owne Princes and Captains had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thereby to incourage their youths to follow the steps of their ancesters; which custome euen for the same purpose, is tolerated in our Age, although some peeuish people seeme to dislike of it: Amongst so many valiant Princes of our English Nation, vvhose liues haue already euen cloyed the Stage, I searched the Chronicles of elder ages, vvherein I found amongst diuers renovvned persons, one Brittish Prince, who of his enemies, receiued the title of <hi>Valiant Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> his name was <hi>Caradoc,</hi> he was King of <hi>Siluria, Ordonica,</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> which Countries are now called, <hi>South-Wales, North-Wales,</hi> and the <hi>Marches</hi>; and therefore being borne in Wales, and King of Wales, I called him the <hi>valiant Welshman</hi>; he liued about the yere of our Lord, 70. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> in his 12. booke, sayth, that hee held warres 9. years against all the Romane puissance; but in the end hee was betrayed by <hi>Cartismanda</hi> Queene of <hi>Brigance,</hi> and so conuayed to Rome in triumph, so that the name of <hi>Caradoc</hi> was famous in Rome at that time: wherefore finding him so highly commended amongst the Romans, who were then Lords of all the world, and his enemies; I thought it fit amongst so many Worthies, whose liues haue already been both acted and printed, his life hauing already bin acted with good applause, to be likewise worthy the printing; Hoping that you will censure indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of it; and so I bid you farevvell.</p>

                  <p>I, in a sort, but that was, se offendendo, for it may be, he meant to haue broke the halter, and the halter held him out of his owne defence.</p>

                  <p>No, for hee goes backeward, when tis made, and therefore cannot see before, what will come after; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the halter in fault, for hee might vrge the halter, <hi>nolens volens,</hi> (as the learned say) neyther is he in fault, because his time was come that he should be hanged: and therefore I doe conclude, that he was conscious and guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of his owne death: Moreouer, he was a Lord, and a Lord in his owne precinct has authority to hang and draw himselfe.</p>
