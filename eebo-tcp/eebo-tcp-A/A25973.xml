            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN EPISTLE TO Monsieur Boileau.</head>
            <l>TOO long, Great Man, thy Muse has try'd in vain,</l>
            <l>Thy Monarch's sinking Credit to sustain;</l>
            <l>And thou too long hast mis-employ'd thy Pen,</l>
            <l>To make the <hi>worst</hi> appear the <hi>best</hi> of Men;</l>
            <l>A sullied Fame to brighten and refine,</l>
            <l>That never did with real Lustre shine.</l>
            <l>While, as one, flatter'd by too fair a Glass,</l>
            <l>Views but the wanted Beauties of his Face;</l>
            <l>So <hi>Lewis,</hi> in thy lofty Praise does see</l>
            <l>Not what he is, but what he wants to be.</l>
            <l>And he must all his boasted Glories own,</l>
            <l>Not from himself deriv'd, but thee alone;</l>
            <l>Whose Muse so well does his mean Deeds reherse.</l>
            <l>That he becomes Immortal in thy Verse;</l>
            <l>But to thy Verse no lasting Fame can give,</l>
            <l>In recompence for what he does receive.</l>
            <l>Leave, leave him then to raise his own Renown,</l>
            <l>And win the Laurels that his Temples crown:</l>
            <l>A better Cause, and nobler Subject chuse,</l>
            <l>That may inspire, as it employs, thy Muse;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45173:3"/>
May with thy elevated Sense agree,</l>
            <l>And copious as thy boundless Fancy be;</l>
            <l>A Hero, whose bright Fame may gild thy Bays,</l>
            <l>And more thy Name, than thou his Glory raise.</l>
            <l>See, see, his Conq'ring Sword great <hi>Nassaw</hi> draws;</l>
            <l>Not poorly bribes, but merits thy Applause:</l>
            <l>His brave Exploits afford thy Muse a Theme</l>
            <l>Equal to that, as that is worthy them.</l>
            <l>The Titles he, in Fame's Records does hold,</l>
            <l>Are purchas'd by his Valour, not his Gold.</l>
            <l>He owes his Glory to himself alone,</l>
            <l>And Acquisition makes it all his own.</l>
            <l>Whilst <hi>Lewis</hi> rarely does in Arms appear,</l>
            <l>Nor then to fight, but follow in the Rear:</l>
            <l>Our <hi>Monarch</hi> charging in the Front we see;</l>
            <l>None more expos'd, none less concern'd than he.</l>
            <l>Who lets his Soldiers on no Dangers go,</l>
            <l>But what, as he commands, he leads them to:</l>
            <l>Thus, taught by his Example to obey,</l>
            <l>They bravely follow, as he shews the Way.</l>
            <l>Not so your King; he still declines the Fight,</l>
            <l>Nor shuns the Danger only, but its Sight;</l>
            <l>Yet with unmerited Success grown vain,</l>
            <l>He boasts of Conquests he did never gain.</l>
            <l>His Breaches were from Golden Batt'ries made,</l>
            <l>And our lost Towns not taken, but betray'd.</l>
            <l>Thus when some Place by Purchace is made sure,</l>
            <l>His Person, and his Honour too, secure,</l>
            <l>Then the triumphant Monarch takes the Field,</l>
            <l>And gains the Town that waited so to yield.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45173:3"/>
This makes him with affected Greatness swell,</l>
            <l>And boast his Arms as irresistible;</l>
            <l>His Arches are by such Atchievements rear'd:</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Lewis</hi> fights, and thus is to be fear'd.</l>
            <l>But since he finds the Scene is alter'd now,</l>
            <l>And that his Treasure, as his Courage, low,</l>
            <l>Will not the old prevailing Means afford,</l>
            <l>That more enlarg'd his Conquests, than his Sword,</l>
            <l>He forms no hopeless Siege, makes no Campaigne,</l>
            <l>From which he knows he shall no Honour gain:</l>
            <l>But to the Field has wisely sent his Son,</l>
            <l>To bear the blame of losing what he won;</l>
            <l>For all the Conquest he this Year can boast,</l>
            <l>Is that in Running his Success was most;</l>
            <l>While <hi>Huy's</hi> reduc'd to serve its Native Lord;</l>
            <l>Not as 'twas lost, but storm'd with Fire and Sword;</l>
            <l>Which proves as irresistible a Pow'r</l>

            <l>And while <hi>Huy</hi> falls, stands tamely looking on:</l>
            <l>So by Great <hi>William's</hi> conqu'ring Arms dismay'd,</l>
            <l>The Gen'rals durst not venture to its Aid:</l>
            <l>Happy they could their own Intrenchments keep,</l>
            <l>Though dug, to suit their low-sunk Spirits, deep.</l>
            <l>Yet scarce they lost their Appehension there,</l>
            <l>Nor as from Danger, were secur'd from Fear.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45173:4"/>
Till they, for greater Safety, left the Place</l>
            <l>Not loaden now with Trophies, but Disgrace;</l>
            <l>Such Conquests <hi>Lewis</hi> this Campaigne has won,</l>
            <l>Such Triumphs Fate decreed his glorious Son.</l>
            <l>But since no Honours from the barren Field</l>
            <l>He reaps, what Laurels did the Ocean yield?</l>
            <l>That sure his ruin'd Credit will repair,</l>
            <l>And own his long-pretended Power there.</l>
            <l>But as if both the Elements agreed</l>
            <l>From his usurp'd Dominion to be freed,</l>
            <l>The Sea no longer Tribute does afford,</l>
            <l>But justly pays it to the ancient Lord.</l>
            <l>Whose conqu'ring Fleets assert their native Right,</l>
            <l>While the <hi>French</hi> Navy shuns the dreaded Sight.</l>
            <l>And sees it self in its own Ports confin'd,</l>
            <l>By Fear more pow'rful than an adverse Wind.</l>
            <l>So when the scaly Sov'reign of the Seas,</l>
            <l>Himself within his liquid Realm does please,</l>
            <l>And with swift Finns ranges the briny Flood:</l>
            <l>To take his Pastime there; or seek his Food.</l>
            <l>His frightned Vassals hide their shining Heads,</l>
            <l>In the kind Covert of concealing Weeds.</l>
            <l>Our floating Squadrons now their Right regain,</l>
            <l>And unobstructed wanton through the Main,</l>
            <l>Insult the <hi>Gallick</hi> Coasts, and their just Rage</l>
            <l>With Sacrifice of flaming Towns asswage:</l>
            <l>Whose sable Smoak ascending to the Sky,</l>
            <l>Mourns for the Structures that in Ashes ly.</l>
            <l>While strange Confusion spread along the Shore,</l>
            <l>Makes <hi>England</hi>'s Pow'r rever'd as heretofore.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45173:4"/>
Nor does one Fleet alone her Fame advance,</l>
            <l>The Joys in <hi>Spain</hi> equal the Fears in <hi>France.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Barcellona</hi> all Attempts defies,</l>
            <l>While on our <hi>Monarch</hi>'s Succour she relies,</l>
            <l>And shelter'd by his Navy's spreading Wings,</l>
            <l>She triumphs in the sure Defence it brings.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Spain</hi> by our <hi>Elisa</hi> shook before,</l>
            <l>Is now supported by Great <hi>William</hi>'s Pow'r.</l>
            <l>Then in his Praises let fam'd <hi>Boileau</hi> join,</l>
            <l>And to his Side, like Victory, incline:</l>
            <l>Whose daring Soul, and ever-conqu'ring Sword</l>
            <l>Will endless Matter for thy Verse afford:</l>
            <l>But if thou wilt a servile Labour chuse,</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Arbitrary Pow'r</hi> enslaves thy Muse;</l>
            <l>And does thy Thoughts to narrow Bounds confine,</l>
            <l>Which Heav'n for boundless Subjects did design:</l>
            <l>Know, our fam'd Prince can his own Trophies raise,</l>
            <l>And courts as little as he wants thy Praise.</l>
            <l>Nor, if such Means his Glory could advance,</l>
            <l>Wou'd he have need to be oblig'd to <hi>France:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Since his own Realms abound with Men of Sence,</l>
            <l>And famous for Poetick Excellence.</l>
            <l>Whose lofty Verse your humble Strain exceeds,</l>
            <l>As much as his your meaner Patron's Deeds.</l>
            <l>Witness the Muse that first in Songs Divine,</l>
            <l>Describ'd his Fight and Conquest at the <hi>Boyne.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That which most pleas'd, was difficult to tell,</l>
            <l>The Field so bravely won, or sung so well.</l>
            <l>Witness that happy Pen that did relate</l>
            <l>His glorious Voyage to the <hi>Belgick</hi> State;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45173:5"/>
And gave the World a Proof with how much Fire</l>
            <l>Our Poets write when them our Kings inspire.</l>
            <l>But our Great Monarch's Praises shou'd no more,</l>
            <l>Than his large Soul be bounded by our Shore;</l>
            <l>Far as his Victories, his spreading Fame shou'd sound,</l>
            <l>And be in every Tongue, as every Land renown'd;</l>
            <l>Then, <hi>Boileau,</hi> let thy Muse begin her lofty Flight,</l>
            <l>Tho' she must still despair to reach the wondrous Height.</l>
