            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Here present you with
an Epitomee of some secret
Passages, in the whole
reign of one King, part of anothers:
Of which, my self have been either
an Eare or Eye-witnesse, or, from
the testimony of such as have been
Authours or Actors, therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
Truths.</p>
            <p>It is the Conception and Birth
of four daies, with the help of some
scattered Papers (as a Midwife) to
bring them into the world.</p>
            <p>Being therefore but an Embry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:102656:3"/>
you cannot expect any perfect
shape: But, what it wants in that,
you shall finde in the most perfect
form of undeniable Truths.</p>
            <p>The honourable esteem I have
ever had of you, and your brave
Parts, is my first motive of presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it to your view: That it comes
from no ordinary Author (this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first, and for ought I know
the last) a second: That it was
written in a Melancholly humour,
therefore fittest for your Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
Temper, the last.</p>
            <p>I dare no more trust any other
hand to write this than (willingly)
any but your selfe, or some such
good friends to read it.</p>
            <p>Which is the reason it appeares
no fairer to your view. And it
<pb facs="tcp:102656:3"/>
treads too near<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the heeles of truth,
and these Times, to appear in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>If you shal please to accept of it,
as worthy to cast a glance upon at
your idle, or melancholly hours, I
have my full desires. If cast from
you, it hath just Deserts.</p>
            <p>Mine ambition only is, that so
Noble a Lady shal be the God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the first and only heir, that
ever shall come of this quality,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the Twenty fourth
of <hi>March,</hi> 1602. did
set the most glorious
Sun that ever shined
in our Firmament of
<hi>England</hi> (the never to be forgotten
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Q. E. death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102656:5"/>
about three in the morning, at her
Mannour of <hi>Richmond;</hi> not only to
the unspeakable griefe of her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in particular, but of all her
Subjects in generall.</p>
            <p>And although many of her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
adored that rising Sun appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the North, yet since, not
without regret of their monstrous
ingratitude to her (that Sun) now
set, and in peace:</p>
            <p>For no sooner was that Sun set<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but Sir <hi>Robert Carew</hi> (Her neare
Kinsman, and whose Family, and
himself, she had raised from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of a meane Gentleman, to high
Honour, in title and place) most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully
did catch at Her last
breath, to carry it to the rising Sun
then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> notwithstanding a
strict Charge laid to keep fast all the
Gates, yet (his Father being Lord
Chamberlaine) he by that meanes
found favour to get out, to carry the
first newes; which although it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for him the Governourship
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102656:5"/>
of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> yet hath set so
wide a mark of ingratitude on him,
that it will remaine to Posterity a
greater blot, then the honour hee
obtained afterward will ever wipe
out.</p>
            <p>About nine in the morning of
that day, was proclaimed King <hi>Iames</hi>
of blessed memory,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Iames</hi> proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King.</note> by the name of
<hi>James</hi> the first; and now nothing on
all hands, but preparations for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating
him in his journey for
<hi>England,</hi> many posting into <hi>Scotland</hi>
for preferment, either by indearing
themselves by some merit of their
owne to the King, or by purchasing
friends with their purses (Gold and
Silver being a precious commodity
in that Climate, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
any thing) and did procure
Suits, Honours, and Offices to any
that first came; of all which the
King afterward extended his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in so large and ample a manner,
as procured his owne impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the pressure of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102656:6"/>
so farre as set some distance
between him and them, which his
wisdome, and King-craft, could easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at all times reconcile.</p>
            <p>The first that came from the
King to the Lords in <hi>England,</hi> to
give order for all things necessary
for the expediting his journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>England,</hi> was Sir <hi>Roger Aston</hi>
an <hi>English-man</hi> borne,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Roger Aston</hi> K. <hi>James</hi> his Barber.</note> but had his
breeding wholly in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had
served the King many yeares as his
Barber, an honest and free-hearted
man, and of an ancient Family in
<hi>Cheshire,</hi> but of no breeding answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to his birth; yet he was the
only man ever employed, as a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
from the King to Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
as a Letter carrier only,
which expressed their owne intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without any helpe from him
(besides the delivery) but even in
that capacity was in very good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
with her Majesty, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
very royall rewards, which did
inrich him, and gave him a better
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102656:6"/>
Revenue then most Gentlemen in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> for the Queene did finde
him as faithfull to Her as to his
Master, in which he shewed much
wisdome, though of no breeding.
In this his employment I must not
passe over one pretty passage, I have
heard himselfe relate; That he did
never come to deliver any Letters
from his Master, but ever he was
placed in the Lobby; the Hangings
being turned him, where he might
see the Queen dancing to a little
Fiddle, which was to no other end,
then that he should tell his Master,
by her youthfull disposition, how
likely he was to come to the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Crowne hee so much
thirsted after; for you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
the wisest in that Kingdome
did beleeve the King should never
injoy this Crowne, as long as there
was an old Wife in <hi>England,</hi> which
they did beleeve we ever set up, as
the other was dead.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Roger Aston</hi> presenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102656:7"/>
before the Councell; being
but a plaine untutored man, being
asked how he did, and courted by
all the Lords, lighted upon this
happy reply; Even my Lords, like
a poore man, wandring above forty
yeares in a Wildernesse, and barren
Soyle, am now arrived at the Land
of Promise.<note place="margin">After made gentleman of the Bed-chamber, &amp;c</note> This man was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
made Gentleman of the Bed-chamber,
Master of the Wardrobe,
and invested with such Honours,
and Offices as he was capable of, and
that inabled him to live in a noble
way, during his life, and to leave his
Daughters great Fortunes; but had
you seene how the Lords did vye
courtesies to this poore Gentleman,
striving who should ingrosse that
Commodity by the largest bounty;
you could not but have condemned
them of much basenesse (especially,
seeing when at this time Offices,
and great places of Honour will not
be accepted from that Sonne) that
the very Barber of whose Father
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102656:7"/>
was so much courted, but to speake
a good word in their behalfes Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the times are much altered.</p>
            <p>And now all preparation was
made to meet the King in <hi>York,</hi> that
he might in that Northerne Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis
appear like a King of <hi>England,</hi>
and take that State on him there,
which was not known in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
There met him all the Lords of the
Councell, and there did they all
make Court to the Scotch-men that
were most in favour with the King,
and there did the <hi>Scotch</hi> Courtiers
lay the first foundation of their
<hi>English</hi> Fortunes; the chiefe of
them was Sir <hi>George Hewme,</hi>

those secrets, was that of <hi>Gowries</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102656:8"/>
gave little credit to the Story, but
would speak both sleightly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully
of it, and those of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of that Nation; yet there was a
weekly commemoration by the
Tuesday Sermon, and an anniversary
Feast, as great as it was possible, for
the Kings preservation, ever on the
fifth of <hi>August;</hi> upon which day
as Sir <hi>John Ramsey</hi> after E. of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,</hi>
for his good service in that
preservation, was the principall
guest, so did the King grant him any
Boone he would aske that day; but
had such limitations set to his ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as made his suit as unprofitable
unto him, as that he asked it for,
was unserviceable to the King, and
indeed did make the <hi>English</hi> beleeve
as little the truth of that story, as
the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves did, and yet on
my conscience the good Gentleman
did in that as a Lyer often doth, by
telling a Lye often, beleeveth it to
be a very truth; but the truth was,
(although he was not a man capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102656:8"/>
of much himselfe) yet had it
been true; there was too little done
for him, being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not true, too much;
for, being an Earle, he was in very
little esteeme, either with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or with the better sort of
Courtiers. And I pray God that the
effects of those Sermons in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
time for that service, cause no
ill effects, or be not one cause of
Gods anger towards us in the Sons
reigne.</p>
            <p>This Sir <hi>George Hewme</hi> being the
only man that was the Guider of
the King, and his affaires, all the
wiser sort of <hi>English</hi> made their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
unto him, amongst those Sir
<hi>Robert Cicill,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Robert Cicill</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</note> a very wise man, but
much hated in <hi>England,</hi> by reason
of the fresh bleeding of that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
beloved Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and
for that, was clouded also in the
Kings favour; he came to <hi>Yorke,</hi> but
lay close, unseen, or scarce knowne
to be in the City, untill he knew
what entertainment he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102656:9"/>
from the King; for he was in
his owne, and all mens opinions, so
under the Hatches, as not ever to
appeare above board againe (nor
did any of the Countre-faction to
<hi>Essex</hi> besides himselfe, ever attaine
to the Kings favour;) but those
friends raised by his wit, and purse,
did so co-operate (of which Sir
<hi>Roger Aston,</hi> that plaine man was
principall, for which he lost not his
labour) that Sir <hi>George Hewme,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Robert Cicill</hi> had many secret
meetings, and did so comply, that
Sir <hi>Robert Cicill,</hi> to the admiration
of all, did appeare, and come out of
his Chamber like a Giant, to run
his race, for Honour, and Fortune,
and who in such dearnesse, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy
with the King as Sir <hi>Robert Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill!</hi>
as if he had been his faithfull
Servant many yeares before; yet
did not either his Friends, wit, or
wealth, raise him so much (as some
beleeve) as the ill offices done by
him to this Nation, in discovering
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102656:9"/>
the nature of the people, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King the way, how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance
his Prerogative so above the
Lawes, that he might inslave the
Nation, which though it took well
then, yet it hath been of sad and
dangerous consequence in after
times:</p>
            <p>For first, He caused a whole Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load
of Parliament Presidents (that
spake the Subjects Liberty) to be
burnt:</p>
            <p>Next, raising two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pound for making two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Baronets, telling the King he
should finde his <hi>English</hi> Subjects
like Asses, on whom he might lay
any burthen, and should need neither
Bit, nor Bridle, but their Asses eares;
And when the King said, It would
discontent the generality of the
Gentry: He replyed, Tush Sir, you
want the money, that will doe you
good, the Honour will doe them
very little; And by these courses
he raised himselfe, friends, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102656:10"/>
to Offices, Honours, and great
Possessions; Yet as a punishment,
he lived long enough to have lost
all, had not Death prevented him
between the <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>London:</hi> For
the Duke of <hi>Bullion</hi> being then here,
(about the overture of that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Match betweene the Pals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,
and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) had
so done his errand, and discovered
his juggling; It is most certaine, he
had been stript of all at his returne,
which he well understanding from
his Friends at Court, did expedite
his end; but he dyed opportunely
to save his honour, and his estate
for his posterity, though to leave a
marke of ignominy on himselfe by
that <hi>Herodian</hi> disease, and that for
all his great Honours, and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and stately Houses, he found
no place but the top of a Mole-hill,
neare <hi>Marleborough</hi> to end his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
life; so that it may be said
of him, and truly, he dyed of a most
loathsome disease, and remarkable,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102656:10"/>
without house, without pitty,
without the favour of that Master
that had raised him to so high an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
and yet must he have this
right done him (which is also a
note of the misfortune of our
times) there hath not been any since
his time that equalled him, to fulfill
the Proverbe, <hi>Seldome comes a better;</hi>
he had great parts, was very wise,
full of honour, and bounty, a great
lover and rewarder of Virtue, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts in others; so they did not
appeare too high in place, or looke
too narrowly into his actions.</p>
            <p>The next that came on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Theatre in favour, was <hi>Henry
Howard,</hi> a younger Son of the Duke
of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and Lord <hi>Thomas Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
the one after Earle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
the other Earle of <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
Lord Chamberlaine, and after
Lord Treasurer, who by <hi>Salisburies</hi>
greatnesse with that Family, rather
then by any merit, or wisdome in
themselves, raised many great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102656:11"/>
of his Children: <hi>Northampton</hi>
though a great Clerke, yet not a
wise man, but the grossest Flatterer
of the World; and as <hi>Salisbury</hi> by
his Wit, so this by his Flattery,
raised himselfe; yet one great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the raising all of that Name
of <hi>Howards</hi> was, the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi>
suffering for the Queene of
<hi>Scots,</hi> the Kings Mother, yet did <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi>
so farre get the start of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi>
that <hi>Northampton</hi> never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
loved him but from the teeth
outwards, only had so much discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as not to fall to actuall enmity,
to the over-throw of both, and the
weakning that faction; <hi>Suffolk</hi> also
using him with all submissive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
not for any love, but hope of
gaining his great estate, and sharing
it amongst his Children; but <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamptons</hi>
distaste was such, by his
losse of the Treasurers place, which
he had with such assurance promised
to himselfe in his thoughts, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
what he gave to Master <hi>Henry
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102656:11"/>
Howard,</hi> the rest he gave to the Earl
of <hi>Arundell,</hi> who by his observance,
but more especially by giving <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi>
all his Estate if he never
returned from travell, had wrought
himselfe so far into his affections,
that he doted on him.</p>
            <p>And now the principall managers
of the <hi>English</hi> affaires were <hi>Salisbury,
Suffolke, Northampton, Buckhurst, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerton</hi>
Lord Keeper, <hi>Worcester,</hi> and
the Old Admirall; For the <hi>Scots,</hi> Sir
<hi>George Hewme,</hi> now Earle of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi>
Secretary <hi>Elfeston,</hi> after Earle of
<hi>Balmerino,</hi> and as wise a man as was
in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Lord
of <hi>Kinlosse,</hi> a very honest, but weak
man.</p>
            <p>You are now to observe, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi>
had shaken off all that were
great with him, and of his Faction
in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, as Sir
<hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cobham:</hi> the
three first, very able men as the
world had, the last, but one degree
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102656:12"/>
from a foole, yet served their
turnes better then a wiser man, by
his greatnesse with the Queen, for
they would put him on any thing,
and make him tell any Lye, with as
great confidence as a truth. Three
of these were utterly ruined, as you
shall heare in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
the fourth being a very wise
man, contented himselfe with a
meane place, that was worthy of a
much greater; and although very
active formerly, called to minde
this saying: <hi>Foelix quem faciunt, &amp;c.</hi>
and medled with no State busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
his wisdome fore-telling his
Fate, if he had done otherwise; for
he did see one better head-peece
then his owne, sit tottering at that
time, and fell off afterwards, which
made him think it was good sleeping
in a whole skin.</p>
            <p>The King no sooner came to
<hi>London,</hi> but notice was taken of a
rising Favourite, the first Meteor of
that nature appearing in our cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102656:12"/>
as the King cast his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him for affection, so did all the
Courtiers,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iames Hay</hi> a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</note> to adore him, his name
was Mr. <hi>James</hi> Hay, a Gentleman
that lived long in <hi>France,</hi> and some
say, of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Guard to that
King; this Gentleman comming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to meet the King, and share
with him in his new Conquest (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Scots</hi> phrase) it
should seeme had some former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the then Leiger
Embassadour in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the
<hi>French</hi> King,<note place="margin">His rise.</note> who comming with
his Majesty into <hi>England,</hi> presented
this Gentleman (as a well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
Gentleman) to the King,
in such an high commendation as
engendered a liking that produced
a favourite; in thankfull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
whereof, he did him
many faire offices for the present,
and comming afterwards an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Embassadour to our King,
made him the most sumptuous Feast
at <hi>Essex</hi> house,<note place="margin">His sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous feast.</note> that ever was seene
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102656:13"/>
before, never equalled since, in
which was such plenty (and Fish of
that immensity, brought out of
<hi>Muscovia,</hi> that Dishes were made
to containe them (no Dishes in all
<hi>England</hi> before could neare hold
them) and after that, a costly Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,
and after that, a Maske of
choyse Noble-men; and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and after that, a most costly
and magnificent Banquet, the King,
Lords, and all the prime Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
then about <hi>London</hi> being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thither. Truly, he was a most
compleat,<note place="margin">His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> aud well accomplished
Gentleman, modest, and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and of so faire a demeanour,
as made him be generally beloved;
and for his wisdome, I shall give
you but one character for all: Hee
was ever great with all the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of his time, and although the
King did often change, yet he was
<hi>semper idem</hi> with the King, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
and got by both; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Favourites had that exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102656:13"/>
power over the King, to make
him grace, and disgrace whom they
pleased; yet he was out of their
power, and the only exception to
that generall rule; and for his get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
it was more then almost all
the Favourites of his time, which
appeared in those vast expences of
all sorts, and had not the bounty of
his minde exceeded his gettings, he
might have left the greatest estate
that ever our age or climate had
heard of; he was indeed made for a
Courtier, who wholly studied his
Master, and understood him better
then any other.</p>
            <p>He was imployed in very many of
the most weighty Affaires, and sent
with the most stately Embassies of
our times, which he performed
with that wisdome, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
that he seemed an honour to
his King and Country. For his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in State-affaires, he was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by some Princes the Kings
Juggler. He married the Daughter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102656:14"/>
and Heire of the Lord <hi>Denny,</hi> after
the Earl of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and was hated of none that ever
I heard of, but the Earle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi>
who had no patience to
see him, being himselfe of so vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and cankred a disposition, that
indeed he hated all men of noble
parts, nor loved any but Flatterers
like himselfe; yet it was a great
question, whether he hated the Earl
of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> or Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi>
most, by whom he hath been heard
to say; <hi>Body of God, I will be content
to be damned perpetually in Hell, to be
revenged of that proud Welshman;</hi> and
did so hate him, that he kept an
Inquisition on him seven yeares, to
prove that he had cousened the
King of fourteen thousand pounds,
which at the seven yeares end at an
hearing before the King, the Lords,
the Queen, and all the Ladies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
present, with all the gallantry
of the Court, ended in one paire of
silke Stockins, given by one for a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102656:14"/>
New-yeares Gift to Master <hi>Wels,</hi>
Sir <hi>Robert Mansells</hi> Servant; at
which, the King stood up and sware
very deeply; <hi>Doe you beleeve I will
take a paire of silke Stockins for my
fourteen thousand pounds? give me that,
give me that; is this all the fruit of
seven yeares Commission?</hi> at which
words Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi> kneeled
downe, and said, <hi>I will now Sir take
all the faults they can charge my
servant with, upon my selfe;</hi> at which
the King was very angry, that so
noble a Gentleman, who had so wel
acquitted himselfe, and Honour,
should intrust it in the keeping of a
Servant; at the end of all, the Earle
of <hi>Salisbury</hi> kneeled down, and said;
<hi>Sir, if you will suffer malice so farre to
prevaile, as to have your honest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
traduced, to satisfie the humours
of any, I beseech you take my staffe, for
were my selfe, and the Earl of</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester
<hi>here present, put in the ballance
against Sir</hi> Robert Mansell, <hi>we should
prove too light; I am in a great Place,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102656:15"/>
and cannot say, but by my selfe, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
I may faile, yet not with our own
wils; therefore Sir, if you wil suffer such
inquisitions, there will be no serving
your Majesty, in such places as I hold,
by your Majesties favour;</hi> thus ended
the Earle of <hi>Northamptons</hi> malice,
which only served to honour Sir
<hi>Robert Mansell,</hi> and make a scorne
of himselfe, and this only to make
the venome of this Monster appear,
who did flatter the King, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
with God.</p>
            <p>And now begin Embassadours to
appeare from divers Princes, the
principall were, <hi>Roney</hi> Duke of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi>
from the <hi>French</hi> King; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
of <hi>Castile</hi> from the <hi>Spanish</hi>
King, the Count <hi>Arremberg</hi> from
the Arch Duke; the former came
to congratulate only, and desired
the confirmation of the ancient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
betwixt the two Crownes;
the latter two about the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a firme peace betwixt these two
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102656:15"/>
Kingdomes, that had lived in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
Warre, and hatred of each
other, by which it might appeare
where the advantage of such a
peace would fall, by those that
sought, or rather bought it with an
infinite masse of treasure, prodigal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cast about the <hi>English</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>To bring these Embassadours o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
were appointed Sir <hi>Robert Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi>
being Admirall of the narrow
Seas, and Sir <hi>Jerome Turner</hi> his
Vice-Admirall, the first comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to attend at <hi>Graveling</hi> for the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadour, the latter at
<hi>Calis</hi> for the <hi>French;</hi> but the <hi>French</hi>
comming first, and hearing the
Vice-Admirall was to attend him,
the Admirall the other; in a scorne
put himselfe in a Passage-boat of
<hi>Calis,</hi> came forth with flagge in
top; instantly Sir <hi>Jerome Turner</hi>
sent to know of the Admirall what
he should doe; Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi>
sent him word, to shoot, and sinke
him, if he would not take in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102656:16"/>
flag; this as it made the flag bee
pulled in, so a great complaint, and
'twas beleeved it would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
Sir <hi>Robert Mansell,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
Faction pressing it so home: but he
maintained the act, and was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
beloved of his Master ever after,
to his dying day.</p>
            <p>This makes it appeare how jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
old Commanders were of their
owne honour, and of their Masters,
and Kingdomes honours, which
since hath been so prodigally wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as we are utterly bankerupt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
spent our old Stock, and have
not bravery enough to erect a new.</p>
            <p>The Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> so plyed
his Masters businesse (in which he
spared for no cost) that he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a peace so advantageous for
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and so disadvantageous for
<hi>England,</hi> that it and all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
have since both seen and felt
the lamentable effects thereof.
There was not one Courtier of
note, that tasted not of <hi>Spaines</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:102656:16"/>
bounty, either in Gold, or Jewels
and among them, not any in so large
a proportion as the Countesse of
<hi>Suffolke,</hi> who shared in her Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
being then a potent man, and
in that interest which she had, in
being Mistris to that little great
Secretary (little in body and stature,
but great in wit and policy) the
sole manager of State affaires; so it
may be said, she was a double sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and in truth <hi>Audley-end,</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and great structure, had its
foundation of <hi>Spanish</hi> Gold.</p>
            <p>The King was a peaceable and
merciful Prince; yet God (for some
secret intent best known to himself)
laid the foundation of his reigne,
with the greatest mortality ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
heard of in this Kingdome, by
a fearefull Plague,<note place="margin">A great Plague.</note> and some by that
judged what his future reign would
be, yet their wisdomes failed, for
he was a King of mercy as well as
peace, never cruell, yet surely it
had some morall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102656:17"/>
He was forced by that contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to leave the Metropolis, and goe
into a by corner in <hi>Wiltshire, Wilton</hi>
the Earle of <hi>Pembrookes</hi> House, in
which time of his abode there, a
kinde of Treason brake forth, but
what it was, as no man could then
tell, so it is left with so dark a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that posterity will never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Text, or remember any
such treason; it is true, some lost
their lives, yet the world was never
satisfied of the justice, and one of
them, (and that the only marke of
Tyranny upon this good Kings
reigne) executed many yeares after
without all president, and on my
conscience without any just cause,
and even against that good Kings
will, who in many things was over-awed
by his timorous disposition.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Spanish</hi> Faction, and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Gold betrayed his life, as they
had done the Kingdome before, and
I beleeve it was one of the greatest
Master-peeces of that Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102656:17"/>
to purchase <hi>Rawleighs</hi> head,
yet had not <hi>Bristol</hi> co-operated, the
King would never have consented,
and it may be he had his secret ends,
fearing his wisdome might once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
have raised him, to have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over <hi>Sherborne</hi> Castle, once his
owne, and how unjustly taken from
him God will one day judge; I know
not whether there be a curse on
those that are owners of it, as Fables
report, but I am confident there is a
curse on <hi>Bristol</hi> for taking away his
life; I will not take upon me too
farre to pry into Gods Arke, yet
what is like to befall him, and hath
already, his Son (as hopefull a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
as any in the Kingdome) may
give some token of Gods anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him and his family.</p>
            <p>But because I will not leave you
altogether blinde-folded,<note place="margin">A narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Treason charged on <hi>Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh.</hi>
               </note> I shall as
neare as I can lead you to the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of this Treason, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of Protestants, Puritans, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and of an Atheist: a strange
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102656:18"/>
medley you will say, to meet in one
and the same Treason, and keepe
counsell, which surely they did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they knew not of any; the
Protestants were the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi>
and <hi>George Brook</hi> his Brother, the
one very learned and wise, the other
a most silly Lord, the Puritan the
Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>VVilton,</hi> a very hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Gentleman, blasted in the very
Bud; the Papists <hi>VVatson,</hi> and <hi>Clarke,</hi>
Priests; and <hi>Parham</hi> a Gentleman,
the Atheist Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi>
then generally so beleeved, though
after brought by affliction (the best
School-Mistris) to be, and so dyed,
a most religious Gentleman. This
Treason was compounded of strange
ingredients (and more strange then
true) it was very true, most of these
were discontented, to see <hi>Salisbury</hi>
their old friend so high, to trample
on them, that before had been his
chiefe supporters, and (being ever
of his faction) now neglected and
contemned: it was then beleeved an
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102656:18"/>
errand trick of State to over-throw
some, and disable others, knowing
their strong abilities might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
live to over-throw <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
for they were intimate in all his
secret Councels for the ruine of
<hi>Essex,</hi> especially <hi>Rawleigh, Grey,</hi> and
<hi>Cobham;</hi> though the latter was a
foole, yet had been very usefull to
them (as the Toole in the hand of
the Workman) and to have singled
out these without some Priests,
which were Traytors by the Law,
had smelt too ranke, and appeared
too poore and plaine a tricke of
State; and <hi>Salisbury</hi> in this had a
double benefit: First, in ridding
himselfe of such as he feared would
have been thornes in his sides. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
by endearing himselfe to
the King, by shewing his diligence,
and vigilancy for his safety; so that
it might be said of him as of <hi>Caesar</hi>
in another case (<hi>Inveniam aut sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam</hi>)
I will either finde out a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or make one, and this had been
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102656:19"/>
a pretty trick had it been only to
disgrace, without taking away life;
but how this peece of policy may
stand with Religion, I feare by this
time he too well understands; and
this plot as neare as I can tell you
(and I dare say my intelligence gave
me as neare a guesse as ever any man
had) was, that all these in a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
humour had by <hi>Watson,</hi> and
<hi>Clarke,</hi> being Confessors, dealt with
Count <hi>Aremberge,</hi> the Arch Dukes
Embassadour, to negotiate with
the Arch Duke to raise an Army,
and invade <hi>England,</hi> and they would
raise another of Papists, and Male-contents
to joyne: for you must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the King was beleeved an
errand Puritan, (<hi>Cujus contrarium
verum est</hi>) how likely this Plot was,
let the world judge, that the King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> who had bought peace at so
deare a rate, and found it so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to him, by the lamentable
experience he had formerly in the
Wars with this formidable State,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102656:19"/>
should seek to breake it so soone:
and had it been a reall Treason, the
State had been bound to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
these Traytors, as the best
peece of service done in <hi>England</hi> all
that Kings reigne (it was indeed
those that made the Peace, not
those that endeavoured the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, were the Traytors, and are
to be cursed by all Posterity) yet
this foolish Plot served well enough
to take some blocks out of the way,
that might afterward have made
some of them stumble, to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their owne necks.</p>
            <p>They were all Arraigned of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at <hi>Winchester,</hi> whither the King
having sent some secretly to observe
all passages, upon whose true and
faithfull relations of the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Persons Arraigned, and
the sleight proofes, upon which they
were condemned: he would not be
drawne to signe any Warrant for
the execution of <hi>Rawleigh, Cobham,</hi>
and <hi>Grey,</hi> very hardly for any of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102656:20"/>
the rest, the two Priests excepted.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Rawleighs</hi> defence, it was so
brave and just, as (had he not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
cast himselfe, out of very
wearinesse, as unwilling to detaine
the company longer) no Jury could
ever have cast him; all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
brought against him was <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Accusation, which he only
desired might appeare (<hi>viva voce</hi>)
and he would yeeld without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defence, but that they knew ful
well <hi>Cobham</hi> would not, nor could
not accuse him, having been tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with by <hi>Wade,</hi> then Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Tower, and <hi>Salisburies</hi>
great Creature; <hi>Wade</hi> desired it
under his hand, that also he refused,
at last <hi>Wade</hi> got a trick by his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to surprize <hi>Cobhams</hi> weaknesse,
to get him write his name to a
Blank, to which, <hi>Wade,</hi> no question,
wrote the accusation, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
hereafter; for <hi>Salisbury</hi> urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Rawleigh</hi> often, if <hi>Cobham</hi> had
accused him under his hand, would
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102656:20"/>
he then yeeld? <hi>Rawleigh</hi> replyed,
He knew <hi>Cobham</hi> weake of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and did not know how that
weaknesse might be wrought upon,
but was confident he would not to
his face accuse him, and therefore
would not put his life, fortune, and
all on that; at which fence he stood
til nine at night: at last his fate car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him against his reason, and he
yeelded upon the producing his
hand, which was instantly pulled
out, and was in truth his hand, but
not his act, or deed: so at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
was <hi>George Brooke, Watson,</hi> and
<hi>Clarke</hi> executed, <hi>Parham</hi> acquitted,
and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> executed
many yeares after for the same trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as much against all justice, as
beyond all reason, or any president:
yea after he had been a Generall by
the Kings Commission, and had by
that, power of the Lives of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
utterly against the Civill
Law, which saith, <hi>He that hath power
of the Lives of others, ought to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102656:21"/>
of his owne.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was
so powerfull at that time in Court,
as that Faction could command the
life of any man that might prove
dangerous to his designes; <hi>Grey</hi> and
<hi>Cobham</hi> dyed in their restraint, the
one much pittied, the other scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and his death as base, for hee
dyed lousie for want of Apparrell,
and Linnen; and had starved, had
not a Trencher-scraper, sometime
his Servant in Court, releived him
with scraps, in whose house he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
being so poore a house as he was
forced to creep up a Ladder into a
little hole to his Chamber; which
was a strange judgement, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presidented,
that a man of seven
thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and of a
personall estate of thirty thousand
pounds, of all which the King was
so cheated of what should have Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheated
to him, that he could
not give him any maintenance, as in
all cases the King doth, unlesse out
of his owne Revenue of the Crown,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102656:21"/>
which was the occasion of this
Lords want, (his Wife being very
rich, would not give him the crums
that fell from her Table;) and this
was a just judgement of God on
him.</p>
            <p>And now, because it will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
in this place to let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that <hi>Rawleigh</hi> had his life sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repticiously
taken away, I shall give
you a true story.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> that brave Princesse,
was in a desperate (and some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
an incurable) Disease,
whereof the Phisitians were at the
furthest end of their studies to finde
the cause, at a <hi>Non-plus</hi> for the Cure;
Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> being by his
long studies an admirable Chymist,
undertooke, and performed the
Cure, for which he would receive
no other reward, but that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
would procure that certaine
Lords might be sent to examine
<hi>Cobham,</hi> whether he had accused
Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> of Treason at
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102656:22"/>
any time under his hand; the King,
at the Queens request (and in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
could doe no lesse) sends six
Lords, (which I take were, the
Duke of <hi>Leonox, Salisbury, Worcester,
Suffolke,</hi> Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Julius Caesar</hi>) to demand of <hi>Cobham,</hi>
whether he had not under his hand
accused Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
upon that Treason he was
Arraigned for; <hi>Cobham</hi> did protest,
never, nor could he; but, said he,
That Villaine <hi>Wade</hi> did often soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
me, and not prevailing that
way, got me by a trick to write my
name upon a peece of white Paper;
which I, thinking nothing, did, so
that if any Charge came under my
hand, it was forged by that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine
<hi>Wade,</hi> by writing something
above my hand without my consent
or knowledge. These six returning
to the King, the rest made <hi>Salisbury</hi>
their Spokes-man, who said, Sir,
my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> hath made good
all that ever hee wrote, or said.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102656:22"/>
Where it is to be noted, that this
was but an equivocating tricke in
<hi>Salisbury;</hi> for it was true, that <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had made good whatever hee
had writ (that being but in truth to
very nothing) but never wrote he
any thing to accuse <hi>Rawleigh;</hi> by
which you may see the basenesse of
these Lords, the credulity of the
King, and the ruine of Sir <hi>Walter
Rawleigh.</hi> I appeale now to the
judgement of all the world, whether
these six Lords were not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Murtherers of Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi>
and no question shall be called
to a sad account for it.</p>
            <p>And thus have you a true relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Treason, and Traytors,
with all the windings and turnings
in it, and all passages appertaining
to it; and by it you may see
the slavery these great men were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved
in by <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that none
durst testifie such a truth, as the not
testifying, lost their most precious
Soules.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102656:23"/>
And now doth the King returne
to <hi>Windsor,</hi> where there was only an
apparition of <hi>Southamptons</hi> being a
Favourite to his Majesty, by that
privacy and dearnesse was presented
to the Court-view; but <hi>Salisbury</hi>
(liking not that any of <hi>Essex</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
should come into play) made
that apparition appeare as it were
in <hi>transitu,</hi> and so vanished, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
some jealousies into the Kings
head, who was so farre from jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
that he did not much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be in his Queenes company,
yet love and regality must admit of
no partnership.</p>
            <p>Then was there in requitall of the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadours, two stately
Embassies addressed, the one to
<hi>Spaine,</hi> the other to the Arch Duke,
to have that peace they so dearly
purchased confirmed, and sworne
to by ours, as formerly by them;
the old Lord Admirall was sent to
<hi>Spaine,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Hartford</hi> for
<hi>Bruxels,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Leonox</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:102656:23"/>
might have the better opportunity.
The <hi>Spaniard</hi> was astonied at the
bravenesse of our Embassie, and the
handsome Gentlemen (in both
which, few Embassies ever equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
this) for you must understand the
Iesuites reported our Nation to be
ugly, and like Devils, as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sent to our Nation for casting
off the Popes supremacy; and they
pictured Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
halfe a Man, halfe a Dragon;
When they beheld them after the
shape of Angels, they could not
well tell whether to trust their own
eyes, or their Confessors reports, yet
they then appeared to them, as to
all the world, monstrous Lyers.</p>
            <p>The Embassadour had his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with as much state, as his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
with bounty, the King
defraying all charges, and they were
detained at their Landing longer
then ordinary, to have provisions
prepared in their passage to <hi>Madrid,</hi>
with all the bounty was possible, to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102656:24"/>
make the whole Country appeare a
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was in
truth, but a Wildernesse.</p>
            <p>In their abode there, although
they gave them Roast-meat, yet
they beat them with the spits, by
reporting that the <hi>English</hi> did steale
all the Plate, when in truth it was
themselves, who thought to make
Hay while the Sunne shined, not
thinking ever more to come to such
a Feast, to fill their purses as wel as
their bellyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for food and coyne
are equally alike scarce with that
Nation) this report passed for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
to the infinite dishonour of
our Nation, there being at that
time the prime gallantry of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Mansell,</hi> who was a man
borne to vindicate the Honour of
his Nation, as of his owne, being
Vice-Admirall, and a man on whom
the old Admirall wholly relyed,
having dispatched the Ships to be
gone the next morning, came in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102656:24"/>
very late to Supper; Sir <hi>Richard
Levison</hi> sitting at the upper end of
the Table amongst the Grandees,
the Admirall himselfe not supping
that night, being upon the dispatch
of Letters, the Table upon Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Mansells</hi> entrance offered to
rise, to give him place: But he sat
down instantly at the lower end, and
would not let any man stirre, and
falling to his meat, did espy a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
as the Dishes emptied, ever
putting some in his bosome, some
in his breeches, that they both strut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi> sent a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to the upper end of the table
to Sir <hi>Richard Levison</hi> to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his eare, that whatsoever he
saw him doe, he should desire the
Gentlemen and Grandees to sit qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
for there should be no cause of
any disquiet; on the sudden, Sir
<hi>Robert Mansell</hi> steps up, takes this
<hi>Spaniard</hi> in his armes, (at which
the table began to rise; Sir <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Levison</hi> quiets them,) brings
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102656:25"/>
him up to the end amongst the
Grandees, then pulls out the Plate
from his bosome, breeches, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part about him, which did so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and vindicate
that aspersion cast on our Nation,
that never after was there any such
syllable heard, but all honour done
to the Nation, and all thanks to him
in particular.</p>
            <p>From thence, next day they went
for <hi>Madrid,</hi> where all the royall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
<hi>Spain</hi> could yeeld was
given them, and at the end of the
Grand entertainment and Revells,
which held most part of the night,
as they were all returning to their
Lodgings, the street being made
light by white Wax lights, and
the very night forced into a day, by
shining light, as they were passing
in the street, a <hi>Spaniard</hi> catcheth
off Sir <hi>Robert Mansells</hi> Hat, with
a very rich jewell in it, and away
he flyes; Sir <hi>Robert</hi> not being of a
spirit to have any thing violently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102656:25"/>
from him, nor of such a Court-like
complement, to part with a
jewell of that price, to one no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
acquainted with him, hurls o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the Boote, followes after the
fellow, and some three Gentlemen
did follow him, to secure him,
houseth the Fellow in the house of
an Allagozy, which is a great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
or Judge in <hi>Spaine;</hi> this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
wondering at the manner of
their comming, the one without
his hat and sword in his hand, the
other with all their swords; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the cause, They tell him;
He saith, surely none can think his
house a sanctuary, who is to punish
such offenders.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi> would not
be so put off with his <hi>Spanish</hi> gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but enters the House, leaving
two at the Gate, to see that none
should come out whiles he search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
A long while they could finde
nothing, and the Allagozy urging
this as an affront, at last, looking
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102656:26"/>
downe into a Wel of a smal depth,
he saw the fellow stand up to the
neck in Water: Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi>
seized on his Hat, and Jewell, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fellow to the Allagozy, but
he had much rather have fingered
the Jewell, aud in his gravity told
Sir <hi>Robert Mansell,</hi> hee could not
have it without forme of Law,
which Sir <hi>Robert</hi> dispensed with,
carrying away his Hat, and Jewell,
and never heard further of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse;
now the truth was, this
fellow knew his Burrough well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
as well as some Theeves of
our Nation, after they have done a
Robbery, would put themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Prison of their acquaintance,
assuring themselves none would
search there, or rather as our Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>London,</hi> whose cheif revenue
for themselves, and servants, is from
Theeves, Whores, and Bawds,
therefore this story cannot seeme
strange in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Embassadour sent to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102656:26"/>
the Arch Duke, was, the old Earle
of <hi>Hertford,</hi> who was conveyed over
in one of the Kings Ships, by Sir
<hi>William Munson,</hi> in whose passage a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Man of Warre comming by
that ship, would not vaile, as the
manner was, acknowledging by
that, our Soveraignty over the Sea,
Sir <hi>William Munson</hi> gave him a shot
to instruct him in manners, but instead
of learning, he taught him by retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
another, he acknowledged no
such Soveraignty; this was the very
first indignity and affront ever offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Royall Ships of <hi>England,</hi>
which since have beene most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> desired
my Lord of <hi>Hertford</hi> to goe into the
Hold, and hee would instruct him
by stripes, that refused to be taught
by faire meanes; but the Earl char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him on his Allegiance first to
land him, on whom he was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to attend; so to his great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
he was forced to endure that
indignity, for which I have often
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102656:27"/>
heard him wish he had been han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
rather then live that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Commander of a Kings Ship,
to be Chronicled for the first that
ever endured that affront, although
it was not in his power to have
helped it; yet by his favour, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
but a copy of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
for it had been but hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hanging to have disobeyed my
Lords Commandement, and it had
been infinite odds he had not beene
hanged, having to friend him, the
House of <hi>Suffolke;</hi> nor would hee
have been so sensible of it, had he
not been of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Faction, and
that a <hi>Dutch</hi> ship.</p>
            <p>Now did those great Mannagers of
the State (of which <hi>Salisbury</hi> was
chief) after they had packed the
Cards begin to deale the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdome amongst
themselves, and perswaded the King
to leave the State affaires to them,
and to betake himselfe to some
Country recreations, which they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102656:27"/>
found him addicted unto, for the
City, and businesse, did not agree
with him; to that end purchased,
built, and repaired at <hi>New-Market,</hi>
and <hi>Royston,</hi> and this pleased the
Kings humour well, rather that he
might enjoy his Favourite with
more privacy, then that he loved
the sports; then must <hi>Theobolds</hi> be
in his owne possession, as not fit for
a King to be beholding to a Subject
for an House of daily use, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the King had so much want of
monies (to expresse his love, and
bounty to his Native Nation) <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi>
would exchange, and take
Land for his House, and Parke; in
which exchange, he made such an
advantage, that he sold his House for
fifty yeares purchase, and that so
cunningly, as hardly to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but by a curious sight, for he
fleeted off the Creame of the Kings
Mannours in many Counties, not
any two lying in any one County,
and made choyce of the most in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102656:28"/>
remotest Counties, onely built his
nest at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> within the County
where his Father had built his, yet
kept he still the house of <hi>Theobolds,</hi>
for he and his posterity were to be
perpetuall Keepers of that House,
and many Parkes adjacent; by this
he not onely shewed his wisdome
for his owne benefit, but to the
world what the Kings naturall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
was, to bee easily abused,
and would take counterfeit Coyn
for currant payment.</p>
            <p>And to fit the Kings humour,
and dissolve him in that delight he
was most addicted to, as well as to
serve <hi>Salisburies</hi> owne ends, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his revenge upon some neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Gentlemen, that formerly
would not sell him some conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
parcels of Land neighbouring
on <hi>Theobalds,</hi> he puts the King on
enlarging the Parke, walling, and
storing it with red Deere; and I
dare affirme, with that worke the
King was so well pleased, and did
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102656:28"/>
more glory in, then his Predecessors
did in the conquest of <hi>France;</hi> and
as it was most true, so an ill Omen,
that the King loved Beasts better
then Men, and took more delight
in them, and was more tender o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the life of a Stag then of a Man;
yet this was the weaknesse of his
judgement, and poorenesse of his
Spirit, rather then any innate cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
for he was not naturally cruel
over lives, though in displacing
Officers, which naturally he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
was as glorious, as to over-throw,
and conquer Kings.</p>
            <p>But yet for all their setting their
Cards, and playing their Games
to their owne advantages, of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
much for themselves, and
friends, there was one Knave in the
Packe, would crosse their designs,
and Trump in their way, if he might
not share with them in their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
that was one <hi>Lake,</hi> a Clerke
of the Signet, after, Secretary, and
after that turned out in disgrace;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102656:29"/>
and in truth, was onely wise in the
worlds opinion, could swim being
held up by the chin; but at his fall
all his weaknesses were discovered:
and that the world had been decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in him, I will instance in one
particular amongst many, that shall
give you full assurance; being in
disgrace, he gave two thousand
pounds but to kisse the Kings hand,
beleeving that after that, he might
have accesse as formerly; after he
had paid his money, he was never
suffered to see the King more, only
jeered at by all the Court for his
folly, and went sneaking up and
downe contemned of all men.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Lake</hi> was a fellow of meane
birth, and meaner breeding, being
an under Servant to make Fires in
Secretary <hi>Walsinghams</hi> chamber, and
there got some experience, which
afterwards in the Kings time made
him appeare an able man, which in
the Queenes time, when there was
none in Court but men of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102656:29"/>
made him an inconsiderable
Fellow. He had linked himselfe in
with the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation, progging
for Suits, and helping them to fill
their Purses; as they did beleeve,
there was not so able a man in the
Kingdome (for in truth ever since
Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> death, the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
money hath been the only way
to raise men, as being held the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall
property of a wise man, to
know how to bring in money (<hi>per
fas aut nefas</hi>) and amongst all the
<hi>Scots,</hi> he wholly applyed himselfe to
those of the Bed-chamber, and of
nearest accesse to his Majesty.</p>
            <p>For his good service of abusing
his Country, and Country-men, he
was made Clerke of the Signet, to
waite on the King in his Hunting
journies, and in these journies got
all the Bils signed, even for the
greatest Lords (all Packets being
addressed to him) so that even <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury;</hi>
and <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the
greatest Lords made Court to him;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102656:30"/>
by this meanes did he raise himselfe
from a meane to a great fortune,
but so over-awed by his VVife, that
if hee did not what she comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
she would beate him, and in
truth his Wife was afterwards his
over-throw; besides, he would tell
Tales, and let the King know the
passages of Court, and great men, as
who was <hi>Salisburies</hi> Mistris, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
all; who governed <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and discovered their Bawdery,
which did infinitely please the Kings
humour: and in truth had so much
craft, as he served his turne upon
all, but was ingrossed by none but
by the Bed-chamber, who stuck so
close to him, that they could not
yet remove him. And now doe the
<hi>English</hi> Faction (seeing they could
not sever the <hi>Scots</hi> from him) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to raise a mutiny against
the <hi>Scots</hi> that were his supporters,
their Agents divulging every where,
the <hi>Scots</hi> would get all, and would
begger the Kingdom; the <hi>Scots</hi> on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102656:30"/>
the other side complaine to the
King, they were so poore, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-went
the by-word of beggerly
<hi>Scots;</hi> to which the King returned
this answer (as he had a very ready
wit) Content your selves, I will
shortly make the <hi>English</hi> as begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as you, and so end that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie;
this is as true as he truly
performed it, for however he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
many in particular, as <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
Suffolke, Northampton, Worcester,
Lake,</hi> &amp;c. yet he did begger himself,
and the Nation in generall.</p>
            <p>This also was inculcated into the
eares of the Parliament, when that
great businesse about the union was
in debate, which was much crossed
by that opinion; if they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
impoverished the kingdome,
by the union, they would bankerupt
it. But since, you see by their owne
valour and bravery of spirit, they
have made us begge a re-union with
them, and for ought we see, all our
happines is derived from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>

of a great Family, which did

            <p>It is most true, that many <hi>Scots</hi>
did get much, but not more with

got scarce the Tythe of those

did stick by them, or their posterity;
besides, <hi>Salisbury</hi> had one tricke to
get the kernell, and leave the <hi>Scots</hi>
but the shell, yet cast all the envie
on them; He would make them buy
Bookes of Fee-farmes, some one

hundred Markes, and he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
with them for a thousand
pounds, which they were willing to
embrace, because they were sure
to have them passe without any

<hi>Salisbury</hi> fill up this Booke

had the Honey, they poore

<hi>Dunbar</hi> only had his Agents, and
could play his owne game, which
they durst not crosse; so was the

            <p>And now did a contention arise
between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> about
the election of a Favourite, out of
whether Nation he should come;
now was <hi>Montgomery</hi> in the wane,
being given more to his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,

that alway the Earle of <hi>Carliste</hi> did
invest him in his roome; he as soon
by his neglective carriage did devest
himselfe, yet was he ever in the

his daily visiting, and mourning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him, taking all care for his

of his glory appeare, every

            <p>Lord! how the great men flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then to see him, and to offer to

the King was forced to lay a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,

to facilitate the cure, care was taken

all hope, and she her curling and
perfuming, all adoring this rising
Sun, every man striving to invest
himselfe into this mans favour (not
sparing for bounty nor flattery)
which was not hard to be obtained,
being naturally more addicted to
the <hi>English</hi> then to the <hi>Scotch,</hi> in so
much that he endeavoured to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:102656:38"/>
Then was the strife between <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>

that commodity, which

who had spent a faire fortune
left by his Ancestors, and now for
maintenance, was forced to lead
the life of a Serving-man (that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
kept many to serve him) and
as an addition, the worst of that
kind, a flat Bawd.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman had lived a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
life, by keeping a Whore of
his own, which for the honour of
her Family I will not name, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was fittest to trade in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
for another, and in truth was
fit to take any impression basenesse
could stamp on him, as the sequell
of this story will manifest; This
<hi>Moabitish</hi> woman, was a Daughter
of the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> married to a
young noble Gentleman the Earl of

            </p>
            <p>This Train took, and the first pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

house, and himselfe Bawd to their

had bitternesse on all hands in the

made <hi>Copinger</hi> a friend to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi>
and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> though but a
Servant to Viscount <hi>Rochester,</hi> for so
now was he called, and now had they
linked him so close, as no breaking
from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Overbury</hi> was that <hi>John Baptist</hi> that
reprooved the Lord, for the sinne
of using the Lady, and abusing the
young Earle of <hi>Essex;</hi> would call
her Strumpet, her mother and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bawds, and used them with so
much scorne, as in truth was not
to bee indured from a fellow of his
Rank; to persons of that quality,
how faulty soever otherwise they
were.</p>
            <p>Then to satisfie <hi>Overbury,</hi> and
blot out the name of Sin, his love
led him into a more desperate way
by a resolution to marry another
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102656:39"/>
mans wife, against this then did <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbury</hi>
bellow lowder, and in it,
shewed himselfe more like an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate,
then a discreet &amp; moderate
friend: had he compounded but one
dram of discretion with an ounce of
affection, he might with such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
have preserved his owne life,
and their fortunes and honors.</p>
            <p>For, those that infinitely hated
that Family, did as infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
his insolent carriage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
towards them; so that had
any of those Brothers, or name, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Overbury,</hi> either by picking a

or any other desperate way, or brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a Duell, upon some other

their Sister; the World would
have justified the action, however he
had stood with God; but <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans</hi>
character of that Family bars
all expectation of so much bravery
of spirit; but a Counsell must be
held to put him to death by some
baser means.</p>

            <p>And thus far I do beleeve the Earl

for he indeed made the worst

but such an imployment was far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
his desert, and much better for
him to have accepted then to bee
confined to a loathsome Prison,
and for want of judgement, had his
sufferings been lesse then losse of life
he had not bin worthy of pity; but,
<hi>Jupiter quos vult perdere, hos dementat;</hi>
hee would to the Tower, from

then accept of an honourable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
from whence he might
not only have returned, but done his

            <p>In his managing of this businesse,
that wisdome of his which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he had been esteemed for, suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the censure of Wise men,
as well as Fooles. Having him now
fast in Prison; <hi>Herodias</hi> by pleasing
her <hi>Herod</hi> must also aske, and have
his life; for, <hi>per scelus ad scelera tutior
est via.</hi> To that end they preferred
Empoysoners to be servants to Sir
<hi>Gervase Elwayes</hi> then Lieutenant of
the Tower; The Gentleman was
ever held wise, and honest, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
in having this place thrust
upon him without his thought; he
was also so religious, that few in the
Court did equall him; so wise, as
he obtained the Character of wise
Sir <hi>Gervase Elwayes,</hi> yet neither could
his wisdom, nor the opinion of his
Religion and honesty, prevent that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102656:41"/>
Fate, he was so ignorant of the plot,
as he never did dreame of any such
matter; untill one day (as it should
seem) <hi>Weston</hi> being told, <hi>Elwayes</hi> did
know wherefore he was preferred
unto him, to waite on <hi>Overbury;</hi> he
asked the Lieutenant one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dinner whether he should now
doe it, <hi>Elwayes</hi> asked him, what?
<hi>Weston</hi> at that being somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed,
<hi>Elwayes</hi> espying it, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said, no not yet; for he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
there was something knowne
to <hi>Weston,</hi> which was a secret to
himselfe. Whereupon, <hi>Elwayes</hi>
could not chew any meat, for chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon those words of <hi>Weston,</hi> but
instantly commanded his Table to
be voyded, and thence he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Study, and sent for <hi>Weston</hi>
to come unto him, examining him
of the meaning of that question; at
last by faire meanes, and threatning
together, got the truth; then <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi>
(as he well could) laid before
<hi>Weston</hi> the horridnesse of the Fact,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102656:41"/>
the torments of Hell, and the unas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of his momentary inioying
of either reward or favour after the
Fact done, but that it must follow
so many Personages of Honour,
would never cabinet such a secret
in his breast, that might ruine them;
at last made him so sensible of his
danger in this life; but more sensible
of the torments in the other, that <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
falling on his knees, said; <hi>O
Lord, how good and gracious art thou,
and thy mercy is above all thy workes;
for this day is salvation come to my soul,
and I would not for all the world have
had such a sinne upon me;</hi> giving the
Lieutenant humble thanks, that had
been the instrument of saving his
soul, by putting him off from so foul
intentions.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant having now thus
renewed grace in him, by making
him (as he thought) a new man;
said, thou and I have a dangerous
part to act, yet be honest and true
to me, and I doubt not, but with

Gods help, we shall perform it wel,
both before God and the World;
<hi>Weston</hi> faithfully promised him, and
for a long time as faithfully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with him; the Lieutenant wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him, to bring all such things as
were sent him (to give <hi>Overbury</hi>)
unto him, which he accordingly did;
the Lieutenant gave them to Cats
and Dogs which he ever had ready
in his study for that purpose; some
died presently, some lay lingering a
longer time: all the Jellies and Tarts
sent to <hi>Overbury,</hi> hee cast into his
Privy, they destaining the very Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,</p>
            <p>This continued long, the Earle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
sending to visit <hi>Overbury,</hi> assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him he did not forget his release,
which would not be long deferred,
wherein most men did verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
he meant both nobly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though others conjectured his
meaning was a dissolution: At last
the Countesse sent for <hi>Weston,</hi> revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, and calling him, Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102656:42"/>
Villaine, for had he given
those things sent, <hi>Overbury</hi> had not
been now alive; vowing, she would
be revenged on him; upon the very
fear whereof, he then gave those
poysons after sent, without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Lieutenant; yet for all this
schooling of <hi>Weston,</hi> and his assurance
given of his future fidelity to the
Countesse, she would not trust him
single any more, but put another
Co-adjutor to him, one <hi>Franklin,</hi> a
verier Villain then <hi>Weston,</hi> and truly
they themselves may be deemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill, that could seek out such wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
instruments.</p>
            <p>These two Villains, out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to see the successe of their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
imployment, comming shortly
after it, into <hi>Overburyes</hi> chamber,
found him in infinite torment, with
contention between the strength of
Nature and the working of the
Poyson, and it being very like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had gotten the better in that
contention, by the thrusting out of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102656:43"/>
boyls, botches, and blains, they
fearing it might come to light, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the judgement of Phisitians,
that foul play had been offered him,
consented to stifle him with the
Bed-cloathes, which accordingly
was performed, and so ended he his
miserable life, with the assurance of
the Conspirators, that he dyed by
poyson; none thinking (much lesse
knowing) otherwise, but these two
Murtherers.</p>
            <p>Now was all (as they beleeved)
quiet, and in the depth of security,
and the Earl and Countesse began to
carry their loves more openly and
impudently: But, they understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the world did talke very
loudly, and broadly of this adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
meeting; it must (from that
ground) proceed to an adulterous
Marriage, as well to the wronging a
young Noble man, as to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and shame of themselves; <hi>But
they must needs goe whom the Devill
drives:</hi> yet know they not how,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102656:43"/>
and somely to effect this, but by
making the King a Party in this baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
businesse, which was no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to effect; for the Kings eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to wander after a new Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
being satiated with the old;
therefore for the bringing this baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery
to a marriage, the Bishops
must be principall actors (as I know
not in what bad action they would
not be lookerson,) and the Bishop
of <hi>Winchester,</hi> an excellent Civilian,
and a very great Scholler, must be
the principal, for which his Son was
Knighted, and will never lose that
by-title of Sir <hi>Nullity Bilson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, by a nullity of the first Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
must the second take place;
For the canvasing whereof, there
were many meetings of the Bishops
and the prime Civillians, in which
there wanted no bribes from the
Lord, Lady, and their Friends, to
have this nullity brought to passe,
wherein the discourse would have
better befitted the mouths of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102656:44"/>
Bawds and Ruffians, then the grave
Divines; among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bishop <hi>Neal,</hi>
(then Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> a Creature
and Favourite of the house of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi>)
took up a learned discourse
in the Science of Bawdery, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees in that Science must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Nullity, wherein were so
many beastly expressions, as for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
sake I will not recite them,
being offensive to my very thoughts
and memory; <hi>Aristotles</hi> Problemes
was a modest discourse to his, and
he appeared to be better studied in
that, then in Divinity, and to wind
up his learned Discourse, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
all those met in this Lord,
(meaning <hi>Essex</hi>) and this Lady.</p>
            <p>The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury
Abbot,</hi> to his everlasting fame,
mainly opposed all the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and protested against them,
for which he ever after lived in
disgrace, excluded from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
Table, and dyed in the disgrace
of the King on Earth, though in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102656:44"/>
favour with the King of Kings.</p>
            <p>Yet, forsooth, to make up the ful
measure of Bawdery, and to justifie
<hi>Neales</hi> Discourse, that all things in
the former Marriage conduced to a
nullity; a search must be made, to
finde whether there had been a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration,
and a Jury of grave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
were found fit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
with their Spectacles, ground,
to lessen, not to make the letter lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
who after their inspection gave
their (false) verdict, that she was
<hi>intacta virgo:</hi> which was thought
very strange, for the World tooke
notice that her way was very neare
beaten, so plaine, as by <hi>regia via,</hi>
and in truth so it was, and a way
more common than that, before <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi>
did ever travell that way; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the World tooke notice they
two had long lived in Adultery,
yet had this old <hi>Kettle</hi> a trick for
that also.</p>
            <p>The Lady of <hi>Essex,</hi> for modesty
sake, makes humble suit to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102656:45"/>
bawdy Bishops, (who were
also plotters in this stratagem) that
she might not appeare bare-faced,
for blushing; but desired to come
vailed, with a Taffity over her face;
this by all meanes was thought so
reasonable (for a pretty modest
Lady) that the bawdy Bishops, and
pur-blinde Ladies, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
modesty themselves, could
not thinke it worthy the deniall;
one Mistris <hi>Fines,</hi> neare Kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to old <hi>Kettle,</hi> was dressed up in
the Countesses Cloathes, at that
time too young to bee other then
<hi>virgo intacta,</hi> though within two
yeares after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had the old Ladyes
made their inspection, the orifice
would not have appeared so small,
to have delivered such a verdict as
they did (and a just one) upon their
views: though upon some of their
knowledges it was not that Lady
they were to give verdict upon; if
any make doubt of the truth of this
Story, the Author delivers upon the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102656:45"/>
reputation of a Gentleman, he had
it <hi>verbatim</hi> from a Knight, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of much Honour,<note place="margin">S. W. B.</note> though the
very dependency on that Family
may question it) which did usher
the Lady into the place of inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and hath told it often to his
friends in mirth.</p>
            <p>Now is the Nullity pronounced,
and the Marriage with <hi>Somerset</hi>
with speed solemnized, for which
they and the whole Family of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi>
paid deare in after time; and
had sowre sauce to that sweet meat
of their great Son in Law</p>
            <p>And surely he was the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
man in that marriage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as generally beloved for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and disposition, as hated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
for his linking himselfe in
that Family; for in all the time of
this mans favour, before this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
he did nothing obnoxious to
the State, or any base thing for
his private gaine, but, whether it
was his owne nature that curbed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102656:46"/>
him, or that there was then a brave
Prince living, and a noble Queene
that did awe him, we cannot so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
judge, because after this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and their death, he did many
very ill things.</p>
            <p>In this Favourites flourishing time,
came over the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> to marry
our Kings Daughter, which for the
present, gave much content, and
with the generall applause; yet it
proved a most unfortunate Match
to him and his Posterity, and all
Christendome; for his Alliance
with so many great Princes, put on
him aspiring thoughts, and so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
was he as not to content
himselfe with his hereditary Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of one of the greatest Princes
in <hi>Germany;</hi> but must aspire to a
Kingdome, beleeving that his great
allyance would carry him through
any enterprise, or bring him off
with honour, in both which he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
being cast out of his owne
Country with shame, and he and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102656:46"/>
his, ever after, living upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of other Princes; but had
his Father in Law spent halfe the
mony in Swords he did in words,
(for which he was but scorned) it
had kept him in his owne inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and saved much Christian
blood since shed; but whiles hee,
being wholly addicted to peace,
spent much treasure, in sending cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Embassadours to treat his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
(which he esteemed friends)
might have sent Armies with a lesse
charge, to conquer, so that it may
be concluded, that this then thought
the most happy Match in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
was the greatest unhappines
to Christendome, themselves and
Posterity.</p>
            <p>And, as if to fore-tell the sad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
presently after the Gallantry
and triumphing of that Marriage,
the Kingdome was clad all in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for the sad obsequies of that
most hopefull Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who
dyed not without vehement suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102656:47"/>
of Poyson, and I wish I could say
but suspicion only; but our future
discourse will tell you otherwise:
He was only shewed to this Nation,
as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
to look on, not to enjoy: wee
did indeed joy in that happinesse
we expected in him, but God found
us so unthankfull, and tooke so
lightly the death of that ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
to make us an example of
scorne now, that were formerly, of
all glory.</p>
            <p>His death was fore-told by one
<hi>Bruce,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pr. <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury's</hi> death.</note> a most famous Astrologer of
the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, for which the
Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> (a great States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
caused him to be banished,
who left this fare-well with the
Earl, that it should be too too true,
yet his Lordship should not live to
see it, the Earle dying in <hi>May,</hi> the
Prince in <hi>November</hi> following, to
the infinite griefe of all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
but the Earle of <hi>Somerset</hi> and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102656:47"/>
Family of <hi>Howards,</hi> who by his
death thought themselves secured
from all future dangers; for, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Prince of an open heart, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all basenesse, would often say,
If ever he were King, he would not
leave one of that Family to pisse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a wall.</p>
            <p>This brave Prince being dead,
<hi>Somerset</hi> and that Faction bare all
downe before them, disposing of all
offices; yet <hi>Somerset</hi> never turned any
out (as did the succeeding favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite)
but places being voyd, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of them, and who would give
most, was the word, yet not by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi>
himselfe, but by his Lady and
her Family; for he was naturally
of a noble disposition, and it may
be justly said of him, that never
could be said of any before, or ever
will be of any after him; He never
got suite for himselfe or friends that
was burthensome to the Common-wealth,
no Monopolies, no Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
yet in his time, and by his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102656:48"/>
favour, (though not for his use)
were brought into the Court two
meane fellowes grand Projectors,
the one, <hi>Ingram,</hi> an ordinary Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Customes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ingram</hi> and <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors.</note> the other,
<hi>Cranfield,</hi> an Apprentice, who had
served three broken Citizens, and it
is probable by his wit and honesty
he might thrive by them all, and lay
that for his first a foundation of his
future projecting; the one a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Northamptons,</hi> the other of
the house of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and these like
ill birds defiled their owne nests, and
discovered the secrets of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
house; yet their projects see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for the Kings profit only,
though much water ran by his Mill,
and <hi>Suffolke</hi> did very well licke his
owne fingers; for, <hi>Salisbury</hi> being
dead, <hi>Suffolke</hi> was Treasurer (the
proper place for Customs) and his
Son in Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chamberlaine and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
and then what could not
they two doe?</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Somerset</hi> ever kept them but
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102656:48"/>
like Projectors, which after Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
raised to the degrees of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
only <hi>Suffolke</hi> by <hi>Somersets</hi> power
made <hi>Ingram</hi> a Cofferer of the
Kings House, which was the first
apparent step to <hi>Somersets</hi> downfall;
for, however the King made faire
semblance to maintaine that Act,
yet made he the Earle of <hi>Kelly</hi> his
instrument to set the Officers of his
houshold to petition him against it,
and ever from the Kings owne dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to take their instructions, in
which, one of the Principal given,
was, not to seeke to <hi>Somerset</hi> upon
any tearmes, nay, to deny to accept
his favour though offered to disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul
his owne act, but to carry it
with an high hand against <hi>Somerset,</hi>
by which, assurance was given of
prevailing. Here was pretty jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
(the Court being then but an
<hi>Academy</hi> of Juglers.) <hi>Somerset</hi> did
often Court the Officers (to make
him that <hi>Achilles</hi> his Weapon, that
could wound and heale againe) but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102656:49"/>
was entertained with s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orne; yet
ambition so dazled his eyes, hee
could not see the <hi>precipice</hi> on
which he stood ready for his down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall;
for, surely no Astrologers
could have given him truer notions
of his ruine then this: <hi>Cranfield,</hi> the
other Projector soared higher,
though not in <hi>Somersets</hi> time could
he have his feathers imped, but
<hi>Buckingham</hi> after did so impe them,
that <hi>Cranfield</hi> endeavoured to pull
out his, and gave him the first af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front;
by this you may observe how
the times altered from better to
worse, and so fittest for worthlesse
men.</p>
            <p>For now began to appeare a gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
of a new Favourite,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>George Villiers</hi> a Favourite.</note> one Mr.
<hi>George Villiers,</hi> a younger Son, (by a
second Venter) of an ancient Knight
in <hi>Leicestershire,</hi> as I take it, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of an ancient Family, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but of a meane, and a waiting
Gentle-woman, whom the old man
fell in love with and married, by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102656:49"/>
whom he had three sons, all raised
to the Nobility, by meanes of their
brother-Favourite: this Gentleman
was come also but newly from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
and at that time did beleeve it
a great fortune to marry a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Sir <hi>Roger Astons,</hi> and in
truth it was the heighth of his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and for that only end was an
hanger on upon the Court; the
Gentlewoman loved him so well, as
could all his friends have made (her
for her great fortune) but an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Markes Joynture, she had
married him presently, in despight
of all her friends; and no question
would have had him without any
Joynture at all.</p>
            <p>But, as the Fates would have it,
before the closing up of this Match,
the King cast a glancing eye towards
him, which was easily perceived by
such as observed their Princes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and then the Match was laid
aside, some assuring him a greater
Fortune was comming towards
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102656:50"/>
him. Then, one gave him his place
of Cup-bearer, that he might be in
the Kings eye; another sent to his
Mercer and Taylor to put good
Cloathes on him; a third, to his
Sempster for curious Linnen, and all
as prefacive insinuations to obtaine
Offices upon his future Rise; then
others tooke upon them to be his
Bravoes, to undertake his quarrels
upon affronts put on him by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersets</hi>
Faction, so all hands helped
to the piecing up this new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</p>
            <p>Then begun the King to eate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
who formerly used to eate in
his Bed-chamber, or if by chance
supped in his Bed-chamber, after
supper would come forth to see
pastimes and fooleries; in which
Sir <hi>Ed. Zouch,</hi> Sir <hi>George Goring,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Iohn Finit</hi> were the chiefe and
Master Fools, and surely this Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
got them more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wisdome, farre above them in
desert: <hi>Zouch</hi> his part it was to sing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102656:50"/>
bawdy songs, and tell bawdy tales;
<hi>Finits,</hi> to compose these Songs:
then was a set of Fidlers brought
to Court on purpose for this
Fooling, and <hi>Goring</hi> was Master of
the game for Fooleries, sometimes
presenting <hi>David Droman,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee
Armstrong</hi> the Kings Foole, on
the back of the other fools, to tilt
one at another, till they fell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the eares; sometimes the
property was presented by them in
Antick Dances. But Sir <hi>John Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
(who was never known before)
was commended for notable fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and so was he indeed the best
extemporary foole of them all:
with this jollity was this Favourite
ushered in. This made the house of
<hi>Suffolke</hi> fret, and <hi>Somerset</hi> carried
himselfe now more proudly, and
his Bravado's, ever quarrelling with
the others, which, by his Office of
Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> for a while car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it. But, <hi>Somerset</hi> using of Sir
<hi>Ralph Wynwood</hi> (whom himselfe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102656:51"/>
brought in for a Secretary of
State) in so scornfull a manner (he
having but only the title, the Earle
himselfe keeping the Seales, and
doing the businesse) made <hi>Wynwood</hi>
endeavour to ruine him, who soone
got an opportunity thereto, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
the Countesse of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
(then Prisoner in the Tower)
who told <hi>Wynwood</hi> on a time, that
<hi>Overbury</hi> was poysoned, which she
had so understood from Sir <hi>Gervase
Elwaies;</hi> who did labour by her
meanes to deale with her two sons
in Law, <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Pembrooke,
(Wynwood</hi> also being great-with
that faction) that when it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
question, he might save his owne
stake, who truly was no otherwise
guilty, but that he did not discover
it at <hi>Westons</hi> first disclosing it (hee
being Keeper of the prison) so by
inference, his not disclosing it, was
<hi>Overburies</hi> death; and had he revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it then, I dare say he had beene
brought into the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102656:51"/>
it, and undone (for yet was not the
time fit for discovery.) <hi>Wynwood,</hi> it
was thought, acquainted the King
with it, knowing how willingly he
would have been rid of <hi>Somerset,</hi> yet
the King durst not bring it in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor any question ever would
have been, had not <hi>Somerset</hi> sought
to crosse him in his passion of love to
his new Favourite, in which the
King was more impatient, then any
woman to enjoy her love.</p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Thrumball,</hi> Agent
at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> had (by an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
boy one <hi>Reeve,</hi> after an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
himselfe in <hi>London,</hi> and
dyed very lately) gotten hold of
this poysoning businesse, for <hi>Reeve</hi>
having under his Master, made some
of those desperate Medicines, either
run away, or else his Master sent
him out of the way, and fell in
company of <hi>Thrumbals</hi> servants at
<hi>Bruxels,</hi> to whom he reveal'd it,
they to their Master, who exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the boy, discovered the truth;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102656:52"/>
               <hi>Thrumball</hi> presently wrote to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<hi>Wynwood</hi> he had businesse of
consequence to discover, but would
not send it, therefore desired licence
to come over. The King would not
yeeld to his returne, but willed him
to send an Expresse: That <hi>Thrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi>
utterly refused; and very wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for had any thing appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his hand, the boy might have
dyed, or run away, and then had he
made himselfe the Author of that
which the courtesie of another must
have justified.</p>
            <p>The King being of a longing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
rather then he would not
know, admitted <hi>Thrumbals</hi> returne,
and now they had good testimony
by the Apothecary, who revealed
<hi>Weston,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> and <hi>Franklyn</hi>
to be principall Agents, yet this
(being neare the time of progresse)
was not stirred in till about Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmas
following; yet <hi>Wynwood</hi> did
now carry himselfe in a braving
way of contestation against <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102656:52"/>
struck in with the Faction of
<hi>Villiers,</hi> now on progresse. The King
he went westward, where he was
feasted at <hi>Cranborne,</hi> by a Sonne in
Law of that Family; at <hi>Lulworth,</hi>
and <hi>Bindon,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Walden;</hi> at
<hi>Charlton,</hi> by Sir <hi>Thomas Howard;</hi>
and every where nothing but one
Faction braving the other; then
was the King feasted at <hi>Purbeck</hi> by
the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> who was of the
contrary Faction, and at a Joynture
house of Sir <hi>George Villiers</hi> mother,
called <hi>Gotly,</hi> where he was magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
entertained.</p>
            <p>After all this feasting, homeward
came the King, who desired by all
meanes to reconcile this clashing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his declining, and rising Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite;
to which end, at <hi>Lulworth</hi>
the King imployed Sir <hi>Humphrey
May,</hi> a great servant to <hi>Somerset,</hi>
and a wise servant to <hi>Villiers,</hi> but
with such instructions as if it came
from himselfe: and <hi>Villiers,</hi> had order
presently after Sir <hi>Humphrey Mayes</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102656:53"/>
returne, to present himselfe and
service to <hi>Somerset.</hi> My Lord, said
he, Sir <hi>George Villers,</hi> will come to
you to offer his service, and desire to
be your creature; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
him not, embrace him, and your
Lordship shall still stand a great
man, though not the sole Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite:
My Lord seemed averse, Sir
<hi>Humphrey</hi> then told him in plaine
tearmes, that he was sent by the
King to advise it, and that <hi>Villiers</hi>
would come to him to cast himself
into his protection, to take his rise
under the shadow of his wings: Sir
<hi>Humphrey May</hi> was not parted from
my Lord halfe an houre, but in
comes Sir <hi>George Villiers,</hi> and used
these very words, <hi>My Lord, I desire
to be your servant, and your creature,
and shall desire to take my Court-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
under your favour, and your
Lordship shall finde me, as faithfull a
servant unto you, as ever did serve you.</hi>
My Lord returned this quick and
short answer, <hi>I will none of your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102656:53"/>
nor shall you have any of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
I will, if I can, break your necke,
and of that be confident.</hi> This was but
a harsh Complement, and savoured
more of spirit then wisdome; and
since that time, breaking each others
necks was their aimes, and its verily
beleeved, had <hi>Somerset</hi> complyed
with <hi>Villiers, Overburyes</hi> death had stil
lain raked up in his own ashes; but,
God, who will never suffer murther
to go unpunished, will have what he
will, maugre all the wisdome of the
World.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Windsor</hi> doth the King return,
to end His Progresse, from thence
to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> then to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
and shortly after to <hi>Royston,</hi> to
begin His Winter-Iourney.</p>
            <p>And now begins the game to bee
plaid, in which, <hi>Somerset</hi> must be
the loser, the Cards being shuffled,
cut, and dealt between the King and
Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> Cheife Iustice
(whose Daughter <hi>Turbeck, Villers</hi>
his Brother had married, or was to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102656:54"/>
marry, and therefore a fit instrument
to ruine <hi>Somerset</hi>) and Secretary <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood;</hi>
these all playd: The stake,
<hi>Somersets</hi> life, and his Ladyes, and
their Fortunes, and the Family of
<hi>Suffolke;</hi> some of them played boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in truth the Game was not
plaid above-board.</p>
            <p>The day the King went from
<hi>White-Hall</hi> to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> and so to
<hi>Royston,</hi> the King sent for all the
Judges (his Lords and Servants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circling
him) where kneeling down
in the midst of them, he used these
very words:</p>
            <p>My Lords the Judges; It is lately
come to my hearing, that you have now
in examination a businesse of poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Lord in what a most miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
shall this Kingdom be, (the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
famous Nation for hospitality in the
World) if our Tables should become such
a snare, as none could eate without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of life, and that <hi>Italian</hi> custom should
be introduced amongst us! (Therefore,
my Lords, I charge you, as you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102656:54"/>
it at that great and dreadfull
day of Judgement, that you examin it
strictly without favour, affection, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality;
and if you shall spare any guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this crime, Gods curse light upon
you and your posterity: And if I spare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that are found guilty, Gods curse
light on me, and my posterity for ever.
<hi>But how this dreadfull thunder-Curse
or imprecation was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
shall be shewed hereafter; and
I pray God, the effect be not felt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, even at this day (as it
hath been, I fear, on that vertuous
Lady</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and her children,)
for God treasures up such impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and deprecations, and poures
them out when a Nation least
dreams, even when they cry, peace,
peace, to their souls; and it may wel
be at this time (our other sins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring)
that he is pouring them out
upon King, Judges, and the whole
State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appeares how unwilling the
King was to ruin <hi>Somerset,</hi> a creature
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102656:55"/>
of his owne making, But, <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabile

Grace was offered by the King, had
he had grace to have apprehended
it.</p>
            <p>The King with this, took his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
for a time of <hi>London,</hi> and was
accompanyed with <hi>Somerset</hi> to <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
where no sooner he brought
him, but instantly tooke his leave,
little imagining what viper lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the hearbs; nor must I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
to let you know how perfect the
King was in the art of dissimulation,
or, (to give it his own phrase) <hi>King-craft;</hi>
The Earle of <hi>Somerset</hi> (to his
apprehension) never parted from him
with more seeming affection then
at this time, when intentionally the
King had so exposed him to <hi>Cookes</hi>
dressing, that hee knew <hi>Somerset</hi>
should never see him more; and had
you seen that seeming affection (as
the Author himself did) you would
rather have beleeved he was in his
rising, then setting: The Earl when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102656:55"/>
he kissed his hand,<note place="margin">K. <hi>James</hi> his parting with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> the King hung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his neck, slabboring his cheeks;
saying, for Gods sake when shall I
see thee againe? On my soule, I
shall neither eate, nor sleep, untill
you come again; the Earl told him,
on Monday (this being on the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,)
for Gods sake let me, said the
King, shall I? shall I? Then lolled
about his neck; then, for Gods sake,
give thy Lady this kisse for me: in
the same manner at the stayres head,
at the midle of the staires, and at the
stayres foot; the Earle was not in
his Coach, when the King used
these very words (in the hearing of
four servants, of whom, one was <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersets</hi>
great creature, and of the
Bed-chamber, who reported it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
to the Author of this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
<hi>I shall never see his face more.</hi> I
appeale therefore to the Reader,
whether this Motto of <hi>Qui nescit
dissimulare, nescit regnare,</hi> was not as
well performed in this passage, as his
<hi>Beati pacifici,</hi> in the whole course of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102656:56"/>
his life; and his love to the latter,
made him to bee beaten with his
own weapon in the other, by all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and States that had to doe with
him.</p>
            <p>But, before <hi>Somersets</hi> approach to
<hi>London</hi> his Countesse was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
at his arrivall, himselfe; and
the King being that night at supper,
said to Sir <hi>Thomas Monson,</hi> My Lord
cheife Justice hath sent for you; he
asked the King, when hee should
waite on him again, who replyed,
you may come when you can: And
(as in the story of <hi>Byron,</hi> and many
others) there have been many foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
observations, as presage; so
was there in this Gentleman, who
was the Kings Mr. Faulconer, and
in truth such an one, as no Prince in
Christendom had; for, what Flights
other Princes had, he would excell
them for his Master, in which one
was at the Kite.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> sending over his Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coners
to shew that sport, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102656:56"/>
Faulconer lay long here, but
could not kill one Kite, (ours being
more magnanimous then the <hi>French</hi>
Kite; Sir <hi>Thomas Monson</hi> desired to
have that flight in all exquisitnesse,
and to that end was at <hi>1000l.</hi> charge
in Ger-Faulcons for that flight, in
all that charge, he never had but one
cast would performe it; and those
had killed nine Kites, which were
as many as they were put off unto,
not any one of them escaping.
Whereupon the Earle of <hi>Pembrooke</hi>
with all the Lords, desired the King
but to walk out of <hi>Royston</hi> Townes
end, to see that Flight, which was
one of the most stateliest Flights
of the world, for the high mountee:
the King went unwillingly forth, the
Flight was shewed, but the Kite
went to such a mountee, and the
Hawke after her, as all the field lost
sight of Kite and Hawke and al, and
neither Kite nor Hawke were either
seen or heard of to this present,
which made all the Court conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102656:57"/>
it a very ill <hi>omen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that you see, the plot was so
well laid, as they could be all within
the toyle at one instant, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of each other.</p>
            <p>Now are in hold, the Earle, his
Countesse, Sir <hi>Thomas Monson,</hi> Mris.
<hi>Turner</hi> (a very lewd and infamous
woman of life) <hi>Weston</hi> and <hi>Franklin,</hi>
with some others of lesse note, of
which one <hi>Simon</hi> a servant to Sir
<hi>Thomas Monson,</hi> who was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in carrying Ielly and Tart to the
Tower, who upon his examination,
for his pleasant answer, was instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dismissed, My Lord told him,
<hi>Simon</hi> you have had a hand in this
poysoning businesse; He replyed,
no, my good Lord, I had but one
finger in it, which almost cost me
my life, and at the best cost me all
my Hair and Nailes; for the truth
was <hi>Simon</hi> was somewhat liquorish,
and finding the syrrup swim from
the top of a Tart, as he carryed it,
he did with his finger scum it off, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102656:57"/>
it was to be beleeved, had he known
what it had been, hee would not
have been his Taster at so deare a
rate; and that you may know <hi>Simons</hi>
interest with that Family, I shall tel
you a story.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Monson</hi> was a great lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of Musicke, and had as good as
<hi>England</hi> had, especially for voyces,
and was at infinite charge in bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some in <hi>Italy.</hi> This <hi>Simon</hi> was
an excellent Musician, and did sing
delicately, but was a more generall
Musician than ever the world had,
and in one kind he surpassed all. He
had a <hi>Catzo</hi> of an immense length
and bignesse, with this, being his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
stick, his palme of his hand his
Tabor, and his mouth his Pipe, he
would so imitate a Tabor and Pipe,
as if it had been so indeed: To this
Musicke, would Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> the
young Ladies, and some of that Ging
dance ever after Supper; the old
Lady, who loved that Musicke as
well, as her Daughters, would sit
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102656:58"/>
and laugh, shee could scarce sit for
laughing; and it was beleeved, that
some of them danced after that
Pipe without the Tabor: his Master
comming to heare of it turned him
away, who was infinitly importuned
to take him again, but would not:
however he could not have wanted
a service elsewhere, but he never
durst use his pipe amongst them, for
their dancing recreation, however
he might for any other.</p>
            <p>And now poor Mrs. <hi>Turner, We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
and <hi>Franklin</hi> began the Tragedy,
Mrs. <hi>Turners</hi> day of mourning being
better then the day of her birth: for
she dyed very penitently, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much modesty in her last act,
which is to be hoped was accepted
with God, after that dyed <hi>Weston;</hi>
and then was <hi>Franklin</hi> arraigned,
who confessed that <hi>Overbury</hi> was
smothered to death, not poysoned
to death; though he had poyson gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him.</p>
            <p>Here was <hi>Cooke</hi> glad, how to cast
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102656:58"/>
about to bring both ends together,
Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> and <hi>Weston</hi> being already
hanged for killing <hi>Overbury</hi> with
poyson, but he being the very quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence
of Law, presently informes
the Jury, that if a man be done to
death, with Pistols, Poniards, swords,
Halter, Poyson, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so he be done
to death, the Indictment is good, if
but indicted for any of those wayes;
but the good Lawyers of those times
were not of that opinion, but did
beleeve, that Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
murthered by my Lord <hi>Cookes</hi>
Law, as <hi>Overbury</hi> was without any
Law.</p>
            <p>In the next place, comes the
Countesse to her Tryall, at whose
Arraignment, as also at Mrs. <hi>Turners</hi>
before, were shewed many Pictures,
Puppits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with some Exorcismes
and Magick spels, which made them
appear more odious, as being known
to converse with Witches and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards;
and amongst those tricks, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
book was shewed. This <hi>Forman</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:102656:59"/>
was a fellow dwelt in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
silly fellow, yet had wit enough
to cheate Ladyes, and other women,
by pretending skill in telling their
Fortunes, as, whether they should
bury their Husbands, and what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Husbands they should have,
and whether they should injoy their
Loves, or whether Maids should get
Husbands, or injoy their servants
to themselves without Corrivals;
but, before he would tell any thing,
they must write their names to his
Alphabeticall booke, with their
own hand writing; by this trick he
kept them in awe, if they should
complaine of his abusing them, as
in truth hee did nothing else: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it was beleeved, some meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were at his house, wherein the
art of a Bawd was more beneficiall
to him, then that of a Conjurer;
and that hee was a better Artist in
the one then other; and that you
may know his skil, hee was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a Cuckold, having a very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102656:59"/>
wench to his Wife, which would
say, she did it to try his skill, but it
fared with him as with Astrologers,
that cannot foresee their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny.
I well remember, there was
much mirth made in the Court, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the shewing this booke, for it
was reported, the first leafe my
Lord <hi>Cook</hi> lighted on, he found his
owne wives name.</p>
            <p>The next that came on the stage
was Sir <hi>Thomas Monson;</hi> but the
night before he was to come to his
Tryall, the King being at the game
of Maw, said, To morrow comes
<hi>Tom Monson</hi> to his Tryall; yea, said
the Kings<note n="*" place="margin">S. H. M.</note> Card-holder, where if
he doe not play his Master-prize,
your Majesty shall never trust me;
this so run in the Kings minde, as
the next game, he said he was slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and would play out that Set
next night; the Gentleman depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his lodging, but was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
gone, but the King sent for him,
what communication they had, I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102656:60"/>
know not, (yet it may be can more
easily guesse then any other) but it
is most certaine, next under God,
that Gentleman saved his life, for
the King sent a Post presently to
<hi>London,</hi> to let the Lord chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
know, he would see <hi>Monsons</hi>
examination and confession, to see
if it were worthy to touch his life,
for so small a matter; <hi>Monson</hi> was
too wise to set any thing but faire
in his confession; what he would
have stab'd with, should have been
(<hi>viva voce</hi>) at his Arraignment.
The King sent word, he saw nothing
worthy of death, or of bonds, in
his Accusation or Examination:
<hi>Cook</hi> was so mad, he could not have
his will of <hi>Monson,</hi> that hee said,
Take him away, we have other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
against him of an higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
with which words, out issues
about a dozen Warders of the
Tower, and tooke him from the
Barre; and <hi>Cooks</hi> malice was such
against him, as though it rained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102656:60"/>
and <hi>Monson</hi> not well, he
made him goe a foot from the
<hi>Guild-Hall</hi> to the Tower, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
cost him his life; there he lay a
close prisoner above three months,
to the end to get a Recorders place,
(that <hi>Cranfield</hi> desired) every man
thinking him in some Treason,
would not lend him any Money, and
if so much money had not been paid
by such a time, his place had been
forfeited. And in this let me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the part of a true friend in
Sir <hi>Humphrey May,</hi> who in 24 hours,
(after Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his deep sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of all other his friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
him in that great exigency)
made his Brother <hi>Herick</hi> take up
2000. l. and pay it, to save his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
without so much as any secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from Sir <hi>Thomas Monson,</hi> (for
he was close prisoner) or from any
friend of his; and that you may
know it was for his office only, this
hard measure was shewed him, the
Money was no sooner paid, but his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102656:61"/>
friends might come unto him; and
I must not let passe the skill of the
Lord <hi>Loriskeine,</hi> a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi> who
long before, by his physiognomy,
told Sir <hi>George Marshall</hi> that Sir
<hi>Thomas Monson</hi> would escape hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nearer then ever any man did,
which was true, for he was twice
brought to his triall, put himselfe
both times upon his Country, yet
was only indicted, never tryed, and
yet he had harder measure then ever
any man had, for he lost his Office,
being but indicted, and not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which is without any president.</p>
            <p>And now for the last act, enters
<hi>Somerset</hi> himselfe on the Stage, who
(being told, as the manner is, by
the Lieutenant, that he must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
to goe next day to his triall)
did absolutely refuse it, and said,
they should carry him in his Bed;
that the King had assured him, he
should not come to any triall, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
durst the King bring him to
tryall; this was in an high straine,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102656:61"/>
and in a language not well under
stood by Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> (then
Lieutenant in <hi>Elwaies</hi> his roome)
that made <hi>Moore</hi> quiver and shake,
and however he was accounted a
wise man, yet he was neare at his
wits end.</p>
            <p>Yet away goes <hi>Moore</hi> to <hi>Greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
as late as it was (being 12. at
night) bounseth at the back-staires,
as if mad, to whom came <hi>Jo. Leve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
one of the Groomes out of his
Bed, enquires the reason of that
distemper at so late a season; <hi>Moore</hi>
tells him he must speake with the
King; <hi>Leveston</hi> replyes, he is quiet
(which in the Scottish dialect, is
fast asleep) <hi>Moore</hi> sayes, you must
awake him; <hi>Moore</hi> was called in, (the
Chamber left to the King and
<hi>Moore</hi>) he tels the King those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
and desired to be directed by
the King, for he was gone beyond
his owne reason, to heare such bold
and undutifull expressions, from a
faulty Subject, against a just Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102656:62"/>
The King falls into a passion
of teares: On my soule, <hi>Moore,</hi> I
wot not what to doe, thou art a
wise man, helpe me in this great
straight, and thou shalt finde thou
dost it for a thankfull Master, with
other sad expressions; <hi>Moore</hi> leaves
the King in that passion, but assures
him he will prove the utmost of his
wit, to serve his Majesty, and was
really rewarded with a suit worth
to him 1500. <hi>l.</hi> (although <hi>Annan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
his great friend, did cheat him
of one halfe, so was there falshood
in friendship.)</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> returnes to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi>
about three next morning,<note place="margin">Somersets Tryall.</note> of
that day he was to come to triall,
enters <hi>Somersets</hi> chamber, tels him
he had been with the King, found
him a most affectionate Master un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and full of grace in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
towards him, but (said he)
to satisfie Iustice, you must appeare,
although returne instantly againe,
without any further proceedings,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102656:62"/>
only you shall know your enemies,
and their malice, though they shall
have no power over you: With this
tricke of wit, he allayed his fury,
and got him quietly, about eight in
the morning, to the Hall, yet feared
his former bold language might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
againe, and being brought by
this trick into the toile, might have
more inraged him to fly out into
some strange discovery, for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof he had two servants
placed on each side of him, with a
Cloak on their armes, giving them
withall a peremptory order, if that
<hi>Somerset</hi> did any way fly out on the
King, they should instantly hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink
him with that Cloak, take him
violently from the Bar, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him away; for which, he would
secure them from any danger, and
they should not want also a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
reward. But the Earle finding
himselfe over-reached, re-collected
a better temper, and went on calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his Tryall, where he held the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102656:63"/>
company untill 7. at night. But
who had seene the Kings restlesse
motion all that day (sending to
every Boat he saw landing at the
Bridge, cursing all that came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tydings) would have easily
judged all was not right, and there
had been some grounds for his
feares of <hi>Somersets</hi> boldnesse; but at
last one bringing him word he was
condemned, and the passages, All
was quiet. This is the very relation
from <hi>Moores</hi> owne mouth, and this
he told <hi>verbatim,</hi> in <hi>Wanstead</hi> Parke,
to two Gentlemen (of which the
Author was one) who were both
left by him to their own freedome,
without engaging them, even in
those times of high distemperatures,
unto a faithfull secresie in conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: yet, though he failed in his
wisdome, they failed not in that
worth inherent in every Noble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
never speaking of it till after the
Kings death.</p>
            <p>And there were other strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102656:63"/>
to beleeve <hi>Somerset</hi>
knew that by the King, he desired
none other in the world should be
partaker of, and that all was not
peace within in the Peace-maker
himselfe; for he ever courted <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi>
to his dying day, and gave
him 4000. l. <hi>per annum</hi> for Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farme
Rents, after he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which he took in his servants
names, not his owne (as then being
condemned; not capable of) and he
then resolved never to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
I have heard it credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he was told by a Wizzard, that
could he but come to see the Kings
face againe, he should be re-invested
in his former dearnesse with him;
this had been no hard experiment,
but belike he had too much Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to trust to Wizzards, or else
some friends of his had trusted
them, and been deceived by them,
that he had little reason to put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in them.</p>
            <p>Many beleeved him guilty of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verburies</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:102656:64"/>
death, but the most
thought him guilty only of the
breach of friendship (and that in a
high point) by suffering his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
which was the high-way
to his murther; and this conjecture
I take to be of the soundest opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for by keeping him out of the
action (if it were discovered) his
greatnesse fortified with innocency,
would carry their nocencies through
all dangers. For the Gentleman
himselfe, he had misfortune e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to marry such a woman, in
such a Family, which first undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his Honour, afterwards his life,
(at least to be dead in Law;) nor
did any thing reflect upon him in
all his time of Favourite, but in, and
by that Family; first in his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
marriage, then in so hated a
Family, and the bringing in <hi>Cranfield</hi>
and <hi>Ingram,</hi> as Projectors, all by his
Wives and friends meanes; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
had he been the bravest Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of our time, full of Majesty,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102656:64"/>
imploying his time like a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and the King kept correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
with him by Letters, almost
weekly, to his dying day.</p>
            <p>And here have we brought this
great mans glory to its period, with
his fatal Countesse, who some years
after it, dyed miserably at <hi>Chiswick.</hi>
Mris. <hi>Turner, Weston, Franklin</hi> and
<hi>Elwayes</hi> dyed in the Tower, <hi>Weston</hi>
ever saying, it never troubled him to
dye for the Blue Ribbons sake: and so
was concluded that grand businesse,
the grosse production of a then foul
State and Court, wherein, Pride,
Revenge and Luxury abounded. Yet,
and its verily beleeved, when the
King made those terrible Imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on himselfe, and Deprecations
of the Iudges, it was intended the
Law should run in its proper chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
but was stopt and put out of
course by the folly of that great
Clerke though no wise man, Sir
<hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> who, in a vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
speech, to shew his vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102656:65"/>
enters into a rapture as he then
sat on the Bench, saying, <hi>God knows
what became of that sweet Babe Prince</hi>
Henry (<hi>but I know somewhat;</hi>) &amp; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in searching the Cabinets, he ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on some Papers that spake plain
in that which was ever whispered;
which had he gon on in a gentle way,
would have falne in of themselves,
not to have been prevented, but
this folly of his tongue, stopt the
breath of that discovery, of that so
foule a murder, which, I fear, cryes
still for vengeance.</p>
            <p>And now begins the new Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
to reign, without any concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
now hee rises in honour, as
well as swells with pride, breaking
out of those modest bounds, (which
formerly had impaled him) to the
high-way of pride and scorne, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, and putting in all he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
First, he must aspire to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralls
Office himselfe, and would
not let the old Gentleman (so well
deserving in that place) dye with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102656:65"/>
that Title, but the King must put
himselfe to a great charge, to put
out the better, and take in the
worse; yet for all his immense
greatnesse, would he never let him
be Admiral; untill he had first setled
Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi> Vice-Admirall
of <hi>England,</hi> during his life, by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
in which, he not onely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
his love to his Noble friend,
though sometime his servant, but
his care to the State, that his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and abilities, might support
the others inabilities; wel knowing,
that the Honour and safety of the
Kingdome, consisted in the wel-ordering
and strength of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</p>
            <p>Next, <hi>Egerton</hi> had displeased him
by not giving way to his exorbitant
desires, he must out, and would not
let him seale up his dying eyes, with
the seals which he had so long car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed,
and so well discharged; and
to despite him the more, and to vex
his very soule in the last Agony, he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102656:66"/>
sent <hi>Bacon</hi> (one he hated yet, to be
his Successor) for the Seales, which
the old mansspirit could not brook,
but sent them by his owne servant
to the King, and shortly after yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his soul to his Maker.</p>
            <p>And to the end you may know
what men were made choyce of, to
serve turnes, I shall set you downe a
true story: This great Favourite
sent a Noble Gentleman, and of
much worth to <hi>Bacon,</hi> with this Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to <hi>Bacon.</hi>
               </note>
that he knew him to be a man
of excellent parts, and as the times
were, sit to serve his Master in the
Keepers place, but hee also knew
him of a base and ingratefull dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and an arrant Knave, apt in his
prosperity, to ruine any that had
raised him from adversity; yet for
all this, hee did so much study his
Masters service (knowing how fit
an instrument he might be for him)
that he had obtained the Seales for
him; but with this assurance, should
he ever requite him, as he had done
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102656:66"/>
some others to whom he had been
more bound, he would cast him
downe as much below scorne, as
he had now raised him high above
any Honour he could ever have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bacon</hi> was at that time Attorney
Generall,<note place="margin">Bacons Answer.</note> who patiently hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Message, replyed, I am
glad my noble Lord deales so
friendly and freely with me, and
hath made that choyce of so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and Noble a friend, that
hath delivered his Message in so
plaine language; but saith he, can
my Lord know these abilities in
me? and can hee thinke when I
have! attained the highest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
my profession is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, I shall so much faile in my
judgement, and understanding, as
to lose these abilities? and by my
miscarriage to so noble a Patron,
cast my selfe headlong from the top
of that honour, to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of contempt and scorne?
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102656:67"/>
Surely, my Lord cannot thinke so
meanly of me. The Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
I deliver you nothing from
my selfe, but the words are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my mouth by his Lordship, to
which I neither adde nor diminish;
for, had it been left to my discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
surely, though I might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you the substance, yet should I
have apparelled it in a more mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
attire; but as I have faithfully
delivered my Lords to you, so will
I as faithfully returne yours to his
Lordship.</p>
            <p>You must understand the reason
of this Message, was, his ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to <hi>Essex,</hi> which every one
could remember, for the Earle sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him from starving, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
him so, as his Apology must
witnesse; were there not a great
fault, there needed no Apology;
nor could any age, but a worthlesse,
and corrupt, in men and manners,
have thought him worthy such a
place of honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:102656:67"/>
Well, Lord Keeper he was, for
which he paid nothing, nor was hee
able; for now was there a new trick
to put in dishonest and necessitous
men, to serve such turnes, as men of
plentifull fortunes, and fair repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
would not accept of; and
this filled the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
full of beggerly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
(such daring to venture on
any thing) having nothing to lose;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> course to raise his kindred.</note>
(for it is riches makes men co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
Poverty, daring and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
to adventure at any thing to
get something) yet did not <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
doe things <hi>gratis,</hi> but, what
their purses could not stretch unto,
they paid in pensions out of their
places, all which went to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his numerous beggerly kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
<hi>Bacon</hi> paid a Pension, <hi>Heath</hi>
(Atturney) paid a Pension, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
(Deane) paid a Pension,
with many others: Nor was this
any certaine rule, for present por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
must be raised, for the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102656:68"/>
of a poore Kitchin Maid, to be
made a great Count esse; so <hi>Fotherby</hi>
made Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> paid 3500. l.
and some also, worthy men, were
preferred <hi>gratis,</hi> to blow up their
Fames, and Trumpet forth their
Noblenesse (as <hi>Tolson,</hi> a worthy
man, paid nothing in Fine or Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
after him, <hi>Davenant,</hi> in the
same Bishoprick;) but these were
but as Musick before every sceane;
nor were fines or pensions certaine,
but where men were rich, there
Fines without reservation of rent;
where poore, and such as would
serve turnes, there Pensions; no
Fines; so <hi>Weston,</hi> and many others:
There were books of rates on all
the Offices, Bishopricks, Deaneries
in <hi>England,</hi> that could tell you
what Fines, what Pensions, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it had been impossible such
a numerous kindred could have
been maintained with the three
Kingdomes Revenue.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Bacon</hi> invested in his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102656:68"/>
Office, and, within ten dayes after,
the King goes to <hi>Scotland; Bacon</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
begins to believe himselfe
King, lyes in the Kings Lodgings,
gives audience in the great Banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
House, makes all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
attend his motions, with the
same state the King used to come
out, to give audience to Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours;
when any other Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
sate with him about the Kings
affaires, would (if they sate neare
him) bid them know their distance;
upon which, Secretary <hi>Wynwood</hi>
rose, went away, and would never sit
more (under his encroached State)
but instantly dispatcht one to the
King, to desire him to make haste
back, for even his very Seat was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
usurped: At which, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
the King reading it unto
us, both the King and we were very
merry; and if <hi>Buckingham</hi> had sent
him any Letters, would not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
the opening or reading them
in publique, though, it was said, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102656:69"/>
speedy dispatch, nor would
vouchsafe him any answer. In this
posture he lived, untill he heard the
King was returning, and began to
beleeve the Play was almost at an
end, he might personate a Kings
part no longer, and therefore did
againe re-invest himselfe with his
old rags of basenesse, which were so
tattered and poore at the Kings
comming to <hi>Windsor;</hi> he attended
two dayes at <hi>Buckinghams</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
being not admitted to any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
place, then the roome where
Trencher-scrapers and Lacquies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
there sitting upon an old
wooden chest, (amongst such as for
his basenesse,<note place="margin">He is scorned.</note> were only fit compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
although the Honour of his
place did merit farre more respect)
with his Purse and Seale lying by
him, on that chest; My selfe told a
servant of my Lord of <hi>Buckinghams,</hi>
it was a shame to see the Purse and
Seale of so little value or esteeme in
his Chamber, though the Carryer,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102656:69"/>
without it, merited nothing but
scorne, being worst among the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest.
He told me they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it must be so; after two dayes
he had admittance: at first entrance
he fell downe flat on his face at the
Dukes foot, kissing it, vowing never
to rise till he had his pardon, then
was he againe reconciled, and since
that time so very a slave to the
Duke, and all that Family, that he
durst not deny the command of the
meanest of the kindred, nor oppose
anything; by this you see, a base spirit
is ever most concomitant with the
proudest minde, and surely never so
many brave parts, and so base and
abject a spirit tenanted together in
any one earthen Cottage, as in
this one man: I shall not remember
his basenesse, being out of his place,
of pinning himselfe, for very scraps,
on that Noble Gentleman, Sir
<hi>Julius Caesars</hi> Hospitality, that at
last he was forced to get the Kings
Warrant to remove him out of his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102656:70"/>
house; yet in his prosperity, the
one being Chancellor, and the other
Master of the Rolls, did so scorne
and abuse him, as he would alter
any thing the other did.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Buckingham</hi> having the
Chancellor, Treasurer, and all
great Officers his very slaves, swels
in the height of pride, summons up
all his Country kindred, the old
Countesse providing a place for
them to learne to carry themselves
in a Court-like garbe, but because
they could not learne the French
Dances so soon as to be suitable to
their gay Clothes, Country Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(for their sakes only) must be
the garbe of the Court, and none
else must be used.</p>
            <p>Then must these women-kindred
be married to Earles, Earles eldest
Sonnes, Barons, or chiefe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of greatest estates, insomuch
that the very female kindred were
so numerous, as were sufficient to
have peopled any Plantation; nay,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102656:70"/>
very Kitchin-wenches were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Knights eldest sonnes; yet, as
if <hi>England</hi> had not matches enough
in the Kingdome, they married like
the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> in their own
kindred, witnesse the Earle of <hi>Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesea,</hi>
married a cousen German, to
whom he had given earnest before;
so that King <hi>James,</hi> that naturally,
in former times, hated women,
had his Lodgings replenished with
them, and all of the Kindred. The
Brethren, great Earls. Little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
did run up and downe the
Kings Lodgings, like little Rabbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starters
about their boroughs: Here
was a strange change, that the King,
who formerly would not endure his
Queen and children in his Lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
now you would have judged,
that none but women frequented
them; nay, that was not all, but
the kindred had all the houses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>White-Hall</hi> (as if they had
been Bulwarks and Flankers to that
Cittadell.) But, above all the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102656:71"/>
of those times, old Sir <hi>Anthony
Ashley,</hi> who never loved any but
boyes, yet he was snatcht up for a
kinswoman, as if there had been a
concurrency thorow the Kingdom,
that those that naturally hated wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
yet should love his kindred, as
well as the King him.</p>
            <p>And the very old Midwives of
that kindred, flockt up for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of which old Sir <hi>Christopher
Perkins,</hi> a woman-hater, that never
meant to marry, nay it was said, he
had made a vow of Virginity, yet
was coupled to an old Midwife, so
that you see the greatnesse of this
Favourite, who could force (by his
power over the King) though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Nature.</p>
            <p>But I must tell you, this got him
much hatred, to raise brothers, and
brother-in-laws to the highest rank
of Nobility, which were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the place, of scarce a Iustice
of the Peace, only his brother <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi>
had more wit and honesty then
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102656:71"/>
all the kindred beside, and did keep
him in some bounds of honesty and
modesty, whilst he lived about him,
and would speake plaine <hi>English</hi> to
him: for which plainnesse, when
they had no colour to put him from
his brother, they practised to make
him mad, and thought to bring that
wicked stratagem to effect, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing
a wicked Woman, his
Wife, the Lord <hi>Cookes</hi> Daughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, even in her base and
lewd living.</p>
            <p>And now is <hi>Purbeck</hi> mad indeed,
and put from Court. Now, none
great with <hi>Buckingham,</hi> but Bawds
and Parasites, and such as humoured
him in his unchaste pleasures; so
that since his first being a pretty,
harmlesse, affable Gentleman, he
grew insolent, cruell, and a monster
not to be endured.</p>
            <p>And now is <hi>Williams,</hi> sometimes
Chaplaine to the Lord Keeper <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerton,</hi>
brought into play, made a
privie-Councellor, Deane of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:102656:72"/>
and of secret Councell
with the King, he was also made
Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
voyced at his first step, to marry
<hi>Buckinghams</hi> Mother, who was in
her husbands time, created a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse
(he remaining still) a C. silly
drunken sot) and this was the
first president of this kinde ever
known. <hi>Williams</hi> held her long in
hand, and no doubt, in nature of her
Confessor, was her secret friend,
yet would not marry at present:
which, afterwards, was cause of his
downfall.</p>
            <p>Then was there a Parliament
summoned, in which, <hi>Bacon</hi> for his
bribery and injustice, was thrust out,
being closely prosecuted by one
<hi>Morby</hi> a Woodmonger, and one
<hi>Wrenham,</hi> formerly deeply censured
in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for accusing
him of bribery and injustice; <hi>Bacon</hi>
was by Parliament justly put out of
his place, and but only for the Votes
of the Bishops, had been degraded;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102656:72"/>
the Bishops might have done better
to have kept their voyces to have
done themselves service at this
time, but surely that, with some
other injustice of theirs, had so fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up their measure of iniquity,
that now Gods anger is kindled
against them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Bacons</hi> place comes <hi>Williams,</hi> a
man on purpose brought in at first
to serve turnes, but in this place to
doe that which none of the Layity
could be found bad enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
whereupon this observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made, that first, no Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
could be found so dishonest as
a Clergy man; next, as <hi>Bacon</hi> the
Father of this <hi>Bacon,</hi> did receive the
seales from a Bishop, so a Bishop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
received them from a <hi>Bacon;</hi>
and at this did the Lawyers fret, to
have such a flower pulled out of
their Garland.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Williams,</hi> though he wanted
much of his Predecessors abilities
for the Law, yet did he equall him
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102656:73"/>
for learning and pride, and beyond
him in the way of bribery, this man
answering by Petitions, in which
his servants had one part, himselfe
another, and so was calculated to be
worth to him &amp; his servants <hi>3000. l.
per annum,</hi> by a new way never
found out before.</p>
            <p>And now being come to the
height of his preferment, he did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange
himselfe from the company
of the old Countesse, having much
younger ware, who had keyes to
his chamber to come to him, yet
was there a necessity of keeping him
in this place for a time, the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Match being yet in chase, and if it
succeeded, this man was to clap the
great Seale (through his ignorance
in the Lawes) to such things that
none that understood the danger by
knowing the Lawes, would venture
upon, and for this designe was he at
first brought in, (no Prince living
knowing how to make use of men,
better then King <hi>James.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:102656:73"/>
Now was also <hi>Suffolke</hi> turned out

a fellow (of the same Batch that
<hi>Williams</hi> was) brought into his
place, <hi>Cranfield,</hi> that was the Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
and never could get higher

meane birth, both proud, only the
one an excellent Scholler, and of
great parts; the other, nothing but
a pack of ignorance sodered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with impudence to raise him
(besides his marriage in the lusty
kindred.)</p>
            <p>This <hi>Cranfield</hi> was a fellow of so
meane a condition, as none but a

endured his perching on that high
Tree of honour, to the dishonour of
the Nobility, the disgrace of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102656:74"/>
Gentry, and not long after, to his
owne dishonour, who was thrust
out of the Lords House with this
censure, that <hi>Thou</hi> Lionell, <hi>Earle of
Middlesex, shalt never sit, or have voice

to over-top the Gentry. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

            <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Match,<note place="margin">The Prince goes into Spaine.</note> having been
long in Treaty, and it being suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
now, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
with the State in this, as they
formerly did in a Match with that
brave Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and in truth, in
all other things wherein any nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
had been, only feeding the
King with faire hopes, and faire
words, yet foule deeds. Whether
the King suspected any such matter,
or any whimsey came in the braine
of this great Favourite and Prince,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102656:74"/>
to imitate the old stories of the
Knights Erland, but agreed it was
(it should seeme) between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
and the Prince only (no
one other so much as dreaming of
any such adventure except <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
that the Prince must goe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into <hi>Spaine:</hi> away they went
under the borrowed names of <hi>Jack</hi>
and <hi>Tom Smith,</hi> to the amazement of
all wise men, only accompanied
with <hi>Cottington,</hi> and some one or
two more at most; taking their
way by <hi>France,</hi> they had the Ports
laid so, that none should follow
them, or give any notice to the
<hi>French</hi> Court, till they might get
the start, &amp;c. yet their wisdomes
made them adventure to stay in the
<hi>French</hi> Court, and looke on that
Lady whom he after married, and
there did this <hi>Mars</hi> imitate one of
Prince <hi>Arthurs</hi> Knights, in seeking
adventures through forraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
territories; First beheld this
<hi>French</hi> beauty, <hi>Mars vidit, visamque
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102656:75"/>
cupit, potiturque cupita:</hi> as in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
will afterward appear; from
thence away to <hi>Spaine;</hi> but as the
Journey was only plotted by young
heads, so it was so childishly carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they escaped the <hi>French</hi>
Kings Curriers very narrowly, but
escape they did, and arrived safely
in <hi>Spaine</hi> their wished Port, before
either welcome, or expected, by our
Embassadors, or that State.</p>
            <p>Yet now must the best face bee
put on, at all hands, that put their
Grandees to new shifts, and our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
the Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi> to try
his wit, for at that time was Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Aston</hi> also Embassador at <hi>Spaine,</hi>
in all occurrences <hi>Aston</hi> complyed
with the Prince and Duke, <hi>Bristol</hi>
ran counter; and the Duke and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol</hi>
hated each other mortally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bristol</hi> had the advantage of them
there, as having the much better
head-peice, and being more conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and dear with that State, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complying with them, and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102656:75"/>
had done them very acceptable
services (and in this very Treaty was
of the pack) <hi>Buckingham</hi> had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of him in <hi>England</hi> (although
the King did now hate <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
yet was so awed that hee durst not
discover it) Then <hi>Buckingham</hi> had all
interest in his Successor by this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
so that he laid a present and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
foundation of his succeeding
greatnesse.</p>
            <p>For all his power and greatnesse
<hi>Bristoll</hi> did not forbeare to put all
scornes, affronts, and tricks on him,
and <hi>Buckingham</hi> lay so open, as gave
the other advantage enough by his
lascivious carriage, and miscarriage.
Amongst all his tricks, hee playes
one so cunningly, that it cost him all
the hair on his head, and put him
to the dyet; for it should seem hee
made court to <hi>Conde Olivares</hi> wife,
a very handsom Lady; But it was so
plotted betwixt the Lady, her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and <hi>Bristol,</hi> that instead of that
beauty, he had a notorious S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102656:76"/>
sent him, and surely, by reason
of his said loose and vicious dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
had ever the Match been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
intended for our Prince, yet such
a Companion or Guardian, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to have made that wary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
beleeve that hee had also
been that way addicted; and so have
frustrated the Marriage (that being
a grave and sober people, now espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when conversed with by such
great forraign ghests) but they wel
observed the Prince himselfe to be
of an extraordinary well staied tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>But now, many Lords flockt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and many Servants, that he
might appear the Prince of <hi>England,</hi>
and like himselfe, though hee came
thither like a private person, many
Treaties were, sometimes hope,
sometimes dispair, sometimes great
assurance, then all dasht againe, and
however, his entertainment was as
great as possible that State could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;
yet was his addresses to, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102656:76"/>
with, the Lady, such as rendred
him meane, and a private person, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then a Prince of that State that
formerly had made <hi>Spaine</hi> feel the
weight of their anger, and power;
and was like a Servant, not a Suitor,
for he never was admitted, but to
stand bare-head in her presence, nor
to talke with her, but in a full audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with much company.</p>
            <p>At last, after many heats and
cooles, many hopes, and despaires,
the Prince wrote a letter to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a desperate despaire, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of not injoying his Lady, but of
never more returning, with this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
<hi>You must now, Sir, look upon my
Sister and her children, forgetting ever
you had such a Son, and never thinking
more of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the folly of this voyage,
plotted only by green heads, began
to appear, many shewing much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
many smiling at their sollies
(and in truth glad in their hearts)
and however the King was a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102656:77"/>
dissembler, and shewed much
outward sorrow, as he did for Prince
<hi>Henryes</hi> death, yet something was
discerned, which made his Court
beleeve little greife came neare his
heart, for that hatred he bare to
<hi>Buckingham</hi> long (as being satiated
with him) and his adoring the rising
Sunne, not looking after the Sunne
setting, made the world beleeve hee
would thinke it no ill bargaine to
lose his Son, so <hi>Buckingham</hi> might
bee lost also, for had he not been
weary of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have adventured him in such a
journey, all his Courtiers knew that
very well.</p>
            <p>And for a further illustration of
his wearinesse of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the Parliament before,
when the King gave so much way to
his ruine, that <hi>Buckingham</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
him that hee did seeke his
ruine, and being generally held as a
lost man, the King (to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
it was not so, although, as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102656:77"/>
hereafter you shall understand, it was
so, and that the King durst not avow
his own act,) brought him off from
that Parliament, but <hi>Buckingham</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the King ever afterwards.</p>
            <p>The reason the King so hated
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> (besides his being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of him, for his now stalenesse,
was his marriage, after which the
Kings edge was ever taken off from
all Favourites as well as him; yet
this had so much the over awing
power of him, that hee durst not
make shew to affect any other,)
there was one <hi>Inniossa</hi> a Spanish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
extraordinary here, beingan
old Soldier and a gallant fellow, who
thought that <hi>Buckingham</hi> did not
give that respect to him was due to
his own person, or to the person of
so great a King whose person he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented;
<hi>Inniossa</hi> therefore did as
much scorn and slight <hi>Buckingham</hi>
&amp; the Prince whom he sound wholly
governed by <hi>Buckingham;</hi> for now
<hi>Buckingham</hi> had found, by many pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102656:78"/>
the Kings desire to be rid of
him, he made Court to the Prince,
and so wrought himself into his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias</hi> were
not more dear each to other, which
by no means could the old King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with, nor in truth did any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like or approve of the Prince his
poor spirit, fearing it foretold his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
inclination, that could ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any familiarity with such an
one, as had put such foul scorns and
affronts on him in his time of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with the Father: especially, such
as called to minde the bravery of
his brother, who hated the whole
Family for their generall base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
although none of them had
ever offended him in particular, as
this man had done the Prince at two
severall times, once, before an
infinite concourse, by bidding him
in plaine termes kisse his Arse; a
second time, offering to strike
him, saying in most undutiful terms,
<hi>By God it shall not bee so, nor you
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102656:78"/>
shall not have it,</hi> lifting up his hand
over his head with a Ballon-Bracer,
that the Prince said, <hi>What, my Lord,
I thinke you intend to strike me:</hi> The
first of these audacious affronts was
at <hi>Royston,</hi> the second at <hi>Greenwich,</hi>
before about 400. people. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of which were to bee indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a private person, but by
a Prince from a private person,
surely it shewed a much lesse spirit
then should have been inherent to
a Prince, and after this, to bee
so deare with him, as to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by him all his life time, more
then his Father was in the prime of
his affection, I can give it no title
meane enough; it had been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Noble minde of a Prince to
have forgotten such injuries, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to have revenged them when he
had been King, but never to have
suffered him to have come neare his
Court, to upbraid him with the
sight of so much scorn, and that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
offered him before: But at
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102656:79"/>
that time I well remember some
Critticks in Court did not stick to
read his future destiny.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Inniossa</hi> being a brave daring
Gentleman, used some speeches in
the derogation of the Prince and
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> as if they were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the old King; nay, <hi>Inniossa</hi>
sent one <hi>Padro Macestria</hi> (a <hi>Spanish</hi>
Jesuite, and a great States-man) to
King <hi>James,</hi> to let him know, that
he, (under confession) had found
the King was by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> or by
his procurement, to be killed, but
whether by poyson, Pistoll, Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
&amp;c. that he could not tell.</p>
            <p>The King, after the hearing of
this, was extream melancholly, and
in that passion was found by <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
at his returne to him. The
King, as soon as ever he espied him,
said, Ah <hi>Stenny, Stenny,</hi> (for so he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
called him in familiarity,) wilt
thou kill me? at which <hi>Buckingham</hi>
started, and said, who, Sir, hath so
abused you? at which the King sat
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102656:79"/>
silent; out went <hi>Buckingham,</hi> sret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and fuming, asked, who had
been with the King in his absence?
It was told him <hi>Padro Macestria,</hi>
then who brought him to the King?
it was replyed, the Earl of <hi>Kelly;</hi> then
flew <hi>Buckingham</hi> on him, to know
how he durst bring any one in to
the King in his absence, or without
his licence? <hi>Kelly</hi> stood up close to
him (for you must know, <hi>Kelly</hi> was
the truest alarum to give warning
of the downefall of a Favourite, of
any in the Court) and knew his
power could doe him no hurt with
the King, in present; although it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
cast him out of all favor from
the King in future.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Buckingham</hi> questioned <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro
Macestria,</hi> but that quarrel was
interposed and undertook by <hi>Inni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ossa,</hi>
who told him he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
him a Traytor, and that, were
his Masters person off him; he was
a Chivalier, and better borne then
himselfe, and would make it good on
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102656:80"/>
him with his Sword.</p>
            <p>Which high comparison (though
I beleeve true enough) together
with his generous Charge and
Challenge, <hi>Buckingham</hi> for that time
swallowed, and only thought of this
shift to vindicate himselfe on <hi>Inni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ossa,</hi>
which was, to cause the Prince
to write a Letter of complaint to
the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for abusing him
and <hi>Buckingham;</hi> but the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> returned the Letter in a kind
of scorne, to <hi>Inniossa,</hi> not as blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, but rather commending
him; and <hi>Inniossa</hi> in scorne sent it to
the Prince, as if he should say, there
is your Letter to wipe—, which
is all it is fit for.</p>
            <p>Now have you heard what made
the King hate <hi>Buckingham,</hi> you shal
also hear the reason of <hi>Buckinghams</hi>
extreame hatred to the King, which
was beleived the cause of his so spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
death. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> a very faithful
servant to the King, and his Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
General, and no lesse affectionate
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102656:80"/>
to <hi>Somerset,</hi> being formerly raised by
him without any seeking of his, or
so much as within his thought, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as to expresse his love to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset,</hi>
he desired to lay downe that
great place, rather then aggravate, as
his place required, against him. This
man, as well out of his faithfulnesse
to the King, as affection to <hi>Somerset,</hi>
was made choyce of, to worke the
downefall of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in which
he apparently shewed himselfe. But
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> as I told you before,
out of the Kings feare, that durst not
maintaine his owne designe, but left
his Instruments to the mercy of
<hi>Buckinghams</hi> tyranny, being once
gotten out of the toile, like a chased
Boare, foamed, and bit at all came
neare him, and amongst them first
fastned on <hi>Yelverton,</hi> put him out of
his place, and committed him close
Prisoner to the Tower; <hi>Yelverton</hi>
having shewed himselfe so faithfull
to his Master, and he againe so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
to him, to leave him to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102656:81"/>
undergo the whole burden of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghams</hi>
fury, did fly out in some
passion before Sir <hi>Allen Appesly,</hi>
then Lieutenant of the Tower, and
<hi>Buckinghams</hi> great creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appesly</hi> telling the Duke of some
passages in his passion, the Duke one
night about 12. a clock came in a
a disguise, and with the Lieutenant
only, entred <hi>Yelvertons</hi> longing, <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton</hi>
at first sight started, verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
he came in that manner to
murther him; yet, at last recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe, and said: My Lord, have
you the Kings Warrant for this?
the Duke said, no; then said <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton,</hi>
how dare you enter a
close prisoners lodging? it is as
much as your life is worth: And as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
your selfe Master Lieutenant,
the King shall know of this, and you
must answer it. My Lord said, I
come to you (as a friend, though,
formerly, I confesse, upon just cause,
your mortall enemy;) only to aske
you but two questions, which if
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102656:81"/>
you will resolve me, I vow to be a
greater friend now then ever an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and can, and will restore you
foure-fold: <hi>Yelverton</hi> told him, if
they were such as he might, hee
would.</p>
            <p>The first he asked was, What
wrong he had ever done him, that
he so greedily thirsted after his
blood? <hi>Yelverton</hi> replyed, never any,
but I was set on by a power that I
could not withstand, to doe what I
did; he asked him by whom? by
the King your Master, said he, who
hates you more then any man living,
which you might well understand,
when in his Speech to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he said, he would not spare
any (no not any that were dearest to
him, or lay in his bosome) by which
he pointed them to you.</p>
            <p>Wel, said <hi>Buckingham,</hi> I see you
have dealt like a Friend with me, by
many other concurrences as well as
by this; give me your hand, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
you are my friend, and I am
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102656:82"/>
yours; and I will raise you highet
then I have cast you downe: which
he had made good, had <hi>Yelverton</hi>
lived to have injoyed it, for he was
instantly released, and the next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
he gratified him with was
a Judges place, and he had been Lord
Keeper, had not death prevented it.
And if there were no other reason,
but his change from a mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to so firme a friend, this were
sufficient to confirme the truth of
this story. But the Authour had this
from <hi>Yelvertons</hi> owne relation, and
cannot commend <hi>Yelverton,</hi> because
it is verily beleeved this hastened
the Kings death.</p>
            <p>Now have you heard the true
causes of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> hatred to the
King, and the Kings to <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
the King having the more power to
revenge, had the lesse courage; <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
lesse power, but more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
sharpened with revenge: And
however the World did beleeve the
Kings inclination was out of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102656:82"/>
ground, that he might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
yet it was no other but a
cowardly disposition that dust not
adventure; But although the King
lost his opportunity on <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
yet the black plaister and powder
did shew <hi>Buckingham</hi> lost not his on
the King; and that it was no fiction
but a reallity, that <hi>Padro Macestria</hi>
had formerly told the King.</p>
            <p>And now to returne from this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
which is not impertinent,
(besides a great secret,) the Prince
returnes from <hi>Spaine,</hi> contrary to
expectation; in which the wisdome
and gravity of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> failed
him, especially if they did beleeve
<hi>Padro Macestria</hi> (besides nature could
not long support the old King) and
then the <hi>Spaniard</hi> might have made
no little advantage by injoying such a
pledge: But they have confessed
their errour, yet doe palliate it
with having the Prince his faith and
his proxie left with <hi>Digby,</hi> and got
thence with the very same tricke
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102656:83"/>
Sir <hi>Francis Michell</hi> said, he got out
of the Inquisition at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is all the fault laid on <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes</hi>
false play and unfaithfulnesse
to his Master, and combining with
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and by this peece of
service expressing his hatred to the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> for his owne ends (the
Subjects of <hi>England</hi> having ever na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
hated them) <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
the most hated man then living,
from an accused man in the former
Parliament, came to be the very
darling of this Parliament, and a
favourite to the whole Kingdome,
which after King <hi>James</hi> his death he
as soone lost againe, (so inconstant
are the multitude.)</p>
            <p>In the Banquetting-house before
both Houses of Parliament, is <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
to give an account of this
voyage, which he did at large, and
to every full point as a further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
he saith, how say you
Sir? to which the Prince answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>I, yea, or yes,</hi> and through all his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102656:83"/>
discourse laboured to make <hi>Bristoll</hi>
as hatefull to this Parliament, as
himselfe had been to the former:
which, had these things delivered
by him, and attested by the Prince,
been truths; he had justly deserved
death, the accusations were foule,
and little lesse then treason, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any legislative power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Digby</hi> had some friends who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
sent this Declaration into
<hi>Spaine, Digby</hi> acquaints that King,
takes his leave of him for <hi>England:</hi>
that King sets his danger before
him, offers if he will stay with him,
seeing it is for his sake he is like to
suffer, he would make him much
greater in Honour and fortune then
his Master can doe; <hi>Digby</hi> gives him
thankes, but sayes, he served so just
a Master that would not condemne
him unheard, and should he, yet he
had much rather suffer under inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
then lye under the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a false accusation of a fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and Traytor, for the highest
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102656:84"/>
preferment in the World.</p>
            <p>Away therefore comes he, puts
himselfe into a desperate passage,
least the Parliament should have
been dissolved before his comming,
and so no place or meanes left him
for his defence, but must lye under
those false calumnies, and was here
(as the Prince came into <hi>Spaine</hi>)
sooner then either looked for, or
welcome.</p>
            <p>Into the Parliament comes he,
with his Hat full of papers, where
he puts himselfe upon this point,
that if there were one syllable true
that <hi>Buckingham</hi> had delivered, if
this (holding up a Paper in his
hand) be a true copy; I will yeeld
my selfe guilty of all treasons can
be laid to my charge, and said, these
papers, (pointing to his Hat) shall
make it manifest: Besides, some of
them shall make <hi>Buckingham</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
a very monster in his lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
carriages, too too unchaste for
the eares of this Honourable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102656:84"/>
               <hi>Bristoll</hi> was instantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
close prisoner to the Tower
for a contempt; the next day hee
was riding through Cheap-side in
his Coach, by which it appeares
<hi>Buckinghams</hi> power was in: the
wane with his old Master, his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and accusation being scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and false; nor ever durst hee
bring <hi>Bristol</hi> to any further tryall.</p>
            <p>Whether this wound was deeper
given by <hi>Bristol</hi> to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> or
the Prince, I will leave to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to judge, and will not my selfe
determine; And how <hi>Bristol</hi> hath
since stood in favour with the
Prince, since he was King, may give
a conjecture, that he tooke it as a
wound to himselfe, I am sure it was
an ill omen, and hath since given him
lesse credit with his Subjects.</p>
            <p>And in this Parliament doth
<hi>Buckingham</hi> by his under-hand Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and Agents,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cranfield</hi> accused in parliament</note> accuse <hi>Cranfield</hi>
the Lord Treasurer, in which the
Prince also shewes himselfe: <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:102656:85"/>
was so hated a fellow for his
insolency, that a small accusation
would serve the turne, as this truly
was, had his care of expending the
Kings Treasure been out of a true
zeale: for it should seeme that the
Prince sending for monies, <hi>Cranfield</hi>
restrained his Expresse, using some
words, that the journey it selfe was
foolishly undertaken, and now must
be maintained by prodigality, in
which the Revenue of the Kingdom
would not satisfie their vast expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
if this had been spoken out of
a Noble minde, or out of that feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had of the Kingdomes mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(as being Treasurer he ought to
have done) had he fallen, it had
been with honour and a generall
compassion, but being spoken out
of the pride and insolency of his
owne heart, whose minde was ever
so base, as never to discerne what
Honour was, nor ever had he any
other inherent Honour then what
in his Apprentiship he raked out of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102656:85"/>
the Kennel; besides it was knowne
to be out of hatred, that he was not
of councell in the undertaking, he
then looking at himselfe as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
States-man of all the Councell:
He fell without pitty, and with
much scorne, as I formerly set
downe; yet left in a higher estate,
and better condition then so worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
a fellow, and base Projector
deserved, yet afterwards hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
questioned upon his accounts:
But all this was nothing, himselfe,
and his Posterity being left Peeres
of the Realme.</p>
            <p>In this case was the Prince a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
actour, and did duly keep the
earliest houres to sit in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where, then he discerned so
much juggling even to serve his
owne ends on <hi>Cranfield,</hi> that it was
not much to be wondred at, being
come to be King, he did not affect
them: And it was not well that a
Prince should shew so much spleen,
though <hi>Cranfield</hi> deserved any ill
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102656:86"/>
could be cast on him, and who
knowes whether God doth now
punish by Tallion Law, to call his
owne sin to remembrance, and to
repent?</p>
            <p>In this place I hold it not unfit to
shew the Reader how the King hath
ever been abused, and would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused,
by over-much credulity, in
the treaty of <hi>Spaine</hi> for marriages,
as well as in all other Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>You shall now perceive how the
King was abused in this treaty,
which was an error inexcusable, in
himselfe and whole Councell. The
<hi>Italians</hi> having a Proverbe, <hi>He that
deceives me once, its his fault, but if
twice, its my fault:</hi> this second time
therefore could not but be the only
fault of the King and Councell.</p>
            <p>In Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his life time, the
King had a little man, but a very
great and wise Counsellour, his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State, little <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
that great States-man, who did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102656:86"/>
all his Fathers wisdome, as
well as his Offices, and the sonne
came little short of the father, who
was held the greatest States-man in
the world, of his time. It is true,
that one State may abuse another,
but, not to finde out the abuse, is
an unpardonable fault in any States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>There was a treaty in the like
case for Prince <hi>Henry, Salisbury</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
discovered the juggling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any other did thinke of any, for
although it went forward current<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet did <hi>Salisbury</hi> so put the Duke
of <hi>Lerma</hi> unto it, that either it must
be so, or they must confesse their
juggling.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> denyed that
ever there had been any treaty, or
any intention from that State; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi>
sent for the Embassadour to
a full Councell, told him how hee
had abused the King &amp; State, about
a treaty for Marriage, which he had
no Commission for; that therefore
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102656:87"/>
he was lyable to the Lawes of our
Kingdome; for where any Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
doth abuse a State by their
Mrs. Commission, then the servant
was freed; but without Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was culpable and lyable to be
punished by the Lawes of that
State, as being disavowed to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the King his Master: The
Embassadour answered gravely, he
did not understand the cause of his
comming, therefore was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared
to give any answer, but on
Monday he would againe come, this
being Saturday, and give his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
On Monday he comes, begins
with these words, My <hi>soule is my
Gods, my life my Masters, my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
my owne, I will not forfeit the first
and last, to preserve the second;</hi> Then
layes downe his Commission, and
Letters of instruction, under the
Duke of <hi>Lerma's</hi> owne hand: he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
himselfe honestly to this
State, yet lost his owne, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
sent for home, where he lived
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102656:87"/>
and dyed in disgrace. Here was <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatus
vir bonus peregrè missus, sed non
ad mentiendum reipublicae causa:</hi> And
had we had as honest and good
Statesmen, in after times (as <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
was, and so demonstrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in this weighty Affaire) this
State could not have been so abused
in all Treaties.</p>
            <p>By this you see the advantage and
benefit of one wise Counsellour in
a whole State; and although <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
say, By the multitude of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
doth a kingdome flourish,
yet surely he intended they should
be wise men that are Counsellours;
for we had such a multitude of
Counsellours, that a longer table,
and a larger Counsell-chamber was
provided, yet our State was so far
from flourishing, that it had been
almost utterly destroyed; this was
the last Statesman worthy of that
name; and now are the ancient stock
of Statesmen decayed, and with
them all our honour and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:102656:88"/>
I shall now bring my Story to an
end, as I shall this Kings life; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I have made some digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet all pertinent to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of this Kings reigne.</p>
            <p>He now goes to his last Hunting
journey, I meane the last of the
yeare, (as wel as of his life) which
he ever ended in Lent; and was sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
on by an ordinary and moderate
Tertian Ague, which at that season,
according to the Proverb, was Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
for a King, but it proved not
so to him; and poore King, what
was but Physick to any other, was
made mortall to him! yet not the
Ague, as himselfe confessed to a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of his now living, who cryed,
courage Sir, this is but a small fit,
the next will be none at all, at which
he most earnestly looked, and said,
Ah, it is not the Ague afflicteth me,
but the black plaister and powder
given me, and laid to my stomack;
and in truth, the plaister so tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, that he was glad to have it
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102656:88"/>
pulled off, &amp; with it the skin also; nor
was it faire dealing, if he had faire
play (which himselfe suspected)
often saying to <hi>Montgomery,</hi> whom
he trusted above all men, in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
for Gods sake, looke I have
faire play) to bring in an Emprick,
to apply any Medicines, whilst those
Physitians appointed to attend him,
were at dinner; nor could any but
<hi>Buckingham</hi> answer it with lesse
then his life at that present, as he
had the next Parliament, had it not
been dissolved upon the very que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning
him for the Kings death,
and all those that prosecuted him,
utterly disgraced and banished the
Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buckingham</hi> comming into the
Kings Chamber, even when he was
at the point of death, and an honest
servant of the Kings crying: <hi>Ah my
Lord, you have undone us, all his poore
servants, although you are so well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you need not care:</hi> At which, <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
kickt at him, who caught
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102656:89"/>
his foot, and made his head first
come to ground, where <hi>Buckingham</hi>
presently rising, run to the dying
Kings bed side, and cryed, <hi>Justice,
Sir, I am abused by your servant, and
wrongfully accused;</hi> at which the
poore King (become by that time
speechlesse) mournfully fixed his eies
on him, as who would have said, not
wrongfully.</p>
            <p>It were worth the knowledge,
what his confession was, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expressions he made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or any other; but that was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to the dead Arch-Bishop
<hi>Abbot,</hi> and the Bishop <hi>Williams</hi> then
also Lord Keeper, and it was
thought <hi>Williams</hi> had blabbed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which incensed the Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and <hi>Buckinghams</hi> hatred so
much against him, that the losse
of his place could not be expiatory
sufficient, but his utter ruine must
be determined, and that not upon
any knowne crime, but upon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
aud examinations, to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102656:89"/>
pick out faults, committed in his
whole life time; but his greatest
crime for the present, (no question)
was <hi>lapsus linguae,</hi> but <hi>quod defertur
non aufertur,</hi> for although he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by the calme of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet is he more ruined by this
Parliament, and his owne folly; and
truly we may observe the just
Judgement of God on him, for fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Parliament his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
to give wicked counsell to
the King, his former prosecutor.</p>
            <p>And now have I brought this great
Kings Reigne to an end, in a volant
discourse, and shall give you his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in briefe, and so leave him in

            <head>THE
CHARACTER
OF
KING JAMES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Kings Character is much
easier to take then hi Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
for he could never
be brought to sit for the taking of
that, which is the reason of so few
good peeces of him; but his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
was obvious to every eye.</p>
            <p>He was of a middle stature, more
corpulent through his cloathes then
in his body, yet fat enough, his
cloathes ever being made large and
easie, the Doublets quilted for ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letto
proofe, his Breeches in great
pleits and full stuffed: Hee was
naturally of a timorous disposition,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102656:90"/>
which was the reason of his quilted
Doublets: His eyes large, ever row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
after any stranger came in
his presence, insomuch, as many for
shame have left the roome, as being
out of countenance: His Beard was
very thin: His Tongue too large
for his mouth, which ever made
him speak full in the mouth, and
made him drink very uncomely, as
if eating his drink, which came out
into the cup of each side of his
mouth: His skin was as soft as Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feta
Sarsnet, which felt so, because
hee never washt his hands, onely
rubb'd his fingers ends slightly
with the wet end of a Napkin:
His Legs were very weake, having
had (as was thought) some foul play
in his youth, or rather before he
was born, that he was not able to
stand at seven years of age, that
weaknesse made him ever leaning
on other mens shoulders, his walke
was ever circular, his fingers ever in
that walke sidling about his Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102656:91"/>
He was very temperate in
his exercises, and in his dyet, and
not intemperate in his drinking,
however in his old age, and <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
joviall Suppers, when he had
any turne to doe with him, made
him sometimes overtaken, which
he would the very next day remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and repent with teares; it is
true, he dranke very often, which
was rather out of a custom then any
delight, and his drinks were of that
kind for strength, as Frontiniack,
Canary, High Country wine, Tent
Wine, and Scottish Ale, that had
he not had a very strong brain, might
have daily been overtaken, although
he seldom drank at any one time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
four spoonfulls, many times
not above one or two; He was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
constant in all things (his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
excepted) in which he loved
change, yet never cast down any (he
once raised) from the height of
greatnesse, though from their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nearnesse, and privacy; unlesse
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102656:91"/>
by their own default, by opposing his
change, as in <hi>Somersets</hi> case: yet had he
not been in that foul poysoning busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
and so cast down himself; I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
beleeve not him neither; for
al his other Favorites he left great in
Honour, great in Fortune; and did
much love <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him more at the very last gaspe,
then at the first minute of his Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteship:
In his Dyet, Apparrell,
and Journeys, he was very constant;
in his Apparrell so constant, as by
his good wil he would never change
his cloathes untill worn out to very
ragges: His Fashion never: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as one bringing to him a Hat
of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Block, he cast it from him,
swearing he neither loved them nor
their fashions. Another time, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him Roses on his Shooes, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
if they would make him a ruffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed-Dove?
one yard of six pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ribbond served that turn: His
Dyet and Journies was so constant,
that the best observing Courtier of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102656:92"/>
our time was wont to say, were he
asleep seven yeares, and then awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he would tell where the King
every day had been, and every dish
he had had at his Table.</p>
            <p>Hee was not very uxorious,
(though he had a very brave Queen
that never crossed his designes, nor
intermedled with State affaires, but
ever complyed with him (even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the nature of any, but of a
milde spirit) in the change of Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;)
for he was ever best, when
furthest from his Queene, and
that was thought to be the first
grounds of his often removes, which
afterwards proved habituall. He
was unfortunate in the marriage of
his Daughter, and so was all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
besides; but sure the
Daughter was more unfortunate in
a Father, then he in a Daughter:
He naturally loved not the sight of
a Souldier, nor of any valiant man;
and it was an observation that Sir
<hi>Robert Mansell</hi> was the only valiant
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102656:92"/>
man he ever loved, and him he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so intirely, that for all <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
greatnesse with the King, and
his hatred of Sir <hi>Robert Mansell,</hi> yet
could not that alienate the Kings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
from him; insomuch as
when by the instigation of <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
(then Embassadour in <hi>Spaine</hi>) by
<hi>Buckinghams</hi> procurement, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Embassadour came with a great
complaint against Sir <hi>Robert Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi>
then at <hi>Argiers,</hi> to suppresse the
Pirats, That he did support them;
having never a friend there, (though
many) that durst speake in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
the King himselfe defended
him in these words: <hi>My Lord Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour,
I cannot beleeve this, for I
made choyce my selfe of him, out of these
reasons; I know him to be valiant, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and Nobly descended as most in
my Kingdome, and will never beleeve a
man thus qualified will doe so base an
act.</hi> He naturally loved honest men,
that were not over active, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
loved any man heartily untill he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102656:93"/>
had bound him unto him by giving
him some suite, which he thought
bound the others love to him again;
but that argued a poore disposition
in him, to beleeve that any thing
but a Noble minde, seasoned with
vertue, could make any firme love
or union, for mercinary mindes are
carried away with a greater prize,
but Noble mindes, alienated with
nothing but publick disgraces.</p>
            <p>He was very witty, and had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ready witty jests as any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
at which he would not smile
himselfe, but deliver them in a grave
and serious manner: He was very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall,
of what he had not in his
owne gripe, and would rather part
with 100. <hi>li.</hi> hee never had in his
keeping, then one twenty shillings
peece within his owne custody: He
spent much, and had much use of his
Subjects purses, which bred some
clashings with them in Parliament,
yet would alwayes come off, and
end with a sweet and plausible
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102656:93"/>
close; and truly his bounty was not
discommendable, for his raising Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
was the worst: Rewarding
old servants, and releiving his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country-men, was infinitely
more to be commended in him, then
condemned. His sending Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
were no lesse chargeable then
dishonourable and unprofitable to
him and his whole Kingdome; for
he was ever abused in all Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet hee had rather spend
100000. <hi>li.</hi> on Embassies, to keep or
procure peace with dishonour, then
10000. <hi>li.</hi> on an Army that would
have forced peace with honour: He
loved good Lawes, and had many
made in his time, and in his last Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
for the good of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and suppressing Promoters, and
progging fellowes, gave way to
that <hi>Nullum tempus, &amp;c.</hi> to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

beneficiall to the Subjects in respect

that would make daily so bold with

            <p>He ever desired to prefer meane
men in great places, that when he
turned them out again, they should
have no friend to bandy with them:
And besides, they were so hated by
being raised from a meane estate, to
over-top all men, that every one
held it a pretty recreation to have
them often turned out: There were
living in this Kings time, at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
two Treasurers, three Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
two Lord Keepers, two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralls,
three Lord chief Justices,
yet but one in play, therefore this
King had a pretty faculty in putting
out and in: By this you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in what his wisdome consisted,
but in great and weighty affaires e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at his wits end.</p>
            <p>He had a trick to cousen himselfe
with bargains under hand, by taking
1000. <hi>li.</hi> or 10000. <hi>li.</hi> as a bribe,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102656:95"/>
when his Counsell was treating
with his Customers to raise them
to so much more yearly; this went
into his Privy purse, wherein hee
thought hee had over-reached the
Lords, but cousened himselfe; but
would as easily breake the bargaine
upon the next offer, saying, he was
mistaken and deceived, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no reason he should keep the
bargaine; this was often the case
with the Farmers of the Customes;
He was infinitely inclined to peace,
but more out of feare then consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and this was the greatest ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
this King had through all his
Reign, otherwise might have been
ranked with the very best of our
Kings, yet sometimes would hee
shew pretty flashes of valour which
might easily be discerned to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
not naturall; and being forced,
could have wished, rather, it would
have recoiled backe into himselfe,
then carryed to that King it had
concerned, least he might have been
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102656:95"/>
put to the tryall, to maintaine his
seeming valour.</p>
            <p>In a word, he was (take him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and not in peeces) such a King,
I wish this Kingdom have never any
worse, on the condition, not any
better; for he lived in peace, dyed
in peace, and left all his Kingdomes
in a peaceable condition, with his
owne Motto:</p>
            <q>Beati Pacifici.</q>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:102656:96"/>
            <head>The Court of King CHARLES.</head>
            <p>NOw having brought this peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
King to rest in all peace,
the 27th. of <hi>March,</hi> his Son, by the
sound of the Trumpet, was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
King, by the name of CHARLES
the FIRST.</p>
            <p>His Fathers Reign began with a
great Plague, and we have seen what
his Reign was; his Sons with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Plague, and the greatest that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was in these parts; we shall see
what his Reign will be, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of this plague have also hung
as a fatall commet over this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in some parts, and over <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
in more particular, ever since:
and we earnestly pray we may not
fall into the hands of men, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ever with that divinely inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
royall Prophet <hi>David,</hi> that we
fall into the hand of the Lord (for
his mercies are great.)</p>
            <p>This King was not Crowned with
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102656:96"/>
that solemnity all other Kings have
formerly been, by riding through
the City in all state, although the
same Triumphs were provided for
him, as sumptuous as for any other;
this, some have taken as an ill omen:
Its further reported (which I will
not beleeve) that he tooke not the
ususall Oath all our Kings were
bound unto at their Coronation,
and its to be read in <hi>Covells</hi> book, if
so, sure its a worse omen.</p>
            <p>One more observation is, of this
King, which I remember not to have
happened in any other Kingdom, I
am confident never in this; That
with him did also rise his Fathers
Favourite, and in much more glory
and luster then in his Fathers time,
as if he were no lesse an inheritor of
his Sons favours, than the Sonne of
the Fathers Crowne, and this, as it
happened, was the worst omen of
all; for, whereas in the Fathers
time, there was some kinde of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
by reason he was weary of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102656:97"/>
the insolency of his Favourite; in
the sons time, he reigned like an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
storme, bearing downe all
before him that stood in his way,
and would not yeeld to him or
comply with him: This shewed no
Heroicall or Kingly spirit, for the
King ever to endure him that had
put such scornes and insolent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
on him in his fathers time.</p>
            <p>This King (as his Father did set
in peace) did rise like a <hi>Mars,</hi> as if
he would say, <hi>Arma virum<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> cano,</hi>
and to that end, to make himselfe
more formidable to <hi>Spaine</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> he called a Parliament,
wherein never Subjects expressed
more hearty affections to a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne;
and in truth, were more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
then wise, for, as if for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to welcome him, they gave
him two intire Subsidies, and in so
doing they brake the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and priviledges of Parliament,
which never was wont to give Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies
but as a thankfull gratuity for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102656:97"/>
enacting good Lawes, therefore it
is but Gods justice to repay them
with Talion Lawes, to have their
Priviledges broken, seeing they first
chalked out the way. The King in
requitall of this great love of theirs,
did instantly dissolve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which hath bred such ill
blood in the veines of the Subjects
to their Sovereign, and in the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
to the Subject, that it is like to
produce an epidemicall infection.</p>
            <p>But the occasion taken to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
it was worst of all; for, <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi>
by his insolent behaviour,
had not onely lost that love his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to <hi>Spaine</hi> had procured him,
but was now growne into such an
hatred that they fell on him for the
death of his old Master, which had
been of a long time before but whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered;
but now, the Examinations
bred such confessions, that it looked
with an ugly deformed poysonous
countenance, and nothing but the
dissolution of that Parliament could
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102656:98"/>
have saved his dissolution and that
with a brand of shame and infamy,
as well as of ingratitude.</p>
            <p>I remember I heard a noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
an old Parliament man, of
that Committee for Examinations
say, at first he derided the very
thought of it; but, after the first
dayes Examination it proved so
foule, as that he both hated and
scorned the name and memory of
<hi>Buckingham;</hi> and though man would
not punish it, God would, which
proved an unhappy prediction.</p>
            <p>This dissolving the Parliament
was ill relished by the people, and
that which to them did seeme the
cause, worse, and to make the case
yet fouler, and that it must needs
be the evident cause; <hi>Buckinghams</hi>
Counsels were so stupid and himself
so insolent, that he did thinke it a
glory to disgrace all those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that businesse, in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or that seemed inquisitive
thereafter; and caused many old
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102656:98"/>
Servants of the Kings, he formerly
favoured very much, to be banished
from Court, never to returne more,
nor did they ever, as <hi>Clare, Crofts,</hi> Sir
<hi>Fra. Stewart, &amp;c.</hi> nay Dr. <hi>Cragg,</hi> his
Phisitian, who from his very child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
had the generall repute of a
very honest man, for expressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
like an honest man in the
Kings presence, was instantly dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
never could recover his place or
favour more.</p>
            <p>Now also is <hi>Williams,</hi> Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
turned out of his place, and <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
the Kings Atturney put in, who
(had <hi>Buckingham</hi> lived) had as soon
followed in the same steps.</p>
            <p>Then goes <hi>Buckingham</hi> into <hi>France</hi>
on a stately Embassie for that Lady
the King had seen, and set an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on in his passage to <hi>Spaine,</hi> which
was obtained with small intreaty.</p>
            <p>Now doth <hi>Buckingham</hi> soare so
high both in his Masters favours and
in the pride of his own heart, as he
alters all great Officers, makes war
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102656:99"/>
against <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
only his, voiced to be on strange
grounds, the successe accordingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Navies, Armies, and nothing but
war appeares, as if we intended in
shew to conquer all that opposed.
Lord <hi>Wimbleton</hi> the General, from
whom as little could be expected, as
he performed, carrying a powerfull
Army to <hi>Cales,</hi> after an infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and drinking much <hi>Spanish</hi>
Wines, and beating out the heads
of what they could not drinke, (as
if they intended to overthrow that
yeares trade of <hi>Spanish</hi> Wine) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
as like a valiant Commander,
as he ever was reputed; whereas,
had he brought home those wasted
Wines, it may be they would have
defrayed the charge of that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>After the returne of that wise
Pageantisme, <hi>Denbigh</hi> is sent into
<hi>France</hi> to aide <hi>Rochell,</hi> who managed
it better then his great Kinsman,
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> who would afterwards
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102656:99"/>
needs goe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to doe great exploits,
for he brought his ships and men
safe againe, the other left his men
in powdering tubs, as if he meant
to have them kept sweet against his
next comming thither: In short, this
unhappy voyage lost all the honour
our glorious ancestors had ever got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
over that Nation, there being so
many brave gentlemen wilfully lost,
as if that voyage had been on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
plotted to disable our Nation,
by taking away so many gallant
brave young spirits; so many of our
Colours lost, as Trophies of their
Victory, and of our shame, hung up
in <hi>Nostredame</hi> Church, that the
brave <hi>Talbot,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> with
many other our valiant Ancestors,
will rise up in Judgement against
him, for that every way inglorious
Act. Nay, to how low an ebbe of
honour was this our poore despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Kingdome brought, that (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time the
glory of the World,) a great Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102656:100"/>
being taken prisoner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
released with this farewell given
with him, that they desired but two
English Mastieffes for his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some!</p>
            <p>But the King by that unnecessary
and dishonourable War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was driven
to that exigency for want of money,
that he was forced to pawn his rich
Cupboard of Plate to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
and to send <hi>Cottington</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> (in
a manner) to beg a peace, which
having obtained, it was thought so
great a service of him, that it raised
him to all his Honor and Fortunes.</p>
            <p>Yet (all the while) <hi>Rochell</hi> in
sharpe distresse was left unrelieved,
although otherwise intended, or
but pretended rather. For the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
betwixt the Duke and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Isle of <hi>Ree,</hi> in sending
complements and Presents to each
other, shewed rather an intimate
dearnesse, then any hostility to be
meant between them. And sure I
am, the successe made it apparent,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102656:100"/>
that their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> purpose was no better
than to carry so many goodly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
to the Slaughter-house, and
Powdering-Tub (as even now I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced.)</p>
            <p>Yet was the King so content to
be abused, as publickly at his Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he delivered it for a miracle, that
having such ill successe, there were so
few men lost, for that as many came
home as went forth (as appeared by
the Chequer-Rol) within five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
At which a Gentleman (whose
faithfull Valour prompted him to
speake a truth in season, though
theirs did not them to fight) stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the back of the Kings chair,
said, yea, Sir, as you hear, that hear
very little of Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if you please
to inquire of such as can and dare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
you truly, you shall find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands fewer came home
then went forth: For which relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this honest Tell-troth was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
presently from his Court-Attendance,
which doom he never
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102656:101"/>
could get reverst, wherein you may
behold the Power of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
with the King, whose Word stood
for a Law.</p>
            <p>Which Power of his, grew now
so exorbitant, he aspires to get high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Titles both in Honour and Place,
as, Prince of <hi>Tipperary</hi> (a place so
called in <hi>Ireland</hi>) and Lord High
Constable of <hi>England</hi> (an Office
aimed at by that Monster and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivillian,
<hi>Leicester,</hi> in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
time, but he therein was crossed
and contradicted by the then Lord
Chancellour <hi>Hatton</hi>) now affected
by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who herein wrote
after <hi>Leicesters</hi> ambitious example
but he crossed too (by President)
with <hi>Coventry</hi> now Lord Keeper, and
no question but upon those just
grounds his Predecessor did: For,
you must understand, this Office hath
an Authority annexed unto it, to
call any Subject in question for his
life, by trying, condemning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
him, in despight of the King
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102656:101"/>
himselfe. Nay, some have made no
bones on't to affirme, that (for
misgovernment) the King himselfe
is not exempted from that Officers
Power; Politickly therefore did
the aforementioned <hi>Hatton</hi> (who
well understood the validity of such
a Power) when <hi>Leicesters</hi> Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was in dispute) to tel the Queen
that <hi>his own hand should never strike off
his own head;</hi> which word was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to her who was hereat so wise
as also in all other matters of State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernment,
wherein as she were
hinted to a fore-sight of any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
she knew how to prevent it.
And thus that ended in his time.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Buckinghams</hi> ambition would
not be so bounded; For, upon the
opposing it by <hi>Coventry,</hi> he peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
thus accosted him, saying, who
made you, <hi>Coventry,</hi> Lord Keeper?
he replyed, the King; <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
sur-replyed, Its false, 'twas I did
make you, and you shall know that
I, who made you, can, and will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102656:102"/>
you. <hi>Coventry</hi> thus answered
him; Did I conceive I held my
Place by your Favour, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
unmake my selfe, by rendring
the Seale to his Majesty. Then
<hi>Buckingham</hi> in a scorn and fury flung
from him, saying, you shall not keep
it long. And, surely, had not <hi>Felton</hi>
prevented him, he had made good
his Word.</p>
            <p>And before that hapned, <hi>Weston</hi> was,
by his power, &amp; for his ends; made
Treasurer, it should seem, upon some
assurance from him, that he would
find ways where-out to raise monys
into the Treasury (he judging him to
be one that out of his own necessitous
condition would adventure on any
desperate projection to raise himself,
but yet withall to fill the Chequer
Coffers) who was no sooner war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in his Office, but hee began to
shew his inbred base disposition to
his Rayser, <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as formerly
he had don to <hi>Cranfield,</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his preserver from perishing in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102656:102"/>
a Prison, whence he redeemed him,
making him a free partaker first of
his bounteous Table, then raising him
shortly after to be Chancellour of
the Exchequer; who at length, for
requitall, supplanted him. But
for all this, <hi>Buckingham</hi> feared not,
his high spirit in himselfe and vast
Power with the King were so predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
and unmoveable: He now
therefore used at his owne pleasure
to come to the Counsell Table (he
being then honoured as the Oracle
from whom they gaped for all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers)
but ever made them wait his
comming, and were so tutored to
their duteous observance of him,
that at his approach or returning
thence, they ever must rise as if he
had been the King himselfe. (So
that you may see to what a pretty
passe those great men by their poor
spirits had brought themselves.)</p>
            <p>But on a time, there issued this
amongst other passages of insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
from <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102656:103"/>
into the Councell, without
any other Court-preface, sayes to
the Treasurer <hi>Weston, My Lord, the
King must have</hi> 60000l. <hi>provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
to morrow morning.</hi> The Lords
startled at the mention of such a
sum (the whole Exchequer not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seen within its keeping scarce
1000l. in many yeares) and could
not imagine how, unlesse by the
Philosophers stone, such a sum was
possible to be gotten, but yet all loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on <hi>Weston</hi> (to whom it was in
this case proper to make answer)
who bethought himselfe what
to say (the rest every one, the while,
gazing at each other, another while
againe all at <hi>Weston,</hi> as a man of
great wisdome, for so was hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
(of a Plebejan.) At length,
up he stands, and thus he answers
<hi>Buckingham; My Lord, The Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
is in a deep consumption.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<hi>Buckingham</hi> interrupts him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>How, Sir! You came in to cure
that Consumption, and to restore it to its
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102656:103"/>
usefull plenitude. I remember you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
(like a Mountebanke) when you
were to be invested by the King, you
would do so, therefore, Sir, see you the
money be provided, otherwise you shall
hear further of it.</hi> With that high
strain hee rose up and departed.</p>
            <p>Now, are all ways indeavoured to
get mony from the Subjects, which
was not to be gotten by fair means,
the King having tryed all the shifts
which any former Prince (out of the
Parliamentary way) had ever don,
and had great sums brought in, such
as none of his Predecessors ever had;
of which, one was the Royall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy,
every man lending as much as
the summe in the Subsidy towards
which he was assessed: as if (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
assessed at 40. <hi>li.</hi> besides so
much payd, he lent also 40. <hi>li.</hi> and
so from the least to the greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
assessed.</p>
            <p>Yet all this would not serve him,
but that quickly vanished, then all
other faire meanes proving (as was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102656:104"/>
thought for their profusenesse) too

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant and slow; Force then must
be the last remedy; the King must
keep standing Garrisons to awe his
good Subjects, and they consisting
too of strangers not of Natives, To
that end, one <hi>Dalbier</hi> (that had
been Generall of Count <hi>Mansfield</hi>
Horse) is dealt with for the raising
of 1000 or 2000 <hi>German</hi> Horse, the
most whereof to bee quartered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Gravesend</hi> and <hi>London;</hi> For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
of which service, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Balfore</hi> (as great a Servant and
Confident he is now of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament)
was sent to <hi>Hamborough</hi>
with 30000. <hi>l.</hi> to buy and to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
those Horse with their impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Riders, and Furniture, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them ready to bee imbarked,
it should seeme they were told by
the way, by some well affected to
<hi>England,</hi> that the King had not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to continue them in Pay; and
Plunder they could not there, for
they should be so invironed with
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102656:104"/>
Sea, that there was no flying, but
they must expect to have all their
throats cut, if they took any thing
from any man: Upon which, those
Rascals, out of feare, not conscience,
refused to come over. However,
<hi>Balfore</hi> so wel lickt his fingers in that
employment, as that he therewith
laid the foundation of his future
fortunes; yet, if this Parliament
consider well this action of his,
there is no reason he should be so
deare unto them: For, of any thing
yet toucht upon against any man by
this Parliament, I dare affirme this
(of his) to be the greatest peece of
villany, and to be the nearest way to
render us all slaves, and to make us
have neither propriety in our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
Wives, nor Children. And
yet was this <hi>Balfore</hi> a principall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detaker,
and actor in this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
designe, and (perhaps for that
very cause) the greatest creature of
<hi>Buckinghams</hi> that ever was.</p>
            <p>In this intervall, their shifts not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102656:105"/>
avayling them; (to see therefore if
by this faire means their ends might
be obtained) another Parliament
was summoned, wherein after some
expostulations on both sides, there
proved no better a good speed and
successe then a meere frustration of
all hopes on both hands; which for
the Kings part, hee apprehended
with so great aversnesse, that, as
'twas said, he made a vow never to
call more Parliaments.</p>
            <p>Forreigne Forces, and fraudulent
and faire devices home-spun, failing,
all; now must Projects in all their
variegated inventions bee (set on
foot; to which sage (or rather ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
purpose, one <hi>Noy,</hi> a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Lawyer as ever this Kingdome
bred, and (formerly) a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot,
and the only searcher of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
for the Parliaments; by
which he grew so cunning as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
all the shifts which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Kings had used to get monies
with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:102656:105"/>
This man the King sends for, tels
him, he wil make him his Attorney
<hi>Noy</hi> (like a true Cynick as he was)
for that time went away, not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the King so much as the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
of a Thankes; nor, indeed,
was it worth his thankes, I am sure
he was not worthy of ours. For, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Court sollicitings had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
him to become the Kings,
he grew the most hatefull man that
ever lived. And its to me a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that <hi>this Parliament of Wonders</hi>
doth not enact a Law, that his very
name should never more be in this
Kingdome, he having been as great
a Deluge to this Realme, as the
Flood was to the whole World:
for, he swept away all our Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and in truth hath been the
cause of all these miseries this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
hath since been ingulphed;
whether you consider our Religion,
(he being a great Papist, if not an
Atheist) and the protector of all
Papists, and the raiser of them up
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102656:106"/>
unto that boldnesse they were now
growne unto, who formerly had
some moderation) or, if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Estates and Liberties, they
were impoverished and enthralled,
by multitudes of projects, and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
wayes; this Monster was the
sole Author of all.</p>
            <p>But first, now because there must
be some great man (as a Captaine
Projector) to lead some on, and
hearten others to follow, Sir <hi>George
Goring</hi> leads up the March and
Dance with the Monopolie of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
and Licensing of Tavernes,
setting some up, where, and as many
as he pleased, and this done by a
Seale appendicular to an Office e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by him for that purpose, as if
authorised by a Law; besides all
this, hee hath Pensions out of
the pretermitted Customs: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as I have heard it most credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
reported, that his Revenue was
9000. <hi>l. per annum,</hi> all of these
kindes; and for this peece of good
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102656:106"/>
service he was made a Lord, and
Privy Councellour, to countenance
his traine of Projectors the better.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Weston</hi> enhance the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
and laid new and heavyer
impositions on all things exported
or imported; with such unconscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
rates upon Tobacco, that
millions of pounds of it lay rotting
in the Custome-house (the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
refusing to pay the Custome)
besides losse of all other charges for
the Tobacco it selfe. In short, there
was not any thing (almost) that
any man did eate, drinke, or weare,
or had in his house from forraigne
parts, or scarce any domesticke
commodities exempted, but he paid
as it were, an Excise for it; yea, at
last, even Cards and Dice escaped
not, but they were monopolized by
a great Councellour, the Lord <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington:</hi>
yea, (to keep their hands in
ure) they got Patents for the very
Rags, Marrow-bones, Guts, and
such like Excrements, as were
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102656:107"/>
thought of no use but to be cast on
the Dunghils; and he was held the
bravest Common-wealths man
that could bring in the most money,
(yet, the Kings private Purse, or
publick Treasury little or nothing
bettered, but) to impoverish and vex
the Subject, and to no other end; for
which he was ordinarily rewarded
with honour.</p>
            <p>This good service (the quite
contrary way) did <hi>Weston</hi> and <hi>Noy</hi>
doe for the King; and, I beleeve
you shall see God reward them and
their posterity; for the one, like a
<hi>Jonas</hi> Gourd sprang up suddenly
from a beggerly estate to much
Honour, and great Fortunes, will
shortly wither; the other, his Son
and Heire was killed in <hi>France,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after his death, and when
both are dead, let their names and
memory rot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be extinct from
the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>Now doth <hi>Buckingham</hi> provide
for another forraigne Enterprise,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102656:107"/>
(but carried so close, I could never
learne what it was; nor did any
wise men much inquire after it,
assuring themselves that such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
could produce no better effects
than those former.) In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
yea even at the very entrance
thereunto, he did so stinke in the
Nostrils of God and Man, that God
made one <hi>Felton</hi> his Instrument to
take such a Monster (as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed)
from his longer domineering
amongst men, by a blow as feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as strange, after which he had
not time to say, <hi>Lord have mercy
on him;</hi> a just judgement on him
that forsooke God, to seeke to the
Devill by Witches, and Sorcerers
in his life; one whereof was Doctor
<hi>Lamb</hi> (who was his great defensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
preserver as he thought him)
whose fate it was to be brained by
a Shoo-makers Last when he least
look'd for it; the other was stabb'd
the next morning after that night
he had caused a Fellow to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102656:108"/>
(not suffering him to have that
nights respite (after his sentence,
and offence (what ere it was) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
him of his sins) with this vow,
<hi>he would neither eate nor drinke untill
he see him dye;</hi> God, in requitall of
his mercilesse cruelty, would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffer him to eate nor drinke
before he dyed, by that dismall
stroake of a poore tenpenny knife,
of the said <hi>Feltons</hi> setting home:
Thus neare alike in time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
were these two hellish Agents
Catastrophees. And now is set that
great Sun (or rather portendous
Comet) from whose influences all
the Officers and Ministers had by
reflexion their life and heat.</p>
            <p>After his death, the very name of
a Favourite dyed with him, none
singly engrossing the Kings eare and
favour; but, a regular motion was
set to all Officers, as appertained to
their severall places; as, to the
Arch-Bishop, the mannagement
and chiefe super-intendency of the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102656:108"/>
Church; to the Lord Treasurer, the
Exchequer and the Customs; to
the Lords, Keepers of the Great
and Privie Seales, what belonged to
equity; to the Judges, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to Law, so that (one would
have thought) all things now went
so just and equall, and in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Channell, as none but might
now expect from that new and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
government halcyon dayes.</p>
            <p>But, it far'd farre otherwise,
(God being angry at the Nations
sins, the generall juggling of the
State was one, and a great one) all
those procedures being but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
righteous, nothing really
so: but, like the Apples of <hi>Sodome,</hi>
faire in shew, rotten and corrupt
within. For, now instead of the
late (but one) Favourite, every
great Officer, and Lord of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
proved a very Tyrant; and it
appeared, that not their vertues, but
the former Favourites power only
did restraine them from being so;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102656:109"/>
for, that falling (together with
himselfe, as you have heard) and
they left to their owne Arbitrary
power; you would verily have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
that Hell had been broke
loose: And to make good that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,
one of the Councell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being
told by a Gentleman, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was much troubled at a certaine
great grievance, replyed, <hi>Doth that
trouble them? by God, there are seaven
worse Devills to be shortly let out amongst
them.</hi> And (in sober sadnesse) they
all might truly have undergone the
name of <hi>Legion,</hi> for, they were all
<hi>many Devills,</hi> and (like true, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills)
tooke pleasure in tormenting.
So that hereby may be perceived,
the Kingdome in generall had no
benefit (though some particular
men, as <hi>Weston</hi> Treasurer, <hi>Coventry</hi>
Lord Keeper, and all such as paid
his beggerly kindred Pensions,
which now were ceased) by this
mans death, whose purpose 'twas to
have turn'd out of place both <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:102656:109"/>
and <hi>Weston,</hi> (before his last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
voyage.) But, now did <hi>Weston</hi>
begin to be more cruell in Pride
and Tyranny than <hi>Buckingham</hi> had
been before him, and, (had not the
Arch-Bishop (<hi>Laud</hi>) ballanced him)
he would have been more insuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
He cheated the King in the
sale of Timber, and of Land, and
in the letting of his Customs, the
Arch-Bishop notwithstanding truly
informing the King thereof; <hi>Weston</hi>
was so mad at the thought of it, he
would often say to his friends (in
private) <hi>That little Priest would Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize
the Kings eare, for he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
whispering to the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now begin the Councel Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the Star-Chamber, and High
Commission to bee Scourges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
Tortures of the Commonwealth,
by Imprisonments, and Mutilations
of Members; and were made, (some
of them) by sinings, the greatest
incomes to the Exchequer; and, in
truth, did now put down the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102656:110"/>
Laws deciding of <hi>Meum</hi> and
<hi>Tuum.</hi> And if any (desiring to appeal
from them) refused to stand there
to their censures, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
untill they would submit
thereunto. If men sent unto by
them for money, refused it, they
would imprison them till they
would give or lend, and if any were
summoned thither they had a mind
to quarrell with, in whom they
could not find a fault, they would
make one, by saying, <hi>the Gentleman
laughs at us:</hi> Or, the Gentleman saith
thus, and thus; it may be that hee
had not in his thought, and yet
there should not want a false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
for, some Lords that sat with
their backs towards them, or so
farre off that they could not heare,
yet would testifie either the words
or actions; or, for want of this, a
Clerk of the Councell should bee
called to witnesse, who, for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
must swear what any Lord said:
If they hit not upon that trick, then
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102656:110"/>
sometimes they would contrive to
put a Gentleman into passion by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him some disgracefull name, or
by scoffing at him; so that, indeed,
the Councell Table was growne
more like a Pasquil then a grave Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
But if the spirit of the man wer
such, that he could not take those
indignities without some regret, it
was well for him, if he escaped with
imprisonment, and not called <hi>Ore
tenus</hi> to the Star-Chamber, and fined
(as many were) to his undoing, for
to that point were now the Fines of
that Court risen.</p>
            <p>As for the High Commission-Court,
that was a very (<hi>Spanish</hi>-like)
Inquisition, in which all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and tyrannizings over our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and Consciences were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as were in the other over our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and Bodyes.</p>
            <p>Then were the Judges so much
their Servants or rather Slaves; that
what ere they illegally put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
they found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Law to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:102656:111"/>
But, that which is a wonder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all wonders is, that <hi>Coventry,</hi>
who formerly had gained the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a just and honest man, was a
principall in all these miscarriages,
yet dyed he unquestioned; when,
had his actions been scanned by a
Parliament (in that they were not,
you may see what opinion is, which
in the multitude blindeth the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
he had been found as foul
a man as ever lived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finch,</hi> a fellow (of an excellent
tongue but not of one dram of Law,
made (for all that) Cheife Justice
of the Common-Pleas (the onely
Court most learned in the Law; yet
he brought all the learned Judges,
except two only (<hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Crook</hi>)
to be of his illegall opinion for ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
This surely, must be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
from God on them, and
us for our sins, otherwise it had been
impossible so many grave Iudges
should have been over-ruled by such
a slight and triviall fellow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:102656:111"/>
Now also all Officers in all places
took what Fees they pleased, as if in
a Iubilee; Amongst the rest those
of the Star-Chamber, the Councell
Table, and the High Commission
were very Grandees: Yea, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Messengers (to them) were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
in their abuse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultings
over the Gentry (when in
their clutches:) and to such a strange
passe were disorders come unto, that
every Lacquey of those great Lords
might give a Check-Mate to any
Gentleman, yea, to any Country
Nobleman, that was not in the Court
favour.</p>
            <p>And to fill full the measure of the
times abounding iniquity, the Court
Chaplines (and others elsewhere)
with the Reverend Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
did preach away our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and proprieties, yet kept they
Divinity enough for their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests:
for, they concluded, all
was either Gods or the Kings, their
part belonged to God, in which
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102656:112"/>
the King had no propriety: Our
part belonged wholly to the King,
in which we had propriety no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when the King were disposed to
call for them, so that, betwixt the
Law and the Gospel, we were eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of Lands, Liberties, and Lives
at pleasure.</p>
            <p>And now is Gods time come to
visit with his Iustice; and behold
it: For, the pit they digged for
others they themselves are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
for all their Honours, Lands
and Liberties are a gasping (and the
Iudges are but in very little better
case) for, the Parliament will doe
that to them by the Law, which
they would have done to us by wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But, what needed all that joy for
the death of <hi>Buckingham!</hi> Sith the
times succeeding him, have been so
infinitely beyond him in all oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as they are like to bring all
manner of miseries both upon King
&amp; people: So that in truth, his Hydra's
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102656:112"/>
head being struck downe, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
more instead thereof appeared,
which never durst, in his life time:
And as he got much by Suites, so
did <hi>Weston,</hi> much, by cheating (yet
all came out of the Subjects purses)
and <hi>Coventry</hi> (that so generally a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
honest man) got such an estate
by Bribery and In-justice, that he is
said to have left a Family worth a
Million; Which may commend his
Wisdome, but in no wise his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.</p>
            <p>And now also dies <hi>Weston,</hi> after
he had first brought in (as, you may
remember, I told you, himselfe was
by <hi>Cranfield</hi>) Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi>
(after Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi>) the active
manager of the State, and sole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the King.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Strafford,</hi> without doubt,
was the ablest Minister that this
Kingdome had since <hi>Salisburies</hi> time;
and to speak uprightly, there was not
any but himselfe worthy of that
name, amongst all the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102656:113"/>
yet, I am confident, by the
weaknesse of that Boord, his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in State affaires were judged
more then they were; and besides,
that very word of States-man was
now grown a stranger to our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Nor was he as <hi>Salisbury,</hi> (or our
ancient <hi>Heroes</hi>) a generall States-man,
nor was it possible he should
be, he not having that breeding
himselfe: Nor kept he any upon his
charge in forraigne parts for intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
Nor had he such a Tutor as
the other had of his Father (who was
the most absolute States-man in the
world) whose very Papers (which
were left to this <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as so many rich Presidents, and
Instructors to him) were able (if
wanting in abilities of his own) to
make him an able States-man. But
I held <hi>Straffords</hi> abilities to be more
on this side, then beyond the Seas;
yet, might he challenge the title of
a good Patriot: And so indeed, he
was, before he turned a Courtier;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102656:113"/>
After that, he converted his studies,
and endeavours, to make the King
an absolute Arbitrary Monarch,
by screwing up the Regall Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to so high a strain as hath made
it crack; and by raising his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
so high that he made them fal;
in which also his owne interest was
concerned: For, he did neither serve
God nor the King for nought. Nor
would <hi>Straffords</hi> abilities have been
so transparent, had any such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents
as <hi>Buckhurst, Walsingham,</hi> or
<hi>Hatton</hi> been now living, or such an
one as the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> (who was
<hi>Salisburies</hi> Antagonist.) But this
man had onely the Arch-Bishop
(whose proper Element too, was but
the Church) and they drew both in
one line. And here I shal give you one
note of <hi>Straffords</hi> failing in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-piece,
that he was no such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
wise man (that could not find
the just <hi>Medium</hi> of the peoples Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
but by striving to make the
King all; and on a sudden, he made
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102656:114"/>
the King lesse, and himselfe lesse
then nothing. And, had he beene
wise, he could not but find the Kings
spirit was not to undergoe, nor to
goe through with great actions, but
would faile under them, and crush
the owners: Which he to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
experience hath found
and felt too true. Besides, I much
doubt <hi>Straffords</hi> owne spirit, that,
seeing his wisdom was too short to
protect him, his spirit was so low to
faile him, that hee did not, like
<hi>Sampson,</hi> pull downe the house up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others heads, but fall (like a
tame foole) himselfe alone, caught
in a gin, and lay still without any
fluttering: When, surely, some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Cabinet Councell
were as deep as himselfe in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
            <p>You have here now seene a great
Subject, yea, the greatest that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our eyes beheld, that was no
Favourite, and greater in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
then many Favourites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:102656:114"/>
You have also seen a King, the
greatest that our Nation ever had,
both in Prerogative, Power, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
and the most absolute over
his Subjects; The one fallen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the earth, the other so low
upon earth, that I wish I could but
see him in the same state his peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Father left him, who kept his
Prerogative to the height, without
cracking it, because hee had able
Ministers and Councellors left, who
were of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> stocke;
but this Kings Ministers straine all
so high, that the very ligaments,
and nerves of Sovereignty are quite
broken in sunder; I wish them well
sothered again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But because, if I write further, I
must tune to a much lower key, I
will here end with my prayers;</hi>
That, God would give the King a wise
Councell, and an understanding heart
to bee able to give himselfe Councell
what will be best for himselfe, his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
and the people committed to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102656:115"/>
his Charge: And that hee may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
such as councell him for their own
private ends, and interest, not for his
Honour and Safety.</p>
            <p>And here do I draw a Curtaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the time past, and that to
come in this Kings Reign, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it may never be remembred

leave to present unto your view some
remarkable observations of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
King.</p>
            <p>In his very infancy; he was so
subject to that wilfull humour
(still possessing him) that if
any thing crossed him, he could
hardly be stilled; which then they
were forced to give way unto, by
reason of that extreame weaknesse
which disabled him (as the like
did his Father) untill the 7th. yeare
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102656:116"/>
of his Age, to goe, or scarce to
stand alone; crawling, (when of
himselfe he would be in motion)
upon all foure, in a most unseemly
manner: For the recovery whereof,
he was beholding to the skill of
one Master <hi>Stutavile,</hi> an excellent
Artist for strengthening Limbs, and
straitning crooked Bodies; but, for
the rectifying his wayward disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the tender care of the Lady
<hi>Carey,</hi> afterward Countesse of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This humour of his principally
he tooke from his Mother, who
notwithstanding was a gallant La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
nor was he free from it by the
Fathers side, though his timorous
nature gave it an allay. His Mother
(who loved him so dearly, that she
said, she loved him as she did her
Soul, yet) was wont to say, that she
must with griefe of heart confesse,
<hi>He was a foole, and wilfull, which would
hereafter endanger him the losse of his
Crowne.</hi>

A sad, Censure, yet it should
seeme Propheticall. But, it were a
lesson fit for all Parents learning,
rather to leave their Children to
Gods Providence, than to pry into
his office of fore knowledge.</p>
            <p>He ever exprest an ill nature, by
taking delight to doe ill offices to
his Fathers servants, as well as to his
owne; witnesse that instance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Master <hi>Murrey</hi> his Tutor,
and Doctor <hi>Hackwell</hi> placed about
him, to instruct him in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion, who (rightly)
judging it co-incident to that
his employment, did therefore
(upon the Treaty for the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Match) deliver him a small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
in Manuscript, therein intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his advice and judgement to
informe his Conscience aright, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
coupling himselfe with a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
saying to him, <hi>Sir, I beseech you
make use of this, by reading it your selfe,
but if you shew it to your Father, I shall
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102656:117"/>
be undone for my good will.</hi> The Prince
returned him many thankes, and
assured him, <hi>it should never goe farther
then the cabinet of his owne breast;</hi> but
withall, <hi>he asked him, to whom he had
shewed it? Hackwell</hi> replyed, <hi>the Arch-Bishop</hi>
(Abbot) <hi>hath read it, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
him it, said to him, Well done
thou good and faithfull servant.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
him, he told the Prince, <hi>he had
only shewed it to Mr.</hi> Murrey <hi>the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
who belike being better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his Masters perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
disposition then the other, did
then dis-swade him from delivering
it to the Prince, for, saith he, he will
betray you. And it so fell out, for
within lesse then two houres after
his said engagement to the Doctor,
he presents it to his Father; upon
which, he, or any through whose
hands and cognizance it had passed
before, were all under a disgrace,
and banished the Court (only <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi>
was afterwards Provost of <hi>Eaton.</hi>)
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102656:117"/>
Here was an Embleme of his breach
of Oathes, and protestations in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of his untrustinesse, which
in a subject would have been called
treachery.</p>
            <p>Such a one too he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
in the businesse of <hi>Rochell;</hi>
which, after his faire promises, and
deep imprecations for their reliefe,
and assistance, wherein they put
some confidence, was meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by him; insomuch that when
the <hi>Rochel</hi> Agents found themselves
abused through their whole yeares
attendance, they left this bitter jeere
upon him, that <hi>now they could rightly
call</hi> England <hi>the Land of Promise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He seldome loved any but to
serve his turne, and would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
serve a turne to doe any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
as was to be seene by his
saying Amen to every full point of
<hi>Buckinghams</hi> Accusation in the face
of the Parliament against <hi>Bristol,</hi> for
his miscarriage in <hi>Spaine;</hi> when it
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102656:118"/>
appeared by <hi>Bristols</hi> defence in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
before the face of that same
Parliament, that there was not
scarce one syllable had any truth in
it; who also freely put himself upon
the Test, that if there were any truth
in that combined Accusation against
him, he would yeeld himselfe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it all.</p>
            <p>He was of a very poore spirit,
which may be conceived (amongst
other things) by his making <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
his Privado, after he came
to the Crown; otherwise would he
never have forgotten those unsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
insolencies offered him being
Prince, what they were you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
heard. His Predecessor <hi>Henry</hi>
the fifth (and so his brother <hi>Henry</hi>)
would have instructed him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
for, although (its true) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mindes should forget injuries, so
as not to revenge them, yet so, as
not to countenance the doers of
them, especially to take them into
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102656:118"/>
so much nearnesse and dearnesse as
he did him after those two proud
affronts, which argued in him, as I
said before, a poore and ignoble
spirit.</p>
            <p>He had all his Kingdomes left
in peace and tranquility by his
Father, which he soone after made
a shift to distemper by a foolish
Warre upon <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and
by a more foolish conduct of either
ignorant, unexperienced, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Commanders. And in truth,
if you will give credit to <hi>Vox populi,</hi>
(the Booke so called, written by
one <hi>Scot</hi>) they were suitable to the
grounds of such Quarrels, being no
fairer than the satisfying the beastly
appetite of his Favourite, who must
be reveng'd (forsooth) upon those
States. In which I admire Gods
Justice, that he who unjustly made
War upon unwarrantable grounds,
should have Warre thus brought
home unto him; so that now God
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102656:119"/>
hath given him the same measure he
hath met to others, even full, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
down, and running over.</p>
            <p>I wish I may have a time to give
him a fairer Character when he is
dead, then are my observations in his
life; but I may rather wish then
hope, in that course he yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.</p>

            <head>Certaine observations before
Queene Elizabeths
death.</head>
            <p>I Cannot but admire Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in bringing Peace, when
nothing was thought of but War;
and now bringing a cruell Warre,
when nothing could be expected but
peace: Peace with all forraigne E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
peace at Home. Not long
before the death of Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
all the discourse was in a secret
whispering, on whom the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
would fall; some said, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Arabella,</hi> some the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and reason given <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi>
on both sides; they who were for
her, saying, the Lady <hi>Arabella</hi> was
a Native, and a Maid, and that this
Kingdome never flourished more
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102656:120"/>
then under a Maidens Reigne: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the <hi>Scot,</hi> said, that the
King of <hi>Scots</hi> was more neare to the
Crowne by descent; farther off
say others, as being a Stranger, and
that Nation ever in Hostility against
us. Nor did the King himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
he should have come in with a
sheathed Sword, which appeared
by that Letter he produced of the
Earle of <hi>Northumberlands,</hi> that if he
made any doubt hereof, he would
bring him forty thousand Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
should conduct him into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
But, the Queene dyed, the
King comes in peaceably, even to
the admiration of all Forraigne
Princes, and to the gnashing of
their teeth; but, the reason was,
they had lived in obedience under a
just Sovereigne, who was wont ever
to say, when any great man had
opprest a poore Gentleman that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned
her for redresse against such
oppression, when all the great Lords
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102656:120"/>
and Officers would hold together
to support the Suppressor, and
trample upon the oppressed: <hi>My
Lords</hi> (quoth she) <hi>content you, I am
Queene of the Valleys as well as of the
Hills, and I must not suffer the Hills to
ore-top, nor yet to over-shade the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A worthy saying, which if it
had been imitated by her Successors,
these our miseries had never happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but, I say (and this is it I
now drive at) her Justice made her
Subjects to beleeve there could be
no injustice in Monarchy; and that
was it did facilitate the Kings peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
entrance. In that tranquility
did the Kingdome continue all his
dayes, and about fifteen yeares of
his Sons Reign: when behold, there
was nothing but jollity in the Court,
as if saying to themselves, Who
dares molest us? the King having
now a plentifull Issue; for, let me
tell you, the Kings Issue made Him
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102656:121"/>
and his Courtiers the more to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on the country Gentry. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
when nothing but peace, peace,
sudden destruction came on them,
and us unawares; and God sends
such a War as no man could dreame
of Now the corollary of all is this,
the high injustice of Church and
State was the cause of this Warre.
And, O, may not the continuing of
that, in any other Government prove
the continuance of this war! there
being a farre greater appearance of
the continuance thereof then ever
there was of the beginning:</p>
