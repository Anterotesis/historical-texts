         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſtill upon that <hi>Crambe</hi> of my being onely a <hi>pretended
Agent?</hi> which imputation cannot appeare to the

his <hi>Highneſse</hi> having ſo often iterated by
his Letters to both the Honourable Houſes, as alſo
to divers particular Members of either Houſe (your

<hi>Reſident,</hi> ſtill honouring me in all thoſe Letters with

and I will crowne this verity with a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
unqueſtionable, His Majeſties Royall Letters
ſent me from <hi>Oxford,</hi> confirming under his Hand
and Seale, the priviledges of my place, equall to
thoſe he gave to the greateſt Embaſſadors: So that
in all ſenſe this ridiculous badge of <hi>Pretended,</hi> might
have beene cryed downe long ere this, having no
ground at all to ſubſiſt upon, but the opinion of ſuch
who file their owne dreames upon Record.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, for his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> ſetting out men
of Warre in a maritime way, againſt his Enemy
the French, who in prudence can fault it? he being a
Soveraigne Prince, and in confederacy with the
Catholike King, who gives him the freedome of all
his Ports, as by our laſt Prize taken and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Oſtena</hi> is made manifeſt; So as that fond cavill
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30440:3"/>
muſt be laid downe, in queſtioning his <hi>Highneſs</hi>
right to arme at Sea.</p>
            <p>The particulars of what ſome of his men under
his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> Commiſſion have done in this kind, I
will here ſet downe, and how they have beene treated;
though with a more impartiall penne then I preſume
the Honourable Houſes will receive from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Committee of the Admiralty, which
already hath ſo much ſlighted his <hi>Highneſse,</hi> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſohard a cenſure upon thoſe his Affaires.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Highneſse</hi> ſending for <hi>Ireland</hi> a Ship called the
St. <hi>Carlo,</hi> of 300. Tunne, to tranſport thoſe men
for <hi>Flanders,</hi> which he had levied there, it was taken
by a Parliament man of Warre in the River of <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
and though by Order from his <hi>Highneſſe,</hi> I made
my complaints, yet could I not obtaine of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of the Admiralty any redreſſe; ſo that his
<hi>Highneſſe</hi> loſt that Ship, and by that occaſion his
men alſo, which being tranſported afterwards in a
weaker Veſſell, were taken at Sea by the Hollanders,
preſuming they were to ſerve the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> for
the States of <hi>Holland</hi> are not in Hoſtility with my
Maſter.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Antony</hi> a Flemming, being ſent by
his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to
conduct ſome Souldiers of Colonell <hi>Plunkets</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
which he had levied in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the Dukes
Service, (his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> ſeeing the Spaniard and the
French levie forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> thought it as lawfull
for him ſo to doe as for them) Captaine <hi>Antony</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his <hi>Highneſse</hi> charge bought a Veſſell in <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
in which he imbarked ſome 30 or 40 men for
<hi>Flanders,</hi> but at Sea was taken by a Parliament Ship
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30440:4"/>
and brought Priſoner into <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> no regard
being had to his <hi>Highneſse</hi> Commiſſion which he
ſhewed; There, were his men kept Priſoners for many
weekes on Ship-board, not being permitted to Land;
the Captaine in the meane time got leave to come
up to me to make his complaints, in which I negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as much as poſſible I could, but was ſtill put
off, in the meane time his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> men, ſtill on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
indured extreamity of miſery, being forced
ſomtimes for eight dayes together to drink nothing
but Sea water; In fine, I preſſing that they might
be uſed like Chriſtians, one in office in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of the Admiralty anſwered me, <hi>that he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them no better then doggs:</hi> At the laſt the Captaine
was forced to goe into <hi>Flanders,</hi> there to buy another
Ship to fetch his men away, his <hi>Highneſse</hi> Veſſell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heere ſeaſed upon.</p>
            <p>Theſe were all young Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland,</hi> none of
them above 20 years of age, who had never borne Arms
in that Kingdome, which I often intimated, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would be heard. The poore Youths being moſt
of them Nobly borne, and tenderly bred, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> immediatly dyed upon theſe cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
uſed againſt them.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Highneſſe</hi> having intention to fight his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
the French, in all the Elements he could,
reſolves to ſet up forces alſo by Sea, and having
the freedome of all the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> ports, was
willing to entertaine in that ſervice men of our
Nation, as well as <hi>Dutch, Scots</hi> and <hi>Danes;</hi> whereupon
Captaine <hi>George Grace,</hi> under Commiſſion from his
<hi>Highneſse,</hi> ſetting to Sea, tooke upon the Coaſt of
<hi>France,</hi> a Hanburger richly laden with <hi>French</hi> goods,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30440:4"/>
as wee made to appeare in the Admiralty Court, both
by the Cocket, and Bills of Lading, as by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Hanburger and his fellow Mariners
under their hands; nevertheleſſe the Prize being taken
from his <hi>Highneſse</hi> Captaine, by a Ship of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
commanded by Captaine <hi>Filpot,</hi> with much
violence uſed to our Captaine and his Company)
was brought into <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and here in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
Court, adjudged no Price by Doctor <hi>Samms,</hi>
then judge of the Admiralty; and with ſuch paſſion
was the buſineſſe carried, and in ſuch contempt of
his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> Commiſſion, that Captaine <hi>Grace</hi> was
arreſted in the very Court whilſt the cauſe was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and all the Cockets, Bils of Lading, and the
teſtimonies of the Hanburgers taken from him. Thus
was his <hi>Highneſse</hi> defeated of his Prize, and of his
owne Ship.</p>
            <p>Another Veſſell was bought by his <hi>Highneſſe,</hi> in
which Captaine <hi>Grace</hi> was againe ſet out, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>French-man</hi> in open Sea, the <hi>French-man</hi> fled to
a Parliament Ship which protected him, whereupon
Captaine <hi>Grace</hi> was forced to deſiſt, and ſayled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Poole,</hi> (where lying at Anchor to take in ballaſt,)
by Order from the Governour of <hi>Poole,</hi> he was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon by a Ship of the Parliament, commanded
by Captaine <hi>Cartridge</hi> who brought him into <hi>Poole,</hi>
where the Governour kept the Ship for divers
moneths, and impriſoned the Captaine and his men
without any ground at all, but upon cavill againſt
his Commiſſion; and upon ſiniſter informations cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the <hi>Captaine</hi> to be ſent up to <hi>London</hi> Priſoner, by
Order from the Committee of the Admiralty. By
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30440:5"/>
his meanes that ſervice was wholly loſt, to his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſse</hi>
great dammage and diſhonor, though afterwards
with much and much ſolicitation the Ship was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
but with exceſſive charge to his <hi>Highneſſe,</hi>
both in the clearing of her, and making her fit
againe for Service.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Highneſſe</hi> ſtill not doubting but to receive
full ſatisfation for theſe injuries offered him, ſets
out another Veſſell, under Command of Captaine
<hi>Faulkner,</hi> who upon the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt tooke a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and brought him into <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> where the
Governor ſeaſed upon him, and his Prize; but at
laſt was content to let Captaine <hi>Paulkner</hi> depart with
his owne Veſſell, but detained for his owne uſe and
benefit the <hi>French</hi> Veſſell (which was an excellent
Swimmer) and kept all the goods in her; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
by Order from his <hi>Highneſſe,</hi> I made my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to the Committee of the Admiralty for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
yet none could I ever obtaine. Neither
wanted (upon all theſe ſeverall exigents) his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
Letters to both the Honourable Houſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
reſtitution in a faire way, but ſo farre was
that off, as to this houre his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> never received
any. Nevertheleſſe his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> not intending in
theſe his intentions for Sea, to exclude our Nation,
ſets out Captaine <hi>Faulkner</hi> againe, who taking a
<hi>French-man,</hi> not within command of any Fort or
Caſtle of this Kingdome, as is pretended (which
appeared by a ſhot made from <hi>Mount-Batten</hi> which
reached not Captaine <hi>Faulkner</hi> by a mile and upward)
brought confidently his Prize into the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi>
where he was preſently ſeaſed upon by Colonell
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30440:5"/>
               <hi>Hammond;</hi> the Captaine and all his men caſt into
Priſon; his Prize taken from him, and ſold
before his face (which ſhewed no intention of
reſtoring it to the <hi>French,</hi> had they had any right to
it) and an inventory ſent up to the Committee of
the Admiralty of the goods, to a very ſmall valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

to both the Honourable Houſes, (filled with much
ſweetneſſe and affection towards this Nation) to
obtaine ſatisfaction, none ever yet was thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor that there was any ſuch Princeas the Duke of
<hi>Lorrayne,</hi> whoſe Letters were worthy of anſwer. In
witneſſe ſtill of this high miſpriſſion, foure of his
ſeamen are yet in extreame miſery, detayned in the
Common-Goale of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to periſh; and both the <hi>French</hi> Ship, and the
Dukes alſo, are imbarged, and ſeaſed upon before the
<hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time Captaine <hi>Anderſon</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his <hi>Highneſse</hi> Commiſſion, went downe to
<hi>Portſmouth,</hi> where having gotten to him ſome few
Sea-men, and bought a ſmall Veſſell to tranſport
themſelves to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> there to be put upon a greater
Ship; no ſooner was it knowne, that they were to
ſerve under the Duke my Maſters Commiſſion (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
yet never attempted any thing) were ſeaſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and detained in priſon for many weeks, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of that his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> ſervice, and the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30440:6"/>
of the poore men: after my many ſollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and many repulſes, they were at laſt freed from
their moſt unjuſt impriſonment, but with no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
had of their loſſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeveral paſſages of diſgrace, having beene
put upon the Duke, my Maſter, with ſo ſtiffe a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in both the Honourable Houſes to his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse</hi>
ſo many courteous Letters, have cauſed (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume)
this laſt Letter of his to both the Houſes, to
make ſome expreſſion of his reſentment, in deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Parliament of <hi>England, whether they deſire
to have him their Friend or their Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although I, my Lord, am ſervant to this great
Prince, who at this houre commands an Army of
his owne of 12000. as gallant men as the Sunne
ſhines upon, moſt of them old Souldiers, of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
as well able to command, as of wills ready
to obey, having borne for many yeares the waight
and ſcoarching of the day, who with often graplings
have made ſoft unto their hands the hardneſſe of
warre, glorying more in their honourable Scarrs
then in their Scarlets, and are at their height of joy,
when they heare the Trumpets call to a Battell; yet
am I ſtill an Engliſh man, and ſo zealous a Patriot,
as moſt willingly would I Sacrifice my life in the
continuation of that ancient League and Amity,
which hath ever beene betweene this Kingdome and
the Houſe of <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> that Mother of Princes, that
Nurcery of Kings, whoſe Royall ſteame hath exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
its flouriſhing Branches over moſt of the
Thrones of <hi>Europe,</hi> whoſe now Regnant Heyre, the
Duke my Maſter, looking upon the rich Ornaments
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30440:6"/>
of his Soveraignty, values the greateſt Juell in it,
his ſo neere allyance to our Soveraign Lord, <hi>Charles,</hi>
King of <hi>England, France, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe
preſent condition he behols with eyes full of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and cleered from all Miſts of miſtake.</p>
            <p>I conclude my Lord, with my owne diſintereſt; it
is not (I am confident) the pleaſure of my Maſter to
call me off from this Station, by way of complyance
with the Honourable Houſes, till that abuſive attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of <hi>pretended,</hi> be taken off <hi>from me his reall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter:</hi>
for what judgement can thinke ſuch an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſhould be laid upon me, from any doubt in
matter of fact, as whether his <hi>Highneſse</hi> ownes me for
his <hi>Reſident,</hi> or not? but rather the doubt ſeemes to
be rayſed in matter of his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> Power, whether
he can conſtitute any Publique Miniſter.</p>
            <p>And to queſtion this, wil but expreſſe more &amp; more
the weakneſſe of thoſe who doubt it, and make his
<hi>Highneſse</hi> more &amp; more reflect upon his own Powers.</p>
            <p>But did the ſtreame run cleere (as formerly) which
now begins to be troubled betweene his <hi>Highneſſe</hi>
my Maſter, and the Honourable Houſes, I ſhould
receive thoſe endeavours moſt joyfully, which
ſhould effectually obtaine my recalling, for the cauſe
of my ſtay here being now rightly ſtated, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
appeares betweene his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Lorraine,</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
