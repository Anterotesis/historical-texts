            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

LETTER
FROM
EDINB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RGH.
TO
ONE in LONDON, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received yours, and do not think it ſtrange, that thoſe
of <hi>England</hi> are ſo deſirous to know the Acts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of our General Aſſembly in <hi>Scotland;</hi> for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Curioſity but Intereſt may prompt them thereto: I will
readily ſerve you in this Matter, and intended, though you had
not required it, to have given you an Account of it, that you
might have Occaſion of gratifying your worthy Friends and
Acquaintance. It's true, I was not Eye-Witneſs of what paſt;
for you know my Circumſtances would not allow that; and
the Brethren (as they call themſelves) endeavoured to keep
out all that were not of their own party, or who might tell
Tales; forbidding the Keepers of the door to admit any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a leaden Ticket in the ſhape of a Heart, which was the Paſs
given them, which was not ſo eaſily obtain'd, except for their
particular Friends; and if any of the <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovered,
there was a Cry preſently, <hi>Conformiſts are here;</hi> and
the Officers were ſent to thruſt them out. However not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
of this ſtrictneſs, there were always two or three
diſcreet and intelligent Perſons of my Acquaintance preſent at
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62662:3"/>
every Seſſion, from whom I have what I write to you. And I
aſſure you that you may truſt the Ingenuity and Faithfulneſs of
the Relation. But before I come to the Aſſembly it ſelf, there
be ſome things previous to it which you ought to be informed
of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A General Aſſembly in <hi>Scotland</hi> (you know) is much of
the ſame Nature with the Convocation in <hi>England,</hi> or a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Council; and of no leſs Authority here: Nay, our Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
exalt the Authority of their Aſſemblies aboue that of
King or Parliament; and there be ſome ſtanding Acts of their
Aſſemblies againſt Acts of Parliament, and which diſcharge
Obedience to them: Whereupon our Presbyterians being not
content with what the Parliament had done for them, nor think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Authority ſufficient for ſetting up their Government;
they required a General Aſſembly, by whoſe Authority (which
with them is ſupreme, and next to that of Jeſus Chriſt) their
Government might be firmly eſtabliſhed, and all their Actings
and Proceedings ratified and approved by it. Yet they knew
that a free Aſſembly of the Clergy and Laity throughout the
Kingdom would rather defeat than advance their Deſigns;
therefore they conſider'd how they might prevent that by ſome
Method, which would exclude all who were not well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their Intereſt, or zealous for the Good Old Cauſe.</p>
            <p>In order hereunto they prevailed with the Parliament, to
lodge the whole Government and Management of Church Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in the hands of thoſe few Old Preachers who went off when
Epiſcopacy was reeſtabliſhed <hi>An.</hi> 1661. and ſuch as ſhould be
admitted and approved by them. When theſe Miniſters off the
Epiſcopal Perſwaſion who had complied with the preſent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Government heard this, they thought themſelves injured,
and therefore addreſſed to the Parliament to be admitted to
a ſhare of the Government, or at leaſt not to be abſolutely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to them, who were their ſtated and profeſſed Enemies.
This they claimed as due to them, not only upon the account
of their being Lawful Miniſters of the Goſpel, but alſo upon the
account of the publick Faith, which promiſed them Protection
upon their compliance with the Civil Government: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which, their Petition was diſdainfully rejected, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62662:3"/>
the Act continued as before, in favour only of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Presbyterian Preachers. By which means all the preſent
Epiſcopal Clergy and ſuch of the Laity as favoured their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and had complyed with them, were rendred incapable
of bearing any Office in the Kirk, and of Sitting and Voting in
their Meetings. This the Epiſcopal Party juſtly complained of,
and ſaid; That though Epiſcopacy was aboliſhed merely upon
an unjuſt and falſe Pretence, that that Government exerciſed
Tyranny over the Church, yet now a real Presbyterian Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was eſtabliſhed, that inſtead of Fourteen Biſhops Sixty were
ſet up, who would Lord it over their Brethren more imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
than they either did or pretended to do; and that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
were ſubjected to them who own'd themſelves to be no
more than Presbyters, which had no Precedent in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, but alſo they who could not be denyed to be
Lawful Miniſters were excluded from any ſhare of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Government of the Church; which was contrary to
the very Principles and Tenets of the Presbyterians themſelves;
who make every private Miniſter to be inveſted with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of ruling as well as of teaching; and who affirm it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
for any Miniſter to part with that Right; and who
therefore were wont to exclaim againſt Biſhops, becauſe they
ſeemed to uſurp it wholly to themſelves. All the Excuſe made
for this was, That they could no otherwiſe make their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<hi>ſure,</hi> and that the Epiſcopal Party deſerved to be
thus treated for their Apoſtacy, in betraying and renouncing
the true Rights and Intereſts of the Church by complying with
Epiſcopacy. Hence it was inferr'd that Presbyterians do jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
both with God and Man: For whereas they would have the
World believe, that their Model of Government and Forms of
Diſcipline are ſo much of Divine Right that they can ſubmit to
no Terms of Compoſition with Men about them; ſo when
it makes for their Intereſt, they can without any ſcruple intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
eſſential Alterations thereof: For Parity (which they
make the Inſtitution of Chriſt) was now taken away, and out
of the pretended exigence of the Church nine hundred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
were ſuſpended from one half of that Power given them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62662:4"/>
by Chriſt, which at other times is ſaid to be ſo eſſential to them
that they cannot be Miniſters of the Goſpel without it.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the paſſing that Act of Parliament, for ſetting
up the Presbyterian Government, and committing the Care
and Management thereof to theſe few ſurviving Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Miniſters, who had not complied with Epiſcopacy; there
was a Meeting at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> of Presbyterian Miniſters and Lay-Elders
to adviſe about the Affairs of the Kirk, and to lay
down Methods how a General Aſſembly ſhould be call'd and
conſtituted; becauſe (as I have obſerved) one could not be
had according to their minds, after the old manner and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rules of General Aſſemblies. By Virtue of the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
none had the Right to meddle with the Government
and Affairs of the Church but ſuch Miniſters as had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
by the reſtoration of Epiſcopacy; and certainly theſe
men were greatly overſeen when they parted with that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
and admitted others to ſhare with them before they had
ſetled the Church according to their minds: For by theſe
means they were overpower'd and outvoted, and forced to
yield to other things than what they firſt intended; but they
were not ſenſible of this their Errour till it was paſt remedy.
Firſt, the remnant of the Remonſtrator Party, who had been
actually depoſed in the time of Presbytery, and ſome of them
for ſcandalous and groſs Crimes, came to ſit in this Meeting;
they were very active and uſeful, and therefore it was thought
fit to receive them; but ſome being ſenſible of the Irregularity
of admitting Perſons lying under the ſentence of Depoſition
by their own Kirk, it was therefore moved that the Sentence
of Depoſition might be firſt taken off: But the Debate was
laid aſide and ſuppreſt, becauſe theſe men urg'd and preſſed
that their Sentence of Depoſition might be declared void and
null, being done <hi>Clave errante,</hi> by a Factious party; wherewith
ſome of the old Publick Reſolutioners were pricked, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proceeded to defend themſelves, and particularly one
Mr. <hi>Alexander Pitcarne</hi> proteſted againſt their Proceedings, and
threatned to print his Proteſtation, and to declare their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unlawful, while ſuch incapacitated Members were allowed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62662:4"/>
to ſit in it: But ſuch early Heats being unſeaſonable and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial,
they prevail'd with him to take up his Proteſtation
and to forbear the Publiſhing it. Into this Aſſembly alſo were
received all theſe younger Brethren, who had been admitted to
the Miniſtry clandeſtinely in the time of the laſt Reign, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowedly
and openly ſince the receiving their Indulgence from
King <hi>James.</hi> Theſe were hurried on with more Fierceneſs and
Zeal than the former, who indeed wanted not ſincerity and
concernment enough for the Cauſe.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Gelidus tardante Senectâ</l>
               <l>Sanguis hebet, frigentque effoetae in corpore Vires.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Old Men thought that they ought to rule, and bear the
greateſt Sway becauſe of their Age and Experience, and that
the Act of Parliament was eſpecially in their favours; but the
younger Brethren would not be impos'd upon, ſeeing Parity
was the Conſtitution of their Government. And it was ſaid
that one Mr. <hi>Webſter</hi> told Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule</hi> very bluntly, that
tho he was a younger Man he merited more
than he, having taken the Miniſtry upon him
in the time of Perſecution, when no temporal
<note n="*" place="margin">Except the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which were ſomething to one who knew no other ways how to live.</note> Intereſt did encourage him to it; whereas
the other entred into it in the time of Peace,
and deſerted it in time of Trouble.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gabriel Cunningham</hi> was choſen Moderator of this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was extraordinary as to its Nature, neither was
there a proper Name for it; For it was neither Seſſion, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
Provincial, nor Dioceſan Synod, nor General Aſſembly,
nor Commiſſion of the Kirk, which are all the Church Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ever have been ſince the Reformation; but ever ſince it
bears the Name of the General Meeting. Here they appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Miniſters for the ſeveral Corners of the Country, divided
them into Presbyteries, preſcrib'd the Rules of trying Epiſcopal
Miniſters, and ordained that where the Presbytery conſiſted but
of four or fewer, the next Presbytery ſhould be joyned to it,
which yet in many places made not a competent number for ſo
weighty a buſineſs, as the examining and cenſuring Miniſters
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62662:5"/>
for their Doctrine and Manner: For the two Presbyteries of
<hi>Hidingtoun</hi> and <hi>Dumbar,</hi> where (you know) there be near
thirty Pariſhes, conſiſted but of five Presbyterian Miniſters.
There was the like number in the Presbyteries of <hi>Dunſe</hi>
and <hi>Churnſide,</hi> where there were about as many Pariſhes. In
the Presbytery of <hi>Aughterarder</hi> there was but one Presbiterian
Miniſter, and when the next was joyn'd to it, they made but
three; ſo that when it was debated in the Aſſembly, whether
one of them, to wit Mr. <hi>William Spence</hi> (of whom you will
hear more afterward) ſhould go for <hi>Angus;</hi> they pleaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his going, becauſe that without him they could not
have a <hi>Quorum</hi> in the Country where he then lived; and at
the ſame time Sir <hi>Colin Campbell</hi> and <hi>Ardbruchill</hi> ſtood up and
ſaid, in the face of the Aſſembly, that for twenty Miles Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of <hi>Perth,</hi> there were but two or three Miniſters, meaning
theſe of the Presbyterian Perſwaſion, which ſhews how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
agreeable either their Perſons or Government are to the
People.</p>
            <p>Here alſo they laid down the Method and Manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit
uting the next Aſſembly, which was to ſit in <hi>October, viz.</hi>
That where a Presbytery conſiſted of eight Miniſters, they
ſhould ſend four Miniſters and three ruling Elders to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly;
where they were under eight and above four, three
Miniſters and two ruling Elders; four ſhould ſend two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and one ruling Elder; and where there was but one,
that one and a ruling Elder ſhould come: By which you ſee
that the old Method of conſtituting General Aſſemblies was
quite alter'd, and that as many Parts of the Kingdom were not
allowed Repreſentatives in that Aſſembly, ſo others were not
repreſented equally, nor could they bear a ſutable Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
therein; but the ſmalneſs of their number was admitted as
a defence for this Irregularity. At this Meeting they appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a General Faſt before the ſitting down of the Aſſembly,
to be kept on Sunday the 5th. of <hi>October,</hi> which was the
third Faſt had been obſerved on Sundays within the ſpace of
a Year, which is neither agreeable to the Nature of the day,
nor the Practice of the Primitive Times; but our Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62662:5"/>
are above theſe things; they have more regard to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of their own Predeceſſors, than either to Reaſon or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
and you know it was the Cuſtom of the old Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
to keep all their Faſts on the Lords day: At this time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
we had another inſtance, whereby they ſhewed themſelves
the true Sons of their Fathers, who did not confine themſelves
to Matters purely Eccleſiaſtical, but who alſo were always
catching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the Power of the Magiſtrate; whoſe Priviledg it
is in this Kingdom to licenſe Books, and in their Licences to
grant the Monopoly of them: This Privilege was aſſumed by
the General Meeting; For they order'd an old Treatiſe of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Elders to be reprinted by the Heirs of <hi>Andrew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anderſon,</hi>
and diſcharged any other to meddle therewith; This is the
Form of their Licence word for word.</p>

            <p>This was a ſmall Beginning, however the Privy Council
thought fit to take notice thereof, and to give a check to theſe
Encroachments on the Civil Power, and therefore order'd the
Copies to be call'd in, and the Licence to be torn away; ſo
that after the firſt day all the Copies were ſold without the
<hi>Imprimatur;</hi> and two Friends of mine (who otherwiſe cared
not for the Book) were forced to pay a triple rate for one
with the forementioned Licence, which was a new Proof of
the Presbyterian Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>After the Meeting the Brethren went home, and fell to their
work with all their might, according to the Inſtructions given
them in their General Meeting. It was expected that they would
firſt have planted the Churches made vacant by the Council
and the Rabble, which were more than could be ſupplied by
all the Miniſters of that Perſwaſion: But they were not ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to plant, as to pluck up what was already planted; they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62662:6"/>
would not begin to build, until what was already built was
overthrown to the Ground. More than a third part of the
Churches in the Kingdom wanted Miniſters, and the moſt of
them for more than a Year. But as if that was only a ſmall
matter, it was overlooked; and all Pains and Care laid out
in emptying theſe Churches where the Epiſcopal Miniſters
continued to preach. Their beloved <hi>Weſt</hi> was deſtitute of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
the Churches there and in <hi>Galloway</hi> were almoſt all
ſhut up. So that when the Aſſembly met, two Miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
before them, that where they liv'd there was not ſo
much as the face of a Church, there being no Miniſters but
themſelves and one other: Yet none were ſent thither, but
they ſhew'd greater Inclination to ſeat themſelves in the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
and <hi>South,</hi> which is indeed a better Country, but where
there was leſs room for them, and where they were not ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the People. Many were indeed aſtoniſhed at this,
nor could they either juſtify it, or well underſtand the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
thereof. Strange! there were already more Churches va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
than there were Presbyterian Miniſters to put in them,
and yet ſo many more were aimed at, and coveted. It was ſad
and lamentable to ſee ſo many deſolate Congregations in all
parts of the Land, ſuch Multitudes of People without the
Goſpel, and without the direction of Paſtors, and yet they
would endeavour to deprive them of this Bleſſing, who by the
good Providence of God had it ſtill continued with them.
However they did this either to force the People to joyn with
them when none other could be had, or being conſcious of
their own Ignorance and Inability, they thought it neither fit,
nor their Intereſt to tolerate them who were more judicious,
and who would accuſtom the People to Senſe and ſolid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
which held forth the true Nature and Deſign of the
Goſpel, and which armed People againſt ſanatical Deluſions.</p>
            <p>When ſome were ask'd why they ſtudied to caſt out all the
Epiſcopal Clergy, ſeeing they could not yet ſupply their
Churches, and why they would preach in a Meeting-houſe,
where there was an Epiſcopal Miniſter unblameable in his Life
and Doctrine, and draw the people from him, rather than go
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62662:6"/>
to another Pariſh which wanted a Paſtor altogether. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That there was leſs prejudice both to Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by the want of Preaching, than by the Preaching of Men of
Epiſcopal Principles and Perſuaſions: And Mr. <hi>Frazer</hi> of <hi>Bray</hi>
ſaid in a Sermon before the Parliament, That it was better that
the Temple of the Lord, did lie ſometime unbuilt and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd,
than be rear'd up by <hi>Gibeonites</hi> and <hi>Samaritans.</hi> But to
return, Nothing came before the <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> except Citations
and Libels againſt Epiſcopal Miniſters, and to make the greater
diſpatch, they ſat every Week. The <hi>Presbyteries</hi> were a perfect
Inquiſition, who ſent out Spies to inform them not only of the
publick Sermons and open Practices of the Epiſcopal Clergy, but
alſo what they ſpoke and did in private; Neither did they
ſearch only into their preſent behaviour, but alſo they made
enquiry into the former Actions of their Lives, and if they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
diligent ſearch made any diſcovery of any little Blemiſh or
Failure, though before forgotten, it was made a part of their
Indictment. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> an old Man of eighty years at <hi>Lady-Kirk,</hi>
was libell'd among other things for Drunkenneſs, alledging an
inſtance fifteen or ſixteen Years ago, who as he prov'd the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
Inſtance to be falſe, ſo he ſaid very well, that ſeeing a
latter Inſtance could not be produc'd, it did appear, that he
was neither ſcandalouſly Drunken, nor guilty of the Habit
thereof. There was a form'd Deſign of diſgracing the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Clergy, and of rendring them infamous for Immorality;
but it will be much for their advantage, that after earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and endeavours to blacken them, there was little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
made out againſt them; When any real Scandals were
found, they were loudly talked of, and publickly proclaim'd,
and laid to the charge of the whole Party, as if it were a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
extraordinary to find ſome unworthy perſons among nine
hundred or a thouſand: The leaſt defects of Behaviour were
heightened and aggravated as if they had been groſs Crimes,
and what was no fault was made one by a perverſe and ſiniſter
Interpretation and uncharitable Conſtruction. When more
heinous Crimes were wanting, the Libels were ſtuff'd and
ſwell'd with Articles, which of themſelves amounted to nothing;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62662:7"/>
but accumulated together, were by them look'd upon and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
as amounting to a great guilt. And when nothing
could be deviſed againſt the Miniſter himſelf, he was accuſed
for his Elders and Pariſhioners, if they could be tax'd for any
real or apparent Crimes; For then it was ſaid, that he propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the <hi>Holy Ordinance</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> becauſe he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
by ſuch Elders, in the Adminiſtration of it; and that he
admitted ſuch perſons, whereas yet neihter the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were under Church Cenſure or legal Conviction. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
were generally ſo frivolous and impertinent that they
ought to have been rejected with Scorn; but whatever was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by the Bygots was admitted, and all care and caution
us'd not to diſcourage them. The great Scandals of Mr. <hi>Couper
and Mr.</hi> Graham <hi>Miniſters at</hi> Dumfermline <hi>were the admitting
Perſons promiſcuouſly to the Sacrament; the profaning the</hi> Lords
Day <hi>in ſuffering people to bring in Kail, and fan Barly for the
Pot that day; and by allowing their Children to play with others,</hi>
though they were very much under that age, which even in
the opinion of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors was obliged to the ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Sabbaoth. Another Miniſter was deſign'd to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
<hi>for plucking a few Peaſe on Sunday;</hi> but that being ſo
parallel to the caſe of the Diſciples, which our Saviour defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it was not permitted to be made uſe of. One was accuſed
<hi>becauſe he ſometimes Whiſtled;</hi> And another <hi>becauſe one
time playing at Bowls, he broke an innocent Jeſt,</hi> which none
could have conſtrued Prophane, but they who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure.</p>
            <p>If any had at any time publickly or privately expreſs'd any
Zeal for Epiſcopacy, or reflected on the Covenant, and the
Principles and Practices of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who now always
aſſume the names of the <hi>Godly,</hi> and the <hi>peculiar people of God,</hi>
or if it could have been alledged, that they had any ways, tho
never ſo indirectly, or even in obedience to the Magiſtrate, been
the occaſion of any trouble or uneaſineſs to them, this was
never omitted; but was ſure to be made a main Article of their
Libel. Thus Mr. <hi>Crawford</hi> (the old Gentleman mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
was accuſed for calling the Covenant <hi>a Band of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:62662:7"/>
Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Dalkeith</hi> was libelled, as calling
<hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Argyle</hi> Rebels and Traitors, becauſe he read the
Proclamation ſet forth againſt them, and which was appointed

Great Man was ſo picqu'd at him upon this account, that
he would neither hear his Defences againſt the other Articles
of the Libel, nor yet interpoſe his Authority (which was then
the higheſt in the State) for keeping him in the Exerciſe of
his Miniſtry, though it was deſired by the Generality, and the
beſt of his Pariſh. Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Dumbar</hi> was charged in his
Libel with Cruelty, and a perſecuting Spirit, becauſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
a Friend of his to put away a Servant who would
not keep the Church, and thereby made both her ſelf and her
Miſtreſs liable to the Law: He was alſo accuſed for ſaying to
one who expreſt his fears, as if the Liturgy of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> would be introduced among them, <hi>God ſend us no
worſe;</hi> and that he had never expreſt his thankfulneſs to God,
for the deliverance of the Land from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy.</hi> To
the firſt he reply'd, That he was indeed ſorry if any ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
had dropt from him, becauſe he was ſenſible it was too
mean for ſo great and ſo glorious a Church as that of <hi>England:</hi>
To the other he ſaid, That he thanked God heartily for any
deliverance that the Land had from Popery, but he could not
do ſo for the overthrow of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> unleſs he either acted the
Hypocrite, or was convinced that <hi>Presbytery</hi> was the greater
Bleſſing, and the more Ancient and Apoſtolical Government;
which he never yet ſaw made out. Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> (whom I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before) had in his Libel imputed to him, the taking the
Oaths of Allegiance and Canonical Obedience, which, they
ſaid, ſhewed him incorrigibly Epiſcopal. Mr. <hi>Couper</hi> had added
to his Libel his taking the Oath of the <hi>Teſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſtone</hi> of
<hi>Salin</hi> was accuſed for being too much affected to the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Government, and for recommending ſuperſtitious and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Books to the people, as they were pleas'd to call the
<hi>Whole Duty Man,</hi> which was expreſly mentioned. Another
Mr. <hi>Johnſtone</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Burnt Iſland</hi> was libell'd, for converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with ſome perſons whom they alledg'd to be no Friends to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62662:8"/>
the Government either of Church, or State; and for uſing the
Doxology, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could only refer to the Creed and
Lords Prayer. The Miniſter of <hi>Abbots-Hall</hi> was accuſed for
neglecting the Catechiſm of the <hi>Weſtminſter Divines,</hi> and uſing
that which was firſt ſet forth by the Synod of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
afterwards enlarged by the Reverend and pious Biſhop <hi>Scowgal:</hi>
The Catechiſm (I muſt tell you) is as well as the <hi>Whole Duty
of Man</hi> much ſpoken againſt, and ſeverely condemn'd as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
but what are the particular Errours of it which make it ſo
dangerous, I could never learn, nor do I believe you could
gueſs them, except they were told you.</p>
            <p>By theſe Inſtances you may underſtand the Nature of our <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Libels;</hi> I forbear to give you more, becauſe I ſuppoſe
there will be a Collection of them publiſhed: But you muſt know
that they would never give any of the Epiſcopal Clergy the
title of <hi>Miniſter,</hi> but only that of <hi>Incumbent.</hi> Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of this, and demanded a Reaſon, who was told by way
of Anſwer by one that preach'd at <hi>Innerkeithing</hi> that there were
no true Miniſters but <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters; And as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
them the Title of <hi>Miniſters;</hi> ſo to take away their right
to their reſpective Pariſhes, one Article of their Libel was,
Their entring by Preſentation from a Patron, and by Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Collation, and Inſtitution of the Biſhop, contrary to the
Word of God; The Conſtitution of this Church, Acts of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
and the Lands ſolemn Engagements. When the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men of that Party were upbraided for making Epiſcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
a ground of a Libel; They excus'd themſelves and laid
the blame of it upon the people; but in this they ſhewed their
Hypocriſie and deceitful Dealing. For it was well known that
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters were always conſulted in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Libels, and many of them were drawn up by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and that all them were every where of the ſame ſtrain,
which makes it evident that it was a concerted buſineſs among
them, to beget in the peoples minds an averſion to Epiſcopal
Miniſters, as not true Miniſters, nor entring in at the right door;
though they were alſo careful to foiſt in ſome other thing to
excuſe their Cenſures with the more judicious, who could not
be ſo eaſily deluded and impoſed upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62662:8"/>
As the Articles of the Libels were for the moſt part frivolous
and impertinent, ſo the manner of their proceſs was neither le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
nor reaſonable; for ſeldom did they let the Miniſter accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
know his Accuſer, and ſo he might have been made a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt him, which is contrary to the Laws of all Nations:
Beſide, they always received the Libel, and ſuſtained the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of it, before he was heard, and not regarding what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
might be opponed, cauſed him to be cited to hear and
ſee himſelf depoſed: Nor was he ſuffered to be preſent at the
examination of the Witneſſes; but in many places, if not every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
the Witneſſes were allowed to be preſent all together,
when they gave in their Evidence: By the Civil and Canon
Law, and the reaſonable practiſe of all Nations, they who bear
Hatred, Malice, or have diſcovered any Prejudice againſt the
accuſed, cannot witneſs in Judgment againſt him; but this was
wholly neglected and paſt by, and the moſt avowed, profeſt,
and open Enemies received as Witneſſes, and ſuch alſo allowed
to ſit as Judges. Thus Mr. <hi>Calderwood</hi> a profeſt, and bitter E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
of Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> who was the chief if
not the only Informer againſt him, ſat and judged him in the
<hi>Presbytery</hi> in the quality of a Ruling Elder; And when the ſaid
Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> deſired that he might be removed, it was utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
him. So when Mr. <hi>George Purves</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Glencorſe</hi>
appeared before the ſame <hi>Presbytery</hi> at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> he objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſome of the Witneſſes as carrying Heart-Malice and ill
Will towards him; they having ſometime before aſſaulted him
in the Pulpit with Swords and Staves, and taking him by the
Throat, had gone near to have ſtrangled him, if he had not got
preſent Relief; therefore (ſaid he) they ought not to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as Witneſſes againſt me, for they that did ſo, what will they
not do to procure my ruin? Upon which the very Reverend
and Worthy <hi>Matthew Selkirk,</hi> who is now ſetled Miniſter at
<hi>Crighton,</hi> roſe up and ſpoke to the Moderator; <hi>That if theſe Men
had done ſo out of Malice and perſonal Prejudice, they ought not
to be received as Witneſſes; but if they had done it for the Glory
of God, he ſaw no reaſon why they might not be admitted.</hi> If one
part of the Depoſition ſeemed to prove the Libel, or any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62662:9"/>
of it, though the other did exculpate the Miniſter or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
his fault, the firſt was marked, and the other left out;
So I was told of one who is ſince dead, who was accuſed for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that <hi>Women wanted Souls;</hi> The Witneſs declar'd he had
heard him ſay ſo, but that he only deliver'd as the Opinion of
another, and yet upon this the Article was look'd upon as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
When the Witneſſes cleared the Miniſter or aſſerted his
Innocence, they were diſmiſs'd as knowing nothing of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but ſuch were greatly encouraged and cheriſhed as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves earneſt and forward to diveſt him of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a faithful, pious and upright Paſtor: And when they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Sentence of Suſpenſion or Depoſition againſt any, at
the intimation of it, from the Pulpit in his own Church, the
whole Libel was read, though ſeveral of the Articles were ſo
frivolous and trivial as not cenſurable by Law, and others of
them that contained Matter of Scandal were no way proved.</p>
            <p>As for the Epiſcopal Clergy, ſome of them diſown'd their
Authority, and would not appear; Others appeared, and gave
in their Defences; and ſome perceiving the Partiality of the
particular <hi>Presbyteries</hi> appeal'd to the next General Aſſembly,
hoping to meet with greater Moderation there, or at leaſt that
before that time the Civil Government would put a ſtop to
theſe rigid and unreaſonable proceedings. Thus matters went
till the ſitting of the Aſſembly, and by theſe proceedings the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> not only encreas'd the prejudices of thoſe who
differed from them, but they alſo diſguſted many of their
Friends. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> you know were much inferiour to
the Epiſcopal Party in number, quality, learning or good Senſe;
and I aſſure you, that now they have loſt much even of that
Intereſt which they had in this Nation, many who thought well
of them while they were kept under, are now aſhamed of them,
and have deſerted them: I am told that many (even in the
<hi>Weſt</hi>) abominate them: It is moſt certain that in other places
of the Kingdom, they are fear'd and dreaded as a Plague to
Mankind, juſt as the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are.</p>
            <p>When the time of the Aſſembly drew near, the ſeveral
Presbyteries ſet about the chuſing Commiſſioners for it, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62662:9"/>
things were ſo laid, that the moſt bigotted and hot-headed
were generally choſen, and thoſe of a more moderate Temper
put by. If there had been any reſpect to the qualifications of
Men, none in that part of the Country he lived in would have
been preferr'd to Honeſt Dr. <hi>Hardy;</hi> but becauſe heretofore he
had kept correſpondence with the Epiſcopal Party, and ſtill
preſt Moderation towards them, he was excluded. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Mr. <hi>Alexander Pitcairn</hi> of <hi>Dron</hi> was put by, becauſe of his
carriage at the laſt General Meeting, though he is ſaid to have
more Learning than the moſt of them; and there were but
three others in the Presbytery with him, and none of them, of
theſe old men to whom the Government of the Church was
entruſted by the late Act of Parliament: He indeed came to
the Aſſembly, ſat in it, and interpoſed his Judgment, but was
no Member of it, and ſo conſequently had no Vote. When theſe
Meaſures were perceived, it was concluded, That Mr. <hi>George
Campbel</hi> ſhould be alſo ſhuffled out of the Aſſembly; but that
would have made their deſigns too apparent, there being none of
his Presbytery whom they could bring in Competition with him,
as alſo they had not much reaſon to fear any Oppoſition from
him becauſe of his modeſty and quietneſs, which makes him
averſe to Conteſts and Jangling. He hath indeed the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a learned, good, and diſcreet Man; and by his Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at firſt he did very much diſpleaſe his Brethren, which (as
I am informed, but am loth to believe) hath obliged him for
removing their Jealouſies to expreſs himſelf of late more ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt the Epiſcopal Party than he us'd to do formerly. As
for Lay-Commiſſioners, ſuch were pick'd out as either were
moſt bygottedly affected to their Intereſts, or whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
and deſign'd to make faſt Friends to their Party. In the
Presbytery of <hi>Churnſide</hi> the <hi>Laird</hi> of—was choſen, and in <hi>Dunſe</hi>
the Competition lay betwixt the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Lanton</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> the
laſt was like to have carried it, but ſome one ſuggeſted to the
Moderator, that it would very much reflect upon them to have
both the Commiſſioners for the <hi>Merſe</hi> ſtain'd with the <hi>Scandal</hi>
of <hi>Adultery;</hi> upon which the Commiſſion was giv'n to <hi>Lanton,</hi>
and the other was put by, whom yet they would fain have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62662:10"/>
obliged, he being one who has at preſent a conſiderable place
in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> you know ought to have a Commiſſioner at every
Aſſembly, to ſee that Affairs of State be not medled with by the
Brethren, who indeed ſtill retain the ſtrong Inclinations, which
they as well as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have always ſhewed to
meddle with them, pretending they only do this in <hi>ordine ad
ſpiritualia.</hi> Every one look'd that the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> ſhould
have been the perſon, whom the King ſhould have honoured
with that Employment, and his Lordſhip himſelf rejoyced in
expectation of it: But (to the ſurprizal of all) ſome few days
before the Aſſembly ſat, a Commiſſion came down for My
Lord <hi>Carmichael,</hi> which made the zealous Brethren hang down
their Ears: And My Lord <hi>Crawford</hi> gave an Indication of his
ſecret Grudg at the diſappointment, by his entertaining every
body who came to ſee him with Proteſtations, that he did not
deſire it, and with Reaſons and Excuſes why he would not have
accepted of it, if it had been offered to him: But we may
juſtly ſuſpect that his Lordſhip would not have refuſed it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he frequented the Aſſembly, and officiouſly meddled in all
the Concerns of it, even before he was made a Member; and
upon <hi>Carmichael</hi>'s advancement, there were Letters immediately
diſpatched to procure a Commiſſion for his Lordſhip from ſome
Burgh or other, becauſe a Commiſſion from a Presbytery had
been neglected, upon an expectation that his Lordſhip ſhould
have repreſented the <hi>King</hi> himſelf in the Aſſembly: His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was ſo humble, that having miſs'd of the higheſt Station,
he would rather ſerve in the meaneſt, than not have an hand in
advancing the good Cauſe; or be deprived of the occaſion of
perfecting what he had ſo zealouſly begun: He had indeed
merited the higheſt Honour in the Kirk, but all except the very
Bygots of that ſide approved the <hi>King</hi>'s Choice as beſt and
wiſeſt for himſelf, and the Intereſt of the State. For My Lord
<hi>Carmichael</hi> was look'd upon as a Man of good Senſe, and he
had lately giv'n proofs of his Diſcretion and moderate Temper,
at the Viſitation of the Colledg of <hi>Glaſgow;</hi> whereas My
Lord <hi>Crawford</hi> kept within no bounds of Moderation at the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62662:10"/>
Viſitation of the Univerſity of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and was much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of for his rough Uſage of the Maſters, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Reverend old Dr. <hi>Weemſe</hi> Dean of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and
Principle of S. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s College, who had been a Maſter in
the ſaid Univerſity for the ſpace of 45 years, under whom
My Lord <hi>Crawford</hi> ſtudied Philoſophy, and to whom he was
then particularly obliged; the Dr. had alſo been a zealous
Aſſertor of the Proteſtant Religion, and deſign'd to have made
the Univerſity his Heir; notwithſtanding all which, My Lord
would not ſuffer him to have favour of a Seat, when he
attended that Viſitation, and when the honeſt Gentleman's
Age and Infirmity obliged him to reſt himſelf on the ſtep of
a Stair in the room, becauſe other Conveniency was deny'd
him; his Lordſhip ſent an Officer and raiſed him; ſuch Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Incivility you may think incredible, but I had it from
the old Gentleman himſelf; of the which, with all other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of that Viſitation, as alſo of the Viſitation of the other
Colleges, I am told that the World may expect a full Account.
But to return from whence my reſpect to my Lord <hi>Crawford</hi>
carried me.</p>
            <p>All the Members of the Aſſembly being duly couven'd on
the appointed day, <hi>viz.</hi> the 16th. of <hi>October,</hi> they went to the
High Church where Mr. <hi>Gabriel Cunninghame</hi> Moderator <hi>of the
laſt General Meeting</hi> did preach on S. <hi>John 2. 17. And his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
remembred that it was written, the Zeal of thine Houſe hath
eaten me up.</hi> In which the old man gave a greater Proof of his
Memory than his Judgment, for the ſame Sermon had been
preach'd on the ſame Text by Mr. <hi>Oliver Bowlis, an.</hi> 1643. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament at <hi>Lond.</hi>
I have ſeen the printed Sermon compared with the Notes of
what was preach'd, and I aſſure you Mr. <hi>Gabriel</hi> made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Repetition, and followed his Authour <hi>verbatim</hi> ſo far as
was fit for his purpoſe, only he left out ſome things in the
Cloſe of Mr. <hi>Bowlis</hi>'s Sermon, and added ſome bitter Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the Epiſcopal Party.</p>
            <p>There was a Parallel carried on betwixt Presbytery and
that Miracle of our Saviour in whipping the Buyers and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62662:11"/>
out of the Temple; the ſetting up Presbytery at this time
was compared to the Work of the Reformation, and was made
a more wonderful and <hi>ſignal Act of Providence.</hi> The Epiſcopal
Party were called <hi>formal and nominal Proteſtants, who profeſſing
to retain the Fundamentals, did pervert and corrupt the very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and all the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
you know can never have their fill of Preaching, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a ſingle Sermon was not thought ſufficient to open their
Aſſembly, but they returned in the Afternoon, where Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Simſon</hi> preached, on 3. <hi>Zach. 7. Thus ſaith the Lord of
Hoſts, if thou wilt walk in my Ways, and if thou wilt keep my
Charge, then thou ſhalt alſo judg my Houſe, and ſhalt alſo keep my
Courts, and I will give the Places to walk among theſe that ſtand
by.</hi> When his Matter and Expreſſion were conſidered, no
body thought his Sermon was borrowed as that in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
had been, for it was Presbyterian Stuff courſe enough.
He aſcribed to their Meeting a Supremacy abſolute and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
next under Chriſt.</p>
            <p>After both Sermons they went to the Place appointed for
the Aſſembly; Mr. <hi>Gabriel Cunninghame</hi> opened the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a Prayer, after which he made a Complement to the
King's Commiſſioner, and deſired that his Commiſſion might
be ſeen and read. The Commiſſioner having produc'd his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
he deſired that every one might alſo ſhew theirs; which
occaſioned a confuſed Jangling for ſome time. The next thing
they fell upon was the chuſing of the Moderator, for Mr. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi>
could no longer preſide, it being againſt their Principles
to allow a conſtant Moderator. For Perſons were in Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the firſt was Mr. <hi>George Campbel</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Drumfries,</hi>
whoſe Character I have given you before; the next was
Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule,</hi> who formerly paſs'd under the name of
Dr. <hi>Rule</hi> becauſe of his practiſing Medicine; he ſat in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embly
as Commiſſioner from the Colledg at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> where
he was lately inſtalled Principal, in the room of the reverend
and learned Dr. <hi>Monro.</hi> In the laſt times of Presbytery he
was an Independent, but now he ſeems to own no ſuch thing,
but preſſeth the Presbyterian Government as of Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62662:11"/>
He is of great Authority among his Party, and is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them a learned and judicious man; but firſt he ſeems
not to have the Latine Tongue, for he oft woundeth <hi>Priſcian,</hi>
and hath ſo little Command of that Language, that he dare not
extend his Prayers before the Students above two or three
Sentences, which when obſerved made one wiſh that all the
Presbyterians were obliged to pray in Latin, and then they
would not be ſo tedious, nor vent ſo much Nonſenſe in their
Prayers, as moſt of them now uſe to do: Again, the things he
hath publiſhed diſcover no ſmall Ignorance; witneſs, his <hi>ſilly
Gloſs on that Expreſſion of S.</hi> Jerome; <hi>Quid facit Epiſcopus, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptâ
Ordinatione, quod Presbyter non faciat:</hi> Where he maketh
<hi>Ordinatio</hi> to be the ordering of the Meetings of the Clergy.
<note n="*" place="margin">This Expoſition of the Fathers Words you may find in the 169 <hi>p.</hi> of his pretended An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonableneſs of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</note> He alſo publiſhed a Pamphlet, wherein he
repreſented the Principles and Practices of
Presbyterians; which is a very weak and
empty Paper full of Contradictions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Scripture is groſly wreſted, and
wherein ſeveral things are obtruded as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and of great Importance, which have
no Foundation either in Scripture, Reaſon, or Antiquity.
As by this it appears that his Learning is not great, though
he hath had the Boldneſs to enter the liſts with Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>
ſo he hath often in his Sermons vented himſelf bitterly againſt
the Epiſcopal Party.</p>
            <p>A third Perſon was Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> once Miniſter at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi>
but who hath preach'd at a Meeting-Houſe in the <hi>Weſt</hi> ever
ſince the Indulgence granted by King <hi>James.</hi> He indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Miniſtry in times of Presbytery, but he alſo compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Epiſcopacy when it was reſtored. He at firſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Mr. <hi>John Menzies</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi>
did heſitate upon the Oath of Canonical Obedience; which
<hi>Biſhop Mitchel</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> would by no means allow; ſo that
they both ran a riſque of being depriv'd. But afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Conference at S. <hi>Andrews</hi> with the Archbiſhop of that See,
who it ſeems dealt ſomewhat ſmoothly with them, they both
ſubſcribed the Oath of Canonical Obedience, and were ſent
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62662:12"/>
back to the Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> with recommendatory Letters
from the Primate; upon which they were admitted to their
Places, which the one kept till his Death, and the other till
the Oath of the Teſt. I am told that Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> denies the
matter of Fact, and will not acknowledg that ever he took
the Oath of Canonical Obedience, but the thing is too noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to be denyed; for as the Primate of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> aſſur'd
the Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> of it by a Letter under his hand, of
which Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> himſelf was the Bearer; ſo the Biſhop
of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> to make their Compliance as publick and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
as he thought their demurring and refuſal had been
ſcandalous, before he remitted them to the Exerciſe of their
Miniſtry, cauſed a publick Intimation of their Subſcription to
be made in the old Church of new <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> which Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made by Dr. <hi>Keith</hi> afterwards Profeſſor of Divinity
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which certainly would not have been done, if
the matter of Fact had not been certain: Eſpecially if it be
conſider'd that they themſelves, tho preſent, did not offer to
contradict it. When this rigorous Proceeding of the Biſhops
againſt them was in ordinary Diſcourſe complained of, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himſelf by an <hi>old Scotch Proverb,</hi> which is, <hi>That a fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Mare ſhould be well girded:</hi> And it has been told me the
Subſcriptions both of Mr. <hi>Menzies</hi> and Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> are ſtill
extant. However Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> payed true Canonical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as much as any other Miniſter, to the Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi>
and lived in particular Friendſhip with Biſhop <hi>Scowgal,</hi> who
ſucceeded in that See: he frequented the Presbyteries and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
ſubmitted to their Acts, and aſſiſted ſeveral times when
the Biſhop ordained, and ſo far deſerted the Principles of the
Covenant and our <hi>Scottiſh Presbiteryans,</hi> that he ſwore and
ſubſcribed the Declaration, when he was admitted Rector of
the <hi>Mariſhal</hi> College of <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> It cannot be denied but
that he carried himſelf well, and gained the good Opinion of
all, while he kept his Place, and even after he had left it for
not taking the Teſt, he did not deſert the Church, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Communion with the Epiſcopal Party, until the time
that King <hi>James</hi> diſcharged the taking of Oaths, and ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62662:12"/>
the Laws which enacted them, and then becauſe he was
not permitted to return to the Exerciſe of his Miniſtry at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi>
tho he was allowed to go any where elſe, he became ſo
picqu'd and offended at the Biſhops, whom he apprehended
were the Cauſe thereof, that he preſently ſtruck in with the
Presbyterians, and either to make his Change appear the more
ſincere, or becauſe he had really alter'd his Judgment and the
Principles he formerly profeſs'd, he hath broke of all corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with the Epiſcopal Party, though ſome of them were
his moſt intimate Acquaintance, and as Occaſion offer'd vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf as bitterly and ſeverely againſt them, as any Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
whatſoever. And when he was laſt at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> tho
he was kindly and civilly invited by his old Colleagues to
take their Pulpit, yet he would never preach for them, nor
ſo much as hear them; but choſe rather to go preach in the
Meeting-Houſe, where he exhorted the People to Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for the deliverance of the Land from Prelacy, and to be
earneſt in their Prayers that it might never return again. In
him we have an apparent Inſtance, how great a Temptation
even to a judicious Man Picque and Intereſt and Popularity
do oftentimes prove. At firſt he pretended that he would
only attempt to reclaim the deluded People of the <hi>Weſt</hi> from
their Errors and Extravagancies, who (he ſaid) had been loſt
for want of good and knowing Miniſters amongſt them; but
it was plainly foretold by a Perſon of Quality and great Worth,
that it would appear he could not work upon them, but that
they would inſnare him, and bring him over to all their Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Perſon was one Mr. <hi>Hugh Kennedy,</hi> who
is uſually called Father <hi>Kennedy</hi> by the Phanaticks here, and
by others <hi>Bitter Beard:</hi> he is of a little Stature, but ſuch a
one as has made a great Buſtle in his time; he was a Ring-leader
of the Remonſtrator-Party, and with the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> when they delivered up King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a part of the Price of his Blood, as is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
ſix thouſand Marks. In the Year 1660 he was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by a Synod of Presbyterians for ſeveral Crimes; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62662:13"/>
for being a Firebrand among his Brethren, and for a Book
entituled <hi>The Cauſes of Gods Wrath upon</hi> Scotland, which Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Depoſition was never taken off, till the laſt day but
one of this Aſſembly, as you ſhall hear afterwards.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the four Perſons nominated to preſide in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly;
when it came to the Vote, Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule</hi> had four
or five; Mr. <hi>Geo. Meldrum</hi> one; Mr. <hi>George Campbel</hi> forty
eight; but the moſt were in favour of Mr. <hi>Hugh Kennedy,</hi>
and ſo the Chair was aſſign'd to him, who came ſhort of the
reſt in Learning, yet ſurpaſſed them in Subtilty and Malice.
Having choſen a Moderator, the next thing requiſite was a
Clerk, they appointed Mr. <hi>John Spalding,</hi> who had been Clerk
to the General Meeting, to officiate in the interim till they
ſhould chuſe one, but he continued all the time of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
for there were ſo many Competitors for the Clerkſhip,
and each of them had ſuch Intereſt by their Friends in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
that they durſt never put it to the hazard of a Vote,
for fear of dividing the Aſſembly; the Competitors were as
we heard, <hi>Merſington, Corſrigge,</hi> two Lords of the Seſſion;
<hi>Park Hay,</hi> the famous <hi>James Stewart,</hi> and one <hi>Kerr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Aſſembly there was an hundred and eighty Perſons,
Clergy and Laity. There were no Commiſſioners from the
Shires of <hi>Angus, Merns, Aberdeen,</hi> or any of the more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Parts of the Kingdom; and even ſeveral Places on the
North ſide of <hi>Tay</hi> had none; only here and there in a Corner,
where the Presbyterians had ſeated themſelves, and aſſumed
the name of a Presbytery, there were one or two choſen and
Commiſſionated to repreſent them in the Aſſembly. None
of the Univerſities or Colleges had any Repreſentatives there,
ſave that of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule</hi> repreſented;
ſo that this was no more a General Aſſembly of the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> than that of <hi>Trent</hi> can be called a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of the Catholick Church; nor did any other Spirit rule in
the one than what prevailed in the other, I mean a Spirit of
Faction, Intereſt and Prejudice, as will appear by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of their Proceedings, though there were Prayers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
put up for another Spirit, if they had been diſpoſed
for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62662:13"/>
The Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland</hi> have always conteſted with
Kings about the <hi>Power of calling, adjourning and diſſolving Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</hi>
They pretend to an intrinſick Power in themſelves
in this matter, to which (as Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> ſays in his Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that of the Magiſtrate is cumulative, and not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative.
The adjuſting of this Matter therefore was the firſt
Difficulty brought before the Moderator, and no ſmall Tryal
of his Skill; for as in the one hand they had all the Reaſons
in the World to complement and gratify the King; ſo on the
other it is well known the Presbyterians are very tenacious
of their pretended Rights, and very jealous of Encroachments
upon them, which makes them cautious of giving Precedents.
Now this Difficulty he reſolved thus, he ſuffered the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
to appoint the time of their Meeting, and without
taking notice of what the Commiſſioner had done, he himſelf
adjourned them to the ſame time; ſometimes alſo to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Commiſſioner be would ſo cunningly ſmooth the
buſineſs, as when he had reſolved upon the time of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he would firſt ask the Commiſſioner if his Grace could
attend them at ſuch a time, and then adjourn to the ſaid time;
ſo they always agreed about the time of their Meetings, and
by this means the Debate betwixt them and the King was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and never decided. There happened a pleaſant Paſſage
to this Purpoſe, which I muſt not omit; Mr. <hi>Gabr. Cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hame</hi>
preſiding one day in the abſence of the ordinary Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,
he asked the Commiſſioner what ſhould be the next
time of their Meeting; but whether it was out of Forgetfulneſs
that he did ſo or not, he corrected himſelf in his Prayer. For
he began with an acknowledgment of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus being ſupreme
Head and Governour of the Church,</hi> and then ſaid theſe Words,
<hi>Thou knoweſt, O Lord, that when we own any other, it is only
for Decency ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day they met, and only heard the King's Letter
read, and appointed ſome Perſons to draw up an Anſwer. We
expected to have ſeen both in Print, as is uſual, but neither
of them has been as yet publiſhed, becauſe, as is ſuppoſed,
there was ſomething in the King's Letter a little checking,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62662:14"/>
which they would not have every one to know, <hi>viz. That
he favoured their Government, becauſe he was made to underſtand
it was moſt agreeable to the Inclinations of the People; that he
would have them very moderate in their Proceedings, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which might diſpleaſe their neighbour Church:</hi> This laſt
did not go down well with them, for it troubled them to
be made in any ways accountable to a Church, which in all
their Diſcourſes they exclaimed againſt as <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> and <hi>ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous,</hi>
and into which they are deſigning to introduce their
glorious Reformation. Neither was the firſt very acceptable,
for if the Inclinations of the People were the Motive of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up Presbyterian Government, when it ſhould (as it very
eaſily might) be repreſented, that the Inclinations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were againſt Presbytery, and the Spirit and ractice P of the
preſent Presbyterians, his Majeſty might be moved to remove
this, and ſet up another Government. Therefore in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
they aſſerted that their Government was not only ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Inclinations of the People, but alſo moſt agreeable
to the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and that this might not be looked upon
merely as the Flouriſh of an Epiſtle, they deſign'd to back it
with the Authority of an Act; which ſhould declare their
Government both of Divine Right, and alſo the true Legal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this Church, which they pretended had never
ſuffered any Alteration, except in time of Uſurpation, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great Oppreſſion. But the Commiſſioner apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Conſequences of ſuch an Act, thought it not fit to
let the ſame paſs, without Advice from Court; and therefore
deſired a Copy of it to ſend to the King his Maſter, who it
ſeems did not approve of it: For it never more appeared here,
at which the Brethren have not a little murmured. And if
it had paſſed, as it would not have contributed much to the
Eſtabliſhment of their Government, it being the Act of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
an Aſſembly; ſo it would only have diſcovered
their Ignorance, Falſhood and Impudence: For it is clear from
our Hiſtories (as was declared in a late Diſcourſe) that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
heretofore was never ſetled but in times of Rebellion;
and what Enemies our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Presbyterians have been always
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62662:14"/>
to Kings, and how much they were wont to encourage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
King <hi>James</hi> VI. has from his Experience fully and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared, in his <hi>Baſilicon Doron,</hi> where he cautions his Son
againſt them as the moſt barbarous, treacherous and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſort of People, who are leſs to be truſted than the thieving
Borderers, or the wildeſt uncivilized <hi>Highlanders.</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alſo, which Sir <hi>James Montgomery</hi> of <hi>Skelmorly</hi> uſed for
Presbytery in the Parliament, ſhews how much it favours Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
and Kingly Power, which was this, That it was the
Peoples only Security againſt the Encroachment of Kings, and
a proper Curb to reſtrain their Inſolence and Extravagancy;
And indeed when they are encouraged, they ſo reſtrain them
as to make them ſignify nothing, as appears by their Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to King <hi>James</hi> VI. before he went to <hi>England,</hi> and what
they did to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. whom they perſecuted and
purſued to Death. As to the Moderation which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
required of them, they promiſed <hi>with a ſolemn Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they would ſhew all the Moderation that his Majeſty
could expect;</hi> which when conſidered was not a very great
Obligation on them; for if the King underſtand them aright,
his Expectation will be very ſmall, Moderation being very
rarely to be found among Presbyterians.</p>
            <p>It being an old Cuſtom of general Aſſemblies to eaſe the
Miniſters of the Place where they meet from preaching, they
ordered this day who ſhould preach the following <hi>Sunday,</hi>
and when they were appointing Preachers for the reſt of the
Churches and Meeting-Houſes in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> one<note n="†" place="margin">Colineſs.</note>
ſtood up, and ſaid; It was fit to ſend Miniſters to
the Conformiſts Kirks too: But the Moderator perceiving
the Commiſſioner diſpleaſed at the Propoſal, replyed; <hi>That
they ſought none of their Help, and they ſhould get as little.</hi> The
firſt that preached in the High Church before the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
was Mr. <hi>Geo. Meldrum,</hi> whoſe Text was <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. Ver.
5. The Sermon was framed to pleaſe the various Humours
of Men, and to recommend himſelf to Perſons of different
Tempers, for the general Drift of it ſeemed to be for Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which both the Court and all good diſcreet People
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62662:15"/>
called for; yet he caution'd it with ſuch Reſtrictions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
as that he might juſtifie himſelf with the more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid,
and prevent their jealouſies and ſuſpicions of him: He
who preached the <hi>Sunday</hi> following (if my Memory fail not)
was one <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who was ſomewhat ſingular in his reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Years during which we of this Nation have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the Goſpel; for whereas the reſt of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
reckon but 28. <hi>viz.</hi> from the Reſtauration of the Royal
Family and Epiſcopacy, he ran ten Years farther backward,
and made it 38. leaving People to gueſs his reaſon, and
when the Matter was enquired into, it was found that he
dated the want of the Goſpel from the Year 1652. becauſe
ſince that time they never had a General Aſſembly, and then
too they were not ſuffered to ſit, for the Engliſh Governor
here raiſed them, becauſe they had no Warrant from <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
and carried them out ſurrounded with Guards to <hi>Bruntsfield-Links,</hi>
where he diſmiſſed them with a ſevere threatening,
if any three of them ſhould be found together. It would be
tedious to give you a particular account of all the Sermons
which were preached here in the time of the Aſſembly, but
in general I aſſure you they were very nauſeating to all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Perſons, for except one or two preached by Mr. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Robert Wyllie,</hi> they were either miſerably flat
and dull, or elſe full of bitter Zeal againſt the Epiſcopal Party;
Inſtead of the Doctrins and Duties of Chriſtianity, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and divine Inſtitution of their Government was the
ſubject of their Diſcourſes, and when they happened on any
neceſſary or weighty Point of Religion, they treated them in
ſuch a manner, as if they had deſign'd to burleſque Religion,
and render it ridiculous, which gave a great advantage to
atheiſtical and profane Men: So it is obſerved that Religion
doth ſuffer more now by the ſetting up of the Presbyterians,
than it did or was like to have ſuffer'd in this Nation by the
attempts of the Jeſuits and other Papiſts a little while ago; for
then it fell out that People ſearch'd and conſidered the Points
of their Religion, and they that were ignorant of the Truth
or diſ-believed it, came to underſtand it, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62662:15"/>
of it, and were reſolved to be ſtedfaſt in the defence of
it, whereas now the Conteſt being about Forms of Government,
and Diſcipline, which generally People look upon as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of leſſer moment, all enquiry into the important Points
is laid aſide, and ſeeing there is ſuch Hypocriſie and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
among theſe very Men who ſet up themſelves for the
peculiar People of God, and that they who would be
thought as it were inſpired, or at leaſt of all others moſt act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Spirit of God, are guilty of baſe and unworthy
Actions; this tempts People to think all Religion a ſham and
cheat.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the twenty fifth they met at eight a Clock
of the Morning for Prayer only. Some ſay eight, others ten,
and ſome that eleven prayed ſucceſſively: One told me he
ſtayed till five of them prayed, however they continued to
pray from eight to twelve. The Moderator began, and when
he ended he named the perſon who ſhould pray next, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one did the like till Dinner time. Among others who
were deſired to pray there was an old Man who at firſt declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, pretending a bodily indiſpoſition, but when it was voted
he ſhould pray, he fell to it, and prayed longer a great deal
than any of the reſt. This Exerciſe of long and continued
Prayer was ſo unuſual, that it became preſently the talk of the
Town, and people had different Sentiments about it, and put
various Conſtructions upon it: Some ſaid they were practiſing
what our Lord condemned, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. conſidering that
their Prayers generally are but Babling and vain Repetitions.
Others that they were imitating the<note n="*" place="margin">Ten or Twelve of which are ſaid in a Morning one after another.</note> Popiſh
Maſſes. Some dreaded the effects of theſe
Prayers when they called to mind the cuſtom
of their Predeceſſors, who uſed to uſher in
ſome Villany by Faſting and ſuch ſolemn Prayers, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of <hi>Nero,</hi> that when he ſolemnly conſulted the Gods, it
was a certain ſign that he intended ſome cruel and bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize:
But the more probable ſeemed to be that this was to
pray themſelves, if poſſible, into a moderate Temper, as the
King's Letter required, or to vindicate their want of it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62662:16"/>
more agreeable to the mind of God, ſeeing it was deny'd
them after ſo many Prayers. To this purpoſe one of them had a
very remarkable Expreſſion in his Prayer; for, having in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the reſt put up ſome petitions for Moderation, at
laſt he concludes with theſe words, But, O
Lord! to be free, it would be better to make
a clean<note n="*" place="margin">That is to turn all the Epiſcopal Clergy out of the Church.</note> 
               <hi>houſe.</hi> This Week they appointed
Committees for the ſeveral Affairs that were
before them, which ſat at their own convenience, and now and
then they met in full Aſſembly, but they paſs'd away the time
without doing any thing conſiderable, ſo that ſome began to
apply to them, <hi>Parturiunt Montes,</hi> &amp;c. The Moderator laid the
blame of it on the ill attendance of the Members of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
and the ſlow Proceedings of the Committee; but
the true reaſon was, That they were reſtrained by the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
ſent from Court, and the fears of encreaſing the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and prejudices of the Country, as alſo they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
retarded by the unskilfulneſs of their Brethren in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
Affairs of this Nature. The Old Men having for a
long time been diſuſed, and the Younger Sort wanting expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
there were beſides ſome little differences among the
Brethren, tho the Moderator did all he could to ſmother
them; for when there was any appearance of the leaſt Jar,
he referred the matter which was like to occaſion it, back to
the Committee to be further conſidered, and then as on all
other occaſions in his Prayer he thanked God for the <hi>Oneneſs</hi>
that was among them. For they endeavour'd to make the
World believe that there was great Harmony in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
which they talked of with a great deal of Fondneſs and
Vanity, eſpecially when the Cameronian Party joyn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to them, tho it may be juſtly ſaid that matters were
rather hudled up betwixt them, than any true Union effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and if the cunning of the Moderator had not prevented
it, the Breach was like to have been wider; For the two
Perſons that appear'd for the Cameronians, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Shiels,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Linnen</hi> gave in two Papers, one of Overtures, and
another defending their Practices as being moſt agreeable to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62662:16"/>
the Practices of the true Presbyterians, and upbraiding the
reſt as deſerting and apoſtatizing from them, which reflected
on all that ſat there, and yet they offered in the face of the
Aſſembly to make good and juſtifie the ſame. At firſt the
Moderator checkt and rebuk'd them, but perceiving they
would not ſubmit themſelves, they were firſt ſent out, and
then after ſome time call'd in again, and taken by the hand
and deſired to ſit down with the reſt, without entering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any debate. He told them upon their ſecond appearance,
that he knew they meaned well, and had done them ſervice,
and that they did expect good from them, tho at firſt he ſaid
they were raſh young Men, who had done much hurt to the
Church. The Sunday following both the Cameronians at
<hi>Reſtalridge,</hi> and the other Brethren in the Pulpits of the
Town, preach'd upon this Agreement and Union of the
Parties. The latter gave God thanks for it, and the former
juſtified themſelves, and declared that thereby they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
condemned their own former Practices, nor yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of the Corruptions that were among their Brethren.
The Cameronians in the Country having got information of
this Union, ſent ſome of their number to the Aſſembly with
ſome Papers, who were not allowed to come in before the
Aſſembly, but ſome of the Brethren were ſent out to confer
with them, who received their Papers, and giving them fair
Words, diſmiſſed them. The Papers having never been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
produc'd, the Contents of them were not known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Affair which came before the Aſſembly, the
firſt thing remarkable was the Buſineſs of Mr.</hi> Gabriel Simple
<hi>which took up ſome days; He had received a Call (as the
Word is) both from the People of</hi> Jedburgh, <hi>and alſo from
thoſe of</hi> Killpatrick, <hi>and each of them petition'd the Aſſembly
for him, becauſe of</hi> Spiritual Sibneſs and Paſtoral Relation
which they had to him; <hi>At the ſame time there was an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
read from no leſs than twelve Pariſhes in</hi> Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>as was pretended,</hi> deſiring that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gabriel</hi>
might not be taken from them, he having taken compaſſion on
them when they lay weltering in their Blood, and no Eye to pity
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62662:17"/>
them, and ſhewing that <hi>England</hi> was over-gone with Briars
and Thorns which would over-run <hi>Scotland</hi> too if Mr. <hi>Gabriel</hi>
did not weed them out, that by Mr. <hi>Gabriel's</hi> care twelve Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
were well provided, which could not be ſo well done by any
ordinary Man; That he had been twenty four Years among them
which was ſufficient to found a Paſtoral Relation. Mr. Gilbert
Rule <hi>ſeconded this Addreſs, and pleaded for thoſe of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,
<hi>that</hi> they might have the benefit of Mr. <hi>Gabriel;</hi>
alledging, that it was Charity to plant the Goſpel in <hi>England,</hi>
and he declar'd thaet he knew not only twelve Pariſhes, but that
for fifty Miles they wanted the Word of God; For (<hi>ſaid he</hi>)
betwixt <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> there was leſs practice of
Piety, than amongſt Papiſts, or Heathens, and therefore it was
fit to ſend Miniſters among them, he concluded his Diſcourſe thus,
That as we ought to plant the Goſpel where-ever we can, ſo the
Presbyterians of <hi>England</hi> having now a Liberty granted them
by King and Parliament they might very well call back ſuch as
had been driven in amongſt them in time of Perſecution. <hi>To
this laſt the Moderator reply'd, Mr.</hi> Gilbert, What if they
ſhould call you? <hi>And when he anſwer'd,</hi> that perhaps he would
then go, <hi>he ſaid to him, Mr.</hi> Gilbert, I do not think you ſo
great a Fool. <hi>But as to Mr.</hi> Gabriel <hi>the Moderator and the
generality of the Aſſembly were for calling him back to</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>alledging that Charity began at home, when they had
reaſon'd a long while upon the Matter too and again, Mr.</hi> Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<hi>ſtood up and ſaid, What needs this ado? For he had
heard that Mr.</hi> Gabriel <hi>durſt not return to</hi> Northumberland,
<hi>there being an Order from ſeveral Juſtices of Peace to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him, which Mr.</hi> Gabriel <hi>confeſs'd to be true. This
decided the matter as to</hi> Northumberland, <hi>and ſhewed that
Mr.</hi> Gabriel <hi>would have</hi> had his forc'd return coloured with a
Solemn invitation; <hi>and when it came to be conſider'd, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Jedburgh <hi>or</hi> Killpatrick <hi>ſhould have him; he diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his own Inclinations before it came to a Vote, telling that</hi>
Kirkpatrick <hi>had no Manſe for him, neither could he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Horſe at it, when the Votes were a ſtating Mr.</hi> Gabriel
Cunningham <hi>deſired the Moderator to pray</hi> for drowning the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62662:17"/>
noiſe of the Aſſembly. <hi>But Mr.</hi> Kirktoun <hi>anſwered,</hi> What needs
all this fool Praying, it was not the Cuſtom to pray at every
thing, <hi>ſo they paſt immediately to voting, and the Votes
carried it for</hi> Jebburgh, <hi>which no doubt was according to
Mr.</hi> Gabriel<hi>'s own deſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next great Affair was the removing Mr. <hi>George Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
from being Miniſter at <hi>Drumfries</hi> to be Profeſſor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which was made vacant by the Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the College, for that Dr. <hi>Strachan</hi> could not comply
with the Terms requir'd in the Act of Parliament. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> being Patrons of the place gave a <hi>Call</hi>
to Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> which was backed by the earneſt invitation
of ſome others about the Town. He indeed deſerves the
place better than any of that Party having qualifications of
Learning and Modeſty beyond what is uſual to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. But as the People of <hi>Drumfries</hi> were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with him, ſo neither was he willing of himſelf
to ſettle at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in his old decaying Years, eſpecially
when he perceived ſuch ſtrong prejudices againſt the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Party to encreaſe. The matter was referr'd to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
where it was long and hotly debated. The neceſſity
and importance of training up Youth was alledged for his
coming to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but he on the other hand ſaid, he was
more capable of doing good at <hi>Drumfries,</hi> and had ſtronger
ties and obligations to that place, and at laſt <hi>added that he
not only had not the inward call to accept of the Profeſſion of
Divinity,</hi> but did find in himſelf an inward averſion and
backwardneſs thereto, which he thought ſhould not be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for there was in it not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
occaſion'd the matter of the inward call to be conſidered
and debated. Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> ſaid, That <hi>it conſiſted in the internal
Qualifications for the place, and the outward harmonious Call
of the Church, and that as they were Judges of the firſt, ſo the
laſt would be known by putting it to a Vote:</hi> adding, <hi>That the
Spirit of God was a harmonious Spirit, and that the Spirit of the
Prophets was ſubject to the Prophets.</hi> Mr. <hi>Campbel</hi> reply'd,
That he put a wrong Gloſs on the Place, but however he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62662:18"/>
would not debate it now. It was referred back to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
and conſidered again in a full Aſſembly, and at laſt th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
matter was put to a Vote, having before they collected th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Votes prayed for direction therein. By the Votes it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
that he ſhould come to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> tho it was obſerved
that the more judicious part were againſt his coming, being
prevail'd upon by the weight of his own Arguments. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
after they had reſolved upon his coming, they allowed
him till <hi>Lammas</hi> following to remove himſelf and his Family
(as ſome ſay) as others would have, that he might in this
time bring his mind to cloſe with the Call of the Aſſembly,
becauſe he had ſaid, he would leave the Kingdom rather than
obey.</p>
            <p>A day or two after the Deciſion of this buſineſs concerning
Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> there came a Commiſſion from the Town of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drews</hi>
to My Lord <hi>Crawford</hi> to repreſent them in the Aſſembly:
The Moderator uſher'd it in with a great Commendation of
his Lordſhip, and the manifold Obligations which they had
to him, and regreted he had not been a Member of their Aſſembly ſooner, and that he had not his Commiſſion from a
Presbytery; for which, he ſaid, the Presbytery of <hi>Couper</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
ſhould be rebuked, in that they had neglected him.
But the reaſon was, (as I told you before) that it was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he ſhould have been Commiſſioner for the King. When
this Commiſſion was read, My Lord <hi>Crawford,</hi> (whoſe Joy
for which was to be ſeen in his Countenance) ſtood up, and
made a Diſcourſe about the Weight and Importance of that
Truſt, and of his Unworthineſs to be a Member of that Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Aſſembly, and deſired that they might allow him the
favour which they had granted to Mr. <hi>George Campbel,</hi> which
was to have till <hi>Lammas</hi> next to adviſe on it: His Lordſhip
not knowing well what to ſay, but thinking he was obliged
to ſay ſomething, fell on this Impertinence; which moved the
Spleen of the Aſſembly, and made them ſpoil the gravity of
their Meeting: And indeed who could forbear laughing, to
hear one make a ſcruple of acting by Commiſſion, when he
had made none to act without one; officiouſly attending the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62662:18"/>
ſeveral Seſſions of the Aſſembly, and particular Committees,
and giving his Opinion in all the Matters that came before
them. And what a ridiculous thing was it, to ask Nine Months
time to adviſe whether he ſhould be a Member of a Meeting
which was to be intirely diſſolved within a fortnight.</p>
            <p>After they had ſat ten or twelve days, they received a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
from two Perſons, the one was called <hi>Smith,</hi> the other
<hi>Grieve,</hi> in name of the Town of <hi>Dundee.</hi> In the Petition, which
was drawn up according to their uſual Canting Stile, they
complain'd of their want of the Miniſtry there, and deſired that
ſome might be ſent to them to preach the Goſpel; upon this
the Commiſſioner asked if the Epiſcopal Miniſters of that
place were legally turned out; and it being replyed that they
were deprived by the Privy Council a year ago; the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
was ſuffered to proceed in the buſineſs, who preſſed it
with great Earneſtneſs, telling the Aſſembly, that he knew
that not only in <hi>Dundee,</hi> but that in all <hi>Angus</hi> the Goſpel was
not preach'd, and that there was no true Miniſter there, tho
he and all the World beſides knew, that except one or two
Churches all the reſt of that Shire have Miniſters ſetled in them,
who daily exerciſe their Functions, but indeed they are Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal
Miniſters; whom neither he, nor others of that party
make any account of, for on all Occaſions they ſo expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as if the Goſpel and Miniſtry were confin'd to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Kirk. But to return to the buſineſs of <hi>Dundee</hi> and
<hi>Angus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew Bowie,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Reiel</hi> declared to the
Aſſembly, <hi>That they had been in that Country already by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the General Meeting, but that they had no incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from that People, on the contrary they had met with great
Diſcouragements, and perceived that they were ſo averſe and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for receiving the Goſpel, that it was needleſs to ſend any to
them; for they would not get an Auditory except in a Kirk, and
the People would not give them the Keys of the Kirk doors, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of them except they were compell'd by Authority.</hi> To which
the Moderator replyed, <hi>Brethren, as you have made an Offer of
the Goſpel to them in the name of the General Meeting, ſo you
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62662:19"/>
muſt now go and offer it in the name of the General Aſſembly;</hi> and
added, <hi>That they would recommend the Affair to the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
who would certainly ſee to their encouragement, and to have
the Keys of ſome Kirk or other given them.</hi> As for <hi>Dundee,</hi>
which was ſaid to be generally refractory, the Moderator ſaid,
<hi>They could and would plant Miniſters and Elders therein, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Town Council would or not.</hi> Which if it be not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion,
let the World judg: When it was deſired that ſome
others might be added to theſe two Brethren, Mr. <hi>William
Spence</hi> ſometime Miniſter of <hi>Glendoven</hi> was named by ſeveral,
which was oppoſed by others, becauſe the removing of him
would leave the Presbytery of <hi>Aughterarder</hi> without a <hi>Quorum,</hi>
as I mentioned before; however after ſome Debate, it was
carried he ſhould go: And other three alſo were appointed
to be in readineſs upon advertiſement of the ſucceſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of theſe Brethren. As for this Mr. <hi>William Spence,</hi>
one of the Apoſtles for <hi>Angus</hi> he ſerved ſome years under Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy,
but having deſired an Augmentation of his Stipend,
and it being refuſed; he conceived a Picque at the Biſhops,
becauſe they gave him not (as he judged) due Aſſiſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Commiſſion of the Kirk, which he firſt vented by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſevere Reflections upon them, and afterwards he grew
to that height, that he diſperſed Papers beſpattering both
them and the Government, and addreſſed to the Presbytery
for a Reformation: His Fellow Presbyters endeavoured to
reclaim him, and to ſuppreſs his Libels, but their Attempts
being in vain, the Matter was carried before the Biſhop and
Synod of <hi>Dumblane,</hi> who finding him obſtinate depoſed him,
and afterwards upon his further Contumacy and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
excommunicated him, which Cenſure was never yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, becauſe he never ſhewed any Repentance, neither
made any Application about it.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the receiving of this Petition from <hi>Dundee,</hi>
there came a Letter to the Aſſembly from <hi>Aberdeen</hi> ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by ſome Phanaticks there; who, I aſſure you, in that
Place are neither conſiderable for Number, nor Quality. The
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62662:19"/>
Letter was to the ſame purpoſe, deſiring the Aſſembly to
ſend them Miniſters, and complaining that they had want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Goſpel for Thirty Years. Mr. <hi>George Meldrum</hi> was
preſent when this Letter was read, and neither contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
the Aſſertion nor qualified it; but ſuffered it to paſs
without any Reflection or Cenſure. Which ſilence of his
was admired by thoſe that knew him, neither could they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
it, conſidering that he both knew the place particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and could not but be convinced that the Goſpel had been
preached there, in as great Purity as in any place in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
For not to ſpeak of the preſent Miniſters of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who have the Approbation of all wiſe and judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
both for preaching and other Qualifications. Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
Lyall,</hi> now at <hi>Montroſs,</hi> was a long time Miniſter there,
and is eſteemed to have a good Talent of popular preaching.
Mr. <hi>John Menzies</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity, who was ever
eſteemed an eloquent Preacher, as well as a learned Man,
continued in the exerciſe of his Miniſtry there, till the year
1684, and Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> himſelf was Twenty of theſe years
Miniſter there alſo; and Dr. <hi>Garden</hi> who ſucceeded him muſt
be acknowledged to be both a knowing man and an able
Preacher; one who teacheth the truth in ſincerity, without
reſpect of Perſons. So that Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi>'s new Intereſt muſt
have ſtrongly perverted his Judgment, or he may be juſtly
charged with Hypocriſie and Cowardice; ſeeing, for fear of
diſpleaſing a Party, he would not own the truth on ſo fair an
Occaſion. The Presbyterians ſpeak much againſt a ſinful ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and certainly ſuch was his at this time. Some alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the ſending of this Letter was a Device of his own,
to get himſelf ſent back to <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> for one would have
thought that the Aſſembly would rather have ſent him than
another, becauſe he might be ſuppoſed to know both the place
and the People beſt where he had been ſo long Miniſter; but
the Aſſembly took no notice of him, and appointed two to
go thither to preach the Goſpel, of which one was Mr. <hi>Shiel</hi>
a <hi>Cameronian.</hi> So that as Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> fell off from the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62662:20"/>
Epiſcopal Party becauſe he was not permitted to return to
his Place at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> for the ſame Reaſon he ſhould now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the Presbyterians, ſeeing they would not reſtore him
unto it.</p>
            <p>Upon ſome other occaſion it was propoſed by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
to ſend ſome other Perſons to make an offer of the
Goſpel to the reſt of the Northern-Shires; accordingly an Act
paſt, appointing ſeveral (I know not the exact number) who
were commended to the Council for their <hi>Viaticum,</hi> as the
Moderator worded it, which Mr. <hi>Fraſer</hi> of <hi>Brae</hi> found fault
with as ſordid, and then he wiſht them to call it Maintenance
or Proviſion, or what they pleaſed, for they knew his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well enough.</p>
            <p>But that which is moſt remarkable, is, that in this as well
as the two former inſtances, Perſons were commiſſionated to
preach and make an offer of the Goſpel; for in theſe very
Terms it was propoſed, ſtated, voted and determined, as
if they were going to convert Pagans and Infidels; this
ſhews their Ignorance and Uncharitableneſs, and is to ſome a
juſt ground (tho there were no other reaſon) for ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from them, and refuſing Communion with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they divide from the Catholick Church in all Ages,
they pervert and alter the nature of the Goſpel, and teach
another Goſpel than what is to be found in Scripture. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they cannot juſtifie their preſent Proceedings, and all
this noiſe they make in ſetting up themſelves, unleſs their
way (as they uſe to ſpeak) be of equal importance with
the Goſpel it ſelf; but if the Goſpel be in the Scripture,
the Epiſcopal Party have preached it more plainly and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than they. And if they teach another Goſpel than what
has been taught by the former, they muſt leave the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and with the Papiſts have recourſe to vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Traditions, or to the more vain Imaginations of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts.</hi>

Before I relate to you any more of their Acts, I'll divert
you with an account how the Aſſembly dealt with ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
as had appealed to them upon the hope of milder
Treatment and greater Juſtice than what had been found in
the particular Presbyteries. If you had ſeen the laſt Letter
they ſent to the King, as it was firſt preſented to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to be approved and ſubſcribed, you would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that all Grievances had been redreſſed, and that the
Epiſcopal Clergy had received a reparation of all the Wrongs
which they had complained of, for the Letter expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
ſo much, but the Libel was ſo groſs that it could not
paſs tho the Moderator urged it, wherefore the amendment
of it being referred to Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Wyllie,</hi>
they made it run thus; That the ſame was recommended to
the Commiſſioners of the Aſſembly, and ſeveral Synods to
be redreſſed. How true even this is, I cannot tell, time will
ſhew, but ſure I am 'twas not done by the Aſſembly, for
they ſhifted off the examination of theſe Appeals, ſaying it
was injurious to the Presbyteries to queſtion the juſtice and
legality of their Proceedings, and preſſed that the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
might be referred back to the particular Presbyteries
and Synods from which they had appealed, which was done,
and that was equivalent to the approving all that was done,
becauſe none would condemn their own Proceedings. The
Affair of <hi>Peebles</hi> is an evident proof that the Aſſembly was
not willing to canvaſs the Actings of any Presbytery, far
leſs to renverſe their Orders and Sentences. The Duke of
<hi>Queensberry</hi> being not only Patron, but alſo a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Heritor of the Pariſh, was as well as others both in point
of Honour and Intereſt concerned to have the matter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed;
and Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> who was called to be Miniſter there
righted. Wherefore the Duke recommended the Buſineſs
with great earneſtneſs to the Commiſſioner, that it might be
brought before the Aſſembly, being confident that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
would not take upon them to approve the Proceedings
of the Presbytery, who had governed themſelves neither by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62662:21"/>
Reaſon, Juſtice, nor Equity in the Matter; as was made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in a printed Information which I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſent you;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the firſt Paper.</note> whereupon the Commiſſioner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed
ſo far as to get it one day propoſed in a
full Aſſembly; but when the Clark took up the Proceſs to
read it, there was ſuch murmuring among the Brethren,
that what he read could neither be heard nor underſtood,
and ſome two or three whiſpered the Moderator in the Ear;
ſo that before the Clark had read ſix lines, he ſtood up, and
addreſſing to the Commiſſioner told his Grace, that it was
fit to wave this Affair for the preſent, that the Brethren
were diſpleaſed that it was brought in ſo abruptly before the
Aſſembly, when it had not been conſidered in the Committee,
that they were not ripe enough as yet to take cognizance of
it, and that there were ſeveral particulars in that Affair
which were not fit to be ſpoken of in publick; to which the
Commiſſioner yielded either out of too much good Nature,
or out of fear that the ſtubborn and forward Men would
have baffled his Authority if he had offered to oblige them
to do any thing againſt their will. To ſave his Credit in
yielding to the Aſſembly, he required them peremptorily to
fall upon it at the next meeting; the Moderator promiſed it,
but there was never a Syllable more of it, nor it ſeems did
the Commiſſioner think ſit to ſtart it again. Before I leave
this Matter, I muſt tell you a remarkable paſſage in Mr. <hi>Veatch</hi>
his Anſwer which he publiſh'd to that printed Information
which I ſpake of before: <hi>That whereas it was objected that
he had not a popular Call to the Pariſh of</hi> Peebles. <hi>This,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>ought not to militate againſt me; for if by ſuch a Call be
meant an unanimous Call of all, or the greateſt part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;
it can be expected but in very few places of the Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to a Presbyterian Miniſter, and never at all,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be hoped
for in the Pariſh of</hi> Peebles. This indeed is a certain Truth,
but it was thought ſtrange to ſee a Presbyterian ſo plainly
confeſs it, ſeeing hitherto they would have the King, and
all the World believe, that both their Perſons and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62662:21"/>
were moſt agreeable to the Inclinations of the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Mr. <hi>Veatch</hi> had not his Wits about him when he let fall this
Declaration, and it ſeems was more intent upon his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
than the general Intereſt of the Party he belongs to;
for hereby he gives a Lie unto the Parliament, lover turns the
Ground whereon the Government was built, and plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates
that he and his Brethren are, and muſt be Intruders,
ſeeing they cannot have the call and conſent of the People.
The want whereof was charged heavily on the Epiſcopal
Clergy in the Weſt by Mr. <hi>George Meldrum</hi> in a Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Parliament, who thought it ſo heinous a Crime, that
he ſaid, <hi>before he obtruded himſelf upon a People againſt their
own will, he would chuſe rather to beg his Fraught and go to</hi>
America: It were to be wiſhed that all his Brethren were
of that mind, for then the Nation would be ſoon rid of
them; and I aſſure you they might have their Fraught
without begging it; for both Gentry and Commons would
pay that more chearfully than their Stipends. Now if it was
a Crime in the Epiſcopal Clergy to take the Cure of a Pariſh
without the expreſs formal conſent of the People, what may
it be thought in a Presbyterian to come in upon a People
when they expreſly declared and proteſt againſt him. I
know no other way of juſtifying this, but by aſſerting the
Doctrine which one of their Laicks raiſed from <hi>ver. 6. Pſal.</hi> 119.
while he was lecturing to the Neighbour-hood, <hi>viz.</hi> The
People of God may ſin, but the Wicked muſt not ſin, and there
is a heavy Vengeance waiting them if they do; but we will
leave this, and return to the Point we were upon.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly was juſt ſo puzzled with the Appeals of the
Epiſcopal Clergy, as their Anceſtors the Phariſees were with
the queſtion about <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm; for on the one ſide they
feared the Court who deſired and required them to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
and indeed they perceived that it was their Intereſt
at this time to make ſome ſhew of Moderation. But on the
other hand it was againſt their Intereſt to condemn the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Presbyteries, nor could they do it becauſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62662:22"/>
they were agreeable to the Rules concerted and preſcribed
by the general Meeting; ſo following the policy of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
they waved the difficulty by remitting all to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and particular Synods. By this means they ſecured what
was already done from being renverſt, and alſo freed the
Aſſembly from the blame of any Injury or Injuſtice done,
or to be done; for then theſe things might be charged on
particular Perſons, and not on the whole Party. However
they ventured upon three or four Proceſſes, and by them
you may gueſs what they would have done with the reſt.
The firſt was, That of Mr. <hi>Lesk</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Turreff</hi> within
the Dioceſs of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> whoſe Church was claimed by one
Mr. <hi>Arthur Mitchell</hi> by vertue of that Act of Parliament,
which reſtored the old Presbyterians to their Churches whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were vacant or poſſeſſed by others. Mr. <hi>Lesk</hi> firſt
made Application to the Council, and thought to have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended
Mr. <hi>Mitchell,</hi> as not being comprehended within the
Act of Parliament, which only was deſigned in favour of
theſe, who had left their Miniſtry for not complying with
Epiſcopacy; whereas Mr. <hi>Mitchell</hi> was depoſed, and deprived
long before that time: But that not taking effect, the Matter
was brought before the Aſſembly, where Mr. <hi>Lesk</hi> inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Mr. <hi>Arthur Mitchell</hi> was never legally ſettled Miniſter
of <hi>Turreff;</hi> that about the Year 1655. he was actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
and that tho he continued to preach there by means
of a prevailing Faction of Remonſtrators under the Uſurper,
he was never look'd upon as Miniſter of the place: and
that in the Year 60. the Synod of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> being freed of the
force and reſtraint that was formerly upon them, did ratifie
the former Sentence of Depoſition. And as for himſelf he
pleaded that he had been legally ſetled Miniſter according
to the Laws of the Land, that he had ſubmitted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Civil Government, which had promiſed protection to
them who did ſo; and that the Heritors, and People of his
Pariſh were for his continuance among them, and altogether
averſe to Mr. <hi>Arthur Mitchell.</hi> To prove this laſt, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62662:22"/>
a Declaration and Petition ſubſcribed by the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and others of the Pariſh. Mr. <hi>Mitchell</hi> alledged that
one or two of the Subſcriptions were not genuine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the whole ought to be neglected as a Forgery.
Mr. <hi>Lesk</hi> replyed, That he laid not the ſtreſs of this Cauſe
on that Paper, that he only produc'd it as an Adminicle, that
he had not gone about ſeeking Subſcriptions, for he looked
upon that as below the Character of a Miniſter; but that it
was given him by honeſt Men, and therefore he had reaſon
to believe the Subſcriptions genuine. And if they laid any
ſtreſs on the Inclinations of the People, if a competent time
were allowed him, he would eaſily prove that they were for
him; but at preſent it was to be conſidered whether he was
legal and rightful Miniſter of that place. After two days de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
it came to a Vote; and the Vote was not whether Mr.
<hi>Lesk</hi> or Mr. <hi>Mitchell</hi> ſhould be continued Miniſter at <hi>Turreff;</hi>
but whether Mr. <hi>Mitchell</hi> was not rightful Miniſter <hi>Anno</hi> 1661.
and only turned out by the unjuſt courſes of the Times, and
whether he was not now to be looked upon as rightful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
there; which Vote was carried in the affirmative, and
Mr. <hi>Lesk</hi> being called in, was told that the Aſſembly had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
him, and ordained Mr. <hi>Arthur Mitchell</hi> to be Miniſter
at <hi>Turreff.</hi> He asked the reaſons of their Sentence, which
were refuſed; but what ever might have been pretended,
the true reaſon was, That they were glad of any pretence for
caſting out Epiſcopal Miniſters, who were always in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Diſcourſes called the Prieſts of <hi>Baal.</hi> By virtue of
that Act of Parliament I juſt now mentioned, all the Churches
were taken from the Epiſcopal Miniſters, to which any Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
had the leaſt pretence, tho the former had comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Civil Government, and the other were ſetled
in other places which they were not reſolved to leave. So
for inſtance, Mr. <hi>James Kirkton</hi> who hath a Meeting-houſe in
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and is called to be one of the Miniſters of that
City went out to the Pariſh of <hi>Martine,</hi> where he had been
formerly Miniſter, and forced away Mr. <hi>Andrew Meldrum</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62662:23"/>
Miniſter without allowing him time to diſpoſe of his
Goods; and after he had performed this noble and heroick
Exploit, and preached a Sunday or two to get a right to
the Stipend, he returned to his Charge at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
turned his back upon that in the Country, as if there had
been no more to be feared, ſeeing the Curate was driven
away.</p>
            <p>The next Appeal which I ſuppoſe was conſidered, was
that of Mr. <hi>Sleery</hi> from the Presbytery of <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> he was
a Miniſter of the Weſt, who had been rabbled out of his own
Church, and thereafter was deſired by the Miniſter of <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi>
to ſerve his Cure during his Sickneſs, which he did; and
when that Miniſter died, the Heritors and People of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
upon the experience they had of him, deſired that he
might continue to preach to them, promiſing that when the
Government was ſetled, they would take care to get him a
legal Title to the Pariſh: but it being firmly reſolved on by
all poſſible means to put out and diſable all Epiſcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
the Presbytery of <hi>Linlithgow</hi> cauſed the ſaid Mr. <hi>Sleery</hi>
to be cited before them, who compeiring, was interrogated
by what Authority he preached at <hi>Falkirk,</hi> and how he came
to uſe the Doxology. The laſt, he ſaid, was the cuſtom of
the place, and that he did the firſt at the deſire of the
People. The Presbytery not being ſatisfied with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to theſe, and ſome other Queſtions, diſcharged him
from preaching there any longer, and declared the Church
vacant, to which Sentence he refuſed to ſubmit, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed;
therefore it was neceſſary to interpoſe the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Aſſembly, for diſpoſſeſſing him of that Church
which was the reaſon why he was called upon. When he
compeired, the Moderator askt him if he acknowledged the
Civil Government, and if he would ſubmit to that of the
Church, to both which he anſwered affirmatively; but when
it was askt him if he repented of his compliance with Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy,
he ſaid, If it was a Sin he would repent of it.
His Anſwer did neither pleaſe nor ſatisfie them; for the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62662:23"/>
Moderator told him it ſeemed he yet doubted whether it
was a Sin or not. So finding by this and ſome other
things, that he was not yet a through Convert, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
him of his Church, and diſcharged him the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>A third Perſon brought before the Aſſembly was one
Mr. <hi>Forſeith</hi> Miniſter at St. <hi>Ninians,</hi> he was accuſed for
marrying a Man to his firſt Wives Neice, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
before the Aſſembly; and alſo that he had been
informed of the Relation, and diſwaded from doing it by
the Epiſcopal Clergy, amongſt whom he lived. All his
excuſe was, that he was not much himſelf when he did
it, being in great confuſion and conſternation becauſe of
the Rabble that was then up, and who continually threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him as they had fallen upon his Neighbour Miniſters.
And he further alledged, that it was the only miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
he could be charged with in thirty five Years Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of the Miniſtry, and therefore he deſired the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to pardon him, and to reſtore him. This they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
and confirmed the Sentence of his Depoſition, which
was very juſt, and the only juſtifiable Act of the Aſſembly
from its ſitting down to its riſing.</p>
            <p>A fourth Affair which the Aſſembly had before them,
was that of Mr. <hi>John Mekenzie</hi> at <hi>Kirkliſton.</hi> I ſuppoſe
you have ſeen an account of his Proceſs before the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
of <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> for he carried it up with him to
<hi>London</hi> to ſhew it to his Friends there. But in caſe you
have not met with him, nor received an account of the
whole Matter, take it in ſhort thus. When rabbling was
practiſed and in faſhion here, he amongſt many others
of his Brethren had the Church Doors ſhut againſt him,
and by this means was hindred from the Exerciſe of his
Miniſtry in that Pariſh; but having complyed with the
Civil Government, he made an intereſt by his Friends to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62662:24"/>
maintain his legal Right and Title to the ſaid Church,
which vexed and gall'd the Presbyterians, who by this
means were kept from ſetling a Miniſter of their own
Perſwaſion there. All endeavours were uſed to remove
him: Firſt, They ſet him upon him to dimit voluntarily,
which he refuſing, they next threatned to force him to
it upon Articles of Scandal. But his Innocence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable
Converſation being ſufficient proof againſt that;
they at laſt purſued him before the Presbytery of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgow,</hi>
upon the pretence of deſerting his People. He
appeared before them, and defended himſelf, declaring
he was always ready and willing to exerciſe his Miniſtry
if the Rabble would have ſuffered him, and allowed
him acceſs to his Church, and therefore the fault did
not lie at his door. Upon this he was blamed for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contemptibly of the Rabble who were ſaid to be
the <hi>neceſſary</hi> Preliminaries <hi>to the Government both of Church
and State,</hi> and from that they would have been infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſecret diſaffection to both. The Presbytery were
forced to vindicate him from all imputation of Scandal,
and for a mark of their ſingular and extraordinary favour,
they ſaid they would give him recommendatory Letters
to put him in capacity of being elected Miniſter of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pariſh; but ſtill they urg'd his quitting of that of
<hi>Kirkliſton:</hi> and when he perceived that they had firmly
reſolved to declare his Church vacant to gratifie the Rabble,
and ſome few other unreaſonable Perſons who were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
with him, he appealled from them to the King,
and the next lawfully called general Aſſembly. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Tenor of his Appeal, many of the Aſſembly ſpake
againſt the receiving or ſuſtaining it, alledging that it was
not to them he appealed, for his expreſſion did imply
that this Aſſembly was not lawfully called, ſeeing it was
called before he appealed, and yet he made no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
reference to it. Beſides, ſaid they, it's clear he
means an Epiſcopal Aſſembly by his appealing to the King
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62662:24"/>
joyntly with the Aſſembly; for theſe Epiſcopalians do
make the King the Head of the Church, whereas we
cannot own any ſuch thing. My Lord <hi>Arbruchel</hi> deſired
the Aſſembly to be favourable to him, for he knew him
to be well affected to the Government, and that he had
ſerved the King abroad for the ſpace of ſeven Years. To
which one replyed, <hi>That he was as well paid for it: he
ſerved him for Wages, and ſo would he have done the</hi> Turk
<hi>too.</hi> They were much irritated by his going to <hi>London</hi>
to repreſent their Proceedings, and to clamour againſt
them; Every Man took occaſion to vent his paſſion and
pique at him; ſome ſaid he was Scandalous, and called
him a Drunkard and Swearer; ſome called him one thing,
and ſome another, and one ſaid he ſhould be depoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was a proud, ſtubborn and inſolent Fellow. The
Commiſſioner apprehending there would be little Juſtice
where there was ſo much pique and prejudice, deſired
the Moderator to delay the Affair, and to allow the young
Man time to appear and anſwer for himſelf: but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
replied, That it was beſt to proceed now, and
more for the young Man's Reputation, for if he were
preſent they would be obliged to take notice of ſome
Crimes, and Scandals which now they would paſs over
without inquiring into them, forgetting that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
had acquitted him of all ſuch Guilt, and that he
himſelf had given him a good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Teſtimony when the Affair
was firſt brought before the Aſſembly. The Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
ſtill urging that they would deal tenderly and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with him; Indeed (replied the Moderator) <hi>Your Grace
ſhall find that we will uſe great tenderneſs towards the Young
Man, and we ſhall be very diſcreet, for we ſhall only</hi> take <hi>his
Kirk from him,</hi> which they did immediately. So that you
have a Sample of the Presbyterian Tenderneſs, which I
think is very near a Kin to the tender Mercies of the
Wicked, which <hi>Solomon</hi> declareth to be cruel; for when
they deprive one of his Livelihood and Good-name, they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62662:25"/>
call it Tenderneſs; and if it be ſo, I pray God ſave us
from their Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Except theſe four, I heard of no other Proceſſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Epiſcopal Clergy were concerned, that were revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and diſcuſſed before the Aſſembly, there were indeed
one or two more mentioned, by the Intereſt made by the
Perſons concerned:<note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Paper.</note> As the Buſineſs of Mr. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi>
in <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> in <hi>Dumbar,</hi> but
they with the reſt were referred back to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Synods and Presbyteries.</p>
            <p>All this while the Presbyterians had been intent upon
the emptying of Churches, now at laſt they began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how Churches ſhould be filled, and Vacancies ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
They wanted Labourers for their Harveſt, and
therefore they firſt paſſed an Act, For calling home ſuch
of their Party as were ſerving in other places abroad;
and appointed the drawing up, and directing of Letters
for acquainting thoſe in <hi>Holland</hi> particularly with the
Mind of the Aſſembly and the Neceſſity of the Church:
It happened that of theſe who were ſpoken of, one was
dead, and another detained Priſoner in <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one ſaid at the reading of the Letter, That the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
needed the Power of Miracles, for bringing back
the one, and that they ought to addreſs to the <hi>French</hi>
King to obtain the other. In the next place for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
the number of the Brethren, they appointed ſome
to ſearch out, and to give in Liſts of ſuch as were thought
fit to be called to the Miniſtry. And indeed they may
come to have enough of them, by the Meaſures and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
which they lay down and follow; but they are
not like to have many learned and knowing men; for
they ſet light of Learning and Knowledg, and do often
run it down: <hi>Zeal for the Good Cauſe</hi> is the chief Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and ſerves inſtead of Learning and other Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62662:25"/>
The Epiſcopal Candidates are thought as
dangerous as thoſe who are actually in Office: Therefore
inſtead of theſe who have been ſeveral years fitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for the holy Miniſtry by proper and uſeful Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
they are putting others upon the Deſign who never
ſtudied at all, neither have any competent meaſure of
Learning for it. Brewers and illiterate Tradeſmen are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up to be Miniſters. Not to trouble you with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inſtances; one <hi>Ruſſel</hi> a <hi>Coalgrieve</hi> in <hi>Fife</hi> is made
Miniſter at <hi>Kennaway:</hi> What Talent of Learning he has
you may eaſily gueſs, when you may underſtand that he
is altogether ignorant of the Latine: When he was paſſing
his Tryals before the Presbytery, they according to their
Cuſtom preſcribed him a Latine Exerciſe in ſome Head
of Divinity, which he earneſtly declined; and when they
would needs keep up the Formality, he complained for
obliging him to pray and preach in an unknown Tongue:
Having miſerably bungled through the Diſcourſe, when
it came to the Diſputes, Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> at <hi>Leſlie</hi> propoſed
an Argument by way of <hi>Enthymema,</hi> and he denyed the
Major, having been at pains to conn the Terms <hi>Major</hi>
and <hi>Minor</hi> before he came there, and his Inſtructer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forgot to tell him the different ways of Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
Then Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> putting his Terms in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
form of an Hypothetick Syllogiſm, fancying he
might underſtand that: When the Syllogiſm was repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he ſaid to the Proponent <hi>explica terminos Minoris,</hi>
which was <hi>Sed verum prius.</hi> Having gotten this Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of his Learning, the Presbytery acknowledged that
he indeed wanted Gifts, but he had Grace, and that
was ſufficient; and therefore they approved of him and
received him into the Miniſtry. Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> hearing that
he was ſo much upbraided with Ignorance, to wipe off
that Stain, he offered to make ſome Oſtentation of
Learning in a Sermon, by the Repetition of a Latine Verſe.
The Verſe he choſe was this common one; <hi>Regis ad
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62662:26"/>
Exemplum, &amp;c.</hi> But alaſs, the Way he took to ſave
his Reputation ruined it for ever, for he blundered
it thus,
<q>
                  <l>Regos ad Exemplas totis componitur orbos.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And as their Clergy are at preſent without Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſo it cannot be expected that their Succeſſors (if
they ſhall have any) will be any whit better,; for they
have laid, our Colleges waſt, driven away our learned
men, and have not qualified Perſons of their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to put in their places. The Univerſity of S. <hi>Andrew</hi>
is altogether laid waſt, there is neither Principal nor
Regent there, and thoſe who have ſucceeded to the
Vacancies in the Colleges of <hi>Glaſcow</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh</hi> are
known to be Perſons neither skilled in Books, nor any
part of good and uſeful Learning: So that they are not
capable of directing the Studies of the Youth which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
thither; nor is it to be ſuppoſed the Youth will
much regard their Advices, when 'tis evident that the
chief of them have need to be put back to learn their
Grammar. The Narrowneſs of the Presbyterian Spirit
is an Enemy to Knowledg, and will obſtruct all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for they not only count it Impiety to call their
commonly received Principles into Queſtion, but alſo they
reckon a free and rational Inquiry into the Grounds
and Reaſons of them to be very dangerous: They are
no leſs friends to implicite Faith, than the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and do not regard the Advice of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> which
is, <hi>That we ſhould be ready always to give an Anſwer to
every man that asketh a Reaſon of the Hope that is in us.</hi>
You may eaſily gueſs how ſqueamiſh they are about Points
of Divinity, when they make the <hi>Carteſian,</hi> and other
Syſtems of new Philoſophy to be groſs and damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62662:26"/>
So that if Presbyterianiſm prevail, all freedom of Spirit, all
improvements of reaſon and knowledge will be baniſh'd,
and the world muſt be condemned again to hear both in
Schools and Pulpits impertinent chat, a Clutter Clutter of
words and canting phraſes which cannot be underſtood.
They are great enemies to Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Learned Profeſſor
of Mathematicks in this place, they ſeek by all means to turn
him out, and ſay that theſe Sciences are not only uſeleſs but
dangerous: and indeed they have reaſon, for they are no
friends to ignorance and nonſence their peculiar properties.
But the want of kindneſs to Mr <hi>Gregory,</hi> and the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
is ſomewhat more excuſable in them; but that they
ſhould ſlight the knowledge of the Hebrew, and other orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
tongues is a little ſtrange, and cannot be juſtified ſeeing
the right underſtanding of the Scripture does ſo much depend
thereupon. They have thruſt out Mr. <hi>Alexander Douglaſs</hi> the
profeſſor of theſe languages here, who as he was a perſon of a
moſt peaceable diſpoſition, ſo he was an ornament to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
he lived in by his skill and knowledge in theſe matters:
he cannot have a true Succeſſor here, for he hath ſcarce his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
in this Kingdom, nor Perhaps are there many in other
places who do exceed him in the thing he profeſſeth. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Jewiſh Synagogue would have been found ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for Epiſcopacie, and therefore it is fit and wiſely done to
keep both Clergy &amp; Laity in ignorance of it. Their kindneſs
for the dead is as ſmal as for the living, &amp; they encourage lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
books as little as learned men. The trade of books is fallen
ſo low ſince the Presbyterian reign was ſet up, that our Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
are thinking either to quit their employments, or to go
and live elſewhere, for they have not made the rent of their
ſhops theſe two years. The Epiſcopall are not in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
for buying and the other crave no other books then
<hi>Durham</hi> on the <hi>Canticles</hi> and <hi>Revelation, Dickſon</hi> and <hi>Hutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Dyar</hi> and <hi>Gray,</hi> Theſe are their Claſſicall Authors and
the ſtandard of their learning: and 'tis from thoſe that they
take the heads of their Sermons, and the inſtructions which
they tender the people. But tho' learning be not the talent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62662:27"/>
of a Presbyterian, yet they have arrogated to themſelves the
gift of preaching; they have the name of Powerfull Soul-ſearching-Preachers:
whereas the Epiſcopall Miniſters are
only named dry moral Lecturers, and under this name ſlout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and abuſed both in Sermons and pray<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs.</p>
            <p>So vain were they of this gift of preaching that for ſome
time we had a new Sermon publiſhed by them every week;
they thinking thereby to gain and proſelite the whole nation,
But the Stratageme failed them, nay it prov'd to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;
for thereby peoples curioſity was diverted from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in the Churches, where they could not expect other
than noiſe and nonſenſe, ſeeing there was ſo much babble &amp;
in their printed, &amp; conſequently more deliberate diſcourſes.
An acquaintance of yours hath made a rare Collection of
notes of their Sermons both printed and unprinted. To which
I refer you for inſtances to prove the truth of what I have been
ſaying: The laſt Sermon that was publiſhed came forth the
firſt week of the Aſs. The Author is one Mr. <hi>James Clark</hi>
who preached in the meeting houſe at <hi>Dumbar.</hi> It was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>ad Clerum;</hi> preached, as was ſaid, at the depoſing of the
Parſon of <hi>Old-Hamſtocks,</hi> which being an extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſomething better then ordinary, was expected: but there
never appeared a more ſilly and empty diſcourſe, nor is it
poſſible that you can conceive ſo meanly of it, as it deſerves.
It was even far below Mr. <hi>Andrew Gray's</hi> Sermons. The very
Presbyterians whoſe guſt craves no fine things, were aſhamed
of it. My Lord <hi>Czawford</hi> to excuſe it laid the blame on the
Printer and complained of him at the Councill Table, for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to publiſh it without a Licenſe, alledging alſo that it
was without the Authors conſent, and that the Copy was an
imperfect uncorrect one, which ſome ignorant or malicious
perſon had taken from the Authors Mouth: But when the
Printer was examined, he produced an Authentick copy from
the Author himſelf, and declared that he reviſed the ſheets
as they came from the Preſs, ſo the Printer was free of the
faults that were in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they could be only charged on Mr.
<hi>Clark,</hi> who it's believed ſhew'd all the learning and eloquence
he was Maſter of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:62662:27"/>
But it is fit now we return to the Aſs. and give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what acts they paſs'd for regulating the diſcipline of
the Church for the future. The firſt of this kinde and the
firſt alſo of any other that paſſed in the Aſs. was an Act againſt
marriages without publick proclamations; as alſo againſt
the private adminiſtration of the two Sacraments, Baptiſme
and the Lords Supper. Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule</hi> preſs'd that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Baptiſme might not at all be adminiſtred but in
publick <hi>and after Sermon, and called the private adminiſtration</hi>
not only Superſtitious but alſo <hi>Sorcerie and Charming, and ſaid
further</hi> that the ſame was contrary to Scripture <hi>and Antiquity.
Mr</hi> Kirkton <hi>took him up briskly and ſaid that was diſputable, that
he could buckle him, or any man upon that point, but would not debate
it now.</hi> He added that <hi>by their rigorous impoſition of indifferent
things he had loſt five men of conſiderable note the laſt week, And
concluded tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there were a thouſand acts againſt it, he would rather
Baptize in private then ſuffer the Children to go to the Curates.</hi>
Some Highland Miniſters crayed that they might not be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that act becauſe it was impoſſible to bring all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of their pariſhes to the Kirks by reaſon of the vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſome of their people lived at from them; but whether
they intend to give a diſpenſation was not expreſſed. The
Moderator to excuſe their own practiſes heretofore ſaid,
<hi>there was a diſtinction both of times and places, for, ſaid he, in times
of Perſecution I think an honeſt Miniſter riding on the way, may go
into a mans houſe, Baptize a Bairn and come out and take his horſe
again.</hi> Tho' while they were under reſtraint, they made no
Scruple of baptizing privately the children of thoſe of their
own perſwaſion, yet now they refuſe to baptize any except
in publick; nor will they do it but when there is a Sermon:
and they are ſo ſtrict upon the point that they ſuffer the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to dye rather then ſlacken their rigour. In the Country
the benefit of Baptiſme can be only had on Sundays becauſe
then only there is preaching; and if Children cannot live ſo
long they muſt take their hazard of departing without that
ſign and Seal of their Salvation. I know a Pariſh where two
or three perſons importuned the Miniſter to baptize their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62662:28"/>
Children publickly or privately as he pleaſed: but he peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
refuſed to do it on a week-day, tho' they who intended
to have been preſent at the baptiſme would have made a
competent number for an ordinary Country Sermon, and
before Sunday two of the Children dyed: we had lately in
this City a more notable inſtance of the ſtiffneſs of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in this particular. A Certain Citizen deſigned to have
his child baptized on a week day at the ordinary time of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
he with the Goſſips came in time enough to the Church,
but becauſe the child was brought in about the cloſe of the
Sermon, neither Mr. <hi>Kennedy</hi> who preached, nor Mr. <hi>Ers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kine</hi>
the Miniſter of the pariſh could be prevailed with to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the Sacrament to the Infant, but they cauſed it to be
carried home again without baptiſm. The people generally
take this very ill, and are very much diſpleaſed with the
Presbyterian Miniſters on this account. Wherefore to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
themſelves, they frequently preach againſt the neceſſity of
Baptiſm, and to talk of it as if it were an ordinance neither
neceſſary nor much to be regarded, and do account the eſteem
and value which is ordinarily put upon it, and earneſt deſires
the people have after it, to be the dregs and reliques of Popery
among us. When a child was brought to Mr. <hi>Kirkton</hi> he took
occaſion to ſhew the Superſtition of that Ceremony, and ſaid
to the People, you think it neceſſary to have your Children
Baptized, but I tell you (ſaid he) I know a good Godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
who lived till he was fourſcore that was never Baptized
all his life time.</p>
            <p>In the next place, they renewed an Act of a Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
appointing Pedagogues, Chaplains, Preachers, and
Students to take and ſubſcribe the Confeſſion of faith; and
further they Commiſſionated ſome to draw up a liſt of all
theſe acts of Aſſemblies which were fit to to be obſerved and
put in uſe, wherein they acted very cunningly, for tho' it be
well known that they receive all the acts of Aſſemblies as if
they were Scripture, and pay no leſs regard to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome of theſe incroach upon the power of the Civil
Magiſtrate, Therefore to prevent the Jealouſies of the King
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62662:28"/>
they would not make a generall Act ratifying and approving
them in <hi>Cumulo,</hi> nor yet would they condemn or cenſure any
of them. But they enforced ſuch as were proper and ſuitable
to the preſent ſtate of affairs, and waved the declaration of
their ſentiments concerning the reſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe the Aſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not ſit ſo long as was
neceſſary to determine all particulars and to give rules and
meaſures for the ſetling of the Church in this juncture, nor
was it ſit it ſhould do it; Therefore they reſolved to chuſe
a Committee who might ſit after the diſſolution of the Aſs.
who ſhould have full and Supream Power to Act in all things
that related to the Church. It's ſaid, that this overture was
firſt made by the Moderate men, who thought by this means
to reduce affairs to a better temper then the Aſs. was like to
do, by reaſon of the many rigid and indiſcreet men who
were in it. Therefore ſix were propoſed to be a part of this
Committee, and to name the other Perſons of whom the
Committee ſhould conſiſt. Four of theſe ſix went under the
Character of Moderate men, the other two were of another
temper, and were joyned to them on purpoſe to prevent
ſuſpition: But the High flown Brethren ſoon ſmell'd out
the deſign, and therefore they firſt Voted two more of their
own ſide, and becauſe that only put them in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> they
again got four more to be added, ſo that they were double
the number of the other, and by this means the Committee
conſiſted moſt part of the ſtricteſt and moſt rigid Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,

chooſe their own Moderator, and Clerk. The Inſtructions

they were not agreed to till the <hi>Tueſday</hi> thereafter. On <hi>Munday</hi>
they were read with ſome alterations: but Mr. <hi>Kirkton</hi> and a

was not a true Copy of that which the Committee had

of it, but the Moderator refuſed it, ſaying, he knew
nothing of the matter: and becauſe the Aſs. was not like to

referred back again to the Committee, and all who had any
thing to ſay about it were appointed to attend them. The next
day it was brought back again to the Aſs. and concluded; Mr.
<hi>Kirkton</hi> and ſome others who preſs'd alterations being abſent.
To ſatisfy your, and my own curioſity I uſed means to procure
a Copy of the inſtructions, and got them with ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which I here ſet down.</p>

                        <head>Inſtructions for the Committee or Commiſſion of the Kirk.</head>
                        <p>Firſt, they are to take into their Cognizance all references
and appeals not diſcuſs'd in the Aſſembly and ſuch matters
as have been ſtated before the Aſs. and referred to them, and
to diſcuſs and determine the famine.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they are to give their advice to all Synods and
Presbyteries when required, and tho' not required, yet upon
information of any irregularity or precipitancy of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in Presbyteries they are to interpoſe their advice for ſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proceſſes till the next Synod or Aſs.</p>
                        <p>When this <hi>2d.</hi> Article was read, ſome asked if the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had power to call before themſelves any buſineſs, and to
take the ſame out of the hands of Presbyteries. To which
the Moderator anſwered, no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they are only to give their
advice, and ſaid he, I think no Presbytery will refuſe it,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62662:30"/>
which if they do, it muſt be <hi>Cum periculo,</hi> and the Church of
<hi>Scotland</hi> will be free from any imputation of their actings.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they are to have power to viſit all Miniſters in
Presbyteries as well Presbyterian as others.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, they are to purge out of the Church all who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
due tryall ſhall be found inſufficient, Scandalous, Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or <hi>ſupinely negligent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was moved that the words <hi>ſupinely negligent</hi> might be
left out, but the ſame was refuſed.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, they are to be carefull that none be admitted by
them to Miniſterial Communion, or to a ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but ſuch as upon due tryall (for which the viſitors ſhall
take a competent time) ſhall be found to be Orthodox in their
doctrine, of competent abilities, having a pious, Godly and
peaceable Converſation as becometh a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
of an edifying gift, and whom the Commiſſion ſhall have
ground to believe will be faithfull to God and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

own and ſubſcribe the Confeſſion of Faith, and to profeſs
their ſubmiſſion and willingneſs to joyn and concur with the
Presbyterian Church-Government.</p>
                        <p>At firſt it was Presbyterian communion, and only faithful
to the Government. Mr. <hi>Kirkton</hi> ſaid that this Article was a
matter of very great conſequence, and deſired it might be well
conſidered, for in <hi>hoc vertitur fortuna Scotia,</hi> and complained
that there was not one word of the Scandal of conforming,
which he ſaid was the greateſt of all Scandals. Mr. <hi>Frazer</hi> of
<hi>Brae</hi> propoſed that the clauſe of repentance might be inſerted;
The Moderator anſwered, that in effect it was there already,
if they look't upon the Commiſſioners as diſcreet and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men; for ſo (ſaid he) they will admit none without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
for without that they cannot have ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that ever they will be faithfull to the Government. Mr.
<hi>Kirkton</hi> replyed, that they could never be ſure of Epiſcopall
Miniſters, for many of them (ſays he) has changed three or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62662:30"/>
four times already, and they will do it at every turn: Mr. <hi>William
Weir</hi> moved that they might be obliged to declare that they ſhould
neither by advice nor any other way endeavour the alteration
of the Presbyterian Government.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, that they be very Cautious in receiving in Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and forming Libels againſt the late Conformiſts, and preſent
Incumbents, and that they proceed in the matter of cenſure very
deliberately, ſo as that none may have juſt cauſe to complain of
their rigidity, yet ſo as to omit no means of information, and that
they ſhall not proceed to cenſure but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon relevant Libels and
ſufficient probations.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, that this Commiſſion do not meddle in publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
or in any thing not expreſſed in their Commiſſion, which is
hereby declared to be given them <hi>in hunc finem</hi> only <hi>&amp; pro preſenti
Eccleſiae ſtatum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Eightly, they ſhall be anſwerable, and cenſurable by the next
Generall Aſſembly, and ſhall continue till the firſt of <hi>Nov.</hi> next,
if there be no Generall Aſs. before that time.</p>

            </q>
            <p>By theſe Inſtructions it appears that the Committee was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſigned againſt the Epiſcopal Clergy, who as yet kept their
places becauſe of their compliance with the Civil Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Presbyterians can never be brought to have true kindneſs for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
Miniſters had they never ſo many recommendations for
their parts, piety, or their Intereſt in the favour of great men. But
on all occaſions they do draw back from them, and do refuſe to
concur with them in advancing even the Common ends of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and truth. And at this time they not only had an averſion to
them on the account of their different principles, but alſo they
were afraid to receive them into their communion, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into a ſhare of the Government, becauſe the Epiſcopal Clergy
was double their number, and therefore it was dangerous to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them, leſt by the plurality of their number on ſome fit occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they ſhould forge a change of the Government. They conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the Compliance and ſubmiſſion to Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which ſuch would give at this time, would not be free and
willing, but only out of a neceſſity to ſerve the preſent Turn till
they ſhould be better ſtated: Wherefore either to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62662:31"/>
upon the Enemies of their Government, or the better to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it, it was from the very firſt reſolved upon to lay aſide all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
Miniſters, unleſs they evidently teſtified a change of mind
as well as of outward behaviour. But how to compaſs this was the
difficulty, for a direct Act for this would make their deſign plain
and ſhew their malice bare fac'd, it would encreaſe the Clamours
and Prejudices of the people, nor could the ſtate in Equity ſuffer it
to paſs. The only expedient then was, to do it by ſome indirect
by-blow, by putting ſomething to them which they could not do;
&amp; by this means render them lyable to their cenſures, or which, if
they did, would proſtitute their reputation with the people, &amp; turn
them odious as men of no Principles, Honeſty, or Stedfaſtneſs. And
as they envyed them their reputation and favour, ſo they thought
if they could bring them to forfeit that, there would be little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in turning them out, neither needed they fear the doing of
it as occaſion offered. It was obſerved that the Faſts formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
went ill away with the Epiſcopal Clergy; ſome Miniſters
would not obſerve them at all, others would not read the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
appointing them, becauſe of ſome inſinuations which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
on Epiſcopacy, and thoſe who complyed with it, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
the people cenſured thoſe who read &amp; obſerved the ſame.</p>
            <p>Another Faſt therefore more plain and particular then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was thought the fitteſt Stratagem for procuring the ruine of
the Epiſcopal Clergy. The motion was no ſooner propoſed then
entertained, and a Committee appointed for the drawing up the
reaſons of it, which were publickly read in the Aſſembly <hi>Novemb.
11th.</hi> When the Clerk had done, the Moderator ſaid, <hi>Brethren, this
is a Savoury Paper, Indeed it is a moſt Savoury Paper, and worthy to be
heard over again.</hi> After a ſecond reading, Mr. <hi>Frazer</hi> of <hi>Brae</hi> asked
who was to obſerve the ſame, whether Presbyterian Miniſters or
Curates alſo <hi>Brother,</hi> ſaid the Moderator, <hi>that is not timely ſtated,
for we muſt firſt conſider the thing, and conclude that, and then we ſhall
conſider the perſons who ſhall obſerve it.</hi> Others ſaid, that what Mr.
<hi>Frazer</hi> had propoſed ought firſt to be conſidered. When they had
for ſome time exerciſed their wit about the reaſons of the Faſt, and
the way of wording it, the Moderator ask'd the Commiſſioner if
his Grace had any thing to ſay about it, who anſwered, yes, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62662:31"/>
therefore deſired it might be delayed till the next day, which was
accordingly done: the next day being the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>Nov.</hi> the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Faſt was again brought before the Aſs. and the paper
containing the reaſons of it read with this alteration, that <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy, and Teſt, and ſome ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
were left out:</hi> It would ſeem that the Commiſſioners refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſuffer it to paſs if theſe had been expreſly mentioned: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to get the Commiſſioner to condeſcend to the thing, they
daſht out the names: But he is an ignorant reader, and has little
skill in ſpelling who doth not perceive that they are all couch'd &amp;
implied. So this day the reaſons were approved, and an act paſs'd,
requiring all perſons throughout the Kingdom whether in Kirks
or Meeting houſes punctually to obſerve the ſame. I ſhould detain
you too long, if I ſhould give you an account of the reaſons here,
and paſs obſervations thereon. I chuſe rather to ſend you the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
it ſelf that you may ſee it and conſider it with your own eyes,
and at the firſt view of it you may be convinced how choaking it
will be to the Epiſcopal Clergy, who can neither in credit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
obſerve it; nor can any who are leſs intereſſed in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
Government go along with it, unleſs they could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that Epiſcopacy, is not only unlawfull but the cauſe and
occaſion of much wickedneſs and impiety, and the ſetting it up is
to apoſtatize from God, &amp; to make Defection from the truth. None
can obſerve this faſt for the reaſons enjoyned, but at the ſame time
they muſt condemn the <hi>Church of England</hi> and other Proteſtant
Churches, nay the Catholick Church of Chriſt from the Apoſtles
days down to <hi>Calvin.</hi> The Aſs. underſtood well enough how con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary
the deſign and reaſons of this faſt were to the ſentiments of
thoſe who were commanded to obſerve it, &amp; that they could not
keep it without being guilty of the greateſt Hypocriſy and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God: and therefore for them, for their own particular ends
to require men thus to mock God and play the Hypocrite, was a
horrid and moſt unjuſtifiable voice of villany, this ſhews that they
faſt for ſtrife and envy, and not to pleaſe God, but to enſnare men
not to avert the Divine Judgements but that they may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of executing their wrath and malice under the Colour and
ſhaddow of zeal againſt Sin. With the Act of the Aſs. for the fa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

I have ſent you alſo the act of Councill annexing the Civil Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to it procured by my Lord <hi>Crawford</hi>'s means:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the laſt Paper.</note> and
I deſire you to take Notice of the Cloſe of it, where
the Obſervation of the Faſt is Urged out of fear of Gods wrath,
and after that is ſubjoyned the higheſt perils from them, which
ſome ſaid was like the Proclamations of one <hi>Borthwi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k</hi> ſometimes
a Bayliff in this City, which were wont to be under the pain of
death, and fourty Pound beſides. The mentioning of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Acts brings to my Memory a paſſage of the Printer; Some in
hopes of getting gain thereby Petitioned the Aſs. for the gift of
publiſhing their Acts. Mrs. <hi>Anderſon</hi> claim'd the priviledge by
vertue of a gift from the King to print all publick Acts and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
and withall ſhe might have deſerved ſuch a ſavour from
them having ever heretofore Favoured their Party, and allowed
them the uſe of her Preſs for publiſhing their Pamphlets, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſuch as durſt not be well avowed. But either becauſe they
would have a Printer of their own diſtinct from the Kings, or
that they would not ſhew kindneſs to her, who had acceſſion to
the guilt of the late Reigns, by printing their ſinfull Acts and
Proclamations: for one or both theſe Reaſons they denied her
the Favour, and beſtowed it on <hi>George Moſman</hi> who repreſented
in his Petition, that he was not only always a true friend to their
Intereſt, but alſo a ſufferer for the Cauſe. And it's true he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Whig enough, but what his Sufferings were it is not well
known, ſeeing he ever lived peaceably at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and had the
freedome of a good trade, whereby he is become Fat every way.
Other men loſe by their Sufferings, but they gain by theirs even
in this life. So Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> died two Thouſand pound Sterling
rich who was not worth forty or fifty pound when he left his
charge. Tho' Mrs. <hi>Anderſon</hi> was repulſed by the Aſs. yet ſhe would
not give over, but next tried her Intereſt with the Councill, that
at leaſt ſhe might have the printing of thoſe Acts which had the Civil
Sanction added to them, they being comprehended within her gift. <hi>Crawford</hi>
who thinks all the Acts of the Presbyterians ſhould be like the Laws of the
<hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> ſtood up for <hi>Moſman,</hi> others pleaded Mrs. <hi>Anderſons</hi>
right, it not being in the power of the Councill, far leſs of the Aſs. to take
away their right and property or any part of it. But one ſaid ſmartly,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62662:32"/>
that the Caſe ſhould be ſtated not betwixt Mrs. <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Moſman,</hi> but
betwixt the King and the Aſs. whether the King ſhould yield to the Aſs.
or the Aſs. to the King My Lord <hi>Crawford</hi> thought the firſt no abſurdity,
and offered to produce inſtances of it in former times. But the reſt of the
Councellors thought they were obliged in Civility to prefer the King, and
ſo Mrs <hi>Anderſon</hi> carried it.</p>
            <p>I believe I may have wearied you with the length of my Letter,
I crave pardon only to add two or three particulars more, and I
ſhall cloſe. The firſt was, their appointing an anſwer to be made
to the printed accounts of the perſecution of the Epiſcopal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
in this Kingdom. At the generall meeting it was laid on Mr.
<hi>Meldrum</hi> who declin'd it. Then it was recommended to Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Pitcairine</hi> who did nothing in it. He excuſed himſelf before
the Aſs. in that he knew not the matters of fact and the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
was not ſent him. The Aſs. ordered him again to go on
in it, and appointed Mr <hi>Gilbert Rule,</hi> and ſome others to aſſiſt him
in the work, and required all the members to furniſh them with
Inſtructions proper for it. Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> in a Sermon before the
Aſs. offered to Juſtify the barbarities of the Rabble, and the ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
which the Epiſcopal Clergy met with, alledging that their
errors, vices and ſcandals deſerve no better at the peoples hands:
But what Juſtification &amp; defence will be made by thoſe who are
appointed to do it, in name of the Aſs: I do not know, but this I
am confident, that they will never prove any material circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in matter of fact to be falſe.</p>
            <p>A Second particular I am to make you acquainted with, is an
Act for taking off the ſentence of depoſition which was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
againſt ſome Miniſters, eſpecially thoſe of the Remonſtrators
party <hi>anno</hi> 1660 I told you before that it had been propoſed at the
General meeting, but was then laid aſide by reaſon of the miſtakes
that were like to ariſe among the Brethren about it Now the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
who was mainly concerned in the buſineſs finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a little better ſtated made an overture of it to the Aſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the day
it was diſſolved: and to obtain it the more eaſily, he brought it in
by way of a ſurprize: <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you may remember there were
once ſome unhappy differences among us, which ſome carried ſo high as to
proceed to inflict the ſentence of depoſition upon ſome on that account;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62662:33"/>
now I think it ſit before we part, that this ſentence be revoked; that as we
are all one mans bairns ſo we may be all alike ſtated.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule</hi>
replied, that he judged it better to bury theſe matters in oblivion,
that they could not paſs a generall Act for reponing theſe men
without re-examining their proceſſes, which was no ways fit; &amp;
perhaps they would not be found all alike, for ſome might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for Scandall and other Crimes, and not only for theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
heats and differences. The Moderator anſwered him, <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there is no need of condeſcending or particulars, and I believe they
will be found all alike, and that they are all very honeſt men that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:</hi>
So he named Mr. <hi>Wier</hi> and ſome others, and among the
reſt himſelf in the third perſon, ſaying, <hi>There is one Mr.</hi> Hugh
Kennedy, <hi>whom I warrant you ken all well enough.</hi> To conclude, the
Act paſſed, the ſentence of depoſition lying upon theſe perſons was
made void, and they declared to be true and lawfull Miniſters.
And herein truly the Moderators wit fail'd him, for inſtead of
righting himſelf which he deſigned, he raiſed objections againſt
himſelf which otherwiſe would have been forgotten; and by this
Act brought an indelible taſh both upon his own publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
theſe two three years, and alſo upon the preſent Aſs. in that
the Moderator and many of its members were both legally and
Canonically incapable. Now that they hear this, they pretend that
the ſentence was taken off formerly, and that the Aſs. only ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and confirmed what was formerly done in theſe mens favour,
and that it was uſuall to ratify in the firſt Generall Aſs. the Acts of
inferiour Judicatories. But as they cannot inſtance the time nor
the meeting in which theſe perſons were reponed, ſo they never
had any proper or avowed meeting for ſuch a buſineſs till the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
granted by King <hi>James;</hi> and we never heard it ſo much
as propoſed before in any of their avowed meetings till the laſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
one as was already declared; and either the ſentence lying
upon theſe perſons was valid or not: If it was not, then what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch a Solemn annulling of it by an Act of the Generall Aſs.
But if it was valid, then the Aſs, approved of men who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumatious
to the diſcipline &amp; government of their own Church;
for they received ſuch to be members of the Aſs. and alſo chooſed one of
that Gang to pr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſide in it, whatever may be ſaid as to the depoſition of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62662:33"/>
theſe men, if it was found expedient that the Aſs. ſhould paſs a verdict on
it, it had been prudent and proper to have done it before their admiſſion
as members; and if the Credit of the Aſs. had been regarded, they would
not have choſen a Moderator againſt whom there was ſuch a conſiderable
exception? certainly a leſs reaſon may invalidate the Authority of the Aſs.
render it unlawfull and unworthy to be owned and ſubmitted to.</p>
            <p>The laſt particular I ſhall trouble you with is about the chooſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
to go from the Aſs. to the King to make a true repreſentation
of their proceedings, to intreat the continuance of his favour, and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
themſelves from the aſperſions of their enemies. It's ſaid that Mr.
<hi>Carſtairs</hi> whom the king had ſent down with letters of inſtruction to the
Aſs. expected that they would have honoured him with that truſt, but
whether it was out of any Jealouſy of his conduct or faithfullneſs or if it
was to gratify others who might have had particular deſigns of their own
they paſſed by Mr. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arſtairs,</hi> and gave the Employment to Mr. <hi>Gilbert Ride</hi>
and Mr. <hi>David Blair.</hi> The firſt I have often had occaſion to mention, the
other preached in a meeting houſe here; he is ſaid to be not ſo courſe but
ſomething better Poliſhed than other common Presbyterians: He is Son
to Mr. <hi>Robert Blair</hi> Miniſter at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> who was famous for many
things but eſpecially his Civility to King <hi>Charles the 2d.</hi> when he made him
a viſit at his own houſe. Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> when the King came in was ſitting in
a Chair, and it ſeems at the time under a bodily infirmity which both kept
him from riſing and excuſed it, when Mrs. <hi>Blair</hi> ran to to fetch a Chair to
the King, he ſaid, <hi>My heart do not trouble your ſelf, he is a young man he may
draw in one to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt I come to the diſſolution of the Aſſembly, which was talked of
ſeverall days before, and actually concluded and reſolved upon <hi>Nov.</hi> 13.
Their laſt Sederunt was in the afternoon, and continued till it was night.
There they debated the calling of another Aſs. and the time of its ſitting;
ſome were for one month, ſome were for another, and there were few
months of the year but was favoured by one or other as ſitteſt for an Aſs.
In the mideſt of theſe debates among themſelves, the Commiſſioner (whoſe
adviſe they never ſought in the affair) ſtood up and diſſolved them in the
Kings name, and by the ſame Authority called and appointed another to
meet on the firſt of <hi>Nove.</hi> next to come, 1691. The Aſſembly was Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
with this, but it would ſeem they thought not fit to call it in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
therefore they ſubmitted: and all was concluded with a prayer and
Pſalm: The Pſalm they Sung was the 133.</p>
            <p>Thus ended our famous Aſſembly: an account whereof I have given
you as fully and exactly as I could: I was not overhaſty to believe any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
till I found it confirmed by two or three others: If I be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in ſome ſmall circumſtances, which the beſt Hiſtorians may erre in;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62662:34"/>
I am ſure no material falſhood can be charged upon me, Let it be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
againſt the truth of my relation, that I ſometimes appear no friend
to the Party; but tho' I be not, I will not willingly and wittingly lye
upon them. I need not aſſure you of my ingenuity who knows that I hate
to utter a lye, either for advancing the beſt cauſe or deſtroying the worſt.
But I confeſs I can hardly bridle my paſſion when I conſider the errour and
injuſtice, the unreaſonableneſs and Hypocriſy which theſe people are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of, who if you will take their word for it are the only true Godly, and

neither Church nor Religion will proſper till that Spirit be caſt out
which poſſeſſes them. I pray God convert them, and let out much of his
Spirit upon them, and all others, that our Land may have peace, and that
the diviſions of our Church may be healed; that our Confuſions may be
wholly removed, and order and good Government reſtored, and that the
worſhip of God may be duly and decently performed as may beſt
tend to the advancement of his Glory, and the good and Edification of the
Souls of his people, with this prayer for the Church, and my hearty
wiſhes for your ſelf, I take my leave at this time.</p>

M<hi rend="sup">R</hi>. WILLIAM VEATCH.</head>
            <p>THE late Mr. <hi>John Hay</hi> Miniſter
of the Goſpel at <hi>Peebles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Bodily Pain and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
utterly diſabled for the
publick Exerciſe of his Miniſtry, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the time of his Departure to
be approaching; Out of a deep concern
for his Flock, after the Example of good
and faithful Paſtors in all Ages, reſolved
to look out for a Succeſſor; And for that
effect, wrote to the Duke of <hi>Queensbery,</hi>
(then undoubted Patron of the Pariſh of
<hi>Peebles</hi>) to nominate ſome Able and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Miniſter, who might aſſiſt him as a
Helper during his Life, and to whom he
might recommend and leave his Charge
at his Death. His Grace being well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with ſo Pious a deſire, remits the
choice to himſelf, whereupon he calls
and invites Mr. <hi>Robert Knocks,</hi> one of the
Miniſters of the City of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
accepted the Call, and to the great
Comfort of the Paſtor and People, ſerved
the <hi>Cure</hi> for ſometime: The ſick Man
had his peaceable Exit in the Lord, ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
himſelf in this; <hi>That he had not left
his Flock as Sheep without a Shepherd;</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after whoſe Deceaſe, the Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Elders, and Parochioners, did apply
themſelves to the Duke's Factor, to Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Duke then at <hi>London,</hi> and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him, that they Unanimouſly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Mr. <hi>Robert Knocks</hi> to be their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
in place of the deceaſt Mr. <hi>John Hay,</hi>
which accordingly the Duke agreed to,
and ordered Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> to continue in the
Exerciſe of his Miniſtry there. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1689,
being the Lord's Day after Sermons, the
Seſſion being ſitting, and the Duke's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
read unto them, the whole Heritors,
Elders, and Parochioners then preſent, did
Unanimouſly and Cheerfully receive the
ſaid Letter and Nomination, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> all the Encouragement
that could be expected from a Dutiful
People; And the Seſſion did order the
Lairds of <hi>Hayſtoun,</hi> and <hi>Halkſhaw, William
Plenderleith, John Hope,</hi> and <hi>John Gevan,</hi>
late Provoſts of <hi>Peebles,</hi> to wait upon
the Duke at his Return, and give him
Thanks in all their Names for his care of
them. After which time Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all the right to be Miniſter at <hi>Peebles,</hi>
which the ſtate of the Church could then
admit of, <hi>viz.</hi> Deſignation and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Patron, with the Conſent
and Concurrence of the Heritors, Elders,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62662:35"/>
and by far the greateſt and moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
part of the People, and wanting only
the formality of an Induction or Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in regard there was no Legal <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Judicatory</hi> then in being to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it on him, continued in the free and
peaceable Exerciſe of his Miniſtry, until
the ſixteenth of <hi>February</hi> 1690, when
ſome violent Interruption being offered
unto him by a Company of Unruly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as he was coming to the Church on
the Lord's Day in the Morning; the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors,
Elders and People as aforeſaid,
were ſo much concerned, that by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Obligation ſubſcribed under their
Hands, they declare their Reſolution to
adhere to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Knoks</hi> as their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;
And Commiſſioned ſome of their
Number to purſue that high Riot, before
the Moſt Honourable Lords of their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi>
Privy Council; Upon whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
and Application, the Lords of
Council finding Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> to have good
Right to ſerve the <hi>Cure</hi> at the Church of
<hi>Peebles,</hi> did juſtly puniſh the Author of
the Tumult, and oblige the Magiſtrates
of <hi>Peebles,</hi> to take ſuch care of the Peace,
that there might be no Interruption of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to him for the Future, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
he enjoyed his Miniſtry comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
and peaceably, until the <hi>Presbytery</hi>
having as would ſeem by all their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Acts, reſolved to Thruſt him out, and
obtrude another on the Pariſh, did by
their Act of the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> laſt at <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kurd,</hi>
without ever examining his Right
and Title, or giving him any Citation,
Proceeding upon a falſe Suppoſition, as
if he had poſſeſt himſelf wrongouſly of
the Church, required him to forbear
Preaching, till he ſhould be allowed by
them. The Extract of which Act, being
delivered to him by the preſent Provoſt
of <hi>Peebles</hi> moſt unſeaſonably upon the
Lord's Day thereafter, juſt as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Pulpit; he taking it as the
Act plainly bears, to be only a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
reſtraint, till ſuch time as he ſhould
apply himſelf to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> for their
Allowance, did patiently and pleaſantly
obey it, taking his ſeat among the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
while the Provoſt fetcht a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
from the <hi>Meeting-Houſe</hi> to Preach in
the Church, who after Sermons by an
Order (as he ſaid) from the <hi>Presbytery,</hi>
ſurprized the Pariſh, by declaring the
Church to be vacant, for the ſupply of
which pretended Vacancy, the ſaid <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>
ſent Mr. <hi>Robert Eliot</hi> one of their
own Number, upon the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi>
being the Lord's Day, to Preach and hold
a Meeting for the calling of one Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Veatch;</hi> Which Meeting being called
after Sermons, the Heritors, either by
themſelves, or their Proxies, together
with all the ordinary Elders of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and the generality of the whole
People, Compeered and Proteſted againſt
the calling of Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi> appealing from
the <hi>Presbytery</hi> to the next <hi>Provincial,</hi> or
<hi>General Aſſembly</hi> that ſhould happen to
be, promiſing to give in the double of
their Proteſtation and Appeal, with the
Reaſons thereof to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> the firſt
Day of their Meeting; whereupon they
took Inſtruments. The ſaid Mr. <hi>Robert
Elliot</hi> in a ſtrange and unbecoming Heat
and Tranſport, inſolently preſuming to
take Inſtruments againſt them in the
Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and without any
regard to their Proteſtation, he with his
Aſſociates proceeded to Nominate ſo
many pretended Commiſſioners, to go
the next day with Mr. <hi>William Ruſſel</hi> who
was ſent by the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and in the
Name of the Pariſh of <hi>Peebles,</hi> to offer a
pretended Call to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which Commiſſioners the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Villain <hi>Beatty,</hi> who occaſioned the
former Tumult, was one, who for his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Prophanation of the Lord's Day, and
villanous Attempt thereupon againſt Mr.
<hi>Knox,</hi> had been lately and deſervedly
puniſhed by the Privy Council, to which
Call, albeit only ſigned by <hi>Cardronno,</hi> who
has but ſmall Intereſt in the Pariſh, and
two or three mean Heritors who have
but two Aikers of Ground a piece almoſt,
Mr. <hi>Veatch</hi> cordially imbracing, came and
preſented it to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Peebles,</hi>
at and within the Chappel thereof upon
the <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> day of <hi>September</hi> following; The
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62662:35"/>
which day and place, the Heritors <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
by themſelves and their Proxies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
and gave in their Proteſtation and
Appeal in Writing, with the moſt grave
and weighty reaſons thereof, <hi>viz. That
the Church could not be reputed vacant,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Knox</hi> who had beſide Poſſeſſion, a good
Right and Title thereto, and to whom
they were firmly reſolved to adhere, not
being either Depoſed, or Deprived, but
only Inhibited for a time, by the Act of
the Presbytery, and his Right not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and diſcuſſed either by the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
or any other <hi>competent Judicatory;</hi>
And ſuppoſe the <hi>Church</hi> had been <hi>vacant,</hi>
as it was not; Yet the ſaid pretended
Call of Mr. <hi>Veatches</hi> was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void
and null, in regard of ſeveral eſſential
Defects and Informalities of it, ſuch as
the Call had not been made in a <hi>Regular</hi>
way by a publick meeting of Heritors,
Elders, and Town Council, but by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ſubſcriptions, which the Magiſtrates
of <hi>Peebles</hi> by menaces and promiſes had
ſecretly collected from a multitude of
Perſons legally uncapable of any vote in
the Election; Some of them having no
intereſt at all in the Pariſh. That there
were none of the Elders conſenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and of a multitude of conſiderable
Heritors in the Pariſh, only two or three
petty and obſcure ones conſented. All
which reaſons are more fully expreſt in
the Appeal, whereupon they took Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but the whole Presbytery (except
an Old Grave Man who diſſented all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long)
taking no notice thereof, nor to
vouchſafe in the leaſt any Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
accepted of and ſuſtained the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
pretended Call, exhibited unto them
in favours of <hi>Mr. Veatch,</hi> Ordering an
Edict to be ſerv'd for him the next
Lord's Day; which Edict being returned
to the Presbytery, upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
and called at the Chappel door,
compeared again the Heritors, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Declared their Adherence
to their former Proteſtation and Appeal,
with the whole Reaſons thereof, and
ſubjoyning ſome more pregnant Reaſons
thereto; <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Veatch</hi>
was a perſon utterly unknown to them;
and that they ought not to be conſtrained
with an <hi>implicite Faith,</hi> to <hi>intruſt the care
of their Souls to a Man of whom they had
no competent knowledge;</hi> Yea, that he was
a Stranger to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> it ſelf, and
that they had never been at the pains to
hear him Preach; that they might judge
of his Qualifications for ſo eminent a
place; that the little Tryal the Pariſh
had of him in two or three Sermons,
they were in their private Judgement of
Diſcretion not well pleaſed with his way
of Preaching, for ſeveral Grave and
Weighty Exceptions which they had
ready to produce. That for the proſpect
of a more lucrative place, he had by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
methods got himſelf looſed from
other Calls, that he might force himſelf
in upon the Pariſh of <hi>Peebles.</hi> And finally,
that the <hi>Presbytery</hi> had in many inſtances
behaved themſelves very partially in this
whole Affair, for all which Reaſons more
amply enlarged by them at that time,
and contained in their Inſtruments; They
did <hi>de novo</hi> Proteſt and Appeal againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further Procedure of the <hi>Presbytery</hi>
upon the ſaid Edict, giving in a Copy of
this their new Appeal, with the Reaſons
of it, and taking Inſtruments thereupon,
in contempt of which repeated Appeals,
with the moſt irrefragable Reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
the <hi>Presbytery</hi> having determined
before hand to inſtitute Mr. <hi>Veatch;</hi> and
for that effect ingaged Mr. <hi>Robert Elliot</hi>
to Preach at his Inſtitution, proceeded
the very next day, being the <hi>18th</hi> of
<hi>September,</hi> actually to Inſtitute him, in
moſt Illegal and Diſorderly way, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to an expreſs Act of the <hi>General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,</hi>
holden at <hi>Glaſgow, December</hi> 17.
1638. Whereby it is expreſly provided,
<hi>That no perſon be obtruded into any Office in
the Kirk, contrary to the will of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi>
At which pretended Inſtitution,
there were none of the Heritors of any
worth, or eſteem, nor of the ſtanding
Elderſhip of the Pariſh, (and excepting
the preſent Magiſtrates,) none of the
ſubſtantial Pariſhioners; Yea, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Body of the Pariſh, few at all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62662:36"/>
to Accept of or Imbrace him; in ſo much
that it's informed, Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> publickly
expreſſed his grief, That there were ſo
few honeſt Men in the Pariſh to receive
their Paſtor.</p>
            <p>In Reſpect of all which, and that the
Heritors conſenting to Mr. <hi>Veatch</hi> his
Call, are but very few, and againſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
of whom there are Competent and
Relevant Exceptions; <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome
of them are not Heritors, and others by
promiſe of caſe of their Stipends, and
ſome by Threatnings if they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
And that the Heritors who have
proteſted againſt the ſaid Call, are not
only the moſt conſiderable Heritors, and
have the moſt conſiderable Intereſt in
the Pariſh, but are double the number
of the other, beſide the whole Elderſhip.
It is therefore hoped, That his <hi>Grace,</hi>
His Majeſtie's <hi>High Commiſſioner</hi> to the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,</hi>
the Right Reverend Moderator,
and the Reverend Brethren of the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Aſſembly</hi> of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> now
ſitting, May Examine, and take into their
Grave and Godly Conſideration, the
whole Progreſs of this Affair, together
with the Pariſhes Proteſtations and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals,
which they Humbly Crave may
be publickly Read, hoping by their Pious
Wiſdom, to have their Lawful Paſtor
reſtored unto them; And in Order
thereunto, to be relieved of ſuch an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal
Intruder, who upon many Accounts
has rendered himſelf unfit to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in ſuch a Charge, particularly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
being conſcious to himſelf of the
weakneſs and Inſufficiency of his Call,
partly by his own Solicitations, partly
by other undirect Motions, he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
ſome few Heritors of Note, to
ſign it after an Edict had been ſerved
thereupon; Again to ſhake himſelf Looſe
from the Calls, which were Referred to
the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> he had prevailed
with ſome of his Friends, to Repreſent
his Call to <hi>Peebles,</hi> as the effect of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
and Extraordinary Providence,
which they did ſo flouriſh out in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Circumſtances, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
equivalent to a voic<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from Heaven,
which he ought not to diſobey. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it can be evinc'd, by clear Evidences,
That it was a Draught and Deſign of Men,
carried on underhand for a conſiderable
time. And it is left to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to
judge what a groſs Hypocriſie and Abuſe
of the <hi>Sacred Name of Providence,</hi> it is to
pretend an <hi>immediate hand of God,</hi> to the
Cobweb-Plots and Contrivances of ſinful
Men; Sure, for as well as this Providence
was painted forth to gain this point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Synod,</hi> there were ſome of that
Meeting, who could ſee thorow the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of that Pretence; And in <hi>ſpecial,</hi>
one Grave and Wiſe Member, could not
let it paſs without a tart Reflection on it;
Siklike, upon the day of his Admiſſion,
he was not afraid publickly to take God
to witneſs, that no proſpect of a great
Benefice had induced him to come to
<hi>Peebles,</hi> whereas it tranſcends the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of the moſt vaſt and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Charity, to fancy what other motive
could prevail with him, to reject Calls of
People that were Zealous and Unanimous
for him; and thruſt himſelf in upon a
Pariſh who deſired him not, and can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no Spiritual Comfort from his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.
And finally, He has ſince that time
impoſed conditions of admitting Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to Baptiſm in that Pariſh, which
neither the Law of the Land, nor the
late <hi>General Meeting</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> has
warranted him to do; whereupon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Perſons were neceſſitate to take their
Children to be Baptiſed by others, and
ſome have taken Inſtruments againſt him.
And not a few Infants have been in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Danger of Dying without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
to the great grief of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
Among whom were weak Twins
belonging to one of the late Magiſtrates.
All which can clearly be proved againſt
him, together with ſeveral other Articles
which they have to produce, and can
prove, competent time being allowed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them for the Citation of Witneſſes, but
which they have hitherto forborn to
make uſe of, out of tenderneſs to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
and will always forbear till they
be conſtrained to take this laſt Remedy.</p>

conſiſted in the knowledge of the

notwithſtanding thereof, againſt all Law,
Reaſon, and good Order, the Presbytery
would not remove him, but allowed him
to fit as one of Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi>'s Judges, and
appointed him one of the Examinators of
the Witneſſes: and he forgetting that
ſtation, informed and tampered with
ſome of them, and threatned others, as

may be lame and weak, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a quite contrary meaning of the

depone; And ſome of the Witneſſes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
deſired that they might ſee and read

againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Citation given to him thereupon,
or Copy, Sight or Notice given to him
thereof; Witneſſes are examined, than
all which there can be nothing in judicial
Procedures more Partial, Pernicious, and
Unjuſt. And Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> having
appealed from the Presbytery to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Aſſembly, the Presbytery notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
thereof proceeded, and found
the Libel Valid, and Proved; and
therefore, and in regard of Mr. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi>'s
Contumacy (as they termed his
Appeal to the General Aſſembly, which
ſat in <hi>October</hi> laſt) they ſuſpended him
from the Miniſtry, and referred him for
further Cenſure to the General Aſſembly.
But the General Aſſembly having found
no Contumacy in the Appeal, they refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him back again to the Synod. And
now the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> does again
Appeal from the Synod, and from any
Sentence they ſhall give in this Matter,
to the next lawful General Aſſembly,
and in the mean time, to Their Majeſties
Protection for Juſtice and Relief. For
thir Grounds and Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There being a Petition given in
by the Heritors and Parochiners of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith</hi>
to the Synod, atteſting, the ſaid
Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> his Faithfulneſs in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
and his Innocency as to the things
Libelled againſt him; and craving, that
according to the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the
Depoſitions of the Witneſſes might be
made parent, that they might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Redargued; yet the Synod ſuffered
not the ſaid Petition to be read.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
repreſented to the Synod the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Procedure of the Presbytery againſt
him, and having craved that the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Witneſſes, might be read before
him, and that he might have a Copy of
the Aditional Libel, which he had never
ſeen; and that conform to the Act of
<hi>Parliament,</hi> the Depoſitions of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
might be made patent to him, to
the end that he might have a Copy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to the effect he might the better
clear himſelf, from any thing that may
ſeem to be deponed againſt him; yet
notwithſtanding thereof, (and contrare
to Law) the ſame was alſo refuſed by the
Synod, and undoubtedly for this Reaſon,
That the Probation was weak, and might
not abide the Light nor Trial, for <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
non quaerit Angulos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Synod, That he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62662:37"/>
that one of the Articles deponed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, was, That he ſhould have
danced about a Bonfire the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
1688; And that the ſame was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Article proved againſt him, which he
inſtantly redargued, for the ſaid <hi>14th</hi>
day of <hi>October</hi> 1688 fell upon a Sunday,
and that the Witneſſes and whole Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> cannot but declare,
that there was never Bonfires at <hi>Dalkeith</hi>
upon a Sunday, ſo that they deponed
flalſly. And the Dancing about a Bonfire
being ſo publick an Act, that not only the
Witneſſes that have deponed it, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
many others would have ſeen it,
and all the Inhabitants of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> would
have heard of it, if it had been true:
Yet notwithſtanding thereof, all the
Neighbours to that Bonfire, and whole
Inhabitants of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> will declare and
depone, that they neither ſaw nor heard
of their Miniſter dancing at that, or any
other Bonfire; yet notwithſtanding of
that clear Conviction, and redarguing of
that Article, the Synod had no regard
thereto, affirming that there was no help
for it now, it being ſo deponed, which
is no other thing than as if they had ſaid,
that they were not concerned tho' it were
falſe, for it was ſo deponed; and which
is ſo conſequential to a clear and poſitive
Redarguing, and Improbation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and Probation thereof, that the
prejudice and deſign of the Synod to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> upon
whatever was alleadged, altho' without
Probation, or upon a Redargued Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is evidently manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> The ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Synod, that he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appealed from the Presbytery, and that
it was but too evident from what is above
narrated, that they were Party againſt
him. And which was further demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
from this, That the ſaid Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and <hi>Alexander Calderwood,</hi> did in face
of the Synod not only interrupt the ſaid
Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> when he was ſpeaking;
but likeways debated and reaſoned againſt
him as his oppoſite Parties, ſo that it could
not be expected, but that they would do
more when he was removed out of the
Synod, and therefore the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
declined the Presbytery, and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Calderwood</hi> as his Judges, and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that they might not ſit to judge
him; yet notwithſtanding thereof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Law and Juſtice, they were not
removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly.</hi> Several Members of the Synod
interrupted the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> while
he was vindicating himſelf, in the face of
the Synod, and craving a ſight of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Libel, and Depoſition of the
Witneſſes; And cried out, That <hi>the ſame
ſhould not be granted to him,</hi> as if every one
of them had had a Deciſive Voice, and
which is without Example in any Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
for any of the Judges to interrupt
the Defenders ſpeaking, and to cry out
their Opinion, or rather Sentence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Defender be removed; and
which openly diſcovers their Prejudice,
Deſign and Reſolution of proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> altho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
juſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> The Prejudice and deſign of the
Synods proceeding againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
on the ſaid lame, weak, and
null probation, is evident, in ſo far as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Members of their Number did
ſpeak and deal with him to demit, or
that otherways they would depoſe him.
And there is nothing more certain, than
that they would never have Dealt with
him to demit, if the Probation againſt
him had been good; Their malice to the
<hi>Regular Clergy</hi> being ſuch, as that they
would rather Depoſe them for Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and Errors in Doctrine, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, than ſuffer them to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and get off without ſtain, when they
are guilty of the ſame. But Mr. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
being Conſcious of his own Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
refuſed to Demit, but rather to ſuffer
their Extremity, from which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
GOD in his good time would Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
him. And therefore it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the Grounds foreſaid, that the
Synod has behaved themſelves moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,
and againſt all Law and Form:
The ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> does therefore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62662:38"/>
Proteſt againſt the Synods further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the ſaid Matter, and appeals
from them, and from any ſentence they
ſhall give therein, to the next lawful <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Aſſemblie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And to their MAJES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES
Protection, for Juſtice, and Relief
in the mean time; And Proteſts, That
the ſaid Libels, and Witneſſes Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
taken thereupon, may be preſerved,
and not put out of the way, That ſo the
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>me (and not Copies thereof) may be
produced to the next <hi>General Aſſembly;</hi>
Or to any their <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſhall be pleaſed,
out of their Royal Authority, to appoint
to conſider the ſame: And that as the
ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> will publiſh and diſperſe
his Appeal, and his Anſwers to the firſt
Libel; Which he only did ſee for his
own Vindication from any ſentence that
ſhall follow hereupon; So he expects,
and earneſtly Deſires, that the ſaid Synod
may Print both the Libels againſt him,
and Depoſitions taken thereupon, for
vindication of their Juſtice, (if they can
conceive they have done right:) But
which Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> hopes will rather
vindicate his Innocency. And further,
Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> Craves, and Proteſts, That
this his Appeal may be inſert in the
Books of the Synod.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of the Appeals fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
the Synod proceeded, and Depoſed
the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> from his Miniſtry,
and thereupon the Elderſhip of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
was invaded, and ſome few (ſeverals
of them ſcarce worth to be noticed as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidenters)
have uſurped the power of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
Elders, and have elected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moe than the number formerly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
purpoſely as they think, to make
the greater Figure; altho' but of the
moſt inconſiderable of the Pariſh; and
of Deſign to Call, Impoſe, and Obtrude
a Miniſter upon the Reſt againſt their
will, contrary to the Laws of Charity,
Practices of Chriſtian Churches, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Presbyterians. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> his
Appeal does in Law preſerve his Right,
and keeps all in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> the time of
the Appeal, while it be diſcuſt.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, not only the ſaid <hi>Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
Heriott,</hi> but likewiſe the Heritors
and Pariſhioners of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> have given
in a Petition to the Lords of their <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties</hi>
moſt Honourable Privy Council,
That they may be pleaſed to forbid the
Calling of a Miniſter until the Appeal
be diſcuſt; And that in the mean time,
he may be reſtored to the Exerciſe
of his Miniſtrie. And that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of <hi>Dalkeith;</hi> And others who had
the Libels given in againſt him, and
Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, may
make the ſame known to him, as Law
appoints; That he may know what is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled,
or may ſeem to be proved, to
the effect he may the better clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the ſame, which is nothing but
falſe lies and calumnies: And whereof
ſeveral of the Presbyterian Miniſters,
who have ſeen the Libels and Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Affirm, that there is nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be proved, But the dancing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Bon-Fire; which is not only
clearly redargued to be falſe as ſaid is,
there being no Bonfires either on the
foreſaid day, nor for ſeveral months
either before or after; But likewiſe if
the perſons who have deponed it were
known, and re-examined, it will be found,
they have deponed falſly; And that they
have been dealt with ſo to Depone;
And that this Falſhood may not be
diſcovered, not only are the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
kept up, contrary to expreſs Law
and Acts of Parliament; But likewiſe,
no notice can be gotten who were the
perſons who have deponed it, that they
may be inſiſted againſt.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is pretended, That the
Lords of their <hi>Majeſties</hi> Privy Council,
are not Judges competent to the ſentences
of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Courts,</hi> and that as they
cannot put in Miniſters in Churches, ſo
they cannot meddle with ſentences of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
It is anſwered, That by the 1.
<hi>Act 8 Parl. Ja.</hi> 6. It is Statute and
Ordained, <hi>That his Majeſtie, and Council
ſhall be Judges competent, To all Perſons
Spiritual and Temporal, in all matters.</hi> And
to pretend, that the Council is not Judge
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62662:38"/>
competent to ſentences of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick
Courts,</hi> is no other them to affirm, <hi>That
theſe Courts have an Arbitrary power, and
may do wrong at their pleaſure without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meed
or Control.</hi> For it is evident, That
<hi>Mr. Herriott</hi> is moſt unjuſtly purſued and
Depoſed. And it is alſo evident, that
if it be not Redreſſed by the Council,
he will never be Reſtored by thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
who have dealt ſo unjuſtly with
him.</p>
               <p>And whereas, it is alleaged, <hi>That as
the Council cannot put in Miniſters, ſo they
cannot meddle with ſentences of Depoſition.</hi>
It is anſwered, That the Council has not
the power of Admiſſion and Ordination
of Miniſters. But if a Miniſter having a
lawful Call, the Presbyterie ſhould refuſe
to admit and Ordain him, albeit they
have nothing to object againſt him, upon
Application to the Council or Seſſion,
Letters will be directed to Charge the
Presbyterie, to Admit and Ordain him,
but <hi>multo magis</hi> in this caſe, where a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
is Depoſed from his Miniſtrie, as
likewiſe from his Benefice, (which is his
Livelyhood and Maintenance) and yet
moſt unjuſtly, and without Ground or
Reaſon; The Council is moſt proper
Judges, for Reſtoring him againſt the
foreſaid Oppreſſion, Injurie, and Unjuſt
Sentence.</p>
               <p>And for a further evidence of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Sentence, it is Humbly deſired, that
the Lords of Their Majeſties Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
will be pleaſed to take notice, That in
the firſt Libel there are many Articles
which are not to be admitted in Law;
And it is ſaid, that there is none of
them proved, but the Dancing about
the Bonfire: And yet the Presbytery by
their Sentence, found the Libel Relevant
and Proved, which muſt be underſtood
as to the whole Articles of the Libel
complexlie, than which there is nothing
more falſe, as will appear by the Libels
and Depoſitions, if they were produced.
And yet thereupon <hi>Mr. Heriott</hi> is firſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
by the Presbytery, and referred
by them to the General Aſſembly for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cenſure, as if great Immoralities
in Life, and Errors in Doctrine, had
been proved againſt him. And the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
(to which the Aſſembly remitted
him) following the ſteps of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
depoſed him. Now when Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
and Synod, have acted thus contrary
to expreſs Law, and have done open and
manifeſt Unjuſtice; (and whereof all that
heard of it are convinced and ſenſible)
And having ſtated themſelves Parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, there can be no Remedy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the ſaid Unjuſtice, Injury,
and Oppreſſion, unleſs the Lords of Their
Majeſties Privy Council interpoſe their
Authority.</p>
               <p>If it be alleaged, That the late
Act of Parliament, The Act of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
in Church matters is Repealed;
It is anſwered, That the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
1669 is Reſcinded, which extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Supremacy, to the Ordering and
Diſpoſal of the External Government and
Policy of the Church, and to the Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Conſtitutions, Acts, and Orders
in the Church. But the foreſaid Act of
<hi>K. Ja.</hi> 6. his 8 Parliament, is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded,
which is only as to the Judging
of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Perſons in matters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
upon; and which power is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in the Crown, otherways there
ſhould be <hi>Regnum in Regno;</hi> and Church
Judicatories ſhould have arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
without Redreſs or Control, as ſaid
is.</p>
               <p>In Regard whereof, The Lords of Their
MAJESTIES Privy Council are
Judges Competent, to this Injurie, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
and Oppreſſion; And the Deſire

               <p>THE General Aſſembly, Having
taken into their moſt ſerious
Conſideration, the late great
and general Defection of this Church and
Kingdom, have thought fit to Appoint
a Day of Solemn Humiliation and Faſting,
for Confeſſion of Sins, and making Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to our Gracious God, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
and remove the guilt thereof: In
order whereunto, they have Ordained
the Confeſſion of Sins, and Cauſes of
Faſting following, to be duly Intimat and
Publiſhed; Recommending it moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to all perſons, both Miniſters and
others, That every one of us may not
only ſearch and try our own hearts and
ways, and ſtir up our ſelves to ſeek the
Lord; But alſo in our Stations, and as
we have acceſs, Deal with one another,
in all love and tenderneſs, to prepare for
ſo great and neceſſary a Duty, that we
may find mercy in God's ſight, and He
may be graciouſly reconciled to our Land
in our Lord Jeſus, and take delight to
dwell among us.</p>
               <p>Although our gracious God hath of
late, for his own Names ſake, wrought
great and wonderful things, for <hi>Britain</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for this Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in particular; Yet the Inhabitants
thereof have cauſe to remember their
own evil ways, and to loath themſelves
in their own ſight for their Iniquities.</p>
               <p>Alas! We, and our Fathers, our
Princes, our Paſtors, and People of all
Ranks have ſinned, and have been under
great Tranſgreſſion to this day: For
though our gracious God ſhewed early
kindneſs to this Land, in ſending the
Goſpel amongſt us, and afterward in our
Reformation from Popiſh Superſtition
and Idolatry; and it had the Honour,
beyond many Nations, of being after our
firſt Reformation, ſolemnly devoted unto
God, both Prince and People, yet we
have dealt treacherouſly with the Lord,
and been unſtedfaſt in his Covenant, and
have not walked ſuitably to our Mercies
received from him, nor obligations to
him: Through the mercy of God this
Church had attained to a great purity of
Doctrine, Worſhip, and Government,
but this was not accompanied with ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
perſonal Reformation, neither was
our Fruit anſwerable to the pains taken
on us by Word and Work; We had
much Goſpel-preaching, but too little
Goſpel-practice; too many went on in
open wickedneſs, and ſome had but a
form of Godlineſs, denying the power
thereof; many alſo who had the Grace
of God in truth fell from their firſt love,
and fell under ſad languiſhings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays;
and when for our ſins the anger of
the Lord had divided us, and we were
brought under the feet of ſtrangers, and
many of our Brethren killed, others ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Captive and ſold as ſlaves, yet we
ſinned ſtill, and after we were freed from
the yoke of ſtrangers, inſtead of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Lord, and being led to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
by his goodneſs, the Land made
open Defection from the good ways of
the Lord: many behaved as if they had
been delivered to work abomination, the
flood-gates of Impiety were opended, and
a deluge of wickedneſs did over-ſpread
the Land, Who can without grief and
ſhame remember the ſhameful debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
and drunkenneſs that then was? And
this accompanied with horrid and helliſh
curſing and ſwearing, and followed with
frequent Filthineſs, Adulteries, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Abominations, and the Reprover
was hated, and he that departed from
Iniquity made himſelf a reproach or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62662:39"/>
prey. And when by theſe, and ſuch
like corrupt practices, mens Conſciences
were debauched, they proceeded to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
the Intereſt of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
and Priviledges of his Church to the
luſts and will of men; The Supremacy
was advanced in ſuch a way, and to
ſuch an height, as never any Chriſtian
Church acknowledged; the Government
of the Church was altered, and Prelacy
(which hath been always grievous to
this Nation) introduced, without the
Churches conſent, and contrair to the
ſtanding Acts of our National Aſſemblies,
both which the preſent Parliament hath
(bleſſed be God) lately found; And yet
nevertheleſs, of the then ſtanding Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> many did ſuddenly and
readily comply with that alteration of the
Government, ſome out of Pride and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
or Man-pleaſing, ſome through
infirmity or weakneſs, or fear of Man,
and want of Courage and Zeal for God,
many faithful Miniſters were thereupon
caſt out, and many Inſufficient and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
men thruſt in on their Charges,
and many Families ruined, becauſe they
would not own them as their Paſtors.</p>
               <p>And alas! It is undenyable, there hath
been under the late Prelacie, a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of Piety, ſo that it was enough to
make a man be nicknam'd a Phanatick, if
he did not run to the ſame exceſs of riot
with others.</p>
               <p>And ſhould it not be lamented, for it
cannot be denyed, there hath been in
ſome a dreadful Atheiſtical Boldneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, ſome have diſputed the Being
of God, and his Providence, the Divine
Authority of the Scriptures, the Life to
come, and Immortality of the Soul, yea
and ſcoffed at theſe things.</p>
               <p>There hath been alſo an horrid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation
of the Holy and Dreadful Name
of God, by Curſing and Swearing: Ah!
there hath been ſo much Swearing and
Forſwearing amongſt us, that no Nation
under Heaven have been more guilty in
this than we; ſome by ſwearing raſhly
or ignorantly, ſome falſly, by breaking
their Oaths, and impoſing and taking
ungodly and unlawful Oaths and Bonds
whereby the Conſciences of many have
been polluted and ſeared, and many
ruined and oppreſſed for refuſing and
not taking them.</p>
               <p>There hath alſo been a great neglect of
the Worſhip of God, too much in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
but eſpecially in Families, and in
ſecret.</p>
               <p>The wonted care of Religious ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord's Day is gone, and in many
places the Sabbath hath been, and is
ſhamefully prophaned.</p>
               <p>The Land alſo hath been full of bloody
Crimes, and Cities full of Violence, and
much innocent Blood ſhed, ſo that Blood
touched Blood; yea, <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſins have
abounded amongſt us, Pride, fullneſs of
Bread, Idleneſs, Vanities of Apparel,
and ſhameful ſenſuality filled the Land.</p>
               <p>And alas! how great hath been the
Cry of Oppreſſion, and Unrighteouſneſs,
Iniquity hath been eſtabliſhed by a Law,
there hath been a great perverting of
Juſtice, by making and executing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Statutes and Acts, and ſad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
of many for their Conſcience
towards God.</p>
               <p>It is alſo matter of Lamentation, that
under this great Defection there hath
been too general a fainting, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
profeſſors of the Goſpel, but alſo
amongſt Miniſters; yea, even amongſt
ſuch, who in the main things did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to maintain their Integrity, in
not giving ſeaſonable and neceſſary Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
againſt the Defectons and Evils
of the Time, and keeping a due diſtance
from them, and ſome on the other hand
managed their Zeal with too little Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and Meekneſs.</p>
               <p>It is alſo matter of Humiliation, that
when Differences fell out amongſt theſe,
who did owne Truth, and bear witneſs
againſt the Courſe of Defection, they
were not managed with due Charity and
Love, but with too much heat and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,
injurious Reflections uſed againſt
pious and worthy men on all hands, and
ſcandalous Diviſions occaſioned, and the
ſucceſs of the Goſpel greatly obſtructed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62662:40"/>
thereby, and ſome dangerous Principles
drunk in: And after all this, there were
ſhameful advances towards Popery, the
Abomination of the Maſs was ſet up in
many places, and Popiſh Schools erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſeverals fell to Idolatry.</p>
               <p>And though the Lord hath put a ſtop
to the Courſe of Defection, and of his
great mercy given us ſome reviving from
our Bondage; yet we have ſad cauſe to
regrate and bemoan, that few have a
due ſenſe of our mercy, or walk anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thereto, few are turned to the Lord in
truth, but the wicked go on to do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and there is found amongſt us to this
day ſhameful ingratitude for our mercies,
Horrid impenitency under our ſins, yea,
even amongſt thoſe who ſtand moſt up
for the Defence of the Truth: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many in our Armies, there is wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prophaneneſs and Debauchery. And
though we profeſs to acknowledge, there
can be no pardon of Sins, no Peace and
Reconciliation with God, but by the
Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; yet few know Him,
or ſee the Neceſſity and Excellency of
the Knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;
few ſee their need of Him, or eſteem, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
or receive Him, as he is offered in the
Goſpel; few are acquainted with Faith
in Jeſus Chriſt, and living by Faith on
Him, as made of the Father unto us, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
and few walk as becometh
the Goſpel, and imitate our Holy Lord in
Humility, Meekneſs, Self-denial, Heavenly-mindedneſs,
Zeal for <hi>GOD,</hi> and Charity
towards Men: But as there is even until
now, a great contempt of the Goſpel, a
great Barrenneſs under it; ſo a deep Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
under our Sin and Danger, a great
want of Piety toward God, and Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Men, with a woful Selfiſhneſs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one ſeeking their own things, few
the things of Chriſt, or the publick
Good, or one anothers welfare: And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
the moſt part more ready to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the ſins of others, than to repent of
their own.</p>
               <p>Our Iniquities are increaſed over our
heads, and our Treſpaſſes are grown up
into the Heavens, they are many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and hainous in their nature, and
grievouſly aggravated, as having been
contrair to great Light and Love, under
ſignal Mercies and Judgments, after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and Supplication, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of our Profeſſion, Promiſes and
ſolemn Vowing, and Covenanting with
God to the contrair.</p>
               <p>Have we not then ſad cauſe of deep
Sorrow and Humiliation? And may we
not fear, if we do not repent, and turn
from the evil of our ways, and return
to the Lord with all our hearts, that He
return to do us evil, after he hath done
us good, and be angry with us, until He
hath conſumed us?</p>
               <p>Let us therefore humble our ſelves by
Faſting and Praying, let us ſearch out
our ſins, and conſider our ways, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
theſe, and other our ſins, with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and Deteſtation; Let us turn unto
the Lord with Faſting and weeping, and
with mourning; Let us firmly Reſolve
and ſincerely Engage to amend our ways
and doings, and return unto the Lord our
God, with all our heart, and earneſtly
pray, that for the blood of the Lamb of
God, our ſins may be forgiven, and our
back-ſlidings healed, and we may yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a righteous Nation, keeping the
Truth, that Religion and Righteouſneſs
may flouriſh, and Love, and Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
and all the Lord's People may be
of one mind in the Lord: and in order
to all theſe, that the Word of the Lord
may have free courſe, and be glorified,
and that the Preaching of the Word, and
Diſpenſing of the Sacraments, may be
accompanied with the wonted preſence,
Power and Bleſſing of the Spirit of the
Lord; That the Lord would preſerve
and bleſs our gracious <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,
William</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and eſtabliſh their
Throne by Righteouſneſs and Religion,
and grant to theſe Nations, Peace and
Truth together; and for that End, bleſs
and proſper His Majeſties Councils, and
Forces by Sea and Land, and thoſe of the
Princes and States his Allies, for God
and his Truth, that Inferior Rulers may
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62662:40"/>
rule in the fear of God, and Judges be
clothed with Righteouſneſs, and that
many faithful Labourers may be ſent out
into the Lord's Vineyard, and they who
are ſent, may find mercy to be faithful,
and be bleſt with Succeſs, that Families
may be as little Churches of Chriſt, and
that the Lord would pour out His Spirit
on all Ranks of People, that they may
be holy in all manner of Converſation,
and God may delight to dwell amongſt
us, and to do us good.</p>
               <p>And while we pray for our ſelves, let
us not forget our Brethren in Forreign
Churches, with whom, alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we had too
little Sympathy; Nay, let us pray, that
all the ends of the Earth, may ſee the
Salvation of God; and that He would
bring his antient people of the <hi>Jews</hi> to
the acknowledgment of Jeſus Chriſt; and
that he would haſten the ruine of Romiſh
Babylon, and advance the Reformation
in Chriſtendome, and preſerve and bleſs
the Reformed Churches; That he would
pity His oppreſſed People, the <hi>French
Proteſtants,</hi> and gather them out of all
places, whither they have been ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the cloudy and dark day; and
that he would be the Defence, Strength
and Salvation of any of his People, who
are in War or Danger by Infidel or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
adverſaries, in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>America.</hi>
And in particular, that the Lord would
be Gracious to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſanctifie
to his People there, both their diſtreſs
and deliverance; and perfect what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
them, that he would convert
the Natives there to the Truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that Land to Peace; and appoint
Salvation for Walls and Bullwarks to
<hi>Brittain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all theſe Cauſes and Reaſons, The
General Aſſembly hath appointed the
Second Thurſday of <hi>January</hi> next, to be
Obſerved in all the Congregations of the
Church and Nation, as a day of Solemn
Faſting and Humiliation, and Prayer;
Beſeeching and Obteſting all, both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
and People of all Ranks to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and ſerious, in Humilitation and
Supplication, and univerſal Reformation,
as they would wiſh to find mercy of the
Lord, and have deſerved wrath avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and would obtain the Bleſſing of the
Lord upon themſelves and Poſterity
after them; and that the Lord may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in us, and our Land may be as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to him. And Ordains all Miniſters,
either in Kirks or Meeting houſes, to
read this preſent Act publickly from the
Pulpit, a Sabbath or two before the ſaid
Day of Humiliation: and that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Presbyteries take care, that it be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Obſerved in their reſpective bounds.
And where, in regard of Vacancies, the
Day hereby appointed, cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
the Aſſembly appoints the ſaid
Humiliation, to be kept ſome other Day
with the firſt convenient opportunity:
And appoints the Commiſſion for Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to apply to the Council, for their
Civil Sanction to the Obſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
