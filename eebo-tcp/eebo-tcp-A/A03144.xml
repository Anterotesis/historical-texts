            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I now addresse my selfe unto You, in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Cause; wherein your whole <hi>Fraternitie,</hi> is ingaged ioyntly. It is almost Three hundred yeares, since that most excellent <hi>Order,</hi> never before ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at once, with such and so many Noble spirits; was by the <hi>Founder</hi> of it, Dedicated to St. <hi>GEORGE</hi> of <hi>CAPPADOCIA.</hi> A <hi>Saint,</hi> more than a Thousand yeares before that Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, crowned with <hi>Martyrdome:</hi> And ever since, continually famous in the Church of <hi>GOD.</hi> Onely some few of late, on what authoritie I know not; have tooke upon them to discharge him, both of his place in Heaven, and reputation in the Church. In which, though their opinions are so contrary, that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly there can bee no agreement made betweene them: yet they agree together to disgrace that holy <hi>Martyr:</hi> For by the first ranke of them, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly affirmed, that <hi>GEORGE</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> so much honoured in the <hi>Christian world,</hi> is but a <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> a <hi>Larva;</hi> onely some strange <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera,</hi> the issue of an idle braine; one that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any being on the Earth. The others, as unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionably, have made him in his life, a dangerous and bloudy <hi>Hereticke:</hi> and since his death, a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Soule amongst the damned. On both sides, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pro imperio.</hi> For this cause, it hath often beene one of my chiefest wishes, that some of those,
<pb facs="tcp:4211:6"/>
whose names are great for learning, and eminent in point of knowledge; would undertake the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of this iniured <hi>Saint.</hi> But finding none, that have as yet adventured in it: I rather chose to put my selfe upon the taske, than that <hi>Saint GEORGE</hi> should longer suffer in his honour, and this Realme in him. The worke, such as it is, next under his most sacred Maiestie, I consecrate to you (most excellent <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Peeres</hi>) and to the honour of that most noble Order, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are; and in defence of which you were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, at your severall Installations.

<q>There are (saith hee) three formes of speaking, which are, as it were, the style and phrase of imposture: By the first kind of which, the capacitie and wit of man is ferter'd and intangled; by the second, it is trained on, and inveigled; and by the third, astonish'd and inchanted.

With each of these diseases, the Storie of our Saint, and many others also of that glorious Company, are deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tainted: the Hereticks, inserting such passages into their Histories, as might perswade the world to thinke them of their party; the others labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so to describe their lives and passions, as might procure unto their shrines, a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Devotion and attendance.

This is in briefe, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the storie in this passage: in which who is so blinde that seeth not, a full description (though in Cloudes and shadowes according to the use of Heretickes) of that great tryall which <hi>Athanasius</hi> had against the <hi>Arian George of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>?

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4211:30"/>
For the facilitating of which great designe; it was resolv'd that <hi>Athanasius,</hi> in a Councell to bee held at <hi>Tyre,</hi> should be accused of Sorcerie: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the murder of one <hi>Arsenius</hi> (whom they had hid out of the way;) and for the cutting off his arme, to use it in his <hi>Magicall</hi> and divelish Incantations.

that blessed Saint continued in the profession of his Faith; she declar'd her selfe a <hi>Christian,</hi> and was forthwith had out of Prison, to her Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4211:31"/>
with the affaires of that tumultuous City. We therefore must conceive it, that under this Cloud and Parable, the <hi>Arians</hi> have involv'd the state of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> under <hi>George</hi> their Byshop. A City which he found devoted to the memorie of their godly <hi>Prelate, Athanasius,</hi> and therefore dead to him, and to the <hi>Arian</hi> party: This City he restor'd (as they would have us thinke) unto a right and lively faith; by his continuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and preaching. A City, which when himselfe was by the fury of the people, ledde unto his death; he boldly comforted, and establish'd in the grounds of saving knowledge: so farre, that for Religions sake, they were even ready to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up their lives, and to suffer with him. The first of these reflects upon the Fable, as it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Nicephorus</hi>; the later, as it is intimated in the words of <hi>Bede.</hi> As for the execution done upon that Ladie, in the report of <hi>Metaphrastes,</hi> it hath relation questionlesse, to that great wrath conceiv'd against this Citie by <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata,</hi> for their tumultuous killing of their Byshop whom he greatly favour'd. A wrath so deepely rooted, that had hee come with life and honour from his <hi>Persian</hi> expedition; hee might perhaps have turn'd his forces upon them.</p>
               <p n="8">(8) This I conceive to be the meaning of the <hi>Arian Legends</hi> in this passage: wherein (as also in the former) I could have gladly wish'd, that those who have delivered to us the lives and stories of the Saints; had sav'd me harmelesse, from the

Chacun scait que les ennemis de St. Athanase l' accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soyent d'estre Magitien, et que son ennemi capital fut George Arien, lequel empiera son seige.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4211:38"/>
foolish and ridiculous (saith he) is that old Fable of St. <hi>George</hi> on Horsebacke, encountring with the Dragon. Every man knoweth that the enemies of St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> accused him of Sorcerie and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke; and that his capitall enemie was <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> which intruded himselfe into the Church of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> whence it is evident, that this their <hi>George</hi> can be no other, than that <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticke. The reason is, <hi>Car sa vie dit qu' ill a eu des grands combats contre le Magitien Athanase:</hi> because his <hi>Legend</hi> tells us, that hee had many bickerings with the Magitian <hi>Athanasius.</hi>
After him followes Dr. <hi>Primrose</hi>: who in a Letter to my Lord of <hi>Exeter</hi> now beeing, and extant in a litle booke entituled the <hi>Reconciler,</hi> touching the visibility and beeing of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; doth thus expresse himselfe, and in these words. <q>Nay as <hi>Calvin said truely,</hi> CHRIST, <hi>in the Roman Church,</hi> is hardly knowne amongst the Saints: of whom some be in Heaven, as the <hi>Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. and some in Hell, as St. <hi>George an Arian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,</hi> and bloudy Butcher of true Christians.</q>
So hee: and this is contrary to the proverbe, <hi>short</hi> and <hi>sowre.</hi> Wee will conclude this ranke with Dr. <hi>Hakewell,</hi> in his Examination of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errour, touching the decay of nature.
The first whole Chapter of which worke is employed in this, <q>that there are many of those opinions which are commonly receiv'd both in ordinarie speech, and in the writings of learned men; which notwithstanding are by others eyther manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4211:38"/>
convinced of falshood, or at least-wise sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected justly of it.

               </p>
               <p n="7">(7) So farre the Doctour, who in the entrance of his Worke, and almost the first words of it, hath given us an especiall <hi>Item</hi> out of <hi>Plinie:</hi> which and the words that follow,
I shall here transcribe, that so his owne sword may bee turned against him, and against those also, both of the same and the other partie. Thus hee begins.<q> 
                     <hi>Nec alius pronior fidei lapsus, quam ubi rei falsae gravis Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor exttiit,</hi> saith <hi>Plinie,</hi> Men doe not any where more easily erre, than where they follow a guide, whom they presume they may safely trust. They cannot quickly be perswaded, that he who is in reputation for knowledge and wisedome, and whose Doctrine is admired in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4211:39"/>
weighty matters; should mistake in points of lesser consequence: the greatest part of the world being fed rather with the names of their Masters, and with the reverend respect they beare their persons or memories; than with the soundnesse and truth of the things they teach. Wherein that of <hi>Vadianus,</hi> is, and ever will bee verified, <hi>Magnos errores, magnorum virorum autoritate persuasi, transmittimus</hi>; We deliver o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as it were by tradition and from hand to hand, great Errours, being thereunto induced by the authority of great men.</q>
So hee; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely there could not any thing be spoken more unto the disadvantage of himselfe, and of all those also which have declared themselves against St. <hi>George</hi>; the <hi>Leaders</hi> of each severall side excepted onely. <hi>Calvin,</hi> a reverend man, a man whose <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we admire in weightie matters:</hi> and shall we thinke he is <hi>mistaken in points of lesser consequence? Reynolds,</hi> a learned man, a man in <hi>Reputation</hi> both for <hi>Knowledge</hi> and for <hi>Wisdome</hi>; and can he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be <hi>mistaken?</hi> Nothing lesse. <hi>Honesta potius esse vitia, quàm turpem Catonem:</hi> We rather must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that truth is falshood, than that such able men, so much advanced in the opinion of the world, should maintaine an Errour. So dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a matter is it, for men of great esteeme and credit in the wayes of learning, to maintaine an Errour; because their <hi>affirmavits,</hi> are by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of men, receiv'd without examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

I say to give each partie satisfaction, which may soone be done: there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one argument, more than the credit of their Leaders, alleadged on eyther partie.

Those stories also,

which reported of his Death and Martyrdome, had in them (as it might be thought) many grosse and notable absurdities: as that hee suffred under I know not what <hi>Dacianus,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch that had under him no lesse than 70. tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie Princes, though others have it, under the Emperour <hi>Diocletian,</hi> this <hi>Dacianus</hi> being then <hi>President,</hi> or (as it were) <hi>Proconsul.</hi> Now being so that they agreed not with themselves; and that there never was, at or about that time, a King of <hi>Persia</hi> of that name, and greatnesse of command; nor any such like action to bee found in true anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, as his encounter with the Dragon: This might occasion, and not without good reason, that the whole Historie became suspected; and therefore that S. <hi>George</hi> might fairely be dismissed out of the <hi>Calendar.</hi> Adde unto this, that shamefull libertie which the Man of <hi>Rome</hi> had tooke unto himselfe, of <hi>Canonizing Saints,</hi> and ordering the dignities and powers of Heaven; and that profuse and lavish prodigalitie, wherewith hee did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the divinest honours on unworthy persons, and sometimes such as had no beeing: and wee shall quickly see, that <hi>Calvin</hi> had some reason, why hee reputed our St. <hi>George</hi> among his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits</hi> or <hi>Larva's</hi>; though, as before I said, it did not please him to expresse it.

                  </gap> of <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Rome,</hi> whereby their Emperours were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd among their Gods: not to say any thing of these, it is not to bee question'd, but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath beene exceeding prodigall of that greatest and most heavenly honour. Wee (know indeed) that innocent and pious Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the first times, registred those as Saints, and those onely, which had confessed their Faith in CHRIST, even to the death; and lost their Lives in testimony of a good Conscience: or else had otherwise nobly deserv'd of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mother, by their paines in writing, or assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duitie in Preaching; in the defence of Sacred truth against the growth of Heresie. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> advanced into the roome of <hi>Christ</hi>; and equall in her owne conceit, unto <hi>all that was called God,</hi> if <hi>not above:</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd them also to bee Saints, which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested in her quarrels, how unjust and treacherous soever. So that the most rebellious sort of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, became at last most capable of this high Honour; the greatest which that Church could possibly usurpe: if at the least, their opposition which they made against their Prince, might seeme to tend to the advancement of <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call liberty.</hi> Of which strange ranke of Saints, (not to name <hi>Anselme, Dunstan,</hi> or the rest before them)
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4211:43"/>
was that stout Rebell <hi>Becket,</hi> in the former times: <hi>Clement,</hi> that kill'd the King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> of the Powder-plot; both Sainted, though not solemnely, in the present. Nor was the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> excessive onely in this kinde, to such as might pleade merit in the <hi>Catholicke</hi> cause, forsooth: but euen to those, of whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence any time upon the earth, there is not any the least ground or possibility. Witnesse St. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesse</hi> or <hi>Longinus,</hi> the name (as they perswade us) of that Soldier, that pierced our Saviours side: which is indeed not any thing but a very Speare, (in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p n="3">(3) All this we grant, and this is nothing to the prejudice of our St. <hi>George.</hi> The Popes have beene too prodigall in bestowing that divine and heavenly title. What then? Therefore shall they which were exalted to that honour, in the common suffrage of the Church, before the Popes usurped this power; bee presently degraded? This were no equitie. <hi>Farre be it from us to doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be</hi> (I say) <hi>farre from us.</hi> This was the Argument of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the behalfe of those few good and godly men which were in <hi>Sodom</hi>: and such an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4211:44"/>
it was, that God Almighty (could not, I will not say, but sure I am he) did not answere; but by yeeelding to it. <hi>Hector Boetius,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Brittish Historie,</hi> have made a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of divers Kings, which I perswade my selfe had never any beeing, unlesse in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that made them: and yet it cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but there are many passages in both those sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries worthy credit; and many Kings, whose acts and beings are not question'd. It was an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Iustice in Almighty God, <hi>not to destroy the righteous with the wicked:</hi> but to be willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve that great and populous City of <hi>Sodom,</hi> from destruction; for the sake onely of ten just and vertuous persons. How unjust therefore were our judgment, onely because of some few <hi>Larva's,</hi> counterfeit Saints, as we may call them: to prejudice so many of the true and reall, as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity or spleene may call in question.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) A second circumstance which makes the storie of St <hi>George</hi> suspected, is, that his life hath in it many vaine and grosse absurdities; and some such actions father'd on him, as might farre better in appearance, sort with a Saint in <hi>Ovid,</hi> than in the credit and beleefe of holy Church.

               <p n="2">(2) Two fairer instances of which, wee can hardly meet with, than two especiall priviledges of two Churches in the realme of <hi>France</hi>; and the vaine Fables thence arising.

if we will beleeve the people, and the ordinarie Fables which are grounded on it; we must take it thus.

A priviledge confirm'd upon them, (as that age and the rest that followed were prone to superstitious bounties) in memory of St. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> whose Festivall is heere observ'd with all solemnitie upon the 23. day of <hi>October</hi>; not long before, Archbyshop of that Citie. But if wee will <hi>beleeve</hi> the people, and the common fables, wee must take it thus. There was a poysonous Dragon, which had done much harme unto this Province; whom they had tryed by many meanes to make away, but none prospered. At last, St. <hi>Romain,</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>Roan,</hi> accompanied
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4211:53"/>
with a Murderer and a Theefe, whose lives were forfeit to the Law; undertakes the enterprise. Vpon the first sight of the Dragon, the Theefe according to his nature, stole away: the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer more hardened in his trade, goeth forwards with him. To make short worke, the Dragon layeth aside his fury, and patiently submits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto that godly Praelate: who binding him about the necke with his stole (or tippet) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth him unto the murderer, and leades him prisoner unto <hi>Roan.</hi> This wondrous accident is said to happen on an <hi>holy Thursday</hi>: and that St. <hi>Audoin</hi> or <hi>Owen</hi> who next succeeded in that Church, in memorie thereof obtain'd this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that from thence forwards the <hi>Chanoins</hi> of <hi>Our Ladies,</hi> should every <hi>holy Thursday</hi> have the releasing of any Murderer, (whom themselves would choose. I say of any Murderer, Theeves not being capable at all of any mercy: because (say they) the Theefe which was to have attended in that service, stole away.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) So farre the storie, as I was told by mine Host at <hi>Roan:</hi> but for the priviledge it is still in practise, and famous by a great and memorable tryall, not long since hapning: related to me by a Gentleman of good account, and a practitioner in the <hi>Parliamentarie</hi> Court in that City. The case is this. Not much above some twelue yeares since, a Noble-man of <hi>Gascoigne</hi> tooke occasion to kill his wife; which done he fled into <hi>Normandie:</hi> and having first acquainted the <hi>Canons</hi> of the

Church of <hi>Nostre Dame</hi> with his desires; put him selfe to the sentence of the Court, &amp; is adjudg'd unto the Wheele. <hi>Ascention</hi> day immediately comming on, the <hi>Canons</hi> chalenged him for theirs: and the chiefe <hi>Iudges,</hi> according to the custome, caused him to bee dilivered. But on the other side, it was pleaded by the <hi>Normans,</hi> that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this priviledge, belonged onely to the Natives of that Province: and they pleaded with such violence, that the poore Baron was againe committed to his irons; till the Qu.

               <p n="4">(4) This storie of St. <hi>Romains</hi> Dragon, in which there is no passage true, conducts me on, unto St. <hi>George</hi>; of whose encounter with the Dragon there may be somewhat said, to qualifie the matter; thought not to justifie it altogether.

But now (saith he) when as the Soldiers of the Guard, [<hi>Milites Imperatorij</hi>] were going to their rest; there was a fearfull neighing heard so upon the suddaine, that it made all of us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed; the rather, because there were not any Horses then about the Court; all of them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the evening farre off, unto their Stables. This tumult not yet quieted, another noyse of the same kinde, but greater than the former; was heard unto the Emperours Chamber; who presently dispatch'd a Servant to inquire into the matter.</q>
The servant did as was commanded, <hi>Sed nihil audivit aliud, nisi ab equo in quodam palatij pariete ante victricis deiparae sacellum, quem Paulus olimpictor praestantissimus effinxisset, D. Georgium pulcherrime sustinentem, esse editum, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <q>The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant did as was commanded, but heard no other noyse than what did seeme to him, to issue from the picture of a certaine horse, bearing St. <hi>George</hi> upon his backe: which <hi>Paul</hi> the famous painter, had long since painted on that part of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace-wall, which is close by our Ladies Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. This is (saith hee) the message which I am commanded to deliver; and to acquaint you also, that his Majesty desires your present counsell.</q>

                  <hi>Nam ut patres nostri nobis tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderunt, equus iste alias ad eundem modum hinnijt, cum Baldwinus Latinorum Princeps, a patre nostro pulsus, urbem amissurus esset.</hi>
                  <q> The Chancellour repairing upon these summons to the Emperor, found him exceedingly disquieted: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sportively accoasting him, I doe my Leige said he, congratulate those noble tryumphs, which the lusty neighing of St. <hi>George's</hi> horse portend unto you. To whom the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour replyed, It seemes my Lord, that you of purpose to compose my thoughts, and make me merry, will not take notice of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but I am able to instruct you in it. For I have heard uppon good credit, that this same pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of an Horse, neigh'd formerly, as now it did: just when that <hi>Baldwin</hi> Emp. of the <hi>Latines</hi> in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was beleagured by my Father; and the City taken.</q>
So farre the storie. All we will note from hence is this, that <hi>Baldwin</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Historie, began his Raigne <hi>anno</hi> 1227. and that St. <hi>George,</hi> both in his time, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was painted mounted on his Horse; which is as much as I desire for my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

And now St. <hi>George</hi> must be ennobled for the killing of a Dragon, which he never saw; and ransoming of King <hi>Nemo's</hi> Daughter, for in the <hi>Legends</hi> there is nothing told us of his name. Iust as upon the <hi>post-fact,</hi> the <hi>Normans</hi> fram'd that doughty tale of St. <hi>Romanus</hi> and the Dragon; or those of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the no lesse memorable storie of Saint <hi>Aignans</hi> Stone.

I know we might with greater glory, and more seeming shew of Antiquity, haue cast this burthen upon him, that calls himselfe Saint <hi>George</hi>'s servant, <hi>Pasicrates</hi> by name: the first which did commit to writing, the Death and Actions of St. <hi>George</hi>; and one (if such a one there was) which might relate the Storie with most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as being alwayes with him even unto his suffering. But since the credit of <hi>Pasicrates,</hi> and of the storie written by him, dependeth onely on
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4211:76"/>
the word of <hi>Metaphrastes,</hi> who ascribes it to him: We may as well immediatly report it out of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphrastes</hi>; in whom there is not any thing omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worth our reading, which is found extant in the other. Of whom, and of the time in which hee liv'd, and that opinion which he carrieth in the world, wee will speake a little: because we have made choyce of him, to declare first for us; and it concernes us, not to have our businesse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by a man suspected, by one of no esteeme and credit with the learned. When that is done, we will not beg you to beleeve him any further; than in Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh's</hi> judgement, we may give credit unto <hi>Annius</hi> and his Authors: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so farre, as others writing on the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concurre with him; and justifie his words as warrantable and historicall.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) And first, the Age in which hee lived, is diuersly reported. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> on the credit of <hi>Baronius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Descrip. Eccl.</note> hath placed him in the middle of the ninth <hi>Centurie; Iohn Vossius</hi> in his Booke <hi>De Gr. Historicis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 26.</note> hath ranked him in the yeare 1060! <hi>Oraeus Volaterran,</hi> our learned <hi>Iewell,</hi> and <hi>Helvicus,</hi> make him a babe of yesterday; a writer of the fourteenth Centurie, no older. Of this last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation more hereafter: the other two, being the worst of them, more probable than this; though but one true. These two both built upon the same ground, the time of <hi>Michael Psellus</hi>; and therefore if wee can resolve upon his time, wee have found the other. By <hi>Bellarmine</hi> it is affirm'd
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4211:76"/>
that <hi>Psellus</hi> was alive, <hi>anno</hi> 850. <hi>Michael</hi> the third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with his Mother <hi>Theodora,</hi> then ruling in the East: which <hi>Psellus</hi> made a funerall Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the praise of <hi>Metaphrastes.</hi> This last ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to bee true by <hi>Vossius</hi>; but then he tells us, and that upon the credit of <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> that <hi>Michael Psellus,</hi>

<q>St. <hi>George</hi> was borne in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> of Christian parents, and those not of the meanest qualitie: by whom he was brought up in true Religion, and the feare of God.

How long most noble Emperour, and you <hi>Conscript Fathers,</hi> will you augment your tyrannies against the Christians? How long will you enact unjust and cruell Lawes against
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4211:81"/>
them? Compelling those which are aright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the faith, to follow that Religion, of whose truth your selves are doubtfull.

Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you therefore acknowledge that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which undoubtedly is true: or else disturbe not them by your raging follies, which would willingly embrace it. This said, and all the <hi>Senate</hi> wonderfully amazed at the free speech and boldnesse of the man; they all of them turn'd their eyes upon the Emperour, expecting what hee would reply: who beckoning to <hi>Magnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> then Consull, and one of his speciall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, to returne an answere; hee presently applyed himselfe to satisfie his Princes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</q>

               <p n="9">(9) For this the yeare and day of S. GEORGE his death, we shall have proofe enough hereafter; of the day chiefly in the <hi>Martyrologies,</hi> and of the yeare thereof in severall Histories. Proofe also store inough for this, that he was beheaded: in which particular, all Authors which have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to particulars, agree joyntly. Onely the old <hi>Franciscan, Fryer Anselme,</hi> whom I lately mention'd, will have him end his sufferings in a flaming fire,<note place="margin">De script. terr. Sanct. ut supr.</note> at <hi>Rama</hi> in the <hi>Holy-Land.</hi> For so it followeth in his text. <hi>In Beryth autem occidit dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conem: in Rama autem, quae distat à Hierusalem per</hi> 20 <hi>miliaria, fertur fuisse combustus.</hi> 'Tis well they are so link'd together, his Martyrdome by fire, and his encounter with the Dragon; being both of them of the same medley. I had almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the doughtie Authour of the <hi>Seaven Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.</hi> Who as hee makes the first atchievement of Saint GEORGE, to bee the killing of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Dragon in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereby hee sav'd from death the Princesse <hi>Sabra:</hi> so doth he make his last, to be a dangerous combate, which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4211:82"/>
hee had with a poysonous Dragon upon <hi>Duns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere Heath</hi>; wherein the Dragon lost his life, and the poore Knight return'd to <hi>Coventrey,</hi> his owne Citie, so extreamely wounded, that hee shortly after dyed. And yet the foolish Author tells us expresly in his <hi>Title,</hi> that there wee have the true and certaine manner of his Death. But as good lucke would have it, hee left behind him to comfort his afflicted people, no fewer than three Sonnes: and one of them, a matter of no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon knowledge, was GVY that famous Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi>; the other two being preferr'd to place in Court.</p>
               <p n="10">(10) To returne then to METAPHRASTES, (for wee will heare him speake no further of St. GEORGE:) wee now dismisse him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the rest that followes, unto them that dare beleeve him. Wee have already shewne you, how hideously the Heretickes had falsified the lives of Saints and Martyrs, to countenance their cause: and with what little choyce of argument the Church-historians had compiled their <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologies,</hi> and <hi>Actes Ecclesiasticall.</hi> Both obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations verified in the storie of our Martyr, and the collections of this Author. For in the rest that followes, wee have the <hi>Arian</hi> tale of <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi> the Magitian; together with the strange Conversion of the Empresse AREXAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRA: both which before have had my blessing. These intermingled with the horrible and most unsufferable torments which are there said to be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4211:83"/>
applyed unto our Martyr: so great, so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the strength of nature to indure; that wee must needs reject the very naming of them, as things so short of Truth, that in the greatest cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they may not be reputed possible. And for the close of all, a cheate or couzning tricke of his, put by him on the Emperour: whom hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded after many of his torments, that hee was now content to sacrifice unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Idols. Which done, the Church made trim, the Priests in readinesse, and many of the people gathered there together to behold the alteration: hee calls upon the LORD, and presently upon his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, downe came a fire from Heaven; by which both Temple, Priests, and many of the people, were consumed. This last, accounted as an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (or a Fable rather) in the common <hi>Legends,</hi> by <hi>Antoninus Florentinus:</hi> who guessing at some reasons for which the passion of St. GEORGE was judged <hi>Apocryphall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Summa histor. part. 1. tit. 8. §. 13.</note> makes this for <hi>One, Quòd</hi> Daciano <hi>dixerit,</hi> (for so hee calls him) <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum se Sacrificare, si faceret populum ad Templum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregari; quo facto, oratione eius, igne coelesti totum Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum &amp;c. concremavit.</hi> This last accounted also one of the principall excesses of this Writer, in the composition of his Stories; and for that noted by the Cardinall in his censure of him.</p>
               <p n="11">(11) These passages in <hi>Metaphrastes</hi> we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not in our Storie; and therefore leave the proofe thereof, to such as thinke they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4211:83"/>
them. But for the rest, wee doubt not but to make it good by witnesses of speciall ranke; and many of them of authority undeniable, in points Historicall. The rest, I meane, which is of principall moment, and most necessary to the cause in hand; as <hi>viz.</hi> his Countrey, and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in generall; the manner of his Death, the time and place of it: all these wee doubt not to make good, by such variety of Evidence, and strength of testimony, as may suffice to make the Storie free from all further question. But for the greatnesse of his Parentage and Fortunes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Honourable place about the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: this wee will take upon the word of <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastes,</hi> untill wee finde some evidence not yet discovered, which can prove the contrary. Nor shall it be sufficient for any of the adverse party, to say, that no such circumstance may bee found in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who largely wrote the Story of that last and greatest Persecution: no nor in <hi>Bede</hi> which mentions him; nor in <hi>Vincentius</hi> or <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi> both which are large inough in the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his History. For wee know well inough that <hi>Argumenta ab authoritate negativè,</hi> are shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exploded in the Schooles of Logicke: that the argument would bee ridiculous, should any one conclude, that all the <hi>Silvian</hi> Kings reckoned in our <hi>Chronologies,</hi> are to bee rejected; because so many Writers of the history of <hi>Rome,</hi> have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to name them. I know indeed, in points of Faith and Morall duties, wee may resolve it with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4211:84"/>
the Fathers, <hi>Non credimus quia non legimus</hi>; and therefore I restraine my selfe to <hi>Cases of this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie:</hi> and that no further, till I see evidence of reason to convince me of an Error; where proofe of testimony failes. Which ground thus layd, wee will proceed unto the justification of the history in METAPHRASTES; so much thereof as wee have taken, and is most materiall. But we will first make cleare our passage, in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of one doubt, and commenting a little upon one memorable circumstance therein; the better to explaine the meaning of the Author, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Reader: and having pointed out the scene of this great Action, descend unto our evidence.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">(1) <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hree thinges there are then, which are to bee dispatch'd, before wee come to the producing of further Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on our party: <hi>viz.</hi> A doubt <hi>to bee remooved,</hi> a notable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4211:85"/>
to bee explained; and the designment of the place or scene of this great Action. Of these the doubt to bee removed, is that particular pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage touching <hi>Magnentius,</hi> said then to be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>Favorite</hi> of DIOCLETIAN, and at that time <hi>Consul:</hi> and this may well be call'd <hi>a doubt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in all the <hi>Consular tables,</hi> which I have sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and seene; I cannot meete, during the whole Empire of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> a <hi>Consul</hi> of that Name. But if wee can finde out the man; I hope we shall agree with case inough about his being <hi>Consul:</hi> and for the finding out the man, wee must make two enquiries. My first enquiry is, whether <hi>Magnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> there mentioned, might not be hee, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards slew <hi>Constans,</hi> Sonne unto <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, and tooke unto himselfe that part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which <hi>Constans</hi> then comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. To make this probable, (for wee aspire no further) we must first understand, that <hi>Diocletian</hi> when hee associated <hi>Maximinian</hi> in the Empire, did take unto himselfe the name from IVPITER; the other his from HERCVLES:<note place="margin">Aurel. Victor. de Caesar. c. 39 §. 2.</note> the one, being thenceforth call'd, <hi>Diocletianus Iovius</hi>; the other <hi>Maximinianus Herculius.</hi> But not content with this, to make their memory in these adjuncts, more eternall; they rais'd two severall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of selected Souldiers, whom they call'd <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vij &amp; Herculij.</hi> Of these selected Companies <hi>Magnentius</hi> was at that time Captain or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (<hi>Comes Herculiorum &amp; Ioviorum,</hi> hee is called in the Latine storie:) when hee made slaughter of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4211:85"/>
Prince <hi>Constans:</hi> and therefore not unlikely, but he may be the Favourite of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Metaphrastes</hi>; and by him rais'd unto this honour. If any thing may bee objected against this, it is, that if <hi>Magnentius</hi> were at that time <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,</hi> when Saint <hi>George</hi> was made a <hi>Martyr:</hi> ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had beene dead, before the murther of the young Emperour <hi>Constans</hi>; or else too old to undertake such enterprises. Of his decease be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, I thinke there can bee nothing proov'd; unlesse by way of possible conjecture. And for his age, allowing him for twenty, <hi>anno</hi> 290. when our <hi>Martyr</hi> suffered, about which age, and sooner, many had beene advanc'd upon spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall favour, to that Dignitie: and it will then ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily appeare, that he could bee no lesse than 80. yeares of age, at his usurping of the Empire. This I confesse for true, but yet I must affirme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that age is hardly able to keepe under, eyther ambitious desires, or noble resolutions. For <hi>Bretannion,</hi> who at the same time with this <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentius,</hi> assum'd the purple habite in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> was exceeding ancient: and in the later dayes, <hi>Venieri,</hi> Admirall of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, in the great Battaile of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> was close upon fourescore; yet of that haughty Spirit that he contested with <hi>Don Iohn</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admirall, even to a Challenge for the Field, who then was in the prime and gallantrie of his youth. A grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age than this, was that of <hi>Andreas Auria,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; who lived till 94. no
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4211:86"/>
lesse: and held unto the last, a man of notable undertakings, and of brave performance. And if we looke on former times, we find that most of <hi>Alexanders</hi> great Commanders, attain'd unto the age of 80. yeares, or not much short of it; and yet contended with each other, even till their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test gaspe of breath, for the sole Empire, and chiefe Soveraignty of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> So stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is the fire of glory and ambition, that it will kindle and enflame the coldest appetite of age. Our next enquirie is, whether the name bee not mistaken in the Author, or the Translatours, for <hi>Maxentius.</hi> Which if it may bee granted, as the mistake is very easie: then will it be a matter of farre lesse difficultie than before. For who so litle conversant in the Histories of those times, but may remember, that <hi>Maximinianus Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> had a sonne so named; and that upon the death of <hi>Constantius Chlorus,</hi> hee was proclaim'd <hi>Augustus,</hi> and saluted Emperour by the <hi>Praetorian</hi> bands at <hi>Rome.</hi> An honour hee enjoyed not long; being first undermined by his owne Father, the old tyrant; and after slaine, with the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiture of his whole forces, at the <hi>Milvian</hi> bridge neere <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great. Now if it may be granted, that the name may possibly bee mistaken; as we see dayly worse mistakes, in the editions of the best Authors: how easie is it to beleeve, that this MAXENTIVS, the sonne of the one Emperor; might be made <hi>Consul,</hi> and in especiall favour with the other? But then it is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:4211:86"/>
objected, that we meet not with his name in any of the <hi>Consular-Tables.</hi> This we affirme, and yet withall that notwithstanding this, <hi>Maxentius</hi> might be <hi>Consull.</hi> For besides the <hi>Consuls Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> appointed for the yeare, whose names one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occurre in the publicke Tables: there was another sort of <hi>Consuls,</hi> call'd <hi>Consuls honourarie,</hi> appointed onely for a Moneth, and sometimes longer, as it pleas'd the Emperours. Of this <hi>See Dion.</hi> A custome taken up, upon the end of the <hi>Civill Warres, Cum helli civilis praemia festinari coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perunt,</hi> as it is in <hi>Tacitus</hi>: when now the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had many men to gratifie, and could not speed them all in <hi>ordinarie Course.</hi> Of the which kind of <hi>Consuls, Maxentius</hi> might be one; so also might <hi>Magnentius,</hi> though wee find nothing of them in the common Calendars. Of this kind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so might there be some other <hi>Consull</hi> of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter name; although no further mention of him in the Histories of that age and time.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The circumstance to be explain'd, is that St. <hi>George</hi> before he came into the <hi>Senate,</hi> put off <hi>His military abiliments</hi>! A circumstance not express'd rightly in the Author, where we find onely <hi>vestem pauperibus distribuit,</hi> that he distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his garments to the poore; and therefore have rather chosen to expresse it in the words of <hi>Vincentius:</hi> where it is said, that having made a dole of all his riches, <hi>militarem vestem exuit,</hi> hee put off his military habit, and so address'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:4211:87"/>
to speake in the behalfe of his poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Which putting off his militarie habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not, as I conceive it, onely (nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at all) the disroabing of himselfe of his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers coate, or cassocke: but rather the abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his militarie or Knightly belt; the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie marke of his well-deserving. For in the times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, it was a custome of the Prince, to honour such which were of greatest merit, with a degree above the rest: which was perform'd by investing them with a military belt or girdle; the Ensigne of a Knight. This was call'd, <hi>Cingulo militiae honestare:</hi> and hereunto it is alluded by St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> in his 26. <hi>Homilie</hi> on the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Let none (saith hee) which is an Officer, presume to come before the Prince, without his belt, and other military ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments. This militarie belt thus given, was an ingagement of the party so invested, unto the service of the Prince: and that in termes so neere and close, that such as had receiv'd the faith, and made a conscience of their wayes, used commonly to cast it from them; because of the incompatibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that was betweene their holy profession, &amp; that Knightly order. A matter frequent in the use of it, in the times of Persecution; in such especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who could not patiently conceale their holy callings, and dissemble their Religion. The
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4211:87"/>
meaning then is this, that <hi>George</hi> no longer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to continue in the service of the Emperour, unto the hazard of his Soule, enounced his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and being so degraded, went up into the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>; no longer now a Soldier of the Emperour; but of IESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) As for the Scene, or Stage, on which this great and famous Tragedie of St. <hi>George</hi> was acted: it is generally said to be in <hi>Lydda,</hi> a Towne of <hi>Palestine,</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> A Towne made famous by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who there, <hi>virtute Christi non sua,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts, 9.33.</note> restored <hi>Aeneas</hi> to his health; <hi>Who had kept his Bed eight yeares, and was sicke of the Palsey.</hi> Knowne also in the Writers both of former and of middle times, by the name <hi>Diospolis,</hi> or the Towne of <hi>Iupiter</hi>; because that Idoll-god was there worshipped. In this Towne, that St. <hi>George</hi> receiv'd the Crowne of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is evident out of the testimonies of those severall Authors, which have made mention of our Martyr: whose words I shall deferre untill the next Chapter, where they are produced at large. Two onely proofes I have made choyce of for the present. First, that his sacred body was there reverently entomb'd, by the devout and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inhabitants thereof: his Sepulcher beeing there extant to be shewne, even in the dayes of <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4211:92"/>
in generall, so also particularly St. GEORGE, had beene abused and counterfeited in his Story: in the close of the same Canon therefore, it is reckon'd as <hi>Apochryphall</hi>; as were a great many others of the same temper. The reason why it was so reckon'd, is by our latter writers diversly related. <hi>Raphael Volaterran</hi> makes it to bee reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, onely so much of it, as concernes St. <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> combat with the Dragon: which also is assign'd by <hi>Antoninus,</hi> amongst other causes; but by neither rightly. For in those times, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeares behind them, the fable of the Dragon was not so much as thought of in the Church <hi>Christian.</hi>

                  <hi>Iacobus de Voragine</hi> more nearely to the truth, <hi>Ex eo quòd Martyrium eius certam relationem non habet:</hi> because the storie of his death is told us in most perplext and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner. <hi>In Calendario n.

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, I say of this was rightly aym'd at by this blind archer: but <hi>Bede</hi> is brought in by him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too early, as beeing a <hi>Post-natus,</hi> scarce borne within two centuries of yeares succeeding. But what need more conjectures, or what use in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is there of any: since the same Canon which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:4211:92"/>
hath decreed the History of <hi>George</hi> (then extant) to be <hi>Apocryphall</hi>; hath also told us, that it was generally beleev'd to have beene writ by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. This is inough to make the History of any S. suspected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; <hi>Apocryphall:</hi> and that it was so written; may easily appeare by that which was related in it touching <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the Empresse <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>; not to omit that terrible massacre which by a cheating tricke, he made of many of the people, branded by ANTONINUS, as before we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

For having told us, that the actions of many of the Saints were writ by Infidels, or rather Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers; and in particular that the passion of St. GEORGE was compos'd by Heretickes; hee states it thus: that notwithstanding this, he, and the Church with him, did reverence all those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and their glorious sufferings for the Truth; knowne better unto God, than any of his people. <hi>Nos tamen cum praedicta Ecclesia, omnes Martyres, at<expan>

To bring the matter nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer home, <hi>Gelasius</hi> in that Canon, hath reckoned as <hi>Apocryphall,</hi> the <hi>Itinerarie</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Actes</hi>

Nor is it to be thought, that <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticke could bee so cunningly inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the <hi>Calendar,</hi> and passe so currantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints; so soone upon his most deserv'd,

though cruell execution: the Church especially keeping an eye so watchfull over them and their designes; that all their practises were assoone brought to light almost, as they were conceiv'd. For fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death of <hi>George</hi> unto the Popedome of <hi>Gelasius,</hi> are but 130. yeares or thereabouts; too scant a time to have his Villanies forgotten, and himselfe reputed for a Martyr. Likely indeed it is, that if the <hi>Arians</hi> had prevail'd, they would have given their <hi>George</hi> a principall habitatiion in the Heaven of glories; above <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> or <hi>Maris,</hi> or <hi>Theognis</hi>; and perhaps next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their founder <hi>Arius</hi> himelfe. But that, the Christian Church should in so short and small a space, ranke him among the Saints; this I can hardly be perswaded: unlesse perchance we may beleeve, that in the same times she could condemne the Heresie, and adore the Heretickes. I know it was a frequent custome with the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> to honour and adore the Gods of those many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which themselves had vanquish'd; <hi>Religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus servire victis,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp; captivas eas post victorias a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorare,</hi> as <hi>Octavius</hi> in the Dialogue. But this they did not on mistake, or any couzinage put upon them by the vanquish'd Nations. No. It was onely on a superstitious conceit, that having in their Citie all the GODS whose people they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and placing them in their most rich and sumptuous Temples: they might by their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the better bring the residue of the world under their subjection. <hi>Sic dum universarum gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium

Not to say more, I thinke it as impossible altogether, that in so small a tract of time, if at all ever, the <hi>Arian George</hi> should bee reputed for a Saint, amongst the <hi>Orthodoxe Professours,</hi> now victorious: as that our Reverend Praelates <hi>Cramner, Latimer,</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> should in an equall space of time, bee taken into the <hi>Roman Martyrologies:</hi> or that their <hi>Henry Garnet, Iames Clement,</hi> or <hi>Nicholas Sanders,</hi> by them honoured, should be accounted <hi>Martyrs</hi> in the Churches Protestant; in case that eyther side prevaile and suppresse the other.</p>

that not much, that there the tributary Kings are five in number more, than heere in <hi>venerable Bede.</hi> This Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> useth as a closing argument, to proove our Saint to bee the <hi>Arian</hi> GEORGE of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and this our selves alledg'd in the behalfe of <hi>Calvin,</hi> to shew what cause hee had, to make St. GEORGE a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, or <hi>Larva.</hi> The processe was, that there was never at or about that time a King of <hi>Persia</hi> of that name, and greatnesse of Command; and that this <hi>Dacianus</hi> is in other of our Authors, made to bee <hi>President</hi> or <hi>Proconsul,</hi> under DIOCLETIAN: therefore in likelihood, our Authors not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and no such King as hee in nature; the whole Story of St. <hi>George</hi> is false and forged. This is the maine of all that may be sayd against us, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Dacianus:</hi> and this I say a favourable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may admit without offence. For proofe of which, wee must looke backe a little on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, at the time of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> sufferings: The East parts of it govern'd, as before I said, by <hi>Diocletian</hi>; and the West by <hi>Maximinian.</hi> These two, the better to direct and manage the affaires of State, had tooke unto themselves two <hi>Caesars:</hi> whereof the one was named <hi>Galerius Maximinianus,</hi> assumed by <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>; and under him <hi>Lieutenant</hi> Generall, or Lord <hi>President</hi> of the Easterne Countries. Now this <hi>Galerius Caesar,</hi> was by birth a <hi>Dacian:</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Successour unto <hi>Diocletian,</hi> in all those parts that hee commanded.

Hereupon we inferre, that probably this <hi>Dacianus</hi> mention'd in the Story, was that <hi>Galerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianus,</hi> who afterwards was Emperour; and had the Easterne parts, all of them, of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, under his subjection.

replyed to this, that <hi>Dacianus</hi> is there made the Lord of seaventy tributarie Kings: or what can be produced to reconcile those Authors, which make him not an Emperour; to these which doe affirme it? This I suppose wee may make good, without much difficulty. We reade in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi>

But <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> and those which call him King, report him as he was in power, though not in title; or rather call him King by
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4211:102"/>
way of anticipation: just as the <hi>Italian</hi> shores in <hi>Virgil,</hi> are call'd <hi>Laviná littora,</hi> before that name was given unto them; because in short time after in honour of <hi>Lavinia,</hi> they were so denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

This, as I said before, may by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Reader be admitted, without the least offence to truth; and much unto the credit of the <hi>Venerable</hi> Author.

Not that they thought, to adde thereby unto their glories, who now were glorious in the Heavens: but by preserving in continuall remembrance, their infinite induran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the truth and testimony of Religion; to make the remnant of Gods people, yet alive, more apt to run that course; and so to runne it, that at the last they might attaine an equall guerdon. Of which kinde of memoriall or publike <hi>Register,</hi> is the Epistle of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> extant in the fourth booke of <hi>Eusebius</hi> Historie; that of the <hi>Lugdunenses</hi> and <hi>Viennoys</hi> in the fifth; and lastly, that also of <hi>Dionysius</hi> Byshop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the sixth and seaventh of the same Author.</p>

For they conceived it rightly, that the birth-day of a Christian, was his entrance into Glory by the gate of Death: and that the worldly-minded man reputed that to bee the day of his Nativity, by which hee entred into life. And therefore <hi>Origen</hi> hath noted of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of his time, and of the times before him; That they esteemed the day of Birth to be an entrance into anguish and temptation: but celebrated with a solemne Feast, the day wherein their friends and brethren were released from sinne and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. <hi>Nunc nos</hi> (saith hee) <hi>non Nativitatis diem celebramus,</hi>

               <p n="7">(7) The second way or course, whereby the Church in ancient times endeavoured to preserve alive, the memorie of the blessed Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; is, as before we said, by giving them some speciall place in her publike <hi>Liturgies.</hi> For since that CHRIST hath not beene onely manifested great in himselfe, but great also and glorious in his Saints; the dayes of whose departure are to the Church of CHRIST, as are th'inauguration dayes of Kings and Emperours, unto their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: therefore especiall choyce being first had of them, there were some certaine times annually se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, to meditate upon our Saviour glorified in them; together with a forme of praise and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, answerable to those times. In both which circumstances, both that of time selected for this service, and of the service destinate unto the time; the Church proceeded with exceeding tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of care, and soundnesse of advice. That so for every purpose, there might be a time and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: and that the office or devotions of the time, being fitted to it; it might bee <hi>opus diei in die suo.</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:4211:114"/>
This was the <hi>Commemoration of the Dead,</hi> in those pious times in use; before that commendable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution became defiled by superstition, and as it were polluted with Idolatrie. Of which we have this testimonie of St. AVSTIN: <hi>Honoramus sanè memorias eorum tanquam Sanctorum hominum Dei,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                     </expan> ad mortem corporum pro veritate certarunt.</hi> Will you the reason of it? It is (saith he) that in the times of such solemnitie, we may both glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our GOD which hath <hi>given such guifts unto men</hi>; and by the annuall reviving of their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we may the better be excited unto an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their vertues. For so it followeth in the place, <hi>Vt ea celebritate Deo vero gratias de eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum victorijs agamus: &amp; nos ad imitationem talium coronarum, eorum memoriae renovatione adhortemur.</hi> So then it seemes the Church proposed unto her selfe, in her publike <hi>Commemorations of the Dead,</hi> two severall ends: one, that GOD might bee prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in his Saints; the other, that the noble and pious actions of the Saints, may bee a patterne unto us, to learne the better how to serve <hi>him in Righteousnesse and Holinesse all the dayes of our lives.</hi> For if the life and death of the Saints <hi>is precious in the sight of God:</hi> how precious should it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in the eyes of all Gods people, that both the one and the other should be carefully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; especially upon the day and time most ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of such remembrances? And on the other side, how is it possible that the recitall of their Christian lives &amp; godly deaths, should be so often
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4211:114"/>
sounded in the eares of the more loose &amp; dissolute men: and not provoke them at some time or other to cry out with <hi>Balaam, O that I might die the death of the Righteous, and that my end might bee like his</hi>! Iust so, the Tropheyes of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> startled such noble resolutions in <hi>Themistocles:</hi> and so did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> emulate the glories of <hi>Achilles,</hi> recited in the workes of <hi>Homer.</hi> For which cause also, and thereby to indeere the memory of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, with and amongst Gods servants: it was the custome of the Church, besides her publike mention of them in her ordinarie <hi>Liturgie</hi>; to suffer <hi>anniversarie panegyricks</hi> to be made in praise of such of them, as had notably deserved it. <hi>Sic &amp; defunctis praemium, &amp; futuris dabatur exemplum</hi>; as <hi>Minutius</hi> hath it.</p>
               <p n="8">(8) Afterwards, when the conceits of men, were raised unto a wonderfull admiration of their vertues; and throughly possess'd with this, how neere a place they held in the opinion and esteeme of Almighty GOD: it was not thought enough to commemorate their graces; unlesse we made some further use of their esteeme with their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, in gracing our petitions. The rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church had generally, and truely taught, that these celestiall Spirits now with <hi>God,</hi> did constantly commend unto him, the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing estate and safetie of his <hi>Vniversall Church:</hi> yea and some also of the faithfull in particular, so farre as possibly by revelation from their GOD,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4211:115"/>
or any other meanes what ever; they might bee made acquainted with their severall wants. Which once conceived, as many times an ill use may be made of a sound doctrine; it was supposed to be a soloecisme in the way of pietie, not to commend our prayers and desires unto them. Vntill at last, as there is seldome any <hi>medium inter summa &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitia,</hi> no stoppe in tumbling downe an Hill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come unto the bottome: the Saints in Heauen against their wils, and besides their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, became the onely mediatours betweene God and man, in point of intercession. And this the processe of the <hi>Trent-Councell,</hi> in drawing up the Article of the <hi>Invocation of the Saints: Sanctos unà cum Christo regnantes orationes suas pro hominibus Deo offerre</hi>;<note place="margin">Sess. 25. cap. 2.</note> and therefore, <hi>bonum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="9">(9) Let us looke then upon the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and we shall find it very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in St, GEORGE'S honour: the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as it is now corrected, and purged of almost all those <hi>Legendarie Fables,</hi> which before gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of offence and laughter. And herein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we find the Service very solemne; scarce any festivall there celebrated with more variety
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:4211:115"/>
of prayer and divine offices. I will touch onely at some principall passages thereof: taking along with me yet the full course and method. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance or <hi>Preparatorie,</hi> this. <hi>Protexisti me Deus à conventu malignantium: Alleluiah. A multitudine operantium iniquitatem. Alleluiah.</hi> Thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended me O GOD from the Congregation of the evill doers. <hi>Alleluiah:</hi> and from the multitude of them that worke iniquity, &amp;c. Then followes this Prayer. <hi>Deus qui nos B. Georgij Martyris tui &amp; meritis &amp; intercessione laetificas, concede propitius, ut qui tua per eum beneficia poscimus, dono tuae gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iiae consequamur.</hi> O <hi>GOD,</hi> which by the merits and intercession of St. GEORGE thy blessed Martyr, dost rejoyce our Soules, grant we beseech thee, that those benefits which by him we crave, may by the favour of thy grace bee given unto us, through IESVS CHRIST our Lord. The Epistle taken out in part, out of the second unto <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> and the 3. <hi>Chapt.</hi> Where the Apostle telleth him, that he <hi>had knowne his doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long suffering, charitie, patience; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions and afflictions, which came unto him at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; out of all which, the LORD delivered him, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Gospell</hi> taken out of the 15. <hi>Chapt.</hi> of St. IOHN, <hi>Ego sum vitis vera,</hi> I am the true Vine, &amp;c. The close of all is this, after the whole Masse ended, which they call the <hi>Postcommunion: Supplices te rogamus omnipotens Deus, ut quos tuis reficis sacramentis, &amp;c.</hi> Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>GOD,</hi> we humbly beseech thee, that we which
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:4211:116"/>
are refresh'd by thy holy Sacraments, may by the intercession of thy blessed Martyr <hi>George,</hi> serve thee heereafter in all godly motions, &amp;c. To which the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I will here adde a <hi>Collect</hi> of the old <hi>Missall,</hi> (See <hi>Vsum Sarum:</hi>) which piously interpreted, hath nothing in it savouring of Superstition; and is withall more proper to St. <hi>Georges</hi> storie. Viz. <hi>Offerimus tibi Domine solenne sacrificium pro veneranda S. Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gij mart. tui passione, deprecantes clementiam tuam, ut per haec S. S. mysteria antiqui hostis tentatamen te tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphante vincamus, et aeternae remunerationis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium te largiente sequamur.</hi> We offer unto thee O LORD the solemne Sacrifice (of praise and Thankesgiving) for the death and passion of St. <hi>George</hi> thy Martyr; beseeching thy divine cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, that by these holy mysteries, we may in thee subdue the manifold temptations of our old enemie the Divell, and be rewarded by thy grace with life eternall. The first of these two Prayers taken out of the <hi>Roman Missall,</hi> I finde also in the <hi>Breviarie,</hi> the <hi>Diurnum,</hi> and the <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium B. Mariae Virginis:</hi> so copious is that Church in the memoriall of our Martyr.</p>
               <p n="10">(10) I doubt not but it will be here objected, that we are driven to hard shifts, when wee are faine to repaire to <hi>Rome</hi>; from thence to prove St. GEORGE'S <hi>Saint-ship.</hi> This wee expect to heare of, and are ready to reply, that this is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth objecting. For here we draw no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:4211:116"/>
to prove how lawfully St. GEORGE may be invoked; or that his intercession may be used, for the more quicke dispatch of our affaires in the Court of Heaven. Onely wee note from hence, that anciently, and in the purer times of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church; St. GEORGE was constantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated, and in his proper course; as a noble Martyr. Vpon which ground, which in it selfe is good and commendable, if they have built, out of their owne, <hi>Wood,</hi> and <hi>Hay,</hi> and <hi>Stubble</hi>; a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and erronious practise not warrantable in the Church: I hope, without offence, it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me, or any else, to make the profitablest use out of their errours; and to verifie the truth and goodnesse of the ancient practise in this case, out of the faultie and erroneous corruption of the present. For I perswade my selfe, that in points onely of Historicall faith, wee may relie in part upon their publike <hi>Liturgies:</hi> and that we may conclude, that surely such a Saint there was, as GEORGE, or MAURICE, or SEBASTIAN, or the rest there honoured; because I finde them in the <hi>Missall,</hi> and the <hi>Breviarie</hi>; no man of this or any age, having as yet inform'd mee, that they have lately beene inserted into the bookes of <hi>Common-Service.</hi> Nay, as in nature, there must be first an habit, before we can admit of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and that in things corrupted, wee must suppose a true and reall being of that thing, thus fallen into corruption: so we may well inferre, upon a view of the corruptions in their <hi>Liturgies,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:4211:117"/>
that certainely there was some excellent use at first, of such a ceremonie, or such an institution; how ever that the foule corruptions of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent have polluted and defiled it. I would not wish me thinks, an argument of more validitie to prove the act of kneeling at the Lords Supper, to be of <hi>good Antiquitie</hi> in the Church of <hi>Christ:</hi> than from the adoration of it (or of the <hi>Hoste</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they call it) exacted in their <hi>Rituals</hi>; which is, no doubt, a superstitious, if not idolatrous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, of that ancient and reverend use of Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Nor would I choose a fairer way of dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to justifie the honourable estate of the <hi>married Clergie,</hi> against the clamours of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>; than to returne upon them, that in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like service of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is reputed commonly, though falsly, for a <hi>Sacrament:</hi> which false conceit of theirs, is a corruption one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the just and pious meaning of the Fathers; who therefore did extoll it in the highest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the better to beate downe those Hereticks which had disgraced it. More might be said in affirmation of this manner of proceeding; had I now either place or leisure. At this time only this, that I should more relie in matters meerely Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall of being, upon the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which certainly is not contrived upon no other ground, than lies and Fables: than upon any mans bare word which saith the contrary; or such weake arguments as are not able to conclude the matter controverted.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4211:120"/>
place fit and worthy of them. Which pietie of theirs, extended at the first, no further, than to the pious and devout interrement of their bodies: the tyranny of those which first made havocke of the Church, extending in those times, no further than to death. So reade we of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the <hi>Protomartyr</hi> of the Church; that being stoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, certaine devout men <hi>carried him,</hi> (or his body rather, which was his <hi>Relique,</hi> all that was left of him) <hi>to the buriall, and made great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But in succeeding times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grew more violent; so also grew the Tyrants more unmercifull, and barbarously cruell: no longer now contented with the simple death of those that suffered; but tearing of their limbs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and scattering abroad their bones, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting forth their ashes into the winde, that so they might not have the honour of an honest buriall. So witnesseth <hi>Lactantius</hi> of <hi>Diocletian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Divin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> instit. l. 5. cap. 11.</note> under whom St. GEORGE was made a Martyr, <hi>Et non tantùm artus hominum dissipat</hi> (saith he) <hi>sed &amp; ossa ipsa comminuit, &amp; in cineres furit, ne quis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet sepulturae locus.</hi> A desperate and raging tyrant, <hi>qui lucem vivis, terram mortuis denegabat</hi>; which neither would allow the benefit of life unto the living, nor buriall to the dead. In these and such like barbarous and cruell times, it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable custome of the <hi>Christians,</hi> to recollect those bones which by the Tyrants had bin so scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; and to interre them with due honour: that even the <hi>Bones also which were broken might reioyce</hi>;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4211:120"/>
that so those precious <hi>Reliques</hi> of their deere Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which were to meet together in a joyfull Resurrection, might not lye scattered, up and downe the fields, a scorne and laughter to the Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) At length according as the minds and thoughts of men were raised unto an high esteeme and admiration of the <hi>Martyrs:</hi> so did they with a greater zeale frequent their shrines; and set an higher price and estimate upon their <hi>Reliques.</hi> Not carefull onely to afford them all due respects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of those many myracles which it pleased GOD to worke in and about those places where they were intombed: but in short time, ascribing some divine and secret vertue to them; whereof, Heaven knowes, they were not guiltie. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded that the <hi>Turkes</hi> in the Sacke of <hi>Lyssa,</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the tombe of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> did violently breake it open, and take thence his bones; every one somewhat, more or lesse, as they could divide them: vainely conceiting, that they should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the worse in any action, as long as any <hi>Relique</hi> of that victorious Soldier was about them. So also that opinion, which the people of those devout and pious times, had first upon good grounds conceiv'd of any of the <hi>Martyrs</hi>; and that respect, which worthily at first, they bare unto their shrines and <hi>Reliques:</hi> degenerated at the last so farre, that they fell also into the same conceit and superstitious folly. Hereupon were
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4211:121"/>
the monuments and dormitories of the Saints againe opened: their bodies translated, some of them entire, into new <hi>Sepulchres</hi>; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dismembred peece by peece, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into farre Countries: that Church or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being conceived most happy, which had procured any the least bone into their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, of such especially of the Saints, which were in greatest credit and opinion with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So that now the cruelty of the barbarous tyrants in the height of persecution, might seeme to be revived in the dawning of Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which notwithstanding, there might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance bee somewhat said in their excuse: as <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Reliques</hi> then by them so zealously affected, were most of them true and reall; not counterfeited by any cheating <hi>Mountebanke</hi>; and therefore worthy of all due respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For who so cold in his affection to the Saints, that would not gladly give them honor, even in their dust? So much respect, no question, may be due unto the <hi>Reliques</hi> of the Saints, if true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such; as by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> was afforded to a parcell of the crosse, sent to him by the Byshop of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi>

upon me to defend it: it is briefly thus.

                  <q>Some certaine men, that carried with them some of St. GEORGE'S <hi>Reliques,</hi> and of others also of the Saints; came once unto a place in the frontires of <hi>Lymosin:</hi> where a few Priests, having a litle Chanterie or Oratorie made of boards, did daily powre out their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions to the Lord. There, for that night, they begg'd for lodging; and were accordingly made welcome.

But somewhat surely there was in it, which might occasion such an Embassie to <hi>Rome</hi>; and some dependance of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of this Country upon the Pope:
<q>It being noted by <hi>G. Sandys,</hi>

so lessoned by their superstitious teachers) as an advocate of victory: and did implore his helpe, <hi>ad expugnandos fidei hostes,</hi> in all their Warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enemies of our religion; as they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so pray unto St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> and St. <hi>Sebastian,</hi> though not so generally.

The issue of the miracle was this, that presently the enemies did turne their backs, and lost the field: there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slain upon the place, and in the chase, 100000. horse, besides foot innumerable; and in their trenches, such infinite store of victuals and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, that served not onely to refresh the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

               <p n="1">(1) <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ground thus layed, we now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto those publike honours, which have beene done unto our <hi>Martyr,</hi> by the Kings and Princes of the earth: of which, some of them, as before I said, reflect upon him, onely as a Saint in generall; some, as the principall Saint or <hi>Guardian</hi> of the military men; and others, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall Patron of the affaires of <hi>Christendome.</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:4211:143"/>
With these, we shall upon occasion, intermingle such honours also, as have beene afforded to him, by some few <hi>Patriarches</hi> and <hi>Prelates, Princes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,</hi> chiefe Rulers of their severall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Which we shall doe the rather, that so the pious actions of the King and civill Magistrate, may be abetted by the faire example of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates:</hi> and the devout performances of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> may be defended by the power and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, of their Soveraigne Princes. A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter questionlesse of chiefe importance to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse now in hand: the Soveraigne Prince, as hee alone is the originall of <hi>Civill honour,</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall nobilitie</hi>; so also not a little to be regarded, in his demeanor towards those above, whom he may honour, though he cannot make them honourable. We take it kindly, when those of lower qualitie, give us that worship and respect that is due unto us: but if we find an extraordinary regard at the hands of those to whom the Lord hath made us subject; we then conceive our selves, to be upon the very top and pinacle, of all worldly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. It was a greater honour unto IOSEPH,<note place="margin">Gen 41. <hi>V.</hi> 42.</note> that PHARAOH <hi>tooke a ring from his owne hand, and put it upon Iosephs, arayed him in vestures of fine linnen, and put a gold chaine about his necke</hi>; than if the whole, united suffrages of the Common people had decreed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> 43.</note> 
                  <hi>to crie before him, bow the knee.</hi>

                  </note> More also did it adde to the esteeme of DANIEL that the great <hi>Emperour</hi> of the East,

gave him the name of <hi>Belteshassar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4, 8.</note> according to the name of one of his especiall <hi>Gods:</hi> Than if that all his Subjects had studied to adorne him with the most glorious attributes, that possibly the wit of man could have invented. For if according unto ARISTOTLES affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Honour is rather seated in those,<note place="margin">Ethic. l. 1. c. 5.</note> which give it, than in them that doe receive it; (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:) Then certainely by how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more excellent, the party is, who doth respect or honour us; by so much more may wee conceive, that wee are honoured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected.</p>
               <p>For which cause,<note place="margin">Hest. ch. 6. v. 6.</note> when King AHASVERVS, proposed this question unto HAMAN, <hi>What shall bee done unto the man whom the King delighteth to honour:</hi> That proud and haughty Favorite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it rightly, that possibly a greater favour could not bee done unto a Subject; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon concluded in his owne heart, thus; <hi>To whom should the King delight to doe honour, more than to my selfe,</hi> so highly raised and setled in his good opinion. A false Conclusion, though the premises were true; I meane the <hi>Maior,</hi> or the <hi>Proposition,</hi> as they call it. Popular spirits, are carried commonly about with popular reports; and, like a flocke of silly sheepe, are prone to take that way, which any
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:4211:144"/>
better than themselves, have layd before them. But Kings haue Kingly mindes, and use not to relie upon uncertaine rumours: more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deny respects, where they may bee chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd; than to conferre them upon those, that have not truely merited.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) How much the honour done by Kings, ought to bee valued; wee may perceive in that which is related by IOSEPHVS, touching the Temple of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> Those of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and some <hi>Schismatickes</hi> of <hi>Iewrie</hi> with them,<note place="margin">Antiqu. Iud. l. 13. c. 7.</note> had built themselves a Temple on Mount <hi>Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim:</hi> which Temple they contended, before <hi>Ptolomie Philometor</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to bee more ancient and more orthodoxe, than that so cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the <hi>Iewes.</hi> A question hereupon ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; ANDRONICVS, a learned and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Iew,</hi> tooke on him <hi>the defence</hi> of the true Temple, as <hi>Advocate</hi> for those of <hi>Iudah:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Sabbaus,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> Proctors for the <hi>Samaritanes.</hi> The day of hearing come, and <hi>Ptolomie</hi> in presence, <hi>Andronicus</hi> had licence graunted by his <hi>Adversaries</hi>; first, to proceed unto his proofes: themselves not yet resolved, so it appear'd, what might bee sayd in theyr owne quarrell. Hee did so, and hee prooved his cause by three sorts of Arguments; first, from the letter of the Law, then from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and continuall succession of the high Priests: and lastly, That the Kings of <hi>Asia</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:4211:144"/>
had vouchsafed to Honour it with many cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly presents, and rich offerings. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. So farre the Storie. The application of it, this. Wee have already verified the Cause of our St. GEORGE, although not from the letter of the Law it selfe; yet from the practise of the Church, which is the fairest <hi>Commentarie</hi> that was ever made upon that letter: and wee have proved it, from the succession of so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Authors, most of them Priests, and other publicke Monuments of antiquitie; which since his time, the severall ages of the Church suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively have given us. It now remayneth, that wee make mention of those Honours, which have beene done unto him, by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the most parts of <hi>Christendome:</hi> That so there may bee nothing wanting, by which Saint <hi>George</hi> may bee restored unto his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and his Historie asserted. The issue of the former businesse was this, that those of Counsell for the <hi>Schismatickes</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> had nothing to reply: and so the sentence was pronounced in favour of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is the same, our evidence as faire, our
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:4211:145"/>
proofes as pregnant: and therefore wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume of equall favour, in the judgement. <hi>Nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que aequum reor</hi> (as <hi>Tullie</hi> hath it) <hi>ut qui in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem causa fuerunt,</hi>

Of this kinde are those many <hi>Monasteries,</hi> and Houses of religious persons, which have beene founded partly to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and dedicated by his Name.

               <p n="5">(5) But this, of all things else, cannot be well objected against this apparition of Saint <hi>George:</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> having no such end proposed unto himselfe, in raising this report; as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse his people, or to satisfie his avarice. And certainly were it recorded in any grave and serious Author, that such an apparition as this mention'd, of St. <hi>George</hi>; had beene seene gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the Armie, or by such others which might for certaine have affirmed it: I make no question, but the probability thereof might have

beene easily defended.

We have already in the prosecution of this Historie of Saint GEORGE; spoke of the appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Saint, and many others, at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of <hi>Antiochia:</hi> whereby the Christian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then ready for the fight, were so incouraged and revived, that they obtained a memorable victory upon the enemie. By meanes whereof, Saint <hi>George</hi> became so famous in all the parts of Christendome; and especially among those Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which were continually (in those times) sent to pursue the Warres of the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> that possibly there could not be a greater spurre unto the military men; than to suggest unto them, that Saint <hi>George</hi> had lately shewne himselfe unto their <hi>Chieftaines,</hi> and promised them successe, or counselled them in their designes. Master <hi>de Bellay</hi> hath recorded, that IOANE of <hi>Orleans,</hi> so much commemorated in our common <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi>; was not what shee appeared, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so disguised and prepared before hand,<note place="margin">

Who to embolden his Soldiers to the fight, wrote with a certaine juyce, the word <hi>Victorie,</hi> in the palme of his hand: and after, being at the Sacrifice, hee layed his hand cunningly upon the heart of it, so leaving the word <hi>Victorie</hi> imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on it; which presently he shewed unto those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, as if it had beene there written by the Gods. I cannot say for certaine that this appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to King <hi>Richard,</hi> was by him set on foot for the same purpose; and that it was no other than a Kingly fraud, to quicken and revive the spirits of his Soldiers: but I perswade my selfe, if I did say so, having no other testimony than an <hi>opinatum est</hi> against me; I might be pardoned for my boldnesse.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) This notwithstanding, the fame of such his apparition to that King, did, as before I said, exceedingly promote the reputation of that Saint among the <hi>English:</hi> so farre, that the most excellent Prince King EDVVARD the third, made choyce of him, for his Patron.

For true it is, that this most noble Order was instituted on the 23. of this King, which falls out rightly, with the yeare 350. But then King IOHN of <hi>France,</hi> was but newly entred on his Kingdome: and the expulsion of King HENRY was the last act almost, of that tryumphant Prince of <hi>Wales; Don Pedro</hi> not comming into <hi>England,</hi> till the thirty ninth of King <hi>Edward.</hi>

<q>For the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, it is received generally, that it tooke beginning from a Garter of the Queene, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Ioane</hi> Countesse of <hi>Salisburie,</hi> a Ladie of incomparable beauty, which fell from her as she danced, and the King tooke up from the ground.

                  <q>Which were it so (saith Master <hi>Camden</hi>) it need not seeme to be a base originall thereof,<note place="margin">Camden in Attrebat.</note> considering as one saith, <hi>nobilitas sub amore iacet.</hi> He addes withall, that some report, how from his owne Garter given forth, as a signall of a battaile, which sped so fortunately; hee call'd them Knights of the <hi>Garter.</hi>

But whatsoever the occasion of it was, likely it is that it tooke this name from <hi>the blew Garter,</hi> which the Fellowes of it weare on their left Leg: carrying the foresaid impresse wrought with <hi>golden Letters,</hi> and encha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with precious Stones; and fastned with a buckle of Gold, as with the Bond

Which Lawes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were first instituted and devised, by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Prince, King <hi>Edward,</hi> of that name the third; after revised and ratified by many the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings: And on the <hi>Reformation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> much altered by King <hi>Edward,</hi> of that name the sixt.<note place="margin">Pag. 143<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>About this time</hi> (saith Sir <hi>Iohn Hayward,</hi> in his Historie of that Prince) <hi>the Order was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most wholly altered, as by the Statutes thereof then made it doth appeare.</hi> A thing not to bee wondred at. For even the Lawes of the most setled States and Kingdomes have beene often changed and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; according to occasion and the Princes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Vnto them also, to the <hi>Soveraignes,</hi> I meane, or to their <hi>Deputies,</hi> it appertaines to choose and nominate into the Order, whom they esteeme to bee most worthy of that honour; and like to bee the greatest ornament unto it. Yet so, that sixe at least of the said fellowes doe conveene at the <hi>Election,</hi> and concurre in it: the residue of them being all warned to bee there present, and such as faile of their attendance, without just cause, such as the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> shall approve, to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merced. In their elections, two things there are, which they especially observe. First, that the partie nominated, bee a Gentleman of name
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:4211:165"/>
and armes for three descents, both by the Fathers side and by the Mothers.<note place="margin">Camd. Bliz. Anno 1563.</note> For which cause, when the <hi>Garter</hi> was reproachfully taken from the Lord <hi>William Paget,</hi> by <hi>Dudley</hi> of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to give to <hi>Iohn</hi> his eldest sonne, the Earle of <hi>Warwicke:</hi> he used this colour to disguise that foule dishonour; that the said Lord, (as the first raiser of his house) <hi>was said to bee no gentleman of blood, neither by Father nor by Mother:</hi> as Sir <hi>Iohn Hayward</hi> tells the storie.<note place="margin">Hist. of Ew. 6. pag. 143.</note> The second thing to be observed, is that the partie nominated, bee without spot, or foule reproach: as <hi>viz.</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict of Heresie; nor attaint of treason; nor by his Prodigalitie and riot decayed in his estate, by meanes whereof hee is not able to conserve the honour of his Order; nor such a one that ever fled in the day of battaile, his <hi>Soveraigne Lord,</hi> or his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> being in the Feild. In all which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, a Knight elected and installed; may also, if it please the <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> be degraded. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie chosen by the Prince, if he bee a stranger, is certified thereof soone after by Letters from the <hi>Soveraigne:</hi> and many times, the Statutes of that Order, have beene sent unto him, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them, whether or no he will accept of this election. But this a matter meerely formall. For commonly our Kings are first well assured of the parties good affection to them, before they choose him; and as for forreigne <hi>Princes,</hi> it is a true note of Master <hi>Camdens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Attrebat.</note> that <hi>the most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them have reputed it their chiefest honour to be
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:4211:165"/>
chosen and admitted into this Companie:</hi> as we have said before, and shall see anon, in the ensuing <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue.</hi> If he accept it (as no question but hee will,) then doth the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> forthwith send unto him by his <hi>Ambassadour,</hi> and the chiefe <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi> (commonly) the whole habit of the Order, with the <hi>Garter</hi> and the <hi>Collar</hi>; wherewith they doe invest him. And on the other side, the Prince or stranger so invested, within convenient time, send their sufficient Deputie, with a mantle of <hi>blew Velvet,</hi> to be installed in their roome, at St. GEORGE'S Church at <hi>Windsore.</hi> But if the partie chosen be a Subject of the Kingdome, the <hi>Garter</hi> is delivered to him presently upon his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to signifie that he is chose into the Order. Afterwards, in the <hi>Chapter-house,</hi> upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Commission before the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> or his Deputie; he is invested with his <hi>Robe</hi> and with his <hi>Hood.</hi>
Then followes the <hi>Installment</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with many grave and magnificent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: which done, he doth receive the <hi>Collar</hi> of the Order.<q> These, at their installations, have alwayes an oath administred; that to their power, during the time they shall be fellowes of the Order, they shall defend the honor, quarrels, rights, and lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships of the <hi>Soveraigne</hi>; and that they shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to preserve the honor of the said Order; and all the statutes of it, they shal well observe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraud or <hi>Covin.</hi>
                  </q>
Which oath is by the natives of the kindome, taken absolutely, and in termes; but many times, by strangers, relatively and by halfes, in reference to some former Order. So
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:4211:166"/>
So when King <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> was by the Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> invested with the Garter, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1585,<note place="margin">Camden. in Elizab.</note> he tooke his oath to keepe the Statutes of the Order in all points, <hi>Quae legibus Ordinis S. Spiritus, &amp; S. Michaelis non adversantur</hi>; wherein they were not opposite unto the Order of St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to which he had bin sworn before.<note place="margin">Id. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Anno 1582.</note> Vpon which reason also, <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> though he did joyfully accept the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Order; refused to take the oath at all: because he had beene sworne before (at his instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the Order of Saint <hi>Michael</hi>) to the King of <hi>France.</hi> Being thus solemnely installed, and seated in the place belonging to them in the Chappell, their next care is to fasten an <hi>Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon</hi> of their <hi>Armes and hachments,</hi> in a plate of mettall, upon the backe of their said <hi>stalls:</hi> which they remove, according as themselves, in Order, are advanced higher. And in that Order, doe they also change the places of their banners, swords and Helmets; which are continually set over their said <hi>stalls,</hi> during their being of the Order. This onely is the difference, that at the death of any of the <hi>Knights</hi> of this most noble Order, their Plate of <hi>Armes,</hi> is left for ever to that <hi>stall,</hi> where last they sate; to preserve their memory: whereas the Banner, Sword, and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, are all taken downe; and offered with all due solemnities; the <hi>Offering</hi> made by such of the surviving <hi>Knights,</hi> as by the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> shall
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:4211:166"/>
be destinated to that service. I said before, that they remove their <hi>Plates,</hi> and <hi>Hachments,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as themselves in order are advanced higher. in this <hi>Order,</hi> they take place according to the antiquitie of their Creation; and not according to their dignities, titles, and estates: so that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Knight <hi>Bachelour,</hi> hath place before an Earle or Baron; as not long since wee had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in Sir <hi>Harry Lea,</hi> Knight, keeper of the Armorie. Onely in honour unto strangers, which bee Dukes, or Sonnes and Brethren unto forreine Kings and Princes: it is permitted that they take their roomes and places, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their qualitie. Hitherto have we spoken of the Election of Saint GEORGES Knights, and their admission to the Order. A litle would be said now of the meanes and wayes, whereby their roomes are voyded, and their places desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; and they are three: for either they are voyde by Death, or by Degradation, or by Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and surrendrie. The second of the three (for here we will not speake of Death) is Degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: a peece of Iustice more to bee commended where it may not, than where it may bee spared. The cases wherein Degradation is allowed of, I have shewne already: but the examples are but fewe. <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> which was so scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully degraded by <hi>Northumberland</hi>; was by Qu. <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Camden Eliz. Anno 1563.</note> with great honour, restored againe unto his <hi>Order.</hi> And Sir <hi>Iohn Fastolfe,</hi> which for his
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:4211:167"/>
valiantnesse had beene elected of the Order, was by the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Halls Chron. in Ew. 6.</note> under whom hee served, and unto whom he was <hi>great Master of the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>; devested in great anger of his GEORGE and GARTER: because hee had departed from a battaile, (which the <hi>English</hi> lost) without stroke stricken. But afterwards by meanes of friends, and upon good excuse, and reason, by him alleaged in his defence, (as certainly he was a wise and valiant Captaine, however in the stage, they haue beene pleased to make merry with him) he was restored unto his honour. The third and last meanes of avoydance, is by Cession &amp; Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie: &amp; the examples hereof also are but few. This I am sure of, (not to make further search into it) that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> beeing offended with Qu. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> about the altering of Religion, and thereby alienated from the <hi>English:</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red backe to the Lord Vicount <hi>Mountague,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Camd. Eliz. Anno 1560.</note> the robes and habit of the Order, wherewith he was invested on his marriage with Qu. <hi>Mary.</hi> By which his Act, as the Historian hath observed, <hi>Cum Anglis amicitiam visus est prorsus eiurare:</hi> he seemed to breake off utterly, all amitie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the realme of <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, King <hi>Philip</hi> being once resolved to renounce his Order, was of necessitie to send backe the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. For so it is ordained amongst them, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven such of them as depart this life, are to take care especially, that the <hi>Garter,</hi> bee restored unto the <hi>Soveraigne</hi>; by him and by the Company of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:4211:167"/>
the said Order, to be disposed of to some other. Examples in which kinde are infinite to bee rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Windsore,</hi> the fairest and most stately of our <hi>English</hi> Pallaces, was by King <hi>Edward</hi> who ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and beautified it; conceived most fit to bee the Seate of that most excellent Order, which he had established. An house indeed, worthie of such inhabitants; and therefore worthily honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them. For here, they alwayes leave in readinesse, the mantle of their Order, to be layed up for them; for any suddaine chances which might happen to require their presence at Saint GEORGES Chappell, or in the <hi>Chapter-house.</hi> Here doe they solemnize the Installations of their Brethren; and performe their obsequies. And lastly, such a reverend regard they owe the place, that if they come within two miles of it (except that they be hindered by some weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant businesse) they alwayes doe repaire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and putting on their mantles, which are there in readinesse, proceed unto the <hi>Chappell,</hi> and there make their <hi>Offerings.</hi> Nor doe they go at any time from out the Castle, if their occasions bring them thither; till they have offered in like manner. I should now from the <hi>Knights</hi> and from the <hi>Order,</hi> proceed unto the <hi>Patron</hi> of it: but that I first must meet an errour; by some reputed as a Law and <hi>Statute</hi> of the Order, and so delivered by tradition from hand to hand:<note place="margin">Pol. Virgil lib. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that those of this <hi>Heroicke Order,</hi> are by their <hi>Order</hi> bound, <hi>Vt mutuo se iuvent,</hi> that they defend each other, at all extremities and assaies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:4211:168"/>But doubtlesse there is no such matter. Onely the Knights are bound, not to ingage themselves in the service of a forreine Prince, without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from the <hi>Soveraigne:</hi> nor to beare Armes on one side, if any of their <hi>Fellowes</hi> bee already entertained upon the other. This is the ground of the report: for <hi>Omnis fabula</hi> (as the <hi>Mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists</hi> affirme) <hi>fundatur in Historia.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Id.

Conceiving, that if once he were Companion of that Order, the King of <hi>England,</hi> as the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne thereof, would be obliged, to countenance and aide him in his Warres against the <hi>French.</hi> Which hopes, as they were built upon a false, and ruinous ground; so is it not to bee admired, if they deceived him. <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> who before accounted mutuall defence to be a Statute of this Order: doth, in this passage, overthrow his owne building. Concluding this relation, of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> and his investiture, with this note; <hi>Iampridem ea consuetudo ferendi auxilij obsoleverat:</hi> that long agoe that custome had beene out of use.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> He might as well have said, and more agreeable unto the truth; it had never beene.</p>

<q>And though (saith he) for the credit of the killing of the Dragon I leave every man to his owne beleefe: yet I cannot but thinke, that if the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had not some probable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of that his memorable act among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; it is strange, that the Order full of honor, which <hi>Edward</hi> the third founded,<note place="margin">Hist. of the world, Part, 1 l. 2. c. 7. §. 3. †. 5.</note> and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours royally continued, should have borne his name: seeing the world had not that scarcity of Saints in those dayes, as that the <hi>English</hi> were to make such an erection upon a fable, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son fained.</q>
So hee: And this I well allow of in relation to the Saint; whose being, and whose being of a Saint of speciall eminencie, it justifies sufficiently. But I perswade my selfe, it cannot well be used in the defence of his killing of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:4211:170"/>
Dragon: which being thrust into the <hi>Legends</hi> by <hi>Iacobus de Voragine,</hi> as before we noted, found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a generall entertainment in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church: and amongst other places here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> also.</p>
               <p n="12">(12) As therefore some have made the whole storie of St. GEORGE, to be symbolicall; so have some others made it to be also, of the same nature, in particular relation to this Order.

and state whatsoever.</q>
Which words of theirs may bee approved also, so farre as that this use may commendably bee made of it: but if they were thus spoken, as in relation to the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the founder; there is not any thing more false, nor lesse agreeable to the truth of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. I say, this use may commendably bee made of it. For by the Charter of the <hi>Institution</hi> it apppeares plainely, that this most excellent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was first ordained unto the honour <hi>of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> GOD, <hi>and to the exaltation of the Holy Catholicke Faith.</hi> And in <hi>the Statutes of the Order,</hi> it is a cause sufficient for a <hi>Knight to be refused at the Election</hi>; yea, and degraded after his <hi>Installation:</hi> that hee hath beene <hi>convicted and attainted of Heresie, and errour, against the Faith Catholicke; or hath for any such offence, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred any paine, or conviction publicke.</hi> Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that when it is appointed, that their <hi>Banners Swords</hi> and <hi>Helmets,</hi> shall bee placed above their <hi>stalls</hi>; it is to this intent and purpose: <hi>to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> (so saith the <hi>Statute</hi>) <hi>that they doe beare them in defence of holy Church, as all true knighthood doth require.</hi> So that we see, that all the purpose of the Order is to instruct and lesson them; still to oppose the Divell, <hi>that old Dragon,</hi> and all his instruments what ever, in maintenance of the Gospell, and Gods true Religion. For which cause doubtlesse, doth <hi>Chaucer,</hi> in a Sonnet to the fellowes of the Order; thus counsaile and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise them.</p>

               <p>So farre our English <hi>Homer,</hi> the Father of our <hi>English-Muses.</hi> I am not able to affirme it, but possibly it may be so, that some such matter was intended; when it was ordered so precisely in the Statutes, that none of this most noble Order, shall be seene openly without his <hi>George:</hi> and that it may <hi>not be ingaged, aliened, nor sold, nor given away, for any need, cause, or necessitie whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> Whereas the other of the Ornaments, are for solemne dayes onely; and that the <hi>Garter</hi> may sometimes be layed aside, as in case of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny journey: for then it is sufficient to weare a <hi>blew ribband</hi> under their bootes, to denote the <hi>Garter.</hi> I say perhaps some such might bee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of it: but I affirme it not for certaine. This I am sure of, that this their constant and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wearing of St. GEORGE'S Image, may be a faire instruction unto all of this Heroicke Order; never to lay aside St. GEORGE'S resolution, of encountring with the Dragon, <hi>that old Serpent</hi>; that so they may at last receive the blessed and <hi>immarcessible Crowne of Glorie.</hi>

of Saint GEORGE'S Historie, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it selfe: so farre forth, as it hath beene commended to us, in the best Authors. In that, we have confirmed it, first, by the testimony of such Writers of good qualitie; which have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimously concurr'd in it: and those both of the <hi>Greeke Church, and of the Latine; both Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and Papists.</hi> In the next place, we had recourse unto the practice of the <hi>Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke</hi>; which hath abundantly express'd her good opinion of him: in giving him such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall place in her publike <hi>Martyrologies,</hi> and in her <hi>ordinarie Service</hi>; in taking such a tender care of his precious <hi>Reliques,</hi> and consecrating by his name, so many goodly and magnificent Temples. To this, wee have adjoyn'd the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like honours done unto him, by the greatest <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Republicks</hi> in the Christian world. Not onely in erecting Monasteries to his name, and memory; and instituting Orders of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons to his honour: but, as the times then were, in making him the tutelarie Saint of their <hi>Men of Warre,</hi> the speciall <hi>Patron</hi> of their estates, and military Orders also; and not so onely, but the <hi>Guardian</hi> of the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed affaires of <hi>Christianitie.</hi> In the last place, wee haue particularly related the honours done unto him heere in <hi>England</hi>: as generally, in calling Churches by his name, in making him the <hi>Patron</hi> of this most noble Kingdome, in
