            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Rebels have perſiſted in their cruell and tyrannicall wayes blocked us up round about, and have taken from us whatſoever wee had lying without the Gate, what was not uſefull for them, they deſpitefully burnt; and whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they took of our Nation, whether man, woman, or child, have cruelly and inhumanely hanged and murthered: and for this three weekes ſpace wee have not been able to ſend a Letter to the Lord Preſident, but by water, and that with a great deale of difficultie. But praiſed be God, about ſeven or eight dayes ſince the Lord Preſident upon our bleeding importunitie, appointed the Lord <hi>Baltinglas</hi> his halfe company, to come hither by ſea to help us, which conſiſted of 44 or 45 men, who arrived here the 15. and brought with them eight bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of powder, and an hundred skeanes of match, whereof ſix barrels, and fiftie skeanes were allotted for Bandonbridge, the other fiftie skeanes and two
<pb facs="tcp:42443:3"/>
barrels doe remaine heere for the defence of the towne, which did favour well with us, becauſe it was the firſt that ever we received. The 16. the Troops of Bandonbridge came hither to renew, and carry away the ſaid proviſions, and for their better convoy, we ſent with them our troop, which conſiſted of about fortie Horſe and fortie Foot, which went with them about foure miles, and drew up all our forces wee could make, to make good the retreat, if occaſion had been; our Forces no ſooner parted from our friends, but thoſe of Bandon fell into an Ambuſcado, which was laid purpoſely for them, conſiſting of about 300 men, who fired each upon other; ſuch was the great work of God Almightie, that ours conſiſting of about 80 Horſe, went thorow in deſpite of them, ſlew or killed about 80 of them, without the loſſe of a man; they wanted foure, which they imagined had been ſlaine, but they remained here playing the ill husbands, and went not with their friends; our people in their retreat pillaged, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the houſes they could eſpy; and being come all together, wee marched in a body towards a multitude of them, which appeared upon a mountaine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Belgoly, and lay in ambuſh on the further ſide of the mountaine; the hils round about us were covered with them, wee marched within Musket-ſhot of the maine body of them, and made a ſtand, every man deſirous to march up to them, but night was at hand, and they had very much advantage of the ground; while wee ſtood in ſight of them, they made many hideous ſhouts, calling us Engliſh Rebels, and trayterous villaines, and threatened, that before Munday following; to burne and ranſack our towne; but theſe were but flouriſhes, for that night they retreating to their accuſtomed place Belgoly, where their camp lay, many of their people run away, and it ſeems their Sabbath-Sacrifice wrought little effect; for the chiefe of them, which was <hi>Barry Oage</hi> and <hi>Ieremy Long,</hi> commanded the armed men to march towards my Lord of <hi>Muskrie</hi> his camp, and the reſt they adviſed to ſhift for themſelves: we are informed that many of the armed men did not march far, but run every man his way; this I conceive could not be in any policie, but meerly the finger of God, that ſtrook their hearts with ſuch feare and terrour, as they could not ſtay any longer.</p>
            <p>On munday morning we marched thither, where wee found good ſtore of proviſion, ſome we brought away, the reſt we burned with the houſes, and all the Countrey thereabouts, ſo they cannot in haſte in camp themſelves there again with any commodity: ſome few ſtraglers were found there, which were killed, onely two or three, which we brought home priſoners, which I believe we ſhal hang this day; ſome things they have diſcovered, but to no great purpoſe, that it was meerely feare that drove them away, thinking thoſe eaſternly wind which then blew, had brought us great ſtore of men out of England.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday we went forth againe, and tooke poſſeſſion of a Caſtle called Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloyne, where we have left a guard of 12. Muſquetiers, it lyeth a mile from the
<pb facs="tcp:42443:3"/>
Towne toward Bandonbridge, which was good ſervice; for by that means we have gained a Mill which lyeth under command of the Caſtle, and hope we ſhall keepe it; we had not the uſe of any Mill this three weeks till now, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us (though we have ſtore of Corne) to want bread.</p>
            <p>We have certaine advice, that about ſeven dayes ſince, the Lord Preſidents forces, about 600. foote, and 200. Horſe, ſallyed out of Corke, and ſet upon my Lord of <hi>Muskrie,</hi> and Lord General <hi>Barries</hi> great Camp, which conſiſted of about 8000. The Rebels ſtood a while, but at laſt as many as could did flye, only one Company led by <hi>Mac Finins,</hi> Brother of <hi>Glon<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There were ſlaine of the Rebels no man knowes how many, our men brought in 620. Muſquets and Pikes which lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the dead, they brought in abundance of prouiſions, my Lord of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kries</hi> Plate, and apparell, and many other good things. So I hope they will not be able to recover in haſte ſuch a head againe: their Bogs and woods muſt bee their chiefeſt forts.</p>
            <p>A paſſage or two more, though I be ſomething tedious, I will relate; In my former Letters, I related the great loſſe ſuſtained at a Farme, which I had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Eneskonnis,</hi> it yeelded me 92 pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and the ſtock was my own the Tenant was to make it good at each years end, only I had great ſtore of corne which I could not get threſhed, to bring it away; for after this Rebellion began none of the villaines would labour: I had of wheat the growth of 35. Acres and as good as any in the Countrey, beſide Barley and Oats, my Landlord <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trik Rach</hi> of Polelonge, taking it for his owne, as he formerly had done with m<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Caſtle, and all things elſe, got two or three hundred with their colours to come thither to threſh, and carry it away, halfe for himſelfe, and the other halfe for thoſe that did labour, and ſtand by to guard him, but whiles they were about it the Troops of Bandon, and a few Muſquetiers fell in among them, killed near 100 of them, put the reſt to flight, and carryed with them a great part of the Corn, which was made ready at their hands; and in this ſervice they loſt not a man: A while after the Rebells attempted to ſteale away ſome Cowes near Bandon, and tooke two or three ſmall children that were keeping of the ſaid Cowes, which they killed moſt barbarouſly, took them by the Legs and Armes and tore them aſunder, one of the children they found ſtab'd with a Skean in a dozen places at the leaſt, which inhumanity did ſo much inrage them, that the next day they made another ſalley upon the Rebells, and afterwards <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> upon a Caſtle called Dondoniell Caſtle, where ſome time the Iron works ſtood; it was ſo full of men and proviſions, that they had made Linnies without ſide, againſt the walls of the Caſtle, which they filled with hutches of corn and
<pb facs="tcp:42443:4"/>
houſhold-ſtuffe, which they had taken from the Engliſh: Our men placed Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers round about them, in ſuch manner, that none of them within durſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon the battailment, nor peep out their noſe at the loop-holes; ſent in five or ſixe men that were skilfull in mining under the ſaid Linnies, who laboured ſo luſtily, that in three or foure houres they had made a hole thorow the wall; where they put in furze and ſtraw, which did ſet the lower rooms of the Caſtle on fire, ſo that the Rebels and the proviſions that were within, were burnt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: of what was in the Linnies they ſaved but two hundred horſe load, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it by degrees to the Towne of Bandon. Had we but three or foure hundred men more, we ſhould ſoone be able to cleare the river of Bandon, upon which are three Caſtles very well fortified, Kilgobane, Polelonge, and Corgenas. The land-lord of Polelonge <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Had I men in place, I would be content to maintaine them with victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls and pay at my owne charge, untill I had taken the ſaid Caſtle of Polelonge, ſo that I might enjoy the ſaid Caſtle, and Land thereunto belonging, which is <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I pray, if you have any friends amongſt that honorable aſſembly petition for ſome thing that might do us good: For my part, I have loſt all, and for merchandizing there will be ſo little hopes while I live in this Kingdome; ſo that unleſſe it pleaſe God to <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bove their hearts to ſupport me in ſome good way, I muſt be enforced to ſteer ſuch a courſe, as after ſo much loſſe will not well ſuit with my age.</p>
            <p>The Iriſh inhabitants of this towne, Cork, and Youghall are no better than thoſe that are abroad in action; they did generally give intelligence of all that paſſed, and kept all things from us; I have diſcovered that many of the chiefeſt of the towne did goe daily to Belgolie Camp; and if friends to them, they muſt needs be enemies unto us: I have layd hold of ſome of them, I will adviſe my Lord Preſident of their proceedings.</p>
            <p>Had not God Almighty dealt thus mercifully with us, that the hearts of thoſe miſcreants ſhould thus faile them, to flye when none purſues them, that in our encounters with them we loſe not one for 100. and ſeeing that all theſe late Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>At the beginning of theſe troubles our watches were mixt Iriſh and Engliſh together, but ſince we have divided our ſelves, the Engliſh have all retired to the water ſide, and the Iriſh keep the upper old town; ſo that if they profeſſe any <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <pb facs="tcp:42443:4"/>
did very well approve of their doings: now a little of buſineſſe I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what you write of the Ship <hi>Charles,</hi> I have thereupon thought it the beſt courſe to perſwade Mr. <hi>Iohn Brooks</hi> to goe over to informe that Honourable Houſe what manner of ſhip ſhe is, and what ſhe has and will ſtand us in to ſet her forth compleatly to Sea, ſhe will ſtand us upward of five thouſand pound. I ſhall deſire you to be an aſſiſtant to the bearer Maſter <hi>I. Brooks,</hi> to petition to the Parliament to have ſatisfaction for the time wee have ſpent in Harbour from the 12 day of Januarie, for the defence of the Fort Towne and Harbour, which under God, was the chiefe preſervation of them all; for till of late, the Fort was very weake, and ill-manned; and together to be imployed in the Kings ſervice, and to allow us the rates which other ſhips have, three pound 16. ſhill. <hi>per</hi> Moneth each man; ſhe is already in place, and doubtleſſe may doe as good ſervice as any ſhip that is imployed; ſhe will carry and hath Ports for thirty peeces of Ordnance; we have already 24 Barrels of powder, five cables, and double Sayles: but for this I referre you to the Relation of the bearer, praying you to aſſiſt him effectually; hee is a very able deſerving man; he carryeth a Letter from Captaine <hi>Dowrick,</hi> a part owner to a kinſeman of his, one Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kot;</hi> a good friend to Mr. <hi>Pimme</hi> and Maſter <hi>Stroud;</hi> the ſaid Maſter <hi>Stroud</hi> is a very able deſerving Gentleman, I knew him when my Brother <hi>Nich. Glanfield</hi> lived in <hi>Taneſtock,</hi> but I believe he doth not remember me. I pray God direct their hearts, that we may have ſome ayde come over in time, to keep them from reaping what they have ſowne, and before they have powder and Arms from other parts, leſt they ſhould take head againe. 10000 men in Munſter would in my opinion, in a very ſhort time do the buſineſſe, and fetch back our cattell and Horſes, which they have driven into <hi>Muſgrow</hi> woods. If I had but two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men at preſent, to what we have, I am very confident I should doe ſome ſervice to Gods glory in the defence of my Religion and Nation; and thus much believe of my conceited opinion, That if theſe Rebells be pardoned, this Kingdome will never be ſecure; the abuſes are ſo inhumane, and ſo devilish, that if it become pardonable, none will care what offence he committeth: and the hatred betweene the Nations is ſo great, that it is impoſſible that ever it can bee forgotten. Let us have leave to fight it out to the laſt man: or if not, and that they muſt live here, let us have leave to depart, and ſeeke ſome other place for our habitation.</p>
            <p>We have at preſent abundance of corne, by reaſon of two or three prizes, French-men laden with Wheat and Rye, brought in by our men of warre. It is a great over-ſight, that in all this time we have not more Ships, one or two to ride conſtantly in each Port, to hinder the comming of proviſion and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition to the Rebells, which cannot be ſo ſecurely done by keeping a few ſhips at ſea: The ſure way is, as I have ſaid, to have a ſhip or two to ride con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb facs="tcp:42443:5"/>
in each port, and halfe a doeen of nimble ſhips to keepe at Sea upon the head lands. I pray you be vigilant that we may have ſatisfaction for our loſſes, and ſome reward for our honeſt endevour. I have furniſhed his Mejeſties Fort of this place, Cork, Kings ſhip, and otherwiſe in his Majeſties ſervice, to the value of 400 pounds in Deale hoords, Iron, Pitch, Tar, Train, Ammunitions, and monies and know not yet when, or by whom I ſhal be ſatisfied for the ſame; and whatſoever I have yet remaining, I will willingly part with in the ſaid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and am reapy to ſeale this my intent to the laſt drop of my bloud. There have beene a great many of our Nation who are very able both in perſon and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to ſerve in this cauſe, that have ſtolne away, and carryed their eſtates monies, and proviſion wish them; it were good in my opinion that enquiry were made after them in in England, and compelled not onely to returne in their owne perſons, but to bring over others at their owne charge, it would be but an eaſie puniſhment for their cowardly baſeneſſe. I ſhall peſire you to be mindfull of us in your prayers to God Almighty; In whom I reſt.</p>
