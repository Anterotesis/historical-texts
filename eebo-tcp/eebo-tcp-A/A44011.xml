            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which I do here most
humbly present to Your
Sacred Majesty, is the
best Part of my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
upon the Natural
Causes of Events, both
of such as are commonly known, and of
such as have been of late artificially exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by the Curious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are ranged under seven Heads.</hi>
1. Problems of Gravity. 2. Problems
of Tides. 3. Problems of <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
4. Problems of Heat. 5. Problems
of Hard and Soft. 6. Problems of
Wind and Weather. 7. Problems of
Motion Perpendicular, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
<pb facs="tcp:45571:3"/>
               <hi>&amp;c. To which I have added,</hi>
Two Propositions of Geometry;
<hi>One is,</hi> The Duplication of the Cube,
hitherto sought in vain; <hi>The other,</hi>
A Detection of the absurd Use of
Arithmetick, as it is now applied to
Geometry.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of Natural Causes hath
not infallible and evident Principles. For
there is no Effect which the Power of
God cannot produce by many several
ways.</p>
            <p>But seeing all Effects are produced by
Motion, he that supposing some one or
more Motions can derive from them the
necessity of that Effect whose Cause is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
has done all that is to be expected
from Natural Reason. And though he
prove not that the thing was thus produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
yet he proves that thus it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
when the Materials, and the power
of Moving is in our hands; which is as
useful as if the Causes themselves were
known. And notwithstanding the absence
<pb facs="tcp:45571:3"/>
of rigorous Demonstration, this Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of Nature (if not rendred obscure
by empty terms) is the most Noble Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of the Mind that can be, to such
as are at leisure from their necessary Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
            <p>This that I have done I know is anun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Present to be offered to a <hi>KING,</hi>
though considered (as God considers Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings)
together with the Mind and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the Offerer, I hope will not be to
Your Majesty unacceptable.</p>
            <p>But that which I chiefly consider in it
is, that my Writing should be tryed by
Your Majesties Excellent Reason untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Language that has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
or made use of by Men when they
were puzzled; and who is acquainted
with all the Experiments of the time;
and whose approbation (if I have the
good Fortune to obtain it) will protect my
reasoning from the Contempt of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45571:4"/>
I will not break the custom of joyning
to my Offering a Prayer; And it is,
<hi>That Your Majesty will be pleased
to pardon this following short Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for my</hi> Leviathan. Not that I
rely upon Apologies, but upon Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
most Gracious General Pardon.</p>
            <p>That which is in it of Theology, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the general Current of Divines,
is not put there as my Opinion, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with submission to those that have
the Power Ecclesiastical.</p>
            <p>I did never after, either in Writing or
Discourse, maintain it.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in it against <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy;</hi>
I cannot therefore imagine what
reason any Episcopal-man can have to
speak of me (as I hear some of them do)
as of an <hi>Atheist,</hi> or man of no Religion,
unless it be for making the Authority of
the Church wholly upon the Regal Power;
which I hope Your Majesty will think is
neither Atheism nor Heresie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45571:4"/>
But what had I to do to meddle with
matters of that nature, seeing Religion is
not <hi>Philosophy,</hi> but <hi>Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was written in a time when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Christ's Kingdom was made use
of for the most horrid Actions that can be
imagined; And it was in just Indignation
of that, that I desired to see the bottom of
that Doctrine of the Kingdom of Christ,
which divers Ministers then Preached for
a Pretence to their Rebellion; which
may reasonably extenuate, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the writing of it.</p>
            <p>There is therefore no ground for so
great a Calamny in my writing. There is
no sign of it in my Life; and for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
when I was at the point of Death
at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>
can bear witness of it, if he be asked.
Therefore, I most humbly beseech Your
Sacred Majesty not to believe so ill of me
upon reports, that proceed often (and may
do so now) from the displeasure which
commonly ariseth from difference in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb facs="tcp:45571:5"/>
nor to think the worse of me, if
snatching up all the Weapons to fight
against Your Enemies, I lighted upon one
that had a double edge.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>WHat may be the cause, think
you, that stones, and other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
thrown upward, or carried
up and left to their liberty, fall down again
(for ought a man can see) of their own accord?
I do not think (with the old Philosophers)
that they have any love to the Earth, or are
sullen, that they will neither go nor stay. And
yet I cannot imagine what body there is above
that should drive them back.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>For my part, I believe the cause of
their descending is not in any natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
of the bodies that descend, but rather
that the Globe of the Earth hath some
special motion, by the which it more easily
casteth off the Air, than it doth other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
And then this descent of those we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45571:8"/>
call heavy bodies, must of necessity follow;
unless there be some empty spaces in the
world to receive them. For when the Air
is thrown off from the Earth, somewhat
must come into the place of it, (in case
the world be full) and it must be those
things which are hardliest cast off, that is
those things which we say are heavy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But suppose there be no place empty (for
I will defer the Question till anon) how can
the Earth cast off either the Air, or any
thing else?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I shall shew you how, and that by a
familiar Example. If you lay both your
hands upon a Basen with water in it, how
little soever, and move it circularly, and
continue that motion for a while, and you
shall see the water rise upon the sides, and
fly over; by which you may be assured
that there is a kind of circulating motion,
which would cast off such bodies as are
contiguous to the body so moved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I know very well there is; and it is
the same motion which Country people use to
purge their Corn; For the Chaff and Straws,
by casting the Grain to the side of the Seive,
will come towards the middle. But I would
see the Figure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Here it is. There is a Circle pricked
out, whose Center is A, and three less
Circles, whose Centers are B, C, D; let
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45571:8"/>
every one of them represent the Earth, as
it goeth from B to C, and from C to D,
always touching the uttermost Circle, and
throwing off the Air, as is marked at E and
F. And if the world were not full, there
would follow by this scattering of the Air,
a great deal of space left empty. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the world full, there must be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
shifting of the Air, one part into the
place of another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But what makes a stone come down,
suppose from <hi>G?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If the Air be thrown up beyond G,
it will follow, that at the last, if the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be continued, all the Air will be above
G, that is, above the stone; which cannot
be, till the stone be at the Earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But why comes it down still with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
swiftness?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Because as it descends, and is already
in motion, it receiveth a new impression
from the same cause, which is the Air,
whereof as part mounteth, part also must
descend, supposing as we have done the
plenitude of the world. For, as you may
observe by the Figure, the motion
of the Earth, according to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the uttermost Circle, is progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive;
and so the whole motion is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of two motions, one circular, and the
other progressive; and consequently the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45571:9"/>
Air ascends and circulates at once. And
because the stone descending receiveth a
new pressure in every point of its way, the
motion thereof must needs be accelerated.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true; For it will be accelerated
equally in equal times; and the way it
makes will encrease in a double proportion to
the times, as hath heretofore been demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Galileo.</hi> I see the solution now of an
Experiment, which before did not a little
puzzle me. You know that if two plummets
hang by two strings of equal length, and you
remove them from the perpendicular equally,
I mean in equal angles, and then let them go,
they will make their turns and returns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in equal times; And though the
arches they describe grow continually less and
less, yet the times they spend in the greater
arches, will still be equal to the time they
spend in the lesser.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true. Do you find any Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the contrary?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; For if you remove one of the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
from the perpendicular, so as (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
to make an angle with the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of 80 degrees, and the other so as to
make an angle of 60 degrees, they will not
make their turns and returns in equal
times.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>And what say you is the cause of

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Because the arches are the spaces which
these two motions describe, they must be in
double proportion to their own times; which
cannot be, unless they be let go from equal
altitudes, that is, from equal angles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis right; and the Experiment does
not cross, but confirm the equality of the
times in all the arches they describe, even
from 90 degrees to the least part of one
degree.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But is it not too bold, if not extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
an assertion, to say the Earth is moved
as a man shakes a Basen or a Seive? Does
not the Earth move from West to East every
day once, upon his own Center, and in the
Ecliptick Circle once a year? And now you
give it another odd motion; How can all
these consist in one and the same body?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Well enough. If you be a Shipboard
under sail, do not you go with the Ship?
Cannot you also walk upon the Deck?
Cannot every drop of bloud move at the
same time in your veins? How many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
now do you assign to one and the
same drop of bloud? Nor is it so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
a thing to attribute to the Earth this
kind of motion; but that I believe if we
certainly knew what motion it is that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the descent of bodies, we should find
it either the same, or more extravagant.
But seeing it can be nothing above that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45571:10"/>
worketh this effect, it must be the Earth it
self that does it; and if the Earth, then
you can imagine no other motion to do it
withal, but this; And you will wonder
more, when by the same motion I shall
give you a probable account of the
causes of very many other works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But what part of the Heaven do you
suppose the Poles of your pricked Circle
point to?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I suppose them to be the same with
the Poles of the Ecliptick. For, seeing the
Axis of the Earth in this Nation, and in
the annual motion keeps parallel to it self,
the Axis must in both motions be parallel
as to sense. For, the Circle which the
Earth describes, is not of visible magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
at the distance it is from the Sun.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Though I understand well enough how
the Earth may make a stone descend very
swiftly under the Ecliptick, or not far from
it, where it throws off the Air perpendicularly;
yet about the Poles of the Circle methinks it
should cast off the Air very weakly. I hope
you will not say that bodies descend faster in
places remote from the Poles, than nearer
to them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No; but I ascribe it to the like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Sun and Moon. For such moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
meeting, must needs cast the stream
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45571:10"/>
of the Air towards the Poles; And then
there will be the same necessity for the
descent there, that there is in other places,
though perhaps a little more slowly. For
you may have observed that when it snows
in the South Parts, the flakes of Snow are
not so great as in the North; which is a
probable sign they fall in the South from a
greater height, and consequently disperse
themselves more, as water does that falls
down from a high and steep Rock.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In natural causes all you are to expect
is but probability; which is better yet
then making Gravity the cause, when the
cause of Gravity is that you desire to
know; and better then saying the Earth
draws it, when the Question is, how it
draws?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why does the Earth cast off Air more
easily than it does Water, or any other heavy
bodies?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is indeed the Earth that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
off that Air which is next unto
it. But it is that Air which casteth off
the next Air; and so continually Air
moveth Air; which it can more easily
do then any other thing, because like bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are more susceptible of one anothers
motions; as you may see in two Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings
equally strained, what motion one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45571:11"/>
string being stricken communicates to the
Air, the same will the other receive from
the Air; but strained to a differing note,
will be less, or not at all moved. For there
is no body but Air that hath not some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
though invisible motion of its parts.
And it is that internal motion which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth
all natural bodies one from
another.</p>

               <p>What is the cause why certain Squibs,
though their substance be either Wood or

with Gunpowder, which is also heavy, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
when the Gunpowder is kindled, fly
upwards?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The same that keeps a man that
swims from sinking, though he be heavier
then so much water; He keeps himself up,
and goes forward by beating back the
water with his Feet; and so does a Squib,
by beating down the Air with the stream
of the fired Gunpowder, that proceeding
from its Tail makes it recoil.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why does any Brass or Iron Vessel, if it

heavy?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Because the Vessel and the Air in it,
taken as one body, is more easily cast off
than a body of water equal to it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>How comes it to pass, that a Fish
(especially such a broad Fish as a Turbut or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45571:11"/>
a Plaice, which are broad and thin) in the
bottom of the Sea, perhaps a mile deep, is not
press'd to death with the weight of water that
lies upon the back of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Because all heavy bodies descend
towards one point, which is the Center of
the Earth, and consequently the whole
Sea descending at once does arch it self so,
as that the upper parts cannot press the
parts next below them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It is evident; Nor can there be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
any weight, as some suppose there is, of a
Cylinder of Air, or Water, or of any other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid

or is sustained and inclosed in a

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The motion I have hitherto supposed
but in the Earth, I suppose also in the
Moon, and in all those great Bodies that
hang in the Air constantly, I mean the Stars,
both fixed and errant. And for the Sun
and Moon, I suppose the Poles of their
motion to be the Poles of the <hi>Aequinoctial;</hi>
which supposed, it will follow, (because
the Sun, the Earth and the Moon at every
Full and Change are almost in one streight
line) that this motion of the Earth will be
made swifter than in the Quarters. For
this motion of the Sun and Moon being
communicated to the Earth, that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
the like motion, maketh the same
greater; and much greater when they are
all three in one streight line, which is only
at the Full and Change, whose Tides are
therefore called Spring Tides.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But what then is the cause that the
Spring-Tides themselves are twice a year,
namely when the Sun is in the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi>
greater than at any other times?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>At other times of the year, the
Earth being out of the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> the
motion thereof, by which the Tides are
made, will be less augmented, by so much
as a motion in the obliquity of 23 degrees
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45571:13"/>
or thereabout (which is the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> and Ecliptick Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles)
is weaker then the motion which is
without obliquity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>All this is reasonable enough, if it be
possible that such motions as you suppose in
these bodies, be really there. But that is a
thing I have some reason to doubt of; For,
the throwing off of Air, consequent to these
motions, is the cause, you say, that other
things come to the Earth; And therefore the
like motions in the Sun, and Moon, and
Stars, casting off the Air, should also cause
all other things to come to every one of them.
From whence it will follow, that the Sun,
Moon, and Earth, and all other bodies but
Air, should presently come together into one
heap.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That does not follow: For if two
bodies cast off the Air, the motion of that
Air will be repress'd both ways, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into a course towards the Poles on
both sides; and then the two bodies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly come together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true. And besides, this driving
off the Air on both sides, North and South,
makes the like motion of Air there also. And
this may answer to the Question, How a
stone could fall to the Earth under the Poles
of the Ecliptick, by the only casting off of
Air?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:45571:14"/>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It follows from hence, that there is
a certain and determinate distance of one
of these bodies (the Stars) from another,
without any very sensible variation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>All this is probable enough, if it be true
that there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> no place empty in
all the World. And supposing this motion of
the Sun and Moon to be in the plain of the
<hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> methinks that this should be
the cause of the Diurnal motion of the Earth;
And because this motion of the Earth is
(you say) in the plain of the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi>
the same should cause also a motion in the
Moon on her own Center, answerable to the
Diurnal motion of the Earth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Why not? what else can you think
makes the Diurnal motion of the Earth,
but the Sun? And for the Moon, if it did
not turn upon its own Center, we should
see sometimes one, sometimes another face
of the Moon, which we do not.</p>

               <p>Many; but I will name but one;

I say, the difficulty, not the impossibility.
It is possible, without introducing <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
to pull assunder any two bodies, how
hard and flat soever they be, if the force
used be greater than the resistance of the
hardness. And in case there be any greater
difficulty to part them, (besides what
proceeds from their hardness) then there
is to pull them further assunder when they
are parted, that difficulty is Argument
enough to prove there is no <hi>Vacuum.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>These Assertions need demonstration.

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If two flat polish'd Marbles lie one

in all points at one and the same
instant; and yet the weight of either of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45571:15"/>
them it is enough to make them slide off
one from the other. Is not the cause of
this, that the Air succeeds the Marble
that so slides, and fills up the place it
leaves.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But when you pull the whole
Superficies assunder, not without great
difficulty, what is the cause of that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think as most men do, that the
Air cannot fill up the space between in an
instant; For the parting is in an instant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose there be <hi>Vacuum</hi> in that Air
into which the Marble you pull off is to
succeed, shall there be no <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the
Air that was round about the two Marbles
when they touched? Why cannot that
<hi>Vacuum</hi> come into the place between?
Air cannot succeed in an instant, because
a body; and consequently cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
through the least space in an instant.
But emptiness is not a body, nor is moved,
but made by the act it self of separation.
There is therefore (if you admit <hi>Vacuum</hi>)
no necessity at all for the Air to fill the
space left, in an instant. And therefore,
with what ease the Marble coming off
presseth out the <hi>Vacuum</hi> of the Air behind
it, with the same ease will the Marbles be
pulled assunder. Seeing then, if there were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45571:15"/>
                  <hi>Vacuum,</hi> there would be no difficulty of
Separation; it follows, because there is
difficulty of separation, that there is no
<hi>Vacuum.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Well now, supposing the world full, how
do you prove it possible to pull those Marbles
assunder?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Take a piece of soft wax; Do not
you think the one half touches the other
half as close as the smoothest Marbles?
yet you can pull them assunder. But how?
still as you pull, the wax grows continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
more and more slender; there being a
perpetual parting or discession of the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
part of the wax one from another;
which the Air presently fills, and so there
is a continual lessening of the wax, till it
be no bigger than a hair, and at last sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
If you can do the same to a Pillar
of Marble, till the outside give way, the
effect will be the same, but much quicker,
after it once begins to break in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies;
because the force that can master
the first resistance of the hardness, will
quickly dispatch the rest.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It seems so by the brittleness of some
hard bodies. But I shall afterward put some
Questions to you, touching the nature of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But now to return to our subject,</p>
            </sp>
            <p>What reason can you render (without sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<hi>Vacuum</hi>) of the effects produced in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45571:16"/>
the Engine they use at <hi>Gresham Colledge?</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That Engine produceth the same
effects, that a strong wind would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in a narrow room.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>How comes the wind in? You know
the Engine is a hollow round pipe of brass;
into which is thrust a Cylinder of wood co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Leather, and fitted to the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
so exactly as no Air can possibly
pass between the leather and the brass?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I know it; and that they may
thrust it up, there is a hole left in the
Cylinder to let the Air out before it;
which they can stop when they please.
There is also in the bottom of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
a passage into a hollow Globe of
Glass; which passage they can also open
and shut at pleasure. And at the top of
that Globe there is a wide mouth to put
in what they please to try conclusions on;
and that also to be opened and shut as
shall be needful. 'Tis of the nature of a
Pop-gun which Children use, but great,
costly, and more ingenious. They thrust
forward, and pull back the wooden Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
(because it requires much strength)
with an Iron screw. What is there in all
this to prove the possibility of <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Whan this wooden Cylinder covered
with leather, fit and close is thrust home to
the bottom, and the holes in the hollow Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45571:16"/>
of Brass close stopped, how can it
be drawn back, as with the screw they draw
it, but that the space it leaves must needs
be empty. For it is impossible that any Air
can pass into the place to fill it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I think it close enough to
keep out Straw and Feathers, but not
to keep out Air, nor yet matter. For
suppose they were not so exactly close
but that there were round about a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for a small hair to lye between,
Then will the pulling back of the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of wood force so much Air in, as in
retiring it forces back, and that without
any sensible difficulty. And the Air will
so much more swiftly enter as the passage
is left more narrow. Or if they touch,
and the contract be in some points, and
not in all, the Air will enter as before in
case the force be augmented accordingly.
Lastly, though they touch exactly, if
either the Leather yield, or the Brass
(which it may do to the force of a strong
screw) the Air will again enter. Do you
think it possible to make two superficies
so exquisitly touch in all points as you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
or Leather so hard as not to yield
to the force of a screw? The Body of
Leather will give passage both to Air and
Water, as you will confess when you
ride in Rainy and Windy weather. You
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45571:17"/>
may therefore be assured that in drawing
out their wooden-leather Cylinder they
force in as much Air as will fill the place
it leaves, and that with as much swiftness
as is answerable to the strength that drives
it in. The effect therefore of their pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is nothing else but a vehement Wind,
a very vehement Wind coming in on all
sides of the Cylinder at once into the
hollow of the Brass Pipe, and into the
hollow of the Glass Globe joyned to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I see the reason already of one of
their wonders, which is, that the Cylinder
they pump with, if it be left to it self, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is pulled back will swiftly go up again.
You will say the Air comes out again with
the same violence by reflection; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This is argument enough that the
place was not empty. For what can fetch
or drive up the Sucker, as they call it,
if the place within were empty; for that
there is any weight in the Air to do it, I
have already demonstrated to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
               <p>Besides, you know, when they have
sucked out (as they think) all the Air
from the Glass Globe, they can neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
both see through it what is done, and
hear a sound from within when there is
any made. Which (if there were no
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45571:17"/>
other, but there are many other,) is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
enough that the place is still full
of Air.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What say you to the swelling of a
Bladder even to bursting, if it be a little
blown when it is put into the Receiver, (for
so they call the Globe of Glass?)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The stream of Air that from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
side meeting together, and turning in
an infinite number of small points, do
pierce the Bladder in innumerable places
with great violence at once, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
invisible small wimbles; especially if
the Bladder be a little blown before it be
put in, that it may make a little resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
And when the Air has once pierced
it, it is easie to conceive, that it must af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
by the same violent motion be
extended till it break. If before it break
you let in fresh Air upon it, the violence
of the motion will thereby be tempered,
and the Bladder be less extended. For
that also they have observed. Can you
imagine how a Bladder should be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and broken, by being too full of
Emptiness.</p>

               <p>How come living creatures to be killed

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If they suck into their lungs so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
a wind thus made, you must needs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45571:18"/>
think it will presently stop the passage of
their bloud; and that is death; though
they may recover if taken out before
they be too cold. And so likewise will it
put out fire; but the Coals taken out
whilst they are hot, will revive again.
'Tis an ordinary thing in many Coal-pits,
(whereof I have seen the experience,)
that a wind proceeding from the sides of
the Pit every way, will extinguish any
fire let down into it, and kill the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
unless they be quickly taken out.</p>

dance. I hope you are by this time satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that no experiment made with the

prove that there is, or that there may be

               <p>What say you to <hi>Torricellioes</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
in Quick-silver, which is this.
There is a Bason at <hi>A</hi> filled with Quick-sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
suppose to <hi>B,</hi> And <hi>CD</hi> a hollow glass
pipe filled with the same. Which if you stop
with your finger at <hi>B,</hi> and so set it upright,
and then if you take away your finger, the
Quick-silver will fall from <hi>C</hi> downwards,
but not to the bottom. For it will stop by the
way, suppose at <hi>D.</hi> Is it not therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that that space between <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> be
left empty? Or will you say the Quick sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
does not exactly touch the sides of the
glass pipe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I'le say neither. If a man thrust
down into a vessel of Quick-silver a
blown Bladder, will not that Bladder
come up to the top?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes certanly, or a Bladder of Iron,
or of any thing else but Gold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You see then that Air can pierce
Quick-silver.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, with so much force as the
weight of Quick-silver comes to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When the Quick-silver is fallen to
D, there is so much the more in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And that takes up the place which
so much Air took up before. Whither
can this Air go if all the World without
that glass pipe B C were full? There must
needs be the same or as much Air come
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45571:19"/>
to that space (which only is empty) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
C and D. By what force? By the
weight of the Quick-silver between D
and B. Which Quick-silver weigheth
now upward; or else it could never
have raised that part higher, which was
at first in the Bason. So you see the weight
of Quick-silver can press the Air through
Quick-silver up into the pipe, till it come
to an equality of force as in D. Where
the weight of the Quick-silver is equal to
the force which is required in Air to go
through it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If a man suck a Vial that has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it but Air, and presently dip the
mouth of it into water, the water will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
into the Vial. Is not that an argument
that part of the Air had been sucked out,
and part of the room within the Vial left
empty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No. If there were empty space in
the World, why should not there be also
some empty space in the Vial before it
was sucked? And then why does not the
water rise to fill that, when a man sucks
the Vial he draws nothing out neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Belly not into his Lungs, nor into
his Mouth; only he sets the Air within
the glass into a circular motion, giving it
at once an endeavour to go forth by the
sucking, and an endeavour to go back
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45571:19"/>
by not receiving it into his mouth. And
so with a great deal of labour glues his
lips to the neck of the Vial. Then taking
it off, and dipping the neck of the Vial
into the water before the circulation
cease, the Air with the endeavour it hath
now gotten, pierces the water and goes
out. And so much Air as goes out, so
much matter comes up into the room
of it.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I find my skin more extended in

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Then that is it you would know
the cause of. I have told you before that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45571:20"/>
by the motion I suppose both in the Sun,
and in the Earth, the Air is dissipated,
and consequently that there would be an
infinite number of small empty places but
that the World being full, there comes
from the next parts other Air into the
spaces, they would else make empty.
When therefore this motion of the Sun
is excercised upon the Superficies of the
Earth, if there do not come out of the
Earth it self some corporal substance to
supply that tearing of the Air, we must
return again to the admission of <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
If there do, then you see how by this
motion fluid bodies are made to exhale
out of the Earth. The like happens to a
mans body or hand, which when he
perceives, he says he is Hot. And so of
the Earth when it sendeth forth Water
and Earth together in Plants, we say it
does it by Heat from the Sun.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very probable, and no less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the same action of the Sun, is
that which from the Sea and moist places
of the Earth, but especially from the Sea
fetcheth up the water into the Clouds. But
there be many ways of Heating besides the
action of the Sun or of Fire. Two pieces of

of the Air by the reciprocal and
contrary motions of the two pieces of

forth of whatsoever is Aereal or

pursued) a dissipation also of the other

               <p>You know the rubbing or heard
pressing of the Eye, or a stroke upon it
makes an apparition of Light without
and before it, which way soever you
look. This can proceed from nothing else
but from the restitution of the Organ
pressed or stricken, unto its former ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
situation of parts. Does not the Sun
by his thrusting back the Air upon you
eyes press them? Or does not those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
whereon the Sun shines (though by
reflection) do the same, though not so
strongly? And do not the Organs of
Sight, the Eye, the Heart, and Brains
resist that pressure by an endeavour of
restitution outwards? Why then should
there not be without and before the Eye,
an apparition of Light in this case as

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45571:21"/>
are of the Regiment of Fancy, without
any body concealed under them, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them, by which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>

               <p>And when you look towards the Sun
or Moon, why is not that also which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
before your Eyes at that time a fancy?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>So it is. Though the Sun it self be
a real Body, yet that bright Circle of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a foot Diameter cannot be the Sun,
unless there be two Suns, a greater and a
lesser. And because you may see that
which you call the Sun, both above you
in the Skie, and before you in the Water,
and two Suns (by distorting your Eye)
in two places of the Skie, one of them
must needs be Fancy. And if one, both.
All sense is Fancy though the cause be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in a real Body.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I see by this that those things which the
Learned call the Accidents of Bodies, are
indeed nothing else but diversity of Fancy;
and are inherent in the Sentient, and not
in the Objects, except Motion and Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.
And I perceive by your Doctrine you
have been tampering with <hi>Leviathan.</hi> But
how comes Wood with a certain degree of
Heat to shine, and Iron also with a greater
degree; but no Heat at all to be able to make
water shine?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That which shineth hath the same
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45571:22"/>
Motion in its parts that I have all this
while supposed in the Sun and Earth. In
which Motion there must needs be a
competent degree of swiftness, to move
the sense, that is, to make it visible. All
Bodies that are not fluid will shine with
Heat, if the Heat be very great. Iron
will shine and Gold will shine; but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will not, because the parts are carried
away before they attain to that degree of
swiftness; which is requisite.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>There are many fluid Bodies, whose
parts evaporate, and yet they make a flame,
as Oyl, and Wine, and other strong drinks:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>As for Oyl I never saw any infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by it self; how much soever Heated,
therefore I do not think they are the parts
of the Oyl, but of the combustible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
oyled that shine, but the parts of
Wine and strong Drinks have partly a
strong Motion of themselves, and may
be made to shine, but not with boiling,
but by adding to them as they rise the
flame of some other body.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>How can it be known that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Wine have such a Motion as you
suppose?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Have you ever been so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered
with drinking Wine, as to
think the Windows and Table move?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I confess (though you be not my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45571:22"/>
I have, but very seldom, and I
remember the window seemed to go and come
in a kind of circling Motion, such as you
have described. But what of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing, but that it was the Wine
that caused it; which having a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of that Motion before, did when it
was Heated in the Veins, give that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion
(which you thought was in the
window,) to the Veins themselves, and
(by the continuation of the parts of mans
Body) to the Brain; and that was it
which made the window seem to move.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What is Flame? For I have often
thought the Flame that comes out of a small
heap of Straw, to be more (before it hath
done Flaming,) then a hundred times the
Straw it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It was but your Fancy. If you
take a stick in your hand by one end, the
other end burning, and move it swiftly,
the burning end, if the Motion be circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
shall seem a circle; if streight, a
streight line of Fire, longer or shorter,
according to the swiftness of the Motion,
or to the space it moves in. You know
the cause of that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think it is, because the impression
of that visible Object, which was made at
the first instant of the Motion did last till
it was ended. For then it will follow that it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45571:23"/>
must be visible all the way, the impressions
in all points of the time being equal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The cause can be no other. The
smallest spark of Fire flying up seems a
line drawn upward; and again by that
swift circular Motion which we have
supposed for the cause of Light, seems
also broader then it is. And consequently
the Flame of every thing must needs
seem much greater then it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What are those sparks that flie out of
the Fire?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>They are small pieces of the wood
or Coals, or other Fuel loosened and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with the Air that cometh up
with them. And being extiguished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their parts be quite dissipated into
others, are so much Soot, and black,
and may be fired again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>A Spark of Fire may be stricken out
of a cold stone. It is not therefore Heat
that makes this shining.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No 'Tis the Motion that makes both
the Heat and shining; and the stroke
makes the Motion. For every of those
Sparks, is a little parcel of the stone,
which swiftly moved, imprinteth the
same Motion into the matter prepared, or

               <p>How comes the Light of the Sun to
burn almost any combustible matter by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refraction
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45571:23"/>
through a convex glass, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
from a concave?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Air moved by the Sun presseth
the convex glass in such manner as the
action continued through it, proceedeth
not in the same streight line by which it
proceeded from the Sun, but tendeth
more toward the center of the body
it enters. Also when the action is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
through the convex body it bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
again the same way. By which means
the whole action of the Sun-beams are
enclosed within a very small compass; in
which place therefore there must be a
very vehement Motion; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
if there be in that place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible
matter, such as is not very hard
kindle, the parts of it will be dissipated,
and receive that Motion which worketh
on the Eye as other Fire does.</p>
               <p>The same reason is to be given for
burning by Reflection. For there also the
Beams are collected into almost a point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why may not the Sun-beams be such
a Body as we call Fire, and pass through
the pores of the glass so disposed as to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them to a point, or very near?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Can there be a glass that is all
pores; If there cannot, then cannot this
effect be produced by the passing of Fire
through the pores. You have seen men
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45571:24"/>
llght their Tobacco at the Sun with a
burning glass, or with a ball of Cristal,
held which way they will indifferently.
Which must be impossible, unless the ball
were all pores. Again, neither you nor
I can conceive any other Fire then we
have seen, nor then such as water will
put out. But not only a solid Globe of
Glass or Cristal will serve for a burning
Glass, but also a hollow one filled with
water. How then does the Fire from the
Sun pass through the glass of water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being put out before it come to the
matter they would have it burn?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I know not. There comes nothing
from the Sun. If there did, there is come
so much from it already, that at this day
we had had no Sun,</p>

               <p>That body whereof no one part
is easily put out of its place, without
removing the whole, is that which I and
all men call Hard; and the contrary Soft.
So that they, are but degrees one of
another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What is the cause that makes one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Harder then another, or (seeing you
say they are but degrees of one another)
what makes one body Softer then another,
and the same body sometimes Harder,
sometimes Softer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The same Motion which we have
supposed from the beginning for the cause
of so many other effects. Which Motion
not being upon the center of the part
moved, but the part it self going in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
circle to and again, it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that the Motion be perfectly circular.
For it is not circulation, but the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
I mean the to and again that does
cast off, and lacerrate the Air, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
produce the fore-mentioned
effects.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:45571:25"/>
For the cause therefore of Hardness,
I suppose the reciprocation of Motion in
those things which are Hard, to be very
swift, and in very small circles.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>This is somewhat hard to believe. I
would you could supply it with some visible

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When you see (for example) a
Cross-bow bent, do you think the parts
of it stir?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How are you sure? You have no
argument for it, but that you do not see
the Motion. When I see you sitting still,
must I believe there is no Motion in your
parts within, when there are so many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to convince me there is.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What argument have you to convince
me that there is Motion in a Cross-bow when
it stands bent?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If you cut the string, or any way
set the Bow at liberty it will have then a
very visible Motion. What can be the

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If the Bow had been crooked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was bent, and a string tied to
both ends, and then cut asunder, the
Bow would not have stir'd. Where lies
the difference?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Bow bent has a Spring; unbent

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you by Spring?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>An endeavour of restitution to it's
former posture.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I understand Spring as well as I do
endeavour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I mean a Prnciple or beginning of
Motion in a contrary way to that of the
force which bent it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But the beginning of Motion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Motion, how insensible soever it be.
And you know that nothing can give a
beginning of Motion to it self. What is it
therefore that gives the Bow (which
you say you are sure was at rest when it
stood bent) its first endeavour to return
to its former posture?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It was he that bent it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That cannot be. For he gave it an
endeavour to come forward, and the
Bow endeavours to go backward.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Well, grant that endeavour be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou,
and Motion in the Bow unbent, how
do you derive from thence, that being
set at liberty it must return to its former
posture?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Thus There being within the Bow
a swift (though invisible) Motion of all
the parts, and consequently of the whole;
the bending causeth that Motion, which
was along the Bow (that was beaten out
when it was hot into that length) to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45571:26"/>
a cross the length in every part of
it, and the more by how much it is more
bent; and consequently endeavours to
unbend it all the while it stands bent. And
therefore when the force which kept it
bent is removed, it must of necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the posture it had before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But has that endeavour no effect at all
before the impediment be removed? For if
endeavour be Motion, and every Motion
have some effect more or less, methinks this
endavour should in time produce some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>So it does. For in time (in a long
time) the course of this internal Motion
will lie along the Bow, not according to
the former, but to the new acquired
posture. And then it will be as uneasie
to return it to its former posture, as it
was before to bend it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That's true. For Bows long bent lose
their appetite to restitution, long custom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
nature. But from this internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocation
of the parts, how do you infer
the Hardness of the whole Body.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If you apply force to any single part
of such a body, you must needs disorder
the Motion of the next parts to it before it
yield, and there disordered, the Motion
of the next again must also be disordered;
and consequently no one part can yield
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45571:26"/>
without force sufficient to disorder all.
But then the whole body must also yield.
Now when a body is of such a nature as
no single part can be removed without
removing the whole, men say that body
is Hard.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why does the Fire melt divers Hard

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The hardest bodies are those
wherein the Motion of the parts are the
most swift, and yet in the least circles.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if the Fire, the Motion of
whose parts are swift, and in greater cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles,
he made so swit, as to be strong
enough to master the Motion of the parts
of the Hard body, it will make those parts
to move in a greater compass, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
weaken their resistance, that is to
say, Soften them, which is a degree of
liquefaction. And when the Moton is so
weakened, as that the parts lose their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
by the force of their own weight,
then we count the body melted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why are the Hardest things the most
brittle, insomuch that what force soever is
enough to bend them, is enough also to break
them?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In bending a Hard body, as (for
example) a Rod of Iron, you do not
inlarge the space of the internal Motion
of the parts of Iron, as the Fire does;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45571:27"/>
but you master and interrupt the Motion,
and that chiefly in one place. In which
place the Motion that makes the Iron
Hard being once overcome, the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that bending must needs suddenly
master the Motions of the parts next unto
it, being almost mastered before.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have seen a small piece of glass,
the figure whereof is this <hi>A A B C.</hi> Which
piece of glass if you bend toward to top, as
in <hi>C,</hi> the whole body will shatter asunder
into a Million of pieces, and be like to so
much dust. I would fain see you give a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
reason of that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I have seen the Experiment. The
making of the glass, is thus, They dip an
Iron Rod into the molten glass that stands
in a Vessel within the Furnace. Upon
which Iron Rod taken out, there will
hang a drop of molten but tough Mettal
of the figure you have described, which
they let fall into the water. So that the
main drop comes first to the water, and
after it the tail, which though streight
whilst it hung on the end of the Rod, yet
by falling into the water becomes croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Now you know the making of it,
you may consider what must be the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of it. Because the main drop A
comes first to the water, it is therefore first
quenched, and consequently that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45571:27"/>
of the parts of that drop, which by
the Fire were made to be moved in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
compass, is by the water made to
shrink into lesser circles towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end B, but with the same or not
much less swiftness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If you take any long piece of Iron,
Glass, or other uniform and continued
body; and having Heated one end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
you hold the other end in your hand,
and so quench it suddenly, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
you held it easily enough, yet now
it will burn your fingers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It will so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You see then how the Motion of
the parts from A toward C is made more
violent and in less compass by quenching
the other parts first. Besides, the whole
Motion that was in all the parts of the main
drop A, is now united in the small end
B C. And this I take to be the cause why
that small part B C is so exceeding stiff.
Seeing also this Motion in every small part
of the glass, is not only circular, but
proceeds also all along the glass from A to
B, the whole Motion compounded will
be such as the Motion of Spinning any
Soft matter unto Thread, and will dispose
the whole body of the glass in Threads,
which in other Hard bodies are called the
grain.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:45571:28"/>
Therefore if you bend this body (for
example) in C (which to do will require
more force then a man would think that
has not tryed) those threads of Glass
must needs be all bent at the same time,
and stand so, till by the breaking of the
Glass at C, they be all at once set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
And then all at once being sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
unbent, like so many brittle, and
over-bent Bows, their Strings breaking,
be shivered in pieces.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis like enough to be so. And if
nature have betrayed her self in any thing,
I think it is in this, and in that other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the Cross-bow; which strongly
and evidently demonstrates the internal
reciprocation of the Motion, which you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to be in the internal parts of every
Hard body. And I have observed somewhat
in Looking-glasses which much confirms that
there is some such Motion in the internal
parts of Glass, as you have supposed for
the cause of Hardness. For let the Glass be
<hi>A B,</hi> and let the Object at <hi>C</hi> be a Candle,
and the Eye at <hi>D.</hi> Now by divers Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Refractions in the two superficies
of the Glass, if the Lines of Vision be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
oblique, you shall see many images of
the Candle, as <hi>E, F, G,</hi> in such order and
position as is here described. But if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
your Eye to <hi>C,</hi> and the Candle to <hi>D,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45571:28"/>
they will appear in a situation manifestly
different from this. Which you will yet
more plainly perceive if the Looking-Glass
be coloured, as I have obseved in Red and
Blew Glasses; and could never conceive
any probable cause of it, till now you tell
me of this secret Motion of the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross
the grain of the Glass, acquired by
cooling it this or that way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>There be very many kinds of Hard
bodies, Metals, Stones, and other kinds
in the bowels of the Earth, that have
been there ever sence the beginning of
the World; and I believe also many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
sorts of Juices that may be made
Hard. But for one general cause of Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it can be no other then such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Motion of parts as I have already
described, whatsoever may be the cause
of the several concomitant qualities of
their Hardness in particular.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>We see water Hardened every Frosty
day. It's likely therefore you may give a
pribable cause of Ice. What is the cause of
Freezing of the Ocean towards the Poles of
the Earth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You know the Sun being always
between the Tropicks, and (as we
have supposed) always casting off the
Air; and the Earth likewise casting it off
from it's self, there must needs on both
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45571:29"/>
sides be a great Stream of Air towards
the Poles, shaving the superficies of the
Earth and Sea, in the Northern and Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Climates. This shaving of the
Earth and Sea by the Stream of Air must
needs contract and make to shrink those
little Circles of the internal parts of Earth
and Water, and consequently Harden
them, first at the superficies, into a thin
skin, which is the first Ice; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the same Motion continuing, and
the first Ice co-operating, the Ice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
thicker. And this I conceive to be
the cause of the Freezing of the Ocean.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If that be the cause, I need not ask
how a Bottle of water is made to Freeze in
warm weather with Snow, or Ice mingled
with Salt. For when the Bottle is in the
midst of it, the Wind that goeth out both
of the Salt and of the Ice as they dissolve,
must needs shave the superficies of the
Bottle, and the Bottle work accordingly on
the water without it, and so give it first a
thin skin, and at last thicken it into a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
piece of Ice. But how comes it to pass
that water does not use to Freeze in a deep
Pit?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>A deep Pit is a very thick Bottle,
and such as the Air cannot come at but
only at the top, or where the Earth is
very loose and spungy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45571:29"/>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why will not Wine Freeze as well as
Water?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>So it will when the Frost is great
enough. But the internal Motion of the
parts of Wine and other Heating Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
is in greater Circles and stronger
then the Motion of the parts of water;
and therefore less easily to be Frozen, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specally
quite through, because those parts
that have the strongest Motion retire to
the center of the Vessel.</p>

               <p>The motion of the Air (such as I
have described to you already) tending
to the dis-union of the parts of the Air,
must needs cause a continual endeavour
(there being no possibility of <hi>Vacuum</hi>)
of whatsoever fluid parts there are upon
the face of the Earth and Sea, to supply
the place which would else be empty.</p>
               <p>This makes the water, and also very
small and loose parts of the Earth and Sea
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45571:30"/>
to rise, and mingle themselves with the
Air, and to become mist and Clouds. Of
which the greatest quantity arise there,
where there is most water, namely, from
the large parts of the Ocean; which are
the South Sea, the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, and the
Sea that divideth <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> from
<hi>America;</hi> over which the Sun, for the
greatest part of the year is perpendicular,
and consequently raiseth a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water. Which afterwards gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into Clouds, falls down in Rain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If the Sun can thus draw up the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is likely it would also hold them

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is not improbable that they are
carried against Hills, and there stopt till
more overtake them. And when they
are carried towards the North or South
where the force of the Sun is more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
and thereby weaker, they descend
gently by their own weight. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they tend all to the center of the

And then it Rains.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Because perhaps when the water
is drawn up higher then the highest
Mountains, where the course of the Air
between the Aequator and the Poles is
free from stopping, the Stream of the Air
Freezeth it into Snow. And 'tis in those
places only where the Hills shelter it
from that Stream, that it falls in Rain.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why is there so little Rain in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and yet so much in other parts nearer the

the Countrey?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The cause of the falling of Rain,
I told you was the the stopping, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the collection of Clouds about
great Mountains, especially when the
Sun is near the Aequinoctial, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
draws up the water more potently,
and from greater Seas. If you consider
therefore that the Mountains in which
are the springs of <hi>Nile,</hi> lye near the
Aequinoctial and are exceeding great,
and near the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, you will not
think it strange there should be great
store of Snow. This as it melts makes
the Rain of <hi>Nile</hi> to rise, which in <hi>April</hi>
and <hi>May</hi> going on toward <hi>Egypt</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there about the time of the Solstice,

               <p>Why should not the <hi>Nile</hi> then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
that Countrey twice a year? For it
comes twice a year to the Aequinoctial.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>From the <hi>Autumnal Aequinox,</hi> the
Sun goeth on toward the Southern Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique.
And therefore cannot dissolve, the
Snow on that side of the Hills that look
towards <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But then there ought to be such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Innundation Southward.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt but there is a greater
descent of water there in their Summer
then at other times; as there must be
wheresoever there is much Snow melted.
But what should that innundate, unless
it should overflow the Sea that comes
close to the foot of those Mountains?
And for the cause why it seldom Rains in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> it may be this, That there are
no very high Hills near it to collect the
Clouds. The Mountains whence <hi>Nile</hi>
riseth being near 2000 Miles off. The
nearest on one side are the Mountains of
<hi>Nubia,</hi> and on the other side <hi>Sina,</hi> and

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>From the Motion (I think) espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the Clouds, partly also from
whatsoever is moved in the Air.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It is manifest, that the Clouds are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45571:31"/>
moved by the Winds; so that there were
Winds before any clouds could be moved.
Therefore I think you make the Effect
before the Cause.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If nothing could move a Cloud
but Wind, your objection were good.
But you allow a Cloud to descend by it's
own weight. But when it so descends, it
must needs move the Air before it, even
to the Earth, and the Earth again repel
it, and so make lateral Winds every way.
Which will carry forwards other Clouds
if there be any in their way, but not the
Cloud that made them The Vapour of
the water rising into Clouds, must needs
also as they rise, raise a Wind?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I grant it. But how can the slow

as it does?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is not one or two little Clouds,
but many and great ones that do it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
when the Air is driven into places
already covered; it cannot but be much
the swifter for the narrowness of the
passage</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why does the South Wind more often

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Where the Sun hath most power,
and where the Seas are greatest, that is
in the South, there is most water in the
Air; which a South wind can only bring
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45571:32"/>
to us. But I have seen great showers of
Rain sometimes also when the wind hath
been North, but it was in Summer, and
came first, I think, from the South or
West, and was but brought back from
the North.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>We had a Storm within a little more

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That Storm was then coming and
had moved the Water before it. But the
Wind you could not perceive, for it
came downwards with the descending
of the Clouds, and pressing the Water
bounded above your Sail till it came
very near. And that was it that made
you think there was no Wind at all.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>How comes it to pass that a Ship
should go against the Wind which moves it,
even almost point blank, as if it were not
driven but drawn?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You are to know first, that what
Body soever is carryed against another
Body, whether perpendicularly, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
it drives it in a perpendicular to
the superficies it lighteth on. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
a Bullet shot against a flat wall,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45571:32"/>
maketh the Stone (or other matter it
hits) to retire in a perpendicular to
that flat; or, if the Wall be round,
towards the center, that is to say, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly.
For if the way of the
motion be oblique to the Wall, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is compounded of two motions,
one parrallel to the Wall, and the other
perpendicular. By the former whereof
the Bullet is carried along the Wall side,
by the other it approacheth to it. Now
the former of these motions can have no
effect upon it; all the battery is from
the motion perpendicular, in which it
approacheth. And therefore the part it
hits must also retire perpendicularly. If
it were not so, a Bullet with the same
swiftness would execute as much oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shot, as perpendicularly; which you
know it does not.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It will so, but when it is very near
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45571:33"/>
to the Wind it will go forward very slowly,
and make more way with her side to the Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It will indeed go slower in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the Line <hi>A. E.</hi> to the Line
<hi>C. E.</hi> But the Ship will not go so fast as
you think sideward: One is the force of
that Wind which lights on the side of the
Ship it self; the other is, the bellying of
the Sail; for the former, it is not much
because the Ship does not easily put from
her the Water with her side; and belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Sail, gives some little hold for
the Wind to drive the Ship a stern.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>For the motion sideward I agree with
you; but I had thought the bellying of the
Sail, had made the Ship go faster.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But it does not; only in a fore-wind
it hinders least.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>By this reason a broad thin Board

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You may easily foresee the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities
of such a Sail. But I have seen
tryed in little what such a Wind can do
in such a case. For I have seen a Board
set upon four truckles, with a staff set up
in the midst of it for a Mast, and another
very thin and broad Board fastned to that
staff in the stead of a Sail; and so set as
to receive the Wind very obliquely, I
mean so as to be within a point of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45571:33"/>
Compass directly opposite to it; and so
placed upon a reasonable smooth pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
where the Wind blew somewhat
strongly. The event was first, that it stood
doubting whether it should stir at all
or no, but that was not long; and then
it ran a head extream swiftly, till it was
overthrown by a Rub.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Before you leave the Ship tell me how
it comes about that so small a thing as a
<hi>Rudder,</hi> can so easily turn the greatest
Ship?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis not the <hi>Rudder</hi> only, there must
also be a stream to do it; you shall never
turn a Ship with a <hi>Rudder</hi> in a standing
pooll, nor in a natural current.</p>
               <p>You must make a stream from head to
stern, either with Oares or with Sails:
when you have made such a stream, the
turning of the <hi>Rudder</hi> obliquely holds
the Water from passing freely; and the
Ship or Boat cannot go on directly, but
as the <hi>Rudder</hi> inclines to the stern, so will
the Ship turn. But this is too well known
to insist upon: you have observed,
that the Rudders of the greatest Ships
are not very broad, but go deep into the
Water, whereas Western Barges, though
but small Vessels, have their Rudders
much broader, which argues that the
holding of Water from passing is the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45571:34"/>
office of a Rudder: and therefore to a
Ship that draws much Water the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is made deep accordingly, and in
Barges that draw little Water, the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
as less deep, must so much the more
be extended in breadth.</p>

               <p>The same cause which (speaking of
Hardness) I supposed for the cause of Ice.
For the Stream of Air proceeding from.
That both the Earth and the Sun cast off
the Air, and consequently maketh a
stream of Air from the Aequinoctial to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Poles, passing amongst the
Clouds, shaving those small drops of
Water whereof the Clouds consist, and
congeals them as they do the Water of
the Sea, or of a River. And these small
frozen drops are that which we call
Snow.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But then how are great drops frozen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is especially in Summer; and hot
weather, that the drops of Water which
make the Clouds, are great enough; but
it is then also that Clouds are sooner and
more plentifully carryed up. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the current of the Air strengthned
between the Earth and the Clouds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more swift; and thereby freezeth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45571:34"/>
the drops of Water, not in the Cloud it
self, but as they are falling. Nor does
it freeze them throughly, the time of
their falling not permitting it, but gives
them only a thin coat of Ice; as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by their suddain dissolving.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>From the manner or kind of noise
they make, namely a crack; which I see
not how it can possibly be made by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or any other soft Bodies whatsoever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, the Powder they call <hi>Aurum

just such another crack as Thunder.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But why may not every small grain
of that <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> by it self be
heard, though a heap of them together
be soft, as is any heap of Sand. Salts
of all sorts are of the nature of Ice. But
Gold is dissolved into <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi>
by Nitre and other Salts. And the least
grain of it gives a little crack in the fire
by it self. And therefore when they are
so warmed by degrees, the crack can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuse but be very great.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But before it be <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi>
they use to wash away the Salt (which they
call dulcifying it,) and then they dry it
gently by degrees.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That is, they exhale the pure Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that is left in the Powder, and leave
the Salt behind to Harden with drying.
Other Powder made of Salts without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gold in them will give a crack as
great as <hi>Aurum Fulminans.</hi> A very great
Chymist of our times hath written, that
<hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tarter, Salt-peter,</hi> and a little
<hi>Brimstone</hi> ground together into a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and dryed, a few grains of that

into a great Gun made strong enough on
purpose, and the Breech of the Gun set in hot

               <p>In very hot weather the Sun raiseth
from the Sea and all moist places abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Water, and to a great height.
And whilst this Water hangs over us in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45571:35"/>
Clouds, or is again descending, it raiseth
other Clouds, and it hapens very often
that they press the Air between them, and
squeeze it through the Clouds themselves
very violently; which as it passes shaves
and hardens them in the manner decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I must here take in one supposition
more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then your Basen (it seems) holds

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It may for all this, for the suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I add is no more but this; that what
internal motion I ascribe to the Earth, and
other the Concrete parts of the World,
is to be supposed also in every of their
parts how small soever; for what reason
is there to think, in case the whole Earth
have in truth the motion I have ascribed
to it, that one part of it taken away,
the remaining part should love that moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If you break a Load-stone both
parts will retain their vertue, though
weakened according to the diminution of
their quantity; I suppose therefore in
every small part of the Earth, the same
kind of motion, which I have supposed in
the whole: and so I recede not yet from
my Basen.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Let it be supposed, and withall,
that abundance of Earth (which I see you

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Then if many pregnant Clouds,
some ascending and some descending
meet together, and make concavities
between, and by the pressing out of the
Air, as I have said before, become Ice;
those Atomes (as I may call them) of
Earth will be by the straining of the Air
through the water of the Clouds, be left
behind, and remain in the Cavities of the
Clouds, and be more in number then for
the proportion of the Air therein. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for want of liberty they must needs
justle one another, and become (as they
are more and more streightened of room)
more and more swift, and consequently
at last break the Ice suddenly and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
now in one place, and by and by in
another; and make thereby so many
claps of Thunder, and so many Flashes
of Lightning. For the Air Recoiling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Eyes, is that which maketh those
Flashes to our Fancy.</p>

               <p>But I have seen Lightning in a very

Thunder nor Clouds.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes in a clear evening; because
the Clouds and the Rain were below the

Horison, perhaps 40 or 50 Miles off; so
that you could not see the Clouds nor
hear the Thunder.</p>

               <p>If the Clouds be indeed Frozen into
Ice, I shall not wonder if they be sometimes
also so scituated, as (like Looking-Glasses)
to make us see sometimes three or more Suns
by Refraction and Reflection.</p>

               <p>The force of the stroke Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

               <p>No we will suppose it loseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of its swiftness. But the cause is,
That their swiftness being equal, the
one is longer in coming to the wall then
the other, in Proportion of Time, as
E G to E F. For though their swiftness
be the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> considered in themselves,
yet the swiftness of their approach to the

               <p>When a Bullet enters not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
from the wall, does it make the

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If you measure the Angles close
by the wall there difference will not be
ensible; otherwise it will be great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
For the Motion of the Bullet
grows continually weaker. But it is not
so with the Sun-beams which press con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
and equally.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What is the cause of Reflection?
When a body can go no further on, it has
lost its Motion. Whence then comes the
Motion by which it reboundeth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:45571:37"/>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This Motion of rebounding or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
proceedeth from the resistance.
There is a difference to be considered
between the Reflection of Light, and
of a Bullet, answerable to their different
Motions, pressing and striking. For the
action which makes Reflection of Light,
is the Pressure of the Air upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
Body, caused by the Sun, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shining body, and is but a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
endeavour; as if two men should
press with their breasts upon the two ends
of a Staff, though they did not remove
one another, yet they would find in
themselves a great disposition to press
backward upon whatsoever is behind
them, though not a total going out of
their places. Such is the way of Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Light. Now, when the falling on of
the Sun-beams is Oblique, the action of
them is nevertheless Perpendicular to the
Superficies it falls on. And therefore the
Reflecting Body, by resisting, turneth
back that Motion Perpendicularly, as
from F to E, but taketh nothing from
the force that goes on parallel in the line
of E H; because the Motion never
presses. And thus of the two Motions
from F to E, and from E to H is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
Motion in the line F H, which
maketh an Angle in B G, equal to the
Angle F G E.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:45571:38"/>
But in Percussion (which is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bullet against a wall,) the
Bullet no sooner goeth off then it loseth
of its swiftness, and inclineth to the Earth
by its weight. So that the Angles made
in falling on and going off, cannot be
equal, unless they be measured close to
the point where the stroke is made.</p>

               <p>If a man set a Board upright upon
its edge, though it may very easily be cast
down with a little Pressure of ones finger,
yet a Bullet from a Musquet shall not throw
it down but go through it. What is the
cause of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In pressing with your finger you
spend time to throw it down. For the
Motion you give to the part you touch is
communicated to every other part before
it fall. For the whole cannot fall till
every part be moved. But the stroke of
a Bullet is so swift, as it breaks through
before the Motion of the part it hits can
be communicated to all the other parts
that must fall with it.</p>

               <p>The stroke of a Hammer will drive a

of a Nail, and in how much time will do
the same? It is a question I have heard

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45571:38"/>
of weight from the operation of
a stroke, makes it uncalculable. The
suddenness of the stroke upon one point
of the wood takes away the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
from the rest. Therefore the Nail
enters so far as it does. But the weight
not only gives them time, but also aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Reflection is always made by the Re-acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Body prest or stricken; but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiling
not always. The Recoiling of a
Gun is not caused by its own pressing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Gun-powder, but by the force of
the Powder it self, inflamed and moved
every way alike:</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I had thought it had been by the
sudden re-entring of the Air after the flame
and Bullet were gone out. For it is impossible
that so much room as is left empty by the
discharging of the Gun, should be so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
filled with the Air that entereth at
the Touch-hole.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The flame is nothing but the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it self, which scattered into its smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45571:39"/>
parts seems, of greater bulk by much,
then in truth it is, because they shine.
And as the parts scatter more and more,
so still more Air gets between them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
not only at the Touch-hole, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
at the mouh of the Gun. which two
ways being opposite, it will be much too
weak to make the Gun Recoil.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard that a great Gun char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
too much or too little, will Shoot (not
above, nor below but) besides the mark;
and charged with one certain charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both will hit it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How that should be I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
For when all things in the cause are
equal, the effects cannot be unnequal. As
soon as Fire is given, and before the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
be out, the Gun begins to Recoil. If
then there be any unevenness or rub in
the ground more on one side then on the
other, it shall shoot besides the mark,
whether too much, or too little, or justly
charged; because if the line wherein the
Gun Recoileth decline, the way of the
Bullet will also decline to the contrary
side of the mark. Therefore I can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
no cause of this event, but either in
the ground it Recoils on, or in the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
weight of the parts of the Breech.</p>

               <p>If is pass through a Body of

and to the Point of the Superficies it
falleth on, you draw a Line Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I told you before, that the falling on
worketh only in the Perpendicular;
But as soon as the Action proceedeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inward then a meer touch, it worketh
partly in the Perpendicular, and partly
forward, and would proceed in the
same line in which it fell on, but for
for the greater resistance which now
weakneth the Motion forward, and
makes it to incline towards the Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular.</p>

               <p>In transparent Bodies it may be so;
but there be Bodies through which the

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But the Action by which Light is
made, passeth through all Bodies. For
this Action is Pression; and whatsoever
is prest, presseth that which is next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and so continually. But the cause
why there is no Light seen through it, is
the uneveness of the parts within, whereby
the Action is by an infinite number of
Reflections so diverted and weakned,
that before it hath proceeded through,
it hath not strength left towork upon
the Eye strongly enough to produce
sight.</p>

               <p>When a Bullet is shot very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
though the Motion be never
so swift, yet approach downwards to
the Water is very slow, and when it
cometh to it, it casteth up much Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before it, which with its weight
presseth downwards again, and maketh
the Water to rise under the Bullet with
force enough to master the weak Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Bullet downwards, and to make
it rise in such manner as Bodies use to
rise by Reflection.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>By what Motion (seeing you ascribe
all Effects to Motion) can a <hi>Load-stone</hi>
draw <hi>Iron</hi> to it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>By the same Motion hitherto sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
But though all the smallest parts
of the Earth have this Motion, yet it
is not supposed that their Motions are
in equal Circles; nor that they keep
just time with one another; nor that
they have all the same Poles. If they
had, all Bodies would draw one another
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45571:41"/>
alike. For such an agreement of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of Way, of Swiftness, of Poles,
cannot be maintained without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the Bodies themselves in the
Center of their common Motion, but
by violence.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>If therefore the <hi>Iron</hi> have but so much
of the Nature of the <hi>Load-stone</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to receive from it the like Motion,
as one String of a <hi>Lute</hi> doth from another
String strained to the same Note (as
it is like enough it hath, the <hi>Load-stone</hi>
being but one kind of <hi>Iron</hi> Ore) it
must needs after that Motion received
from it, (unless the greatness of the
weight hinder) come nearer to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
at distance their Motions will differ
in time, and oppose each other where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they will be forced to a common Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
If the <hi>Iron</hi> be lifted up from the
Earth, the Motion of the <hi>Load-stone</hi>
must be stronger, or the Body of it near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to overcome the Weight; and then
the <hi>Iron</hi> will leap up to the <hi>Load-stone</hi> as
as Swiftly as from the same distance,
it would fall down to the Earth; but if
both the <hi>Stone</hi> and the <hi>Iron</hi> be set float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Water, the attraction will
begin to be manifest at a greater distance,
because the hindrance of the weight is
in part removed.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But why does the <hi>Load-stone</hi> if it
float on a Calm Water, never fail to place it
self at last in the Meridian just <hi>North</hi>
and <hi>South.</hi>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Not so, just in the Meridian, but
almost in all places with some variations.
But the cause I think is, that the Axis of
this Magnetical Motion is parallel to the
Axis of the Ecliptique, which is the Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
of the like Motion in the Earth,
and consequently that it cannot freely
exercise its Natural Motion in any other
Scituation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Whence may this consent of Motion
in the <hi>Load-stone</hi> and the Earth proceed?
Do you think (as some have written) that
the Earth is a great <hi>Load-stone?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Gilbert</hi> that was the first that
wrote any thing of this Subject ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
inclines to that opinion. <hi>Decartes</hi>
thought the Earth (excepting this upper
crust of a few Miles depth) to be of the
same Nature with all other Stars, and
bright. For my part I am content to be
ignorant; but I believe the <hi>Load stone</hi>
hath given its virtue by a long habitude
in the Mine, the Vein of it lying in the
plain of some of the Meridians, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of some of the great Circles that pass
through the Poles of the Ecliptique,
which are the same with the Poles of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45571:42"/>
the like Motion supposed in the Earth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If that be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I need not ask why
the filings of <hi>Iron</hi> laid on a <hi>Load-stone</hi>
equally distant from its Poles will lie paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to the Axis, but one each side incline
to the Pole that is next it. Nor why by
drawing a <hi>Load-ston</hi> all a long a Needle
of <hi>Iron,</hi> the Needle will receive the same
Poles Nor why when the <hi>Load-stone</hi> and
<hi>Iron</hi> (or two <hi>Load-stones</hi>) are put together
floating upon Water, will fall one of them a
Stern of the other, that their like parts may
look the same way, and their unlike touch,
in which Action they are commonly said to
Repel one another. For all this may be
deriv'd from the union of their Motions.

               <p>That which in all Ages, and all places

V X Y till it cut the line R S drawn

be equal to D X. And drawing X Z it
will pass through T. And the four lines
T V, T X, T Y and T Z will be equal.

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Because T V and T Y are equal;
and T D, T Sequal; S V will also be
equal to D V. And because D P and
R S are equal and parallel, R Y will be
equal and parallel to P V. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
V R and P Y that joyn them will
be equal and parallel. And the Angles
P <hi>u</hi> V, R V <hi>u</hi> will be alternate, and
consequently equal. But P <hi>u</hi> V is a
right Angle; therefore also R V <hi>u</hi> will
be a right Angle.</p>

cutting V R wheresoever in

are parallel) the Angle Y <hi>t</hi> V will be
a right Angle. And the figure <hi>u</hi> Y <hi>t</hi> V
a Rectangle, and <hi>u t</hi> equal to Y V. But
Y V is equal to Z X; and therefore Z
X is equal to <hi>u t.</hi> And <hi>u t</hi> must pass
through the point T (For the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of any Rectangle, divide each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>u</hi> are the same point, and X and <hi>t</hi> the

falls upon P. and D X is the lesser of
the two means between A D and D V.
And the Cube of D X double to the

               <p>I cannot imagine what fault there
can be in this Demonstration, and yet
there is one thing which seems a little strange
to me. And 'tis this. You take <hi>B R,</hi> which
is half the Diagonal, and which is the sine
of 45 degrees, and which is also the mean
proportional between the two Extreams.
And yet you bring none of these proprieties
into your Demonstration. So that though
you argue from the Construction, yet you do
not argue from the Cause. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
your adversaries will object (at least)
against the Art of you Demonstratieon, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45571:45"/>
enqure by what luck you pitched upon half
the Diagonal for your Foundation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I see you let nothing pass. But for
answer you must know, That if a man
argue from the negative of the truth,
though he know not that it is the truth
which is denyed, yet he will fall at last,
after many consequences, into one absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
or another. For though false do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
produce Truth, yet it produces also
absurdity, as it hath done here. But
Truth produceth nothing but Truth.
Therefore in Demonstrations that tend to
absurdity, it is no good Logick to require
all along the operation of the cause.</p>

               <p>Out upon it it, it's absurd. Why do

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In <hi>Arithmetick</hi> the numbers consist
of so many Units; and are never consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
there as nothings. And therefore
every one Line has some Latitude, and
if you allow to BI. the Semi-diagonal
the same Latitude you do to AB. or to
BR. you will quickly see the Square of
half the Diagonal to be equal to twice
the Square of half AB.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but then your Demonstration is
not confuted; for the Point <hi>Y,</hi> will have
Latitude enough to take in that little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
which is between the Root of 1681
and the Root of 1682. This putting off an

for one Square, must needs marr the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Again he says the Cube of <hi>AB.</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to 8. but seeing <hi>AB.</hi> is 2, the Cube
of <hi>AB.</hi> must be just equal to four of its

sometimes a Line, sometimes a Square,
is now a Cube.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It can be no otherwise when you

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In the next place, I find that the

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then if you add to 45 Cubes of <hi>DV.</hi>
the Square Root of 1682, the sum will be
45 Cubes of <hi>DV.</hi> And if you add to the
Cube of <hi>DY.</hi> the same Root of 1682, the
sum will be the Cube of <hi>DY.</hi> plus the
Square Root of 1682. And these two sums
must be equal.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But the Square Root of 1682, being
a Line, adds nothing to a Cube; therefore
the Cube alone of <hi>DY.</hi> which he says is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I see the Calculation in numbers
is right, though false in lines. The reason
whereof can be no other then some difference
between multiplying numbers into lines or
plains, and multiplying lines into the same
lines or plains.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The difference is manifest. For when
you multiply a number into lines, the
product is lines; as the number 2 mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
into 3 lines is no more then 3 lines
2 times told. But if you multiply lines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
lines you make plains, and if you multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
lines into plains you make solid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
In Geometry there are but three
dimensions, Length, Superficies, and Body.
In Arithmetick there is but one, and that
is Number or Length which you will.
And though there be some Numbers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Plain, others Solid, others <hi>Plano-solid,</hi>
others Square, others Cubique, others
Square-square, others <hi>Quadrato-cubique,</hi>
others Cubi-cubique <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet are all
these but one dimension, namely Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45571:48"/>
or a file of things Numbered.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It is because in <hi>Arithmetick</hi> Units
are not Nothings, and therefore have
breadth. And therefore many Lines set
together make a superficies though their
breadth be insensible. And the greater
the number is into which you divide

               <p>As for <hi>Archimedes,</hi> there is no
man that does more admire him then I
do. But there is no man that cannot
Err. His reasoning is good. But he ads
all other Geometricans before and after
him, have had two Principles that cross
one another when they are applyed to
one and the same Science. One is, that
a Point is no part of a Line which is true
in Geometry, where a part of a Line
when it is called a Point, is not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
another is, that a Unit is part of a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45571:49"/>
Number which is also true; but when
they reckon by <hi>Arethmetick</hi> in <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
there a Unit is somtimes part of a
Line, sometimes a part of a Square, and
sometimes part of a Cube.</p>
               <p>As for the Table of <hi>Sines, Secants</hi> and
<hi>Tangents,</hi> I am not the first that find fault
with them. Yet I deny not but they are
true enough for the reckoning of Acres
in a Map of Land.</p>

               <p>What a deal of Labour has been lost
by them that being Professors of <hi>Geometry</hi>
have read nothing else to their Auditors but
such stuff as this you have here seen. And
some of them have written great Books of it
in strange characters, such as in troublesome
times, a man would suspect to be a Cypher.</p>

               <p>I think you have seen enough to
satisfie you, that what I have written
heretofore concerning the Quadrature
of the Circle, and of other Figures made
in imitation of the Parabola, has not
been yet confuted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I see you have wrested out of the hands of
our Antagonists this weapon of Algebra, so as
they can never make use of it again. Which I
consider as a thing of much more consequence
to the science of <hi>Geometry,</hi> then either of the
Duplication of the Cube, or the finding of two
mean Proportionals, or the Quadrature of a
Circle, or all these Problems put together.</p>
