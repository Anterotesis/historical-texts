         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>en the Lord of the whole Earth, look down from his holy Habitation, on our unjuſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; the Lord open your underſtandings, by which you may ſee how we are made to ſuffer without a cauſe, by being unjuſtly <hi>numbred with tranſgreſſors,</hi> and <hi>ranked with murderers,</hi> as if we had a hand in <hi>plotting againſt the King;</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> knows we are clear and innocent in all theſe things; Our <hi>juſt Principle,</hi> the <hi>Light in our Conſciences,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Spirit of the Lord,</hi> which is our <hi>Guide,</hi> leadeth to no ſuch thing as a <hi>carnal Sword,</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi> that is of this World, after ſuch a manner to be obtained; the <hi>Light</hi> in your <hi>Conſciences</hi> will clear us, and condemn you for ranking us with <hi>Fift-Monarchy-men</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> whoſe <hi>weapons indeed are carnal</hi> we know, and cannot deny but <hi>weapons of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi> have been found in their habitations; but as for us, the God whom we ſerve, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us no ſuch thing, and he will plead our righteous cauſe, which is no other, but that his <hi>Truth</hi> may proſper and fill the Earth, and that the knowledge thereof <hi>may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the world, as the waters cover the Sea.</hi> This is our deſire, the Lord knows, and our work in this world, which he himſelf hath decreed and cannot be diſannulled, he hath purpoſed it, and will moſt certainly bring it to paſs; though unjuſtly in your late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, we are proclaimed againſt as <hi>Plotters,</hi> and thereby preſented as <hi>Malefactors</hi> to the Nations; and inſtead of being ſaved from perſecution for our pure Conſcience, (as the Word of King <hi>Charles</hi> was, we ſhould be, ſo long as we lived peaceably) we are now made liable to be a prey and a ſpoil to the wicked, though we are altogether innocent and clear of any ſuch thing that is unjuſtly charged againſt us, who live and meet peaceably in his Dominions; no other thing can be juſtly proved againſt us: And further, we are by a late Decree bound to a falſe Church and Worſhip, contrary to all good Conſcience; and if you do not what is in your power to deliver us, the Lord whom we ſerve, moſt certainly will; and though he ſuffer you to heat the Fornace ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times hotter then it is, yet to the falſe Worſhip of the Nation we cannot bow, for Conſcience-ſake, knowing it is better to obey God then man.</p>
            <p>This I write by the Commandment of the Lord to you, that you may not provoke the Lord to your own deſtruction, by deſtroying a people whom he hath bleſſed, and choſen for his peculiar Treaſure: Suffer not an innocent people to be made a prey of by the wicked; for all men we honour in the Lord, and eſteem them highly that are a terror to evil-doers, which is your work, if you leave it not undone; And be it known unto you, we cannot obſerve days which the Lord did never command as his Worſhip; neither can we forbear meeting together in his Fear and Spirit, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, though men command us to the contrary; for by the Lord are we called and gathered to meet in one Spirit; and let the Light of Chriſt in you all be Judge, whether to obey God or Man is better.</p>
