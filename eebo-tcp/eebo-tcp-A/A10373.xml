            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Most gracious Soueraigne:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hose that are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest and helpelesse are commonly silent, wishing that the common ill in al sort might be with their particular misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: which dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, as it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable in all men, so would it be in me more dogge-like then man-like, to bite the stone that strooke me: (to wit) the borrowed autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of my Soueragne misinformed, seeing their armes and hands that flang it, are most of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rotten. For I must confesse it euer, that they are debts, and not discontentments, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty hath laid vpon me; the debts and obligation of a friendlesse aduersity, farre more payable in all Kinds, then those of the prosperous: All which, nor
<pb facs="tcp:23938:3"/>
the least of them, though I cannot discharge, I may yet endeauour it.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding my restraint hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched all wayes, as well the wayes of labour and will, as of all other imployments, yet hath is left with me my cogitations, then which I haue nothing else to offer on the Altar of my Loue.</p>
            <p>Of those (most gracious Soueraigne) I haue vsed some part in the following dispute, betweene a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour of Estate, and a Iustice of Peace, the one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading, the other perswading the calling of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. In all which, since the Norman Conquest (at the least so many as Histories haue gathered) I haue in some things in the following Dialogue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented your Maiestie with the contentions and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.</p>
            <p>Some things there are, and those of the greatest, which because they ought first to be resolued on, I thought fit to range them in the front of the rest, to the end your Maiestie may be pleased to examine your owne great and Princely heart of their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or refusall.</p>
            <p>The first is, that supposition, that your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Subiects giue nothing but with adiunction of their own interests, interlacing in one and the same act your Maiesties reliefe, and their owne liberties; not that your Maiesties pietie was euer suspected, but because the best Princes are euer the least iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, your Maiestie iudging others by your selfe, who haue abused your Maiesties trust. The fear'd continuance of the like abuse may perswade the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision.
<pb facs="tcp:23938:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But this caution, how euer it seemeth at first sight, your Maiesty shall perceiue by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples following but friuolous. The bonds of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to their Kings should alwayes be wrought out of Iron, the bonds of Kings vnto Subiects but with Cobwebs.</p>
            <p>This it is (most renowned Soueraigne) that this trafficke of assurances hath beene often vrged, of which, if the Conditions had beene easie, our Kings haue as easily kept them; if hard and preiudiciall, either to their honours or estates, the Creditours haue beene paid their debts with their owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
            <p>For all binding of a King by Law vpon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of his necessitie, makes the breach it selfe lawfull in a King. His Charters and all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments being no other then the suruiuing witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of vnconstrained will: <hi>Princeps non subijcitur nisi sua voluntate libera, mero moto &amp; certa Scientia:</hi> Necessary words in all the grants of a King witnessing that the same grants were giuen freely and knowingly.</p>
            <p>The second resolution will rest in your Maiesty leauing the new impositions, all Monopolies, and other grieuances of the people to the consideration of the House; Prouided, that your Maiesties reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue be not abated, which if your Maiesty shall refuse, it is thought that the disputes will last long, and the issues will be doubtfull: And on the contrary, if your Maiesty vouchsafe it, it may perchance be stiled a yeelding, which seemeth by the sound to braue the Regalty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23938:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>But (most excellent Prince) what other is it to th'eares of the wise, but as the sound of a trumpet, hauing blasted forth a false Alarme, becomes but common ayre? Shall the head yeeld to the feet? certainly it ought, when they are grieued; for wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome will rather regard the commodity, then obiect the disgrace, seeing if the <hi>feet</hi> lye in fetters, the <hi>head</hi> cannot be freed, and where the feet feele but their owne paines, the head doth not onely suffer by participation, but withall by consideration of the euill.</p>
            <p>Certainly, the point of honour well weighed hath nothing in it to euen the ballance, for by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties fauour, your Maiesty doth not yeeld either to any person, or to any power, but to a dispute onely, in which the Proposition and Minor proue nothing without a conclusion, which no other person or power can make, but a Maiesty: yea, this in <hi>Henry</hi> the third his time was called a wisedome incomparable. For, the King raised againe, recouers his authority: For, being in that extremity as hee was driuen with the Queene and his Children, <hi>Cum Abbatibus &amp; Prioribus saris homilibus hospitia quaerere &amp; prandia</hi>: For the rest, may it please your Maiesty to consider that there can nothing befall your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty in matters of affaires more vnfortunately then the summons of a Parliament, with ill successe: A dishonour so perswasiue and aduenturous as it will not onely finde arguments; but it will take the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all enemies that shall offer themselues against your Maiesties estate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23938:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Le labourin de la paurete ne saict poinct de breuct:</hi> of which dangerous disease in Princes, the remedy doth chiefly consist in the loue of the people, which how it may be had and held, no man knowes better then your Maiesty; how to loose it, all men know, and know that it is lost by nothing more then by the defence of others in wrong doing. The onely motiues of mischances that euer came to Kings of this Land since the Conquest.</p>
            <p>It is onely <hi>loue</hi> (most renowned Soueraigne) must prepare the way for your Maiesties following desires. It is <hi>loue</hi> which obeyes, which suffers, which giues, which stickes at nothing: which Loue, as well of your Maiesties people, as the loue of God to your Maiesty, that it may alwayes hold shall be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayers of your Maiesties most humble vassall,</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>IVSTICE.</speaker>
               <p>Surely Sir it was made manifest at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that M.S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was rather in loue with his owne letter; he confessed hee had seene your Lordships letter before hee wrote his to the Maior of Marleborough, and in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships letter there was not a word whereto the Statutes by M<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> alleadged, had reference; for those Statutes did condemne the gathering of money from the Subject, vnder title of a free gift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas a fift, a sixt, a tenth, &amp;c. was set downe and required. But my good Lord, though diuers Shires haue giuen to his Maiestie, some more, some lesse, what is this to the Kings debt?</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly subiect) he then made his advantage by remembring his countrey councell: But my good Lord, these reserued Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians are not the best seruants, for hee that is bound to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture his life for his Master, is also bound to adventure his advice, <hi>Keep not backe councell</hi> (saith <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi>) <hi>when it may doe good.</hi>

               <p>You say well, but it was after the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parliament, &amp; by colour of it, that they had so great daring, for before that time they could not endure to heare of S <hi>Edwards</hi> lawes, but resisted the confirmation in all they could, although by those lawes the Subjects of this Iland were no lesse free then any of all <hi>Europe.</hi>

refused to follow him into France, as they ought to haue done, and to say true, this <hi>great Charter</hi> vpon which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist so much, was not originally granted Regally and freely: for <hi>Henry</hi> the first did vsurpe the kingdome, and therefore the better to assure himselfe against <hi>Robert</hi> his eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee flattered his Nobility and people with those Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

               <p>Certainely no, for it was determined the case of King <hi>Francis</hi> the first of France, that all promises by him made, whilst he was in the hands of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, were voide, by reason the Iudge of honour, which tells vs he durst doe no other.</p>

               <p>Yet for all that, restraint is imprisonment, yea, feare it selfe is imprisonment, and the King was subject to both: I know there is nothing more kingly in a King than the performance of his word; but yet of a word freely and voluntarily giuen. Neither was the Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the first so published, that all men might plead it for their advantage: but a Charter was left (<hi>in deposito</hi>) in the hands of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterbury for the time, and so to his successours. <hi>Stephen Langthon,</hi> who was euer a Traytor to the King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this Charter, and shewed it to the Barons, thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them to make warre against the King. Neither was it the old Charter simplie the Barons sought to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, but they presented vnto the King other articles and orders, tending to the alteration of the whole common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which when the King refused to signe, the Barons presently put themselues into the field, and in rebellious and outragious fashion sent the King word except he confirmed them, they would not desist from making warre against him till he had satisfied them therein. And in conclusion, the king being betrayed of all his Nobility, in effect was forced to graunt the Charter of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta de Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis,</hi> at such time as he was invironed with an Army in the meadowes of <hi>Staynes,</hi> which Charters being procured by force, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> afterward disavowed, &amp; threatned to curse the Barons if they submitted not themselues as they ought to their Soueraigne Lord, which when the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to obey, the King entertained an army of strangers for his own defence, wherewith hauing mastered &amp; beaten the Barons, they called in <hi>Lewes</hi> of France (a most vnnaturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution) to be their King. Neither was <hi>Magna charta</hi> a law in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

confirmed in the 21<hi rend="sup">•</hi> of his reigne, &amp; made it a law in the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, according to <hi>Littletons</hi> opinion.

For as the King can neuer loose a farthing by it, as I shall proue anon: So except <hi>England</hi> were as <hi>Naples</hi> is, and kept by Garrisons of another Nation, it is impossible for a King of <hi>England</hi> to greaten and inrich himselfe by any way so assuredly, as by the loue of his people: For by one rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King hath more losse then by a hundred yeares obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> For therein haue our Kings beene forced to compound with Roagues and Rebels, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, yea the state of the King, the Monarchie, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility haue beene endangered by them.</p>

               <p>My good Lord, to avoide confusion, I will make a short repetition of them all, and then your Lordship may obiect where you see cause; And I doubt not but to giue your Lordship satisfaction. In the sixt yeare of <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> there was no dispute, the house gaue the King two shillings of euery plough land within <hi>England,</hi> and in the end of the same yeare he had <hi>escuage</hi> paid him (to wit) for euery knights fee two markes in siluer. In the fifth yeare of that King, the Lords demaunded the confirmation of the Great Charter which the kings Councell for that time present ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, alleadging that those priviledges, were extorted by force during the Kings Minoritie, and yet the King was pleased to send forth his writ to the Sheriffes of euery coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, requiring them to certifie what those liberties vvere, and hovv vsed, &amp; in exchange of the Lords demaund, because they pressed him so violently, the king required all the castles &amp; places which the Lords held of his, &amp; had held in the time of his Father, vvith those Manors &amp; Lordships vvhich they had heeretofore vvrested from the Crovvne, vvhich at that time (the King being provided of forces) they durst not deny.

the Duke of Britaine to no purpose, for hee drew ouer the King but to drawe on good conditions for himselfe, as the Earle of <hi>March</hi> his father in law now did: As the English Barons did invite <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> not long before, as in el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der times all the kings and states had done, and in late yeares the Leaguers of <hi>France</hi> entertayned the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Protestants and Netherlands, Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> not with any purpose to greaten those that ayde them, but to purchase to themselues an advantageous peace. But what say the histories to this deniall? they say with a world of payments there mentioned, that the King had drawne the Nobility drie. And besides, that whereas not long before great summes of mony were giuen, and the same appointed to be kept in foure castles, and not to be expended but by the aduice of the Peeres; it was beleeved that the same treasure was yet vnspent.</p>

               <p>I say that the commons being vnable to pay, the king relieues himselfe vpon the richer sort, and soe it likewise happened in the 33 of that king, in which hee was relieued chiefely by the Citty of London.

What is this to

the danger of a Parliament? especially at this time they had reason to refuse, they had giuen so great a some in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the same yeare. And again because it was known that the King had but pretended warre with the king of Castile with whome he had secretly contracted an alliance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a marriage betwixt his sonne <hi>Edward</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elenor.</hi> These false fires doe but freight Children and it commonly falles out that when the cause giuen is knowne to be false, the necessity pretended is thought to be fained, Royall dealing hath euermore Royall successe: and as the King was denied in the eight &amp; thirtyeth yeare, so was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed in the nine &amp; thirtieth yeare, because the Nobility and the people saw, that the King was abused by the Pope it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who aswell in despite to <hi>Manfred</hi> bastard son to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the second, as to cozen the King and to wast him, would needes bestowe on the King the kingdome of Sicilie, to recouer which, the King sent all the treasure he could borrow or scrape to the Pope, and withall gaue him letters of credence, for to take vp what he could in Italy, the King binding himselfe for the payment. Now my good Lord the wisdome of Princes is seen in nothing more then in their enterprises. So how vnpleasing it was to the State of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to consume the treasure of the land, &amp; in the conquest of Sicily so farre of, and otherwise for that the English had lost Normandy vnder their noses and so many goodly parts of France of their owne proper inheritances: the reason of the deniall is as well to be considered as the denyall.</p>

               <p>That's true, but why was that? because the king, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all that was giuen him by Parliament, did lay the greatest taxes that ever king did without their consent.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23938:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for corrupting the Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> now raigning. And the whole kingdome fearing and detesting his venemous dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, they besought his Maiesty to cast him off, which the king performed by an act of his owne, and not by act of Parliament, yea <hi>Gauestons</hi> owne fatherinlawe, the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi>w, as one of the Chiefest of the Lords that procured it. And yet finding the kings affection to follow him so strongly, they all consented to haue him recalled. After which when his credit so increased, that hee despised and set at naught all the auncient Nobility, and not onely perswaded the king to all manner of outrages and riots, but withall transported what he listed of the kings treasure, and jewels, the Lords vrged his banishment the second time, but neither was the first nor second banishment forced by acte of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by the forceable Lords his enemies. Lastly hee being recalled by the king, the Earle of <hi>Lancaster</hi> caused his head to bee stricken off, when those of his party had taken him prisoner. By which presumptuous acts, the Earle and the rest of his company committed treason and murder, treason by raysing an army without warrant, murder by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the life of the kings subiect. After which <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veston</hi> being dead, the <hi>Spencers</hi> got possession of the kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, though the younger of them was placed about the K. by the Lords themselues.</p>

               <p>To answere your Lordship in order, may it please you first to call minde, what was giuen this great king by his Subjects before the dispute betwixt him and the house happened, which was in his latter dayes, from his first yeare to his fift yeare there was nothing giuen the king by his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: In his eight yeare at the Parliament at <hi>London</hi> a tenth and a fifteenth was graunted: in his tenth yeare hee ceased vpon the <hi>Italians</hi> goods heere in <hi>England</hi> to his owne vse, with all the goods of the <hi>Monkes Cluniacqs</hi> and others, of the order of the <hi>Cistertians.</hi> In the eleuenth yeare, hee had given him by parliament a notable relief, the one halfe of the woolls throughout <hi>England,</hi> and of the Cleargy all their wools, after which, in the end of the yeare hee had granted in his parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> forty shillings vpon every sacke of wool, and for every thirty wool fels forty shillings, for every last of leatherne, as much, and for all other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes after the same rate. The king promising that this yeares gathering ended, he would thenceforth content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the old custome, he had ouer and aboue this great ayde the eight part of all goods of all citizens and Burgesses, and of others as of forreigne Marchants, &amp; such as liued not of the gaine of breeding of sheepe and cattell the fifteenth of their goods: Nay my Lord: this was not all: though more then euer was granted to any king, for the same parliament bestowed on the king the ninth sheafe of all the corne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the lande, the ninth fleece, and the ninth lambe for two

               <p>Even, my good Lord, to ruine the kings estate so farre as the state of so great a king may be ruin'd by men am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and greedy without proportion. It had beene a braue increase of revenue, my Lord, to haue raysed 50000′ land of the kings to 20000′ revenue, and to raise the revenue of wards to 20000′ more, 40000′ added to the rest of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties estate, had so enabled his Majestie, as hee could never haue wanted. And my good Lord, it had beene an honest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the king, to haue added 7000′ lands of the Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams,</hi> woods and goods being worth 30000′ more.</p>

               <speaker>IVST.</speaker>
               <p>Neither doth your Lordship, perchance knowe the reason why the 10000′ offer'd by <hi>Swinnerton</hi> for a fine of the <hi>French</hi> wines, was by the then Lord Treasurer conferr'd on <hi>Devonshire</hi> and his <hi>Mistris.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>IVST.</speaker>
               <p>The reason, my good Lord, is manifest, for had the land beene raised, then had the king knowne when hee had given or exchanged land, what hee had giuen or exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>IVST.</speaker>
               <p>So hee did when it did not concerne himselfe nor his particular, for hee could neuer admit any one peece of a good Manour to passe in my Lord <hi>Aubignes</hi> booke of 1000′ land, till hee himselfe had bought, &amp; then all the remaining flowers of the Crowne were culled out. Now had the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer suffer'd the Kings lands to haue been raised, how could his Lordshippe haue made choice of the old rents, as well in that book of my Lord <hi>Aubigne,</hi> as in exchange of <hi>Theobalds,</hi> for which hee tooke <hi>Hatfield</hi> in it, which the greatest sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or favorite Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had never durst haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto her by way of gift or exchange.

               <p>I say there was nothing concluded therein to the prejudice of the King. It is true, that a litle before the sitting of the house, the King displaced his Chancellour and his Treasurer, and most of all his judges and officers of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and committed many of them to prison, because they did not supplie him with mony being beyond the seas, for the rest, the states assembled, besought the King that the lawes of the two Charters might bee obserued, and that the great officers of the Crowne might bee chosen by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

wilbe euer, &amp; the other petition was reiected, the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleas'd notwithstanding, that the great Officers should take an oath in Parliament to doe Iustice. Now for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeare of the King, the King had three markes and a halfe for euery sacke of wooll transported; and in his 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> he had a 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the Clergy, and a 15<hi rend="sup">•</hi> of the Laity for one yeare. His Maiesty forbare after this to charge his subiects with any more payments, vntill the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of his reigne, when there was giuen the King by Parliament 50 for euery sacke of wooll transported for sixe yeares, by which grant, the King receiued a thousand marks a day, a greater matter then a thousand pounds in these dayes, &amp; a 1000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> a day amounts to 365000 a yeare, which was one of the greatest presents that euer was giuen to a King of this land. For besides the cheapnes of all things in that age, the Kings souldiers had but 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> a day wages, a man at armes 6<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, a Knight but 2<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. In the Parliament at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> in the 33<hi rend="sup">•</hi> yeare he had 26<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">d</hi> for euery sacke of wooll transported, &amp; in the 42<hi rend="sup">t•</hi> yeare 3 dismes &amp; 3 fifteens. In his 45<hi rend="sup">l</hi> yeare he had 50000 of the Layty, &amp; because the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualty disputed it, &amp; did not pay so much, the King chang'd his Chancellour, Treasurer, and Privy Seale, being Bishops, and placed Lay men in their roome.</p>

               <p>I will with patience answere your Lordship to the full, and first your Lordship may remember by that which I euen now said, that neuer King had so many gifts as this King had from his subiects, and it hath neuer grieued the subiects of <hi>England</hi> to giue to their King, but when they knew there was a devouring Lady, that had her share in all things that passed, and the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was as scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as shee, that the Chancellour did eat vp the people as fast as either of them both. It grieued the subjects to feede these Cormorants. But my Lord there are two things by which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> haue beene prest, (to wit) by their subiects, and by their owne necessities. The Lords in former times were farre stronger, more warlike, better fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, liuing in their countries, then now they are. Your Lordship may remember in your reading, that there were many Earles could bring into the field a thousand Barbed horses, many a Baron 5 or 600 Barbed horses, whereas now very few of them can furnish twenty fit to serue the King. But to say the truth my Lord, the Iustices of Peace in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> haue oppos'd the iniusticers of warre in <hi>England,</hi> the kings writ runs ouer all, &amp; the great Scale of <hi>England,</hi> with that of the next Constables will serue the turne to affront the greatest Lords in <hi>England</hi> that shall moue against the King. The force therefore by which our Kings in former times were troubled, is vanisht away. But the necessities remaine. The people therefore in these later ages, are no lesse to bee pleased then the Peeres; for as the later are become lesse, so by reason of the trayning through <hi>England,</hi> the Commons

So that the power of the Nobility being now withered, and the power of the people in the flowre, the care to content them would not be neglected, the way to win them often practized, or at least to defend them from oppression.

And yet without dishonour shall it be called dishonour for the King to yeeld to honest desires of his subjects. No my Lord, those that tell the King those tales, feare their own dishonour, and not the Kings, for the honour of the King is supreame, and being guarded by Iustice and piety, it cannot receiue neither wound nor stayne.</p>

               <p>That by your fauour, was the Kings sanity: for great armies do rather devour themselues then destroy enimies.

               <p>It is true my Lord in some particulars, as euen at this time the Duke of Glocester was made away at Callice by strong hand, without any lawfull triall: for hee was a man so beloued of the people and so allied, hauing the Dukes of Lancaster, and Yorke his brethren, the Duke of Aumarle, and the Duke of Hereford his Nephewes, the great Earles of Arundell and VVarwicke, with diuerse other of his part in the conspiracy, as the King durst not trie him according to the law: for at the tryall of Arundell and VVarwicke, the king was forced to entertaine a petty army about him. And though the Duke was greatly lamented, yet it cannot be denyed but that he was then a traytor to the King. And was it not so my Lord with the Duke of Guise: your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship doth remember the spurgald proverbe, that <hi>necessitie hath no law:</hi> and my good Lord, it is the practice of doing wrong, and of generall wrongs done, that brings danger, and not where kings are prest in this or that particular, for there is great difference betweene naturall cruelty and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall. And therefore it was <hi>Machiauels</hi> advice, that <hi>all that a king did in that kind, he shall do at once, and by his mercies afterwards make the world know that his cruelty was not affected.</hi> And my Lord take this for a generall rule, that the immortall policy of a state cannot admit any law or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge whatsoeuer, but in some particular or other, the same is necessarily broken, yea in an <hi>Aristocratia</hi> or popular estate, which vaunts so much of equality and common right, more outrage hath beene committed then in any Christian Monarchy.</p>

               <p>Yes my Lord, &amp; in after times also; for this was not the last, nor shall be the last, I hope. And judge you my Lord, whether the Parliaments doe not only serue the King, whatsoeuer is said to the contrary; for as all King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6, gifts &amp; graunts were made voide by the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> when he was in possession of the kingdome by Parliament. So in the time of <hi>K. H.</hi> when <hi>K. Edw:</hi> was beaten out again, the Parliament of <hi>Westminster</hi> made all his acts voyde, made him &amp; all his followers traytors, &amp; gaue the King many of their heads &amp; lands. The Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> do alwaies serue the King in possession. It seru'd <hi>Rich.</hi> the second to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the popular Lords. It seru'd <hi>Bollingbrooke</hi> to depose <hi>Rich.</hi> When <hi>Edw.</hi> the 4. had the Scepter, it made them all beggars that had followed <hi>H.</hi> the 6. And it did the like for <hi>H.</hi> when <hi>Edw.</hi> was driuen out. The Parliaments are as the friendship of this world is, which alwayes followeth pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. For <hi>K.

               <p>I finde but one, and therein he made diuerse good Lawes. For K. <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth in the beginning of his third yeare hee had by Parliament an ayde granted vnto him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reliefe of the Duke of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> then assailed by the <hi>French</hi> King. And although the King did not enter into the warre, but by the advice of the three estates, who did willingly contribute: Yet those Northerne men which loued <hi>Richard</hi> the third, raised rebellion vnder colour of the mony impos'd, &amp; murthered the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> whom the King employed in that Collection. By which your Lordship sees, that it hath not beene for taxes and impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alone, that the ill disposed haue taken Armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but euen for those payments which haue beene appoynted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>They were fairely hang'd, and the mony levied notwithstanding, in the Kings first yeare he gathered a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous great masse of mony, by a benevolence, taking pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne by this kind of levie from <hi>Edw.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. But the King cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it first to be moued in Parliament where it was allowed, because the poorer sort were therein spared. Yet it is true that the king vsed some arte, for in his Letters hee declared that hee would measure euery mans affections by his gifts. In the thirteenth yeare hee had also a subsedy, whereupon the Cornish men tooke Armes, as the Northerne men of the Bishoppricke had done in the third yeare of the King.</p>

               <p>To impose vpon all things brought into the Kingdome is very auncient: which imposing when it hath beene continued a certaine time, is then called Customes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the subjects are accustomed to pay it, &amp; yet the great taxe vpon wine is still called Impost, because it was imposed after the ordinary rate of payment, had lasted many yeares. But we doe now a dayes vnderstand those things to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, which are raised by the commaund of Princes, without the aduice of the common-wealth, though (as I take it) much of that which is now called custome, was at the first imposed by Prerogatiue royall: Now whether it be time or consent that makes them just, I cannot define, were they just because new, and not justified yet by time, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just because they want a generall consent: yet is this rule of <hi>Aristotle</hi> verified in respect of his Majestie: <hi>Minus timent homines iniustum pati à principe quem cultorem dei putant.</hi> Yea my Lord, they are also the more willingly borne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all the world knowes they are no new Invention of the Kings. And if those that advised his Maiestie to impose them, had raised his lands (as it was offered them) to 20000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> more then it was, and his wards to asmuch as aforesaid, they had done him farre more acceptable seruice. But they had their own ends in refusing the one, and accepting the other. If the land had beene raised, they could not haue selected the best of it for themselues: If the impositions had not been laide, some of them could not haue their silkes, others pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in farme, which indeed grieued the subiect tenne times more then that which his Maiestie enjoyeth. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they made a great advantage that were the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, for if any tumult had followed his Maiesty, ready way had beene to haue deliuered them ouer to the people.</p>

               <p>My good Lord, the people haue not stayde for the kings deliuery, neither in <hi>England,</hi> nor in <hi>France</hi>: Your Lordship knowes how the Chauncellour, Treasurer, and Chiefe Iustice, with many others at seuerall times haue bin vsed by the Rebels: And the Marshals, Constables, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers in <hi>France,</hi> haue beene cut in pieces in <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt his time. Now to your Lordships question, I say that where any man shall giue a King perilous advice, as may either cause a rebellion, or draw the peoples loue from the King. I say, that a King shalbe advised to banish him: But if the King doe absolutely commaund his seruant to doe any thing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to the Common-wealth, and to his own peril, there is the King bound in honour to defend him. But my good Lord for conclusion, there is no man in <hi>England</hi> that will lay

any invention either grieuous or against law vpon the Kings Maiesty: And therefore your Lordships must share it amongst you.</p>

               <p>Alas my good Lord, euery poore wayter in the Custome-house, or euery promoter might haue done it, there is no invention in these things. To lay impositions, and sell the Kings lands, are poore and common devices. It is true that <hi>Ingram</hi> and his fellowes are odious men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maiestie pleas'd the people greatly to put him from the Coffership. It is better for a Prince to vse such a kinde of men, then to countenance them, hang-men are necessary in a Commonwealth: yet in the Nether-lands, none but a hangmans sonne will marry a hang-mans daughter. Now my Lord, the last gathering which <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth made, was in his twentieth yeare, wherein hee had another bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence both of the Cleargy and Laity, a part of which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the poorer sort, hee ordained by his Testament that it should bee restored. And for King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee was left in a most plentifull estate, yet he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully prest his people with great payments; for in the beginning of his time it was infinite that hee spent in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Tilting, Banquetting, and other vanities, before hee was entered into the most consuming expence of the most fond and fruitlesse warre that euer King vndertooke. In his fourth yeare hee had one of the greatest subsedies that euer was granted; for besides two fifteenes and two dismes, hee vsed <hi>Dauids</hi> Lawe of Capitation or head-money, and had of euery Duke ten markes, of euery Earle fiue pounds, of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lord foure pounds, of euery Knight foure markes, &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man rated at 8<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in goods, 4 markes, and so after the rate: yea euery man that was valued but at 40 paide 12<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man and woman aboue 15 yeares 4<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. Hee had also in his sixt yeare diuers subsedies granted him. In his four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth there was a tenth demaunded of euery mans goods, but it was moderated. In the Parliament following,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23938:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Clergie gaue the King the halfe of their spirituall liuings for one yeare, &amp; of the Laity there was demanded 800000', which could not be levied in England, but it was a marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great gift that the king had giuen him at that time. In the Kings seuenteenth yeare was the Rebellion before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, wherein King disavowed the Cardinall. In his seuenteenth yeare hee had the tenth and fifteenth giuen by Parliament, which were before that time paide to the Pope. And before that also, the monyes that the King bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed in his fifteenth yeare were forgiuen him by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his seuenteenth yeare. In his 35 yeare a subsedy was granted of 4<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the pound of euery man worth in goods from 20<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

In the thirty seuenth yeare, a Benevolence was taken, not voluntary, but rated by Commissioners, which because one of the Aldermen refused to pay, he was sent for a soldier into <hi>Scotland.</hi> He had also another great subsedy of sixe shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the pound of the Clergy, and two shillings eight pence of the goods of the Laity, and foure shillings the pound v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Lands.</p>

               <p>Certainely no, for it hath neuer succeeded well, neither on the kings part, nor on the subiects, as by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament before-remembred your Lordshippe may gather, for from such a composition doe arise all jealousies, and all contentions. It was practized in elder times, to the great trouble of the kingdome, and to the losse and ruine of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It was of latter time vsed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, but euery way to his disadvantage. When the King leaues himselfe to his people, they assure themselues that they are trusted and beloued of their king, and there was neuer any assembly so barbarous, as not to aunswere the loue and trust of their King. <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt when his estate was in effect vtterly ouerthrowne, &amp; vtterly impouerished at

the humble request of his Treasurer made the same knowne to the House, or otherwise, vsing the Treasurers owne words, <hi>Hee humbly desired the King to take his staffe, that hee might saue his wardship.</hi>

               <p>Perchance not my Lord; but rather with those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions that haue beene by some of your Lordships laide vpon the King, which did not some of your Lordships feare more than you doe the impositions laid vpon the Subjects, you would neuer disswade his Majestie from a Parliament: For no man doubted, but that his Majestie was advised to lay those impositions by his Councell; and for particular things on which they were laid, the aduice came from pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fellowes (though now great ones) belonging to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome-house. Now my Lord, what prejudice hath his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie (his revenue beeing kept vp) if the impositions that were laid by the aduice of a few, be in Parliament laid by the generall Councell of the kingdome, which takes off all grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and complaint.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>COVNS.</speaker>
               <p>Yea Sir, but that which is done by the King, with the aduice of his priuate or priuy Councell, is done by the Kings absolute power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>IVS.</speaker>
               <p>And by whose power is it done in Parliament, but by the Kinges absolute power? mistake it not my Lord: The 3 estates doe but advise, as the priuy Councel doth, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice if the king embrace, it becomes the kings own acte in the one, &amp; the kings law in the other, for without the kings acceptation, both the publicke &amp; priuate aduices bee but as empty egge-shels; and what doth his Majestie loose if some of those things, which concerns the poorer sort be made free again, &amp; the reuenue kept vp vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is superfluous? <hi>Is</hi> it a losse to the <hi>K.</hi> to be beloued of the Commons? if it be revenue which the <hi>K.</hi> seekes, is it not better to take it of those that laugh, than of those that crie? Yea if all bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to pay vpon a moderation and chaunge of the Species:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23938:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Is it more honourable and more safe for the King, that the Subject pay by perswasion, then to haue them constrayned? If they be contented to whip themselues for the King, were it not better to giue them their rod into their owne hands, than to commit them to the executioner? Certainly it is farre more happy for a Soveraigne Prince, that a Subject open his purse willingly, than that the same bee opened by violence. Besides that when impositions are laid by Parliament, they are gathered by the authority of the lawe, which (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) rejecteth all complaints, and stoppeth every mutinous mouth: It shall ever be my praier, that the King embrace the Councell of honour and safety, &amp; let other Princes embrace that of force.</p>

               <p>But good Sir, it is his <hi>Prerogatiue</hi> which the K. stands vpon, and it is the <hi>Prerogatiue</hi> of the kings, that the Parliaments doe all diminish.</p>

               <speaker>IVST.</speaker>
               <p>If your Lordship would pardon mee, I would say then, that your Lordships objection against Parliaments is ridiculous. In former Parliaments three thinges haue beene supposed dishonour of the King. The first, that the Subjects haue conditioned with the King, when the King hath needed them, to haue the great Charter confirmed: the second, that the Estates haue made Treasurers for the necessary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable disbursing of those summes by them given, to the end, that the kinges, to whom they were giuen, should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend them for their owne defence, &amp; for the defence of the common-wealth: The third, that these haue prest the King to discharge some great Officers of the Crowne, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect others. As touching the first my Lord, I would faine learne what disadvantage the Kings of this Land haue had by confirming the great Charter, the breach of which haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved onely men of your Lordships ranke, to assist their owne passions, and to punish and imprison at their owne discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kings poore Subjects. Concerning their private ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, with the colour of the Kings service, for the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie takes no mans inheritance (as I haue said before) nor
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23938:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any mans life, but by the Law of the land, according to the Charter. Neither doth his Majestie imprison any man, (mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of practice, which concernes the preservation of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state excepted) but by the law of the land. And yet hee vseth his prerogatiue as all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> haue ever vsed it: for the supreame reason cause to practise many thinges without the aduice of the law. As in insurrections and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, it vseth the marshall, and not the common law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any breach of the Charter, the intent of the Charter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered truely. Neither hath any Subject made complaint, or beene grieued, in that the Kings of this land, for their own safties, and preservation of their estates, haue vsed their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues, the great Ensigne, on which there is written <hi>soli Deo.</hi> And my good Lord, was not <hi>Buckingham</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Byron</hi> in <hi>France</hi> condemned, their Peeres vncall'd? And withall, was not <hi>Byron</hi> vtterly (contrary to the customes &amp; priviledges of the <hi>French</hi>) denyed an advocate to assist his defence? for where lawes forecast cannot prouide remedies for future daungers, Princes are forced to assist themselues by their <hi>prerogatiues.</hi> But that which hath beene ever grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and the cause of many troubles, very dangerous is, that your Lordships abusing the reasons of state, doe punish and imprison the Kings Subiects at your pleasure. It is you my Lords, that when Subjects haue sometimes neede of the Kings prerogatiue, doe then vse the strength of the law, and when they require the lawe, you afflict them with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, and tread the great Charter (which hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by 16. actes of Parliament) vnder your feete, as a torne parchment or wast paper.</p>

               <p>Good Sir, which of vs doe in this sort breake the great Charter? perchance you meane, that we haue adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the King to lay the new impositions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>IVST.</speaker>
               <p>No my Lord: there is nothing in the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against impositions: and besides that, necessity doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them. And if necessity doe in somewhat excuse a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man <hi>a fortiori,</hi> it may then excuse a Prince. Againe, the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23938:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Kinges Majestie hath profit and increase of revenue by the impositions. But there are of your Lordships (contrary to the direct letter of the Charter) that imprison the Kinges Subjects, and deny them the benefit of the law, to the Kings disprofit. And what do you otherwise thereby (if the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions be in any sort grievous) but <hi>Renovare dolores</hi>? and withall digge out of the dust the long-buried memory of the Subjects former intentions with their Kings.</p>

               <p>I will tell your Lordshippe when I dare, in the meane time it is enough for mee, to put your Lordship in minde, that all the estates in the world, in the offence of the people, haue either had profit or necessity to perswade them to adventure it, of which, if neither bee vrgent, and yet the Subject exceedingly grieved, your Lordship may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that the House will bee humble suitors for a redresse. And if it bee a Maxime in policie to please the people in all thinges indifferent, and neuer suffer them to bee beaten, but for the Kinges benefit, (for there are no blowes forgotten with the smart but those) then I say to make them vassals to vassals, is but to batter downe those mastering buildings, erected by King <hi>Henry</hi> the seaventh, and fortified by his Sonne, by which the people and Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> were brought to depend vpon the King alone.

Nay, the not taking knowledge of those of his owne vassals that haue done him wrong, is more to be lamented, than the relinquishing of those that doe him right, is to be suspected. I am therefore, my good Lo: held to my resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by these a, besides the former. The 1, that God would neuer haue blest him with so many yeres, &amp; in so many actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yea in all his actions, had he paid his honest servants with evill for good.
