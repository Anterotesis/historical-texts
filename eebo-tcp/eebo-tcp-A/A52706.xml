            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE News of a Perſecution meerly for a matter of
Religion, at this time a day, when the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appears profeſſedly to diſlike it; and the
giving countenance to Informers (who are the Peſt
of every Nation, and the common Enemies of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty)
to the Prejudice of Peaceable and Trading People,
makes your Friends, who have had notice of your late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
ſuſpect that there is ſomething in your caſe more than
ordinary.</p>
            <p>Had this fallen out in ſome remote Country, where no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former
had ever yet appeared, we might have conceived, that
through Ignorance that ſort of Devil might have been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for an Angel of Light; and that upon his bare Averrment,
ſome well-meaning Perſons, even againſt their own Experience,
might have been induced to miſtake their Peaceable Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for Dangerous Incendiaries, and unworthy to enjoy their
own proper Goods. But to ſee that ſort of Creature concerned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97642:3"/>
a Country ſo near <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as not to be capable
of knowing what Informers are, how deteſtable their Trade,
how inconſiderable their Power, how generally indigent and
diſſolute, how mean their Skill, how little they know more
than to ſubborn Witneſſes to commit Perjuries, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to their Confuſion, is that which raiſed Wonder in
ſome of your Friends, to ſo great an height, that they generally
requeſt from your own hand the true ſtate of your Caſe in all
its Circumſtances, to the end they may know, whether there
be any thing which can differ it from the common Caſes of
Perſecution meerly for Religion; from which the generality of
the Country-Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> (and particularly thoſe of
the Country where you live) do commonly profeſs to have as
great an abhorrency, as they have from Depopulating of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
which is the Effect that ſuch Perſecutions muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
produce. In the mean time, do not I pray take me to
be one, who think it ſtrange to hear of Troubles; what hath
been formerly, may happen again without Aſtoniſhment; and
you are too well known to be thought to be ſurprized or
afraid.</p>
            <p>Well did that Perſon conſider the Creature <hi>Man,</hi> who diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
him into two parts, viz. <hi>the Man,</hi> and <hi>the Beaſt:</hi> But
it were happy for Mankind, if the <hi>Beaſt</hi> were leſs imperious and
cruel: In truth, it is rare to find where <hi>the Man</hi> is allowed to
have any power in Acting; every thing ſeems too much to be
governed by <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and by the Tyranny of its inordinate Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Senſes.</p>
            <p>And yet where ſhall one find a ſingle Perſon in the World,
who calls himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or that Party of Men who deſire
to be eſteemed <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but he and they will readily grant
that Principle, Mat. 7. 12. <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men
ſhould do to you, do even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the
Prophets?</hi> and that other Principle, Rom. 3. 8. <hi>Let us not do
Evil that Good may come,</hi> to be Goſpel-Principles, and obliging
to all Mankind?</p>
            <p>There is not a Politician or States-man, nor a Government any
where, that owns <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to be the true Religion, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97642:3"/>
That in the Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was aſſembled
in order to the Perſecuting of the Apoſtles for matters of meer
Religion, <hi>Gamaliel</hi> adviſed prudently, and according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of true Religion, <hi>Acts 5. Let them alone, for if this Counſel
or this work be of Men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God,
we cannot overthrow it, leaſt happily we be found even to Fight againſt
God.</hi> They will all confeſs readily, when preſſed with theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and peaceable Principles; that the Spirit of Perſecuting
for meer Religion, is a Spirit of Injuſtice, as not doing to others
as our ſelves would be done unto; and a Spirit of Diffidence and
Incredulity, refuſing to truſt God, and his Providence, with the
Defence and Juſtification of what is Profeſſed to be of God: And
yet it is hard to find that ſingle Perſon, and much more to name,
tha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Community or Government amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> now in
being, whoſe practice, when they have opportunity and power,
are not contrary to their Principles. And not only ſo, but they
will take upon them to juſtifie ſuch practices to be conſiſtent with,
nay, even duties, unto which they are obliged by that pure Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which they take upon them to profeſs to the whole World.</p>
            <p>But to the end I may not be eſteemed preſumptuous, or uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
in what I here aſſert, and in regard it is impoſſible to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
evident proofs for what I ſay, as touching ſingle Perſons; let
us a little examine the matter, as to Parties and Governments, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this for granted, that every particular Party calls it ſelf a true
Church, or the true Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If what is here urged of
differing Churches ſhall be proved true, the preſumption will ſtand
very ſtrong as to ſingle Perſons; there being no ſingle Perſon, who
would be eſteemed a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but he is in communion or fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with ſome Church, which he owns to be the true Church of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by whoſe Judgment he is willing to be concluded, as
being a profeſſed Member of it; and as taking it for his Principle,
that every Member of the true Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ought to be of
her Judgment, becauſe the Scripture ſays, <hi>She is the Pillar and
Ground of Truth:</hi> And though ſome boggle at this, yet nothing
is truer than that every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Society daily practiſeth it.</p>
            <p>Now, the better to prepare the way for this intended Tryal, we
will crave the Liberty firſt, to conſider <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the World
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97642:4"/>
in general, in its firſt Ages, when it was under Perſecution for
meer matter of Religion, and before it gained any civil Power
and Dominion; From them we ſhall know what the true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
did teach: We will then conſider <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
when divided only into two diſtinct Parties, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
and the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> And in the laſt place, We will conſider <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> when the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were ſub-divided into ſeveral
Parties, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> or Church of <hi>England Proteſtants,</hi>
the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> the <hi>Independants,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:</hi>
and when the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were become ſo ſmall, that they
were upon the matter inconſiderable; and I ſuppoſe, from theſe
differing times, we may hope for a reaſonable Information.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Suppoſe the queſtion put to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the
firſt and Primitive Times, in thoſe firſt and greateſt Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
under which Chriſtianity then ſuffered. <hi>Is it lawful to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute,
and to make and Execute Laws for the Inflicting of Pains
and Penalties upon quiet and peaceable People, for Matters meerly of
Religion;</hi> and in particular, <hi>For meeting together meerly for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Religion?</hi> Doubtleſs, their Anſwer would have been given
with one general Voice: <hi>That it was not Lawful;</hi> and that it was
againſt the Rule of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Law of Nature, <hi>Quod Tibi
non vis fieri, Alteri non feceris, Do not unto another, what thou wouldſt
not have done unto thy ſelf:</hi> And that true it is, the <hi>Jews,</hi> who
Perſecuted the Lord of Life, and put him to Death for matter
of meer Religion, did alledge for their Juſtification, <hi>That they
had a Law,</hi> and <hi>that by their Law he ought to Dye:</hi> But that
that Law, and all Laws of that Nature, were againſt the Law
of God: And that the <hi>Chriſtians had no ſuch cuſtom, nor the
Churches of Chriſt,</hi> is I think, a moſt undeniable thing.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ages (by the Agreement of all) were eſteemed the
pureſt Ages of Chriſtianity; Religion being then moſt Pure,
when the Profeſſors of it were moſt Poor. And if any one
ſhall conceive, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe Ages would have
given any other Anſwer, contrary to what I have here framed
for them, and ſhall give a convincing Reaſon for ſuch his Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
I ſhall confeſs my miſtake. In the mean time I muſt ſay,
That I cannot ſee what other anſwer they could have given
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97642:4"/>
but what muſt have juſtified the Perſecutions againſt themſelves
to have been innocent, on the part of the Perſecutors, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
thoſe firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to Err in Religion, and to be
Diſturbers of the Peace, and Government of their Countries,
and their Meetings to be unlawful Aſſemblies: And much more
Innocent on the part of the inferiour Magiſtrates, who took
care to put thoſe Laws in Execution; they being as much obliged
in all civil Reſpects, to put in Execution the Laws of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
as our Inferiour Magiſtrates are obliged to the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Laws; and they gave the ſame Reaſons. And the ſame
is to be ſaid in the Caſe of the Perſecution of our Lord Chriſt, as
ſeems very clear from that Prayer, which he offered for his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors:
<hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do;</hi> here
then is a Principle of Chriſtianity undivided.</p>
            <p>In the next place, We are to conſider Chriſtianity in <hi>England,</hi>
when divided only into two diſtinct Parties, <hi>viz. Proteſtants</hi> and
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> and when the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had made a Sub diviſion amongſt
themſelves here. This I take to be in the times of K. <hi>Hen. 8.</hi>
K. <hi>Edw. 6.</hi> Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and part of the Reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi>
for though there were diverſities of Opinions amongſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
as well here as in other Countries, even in the firſt beginnings;
yet they were not divided into Parties, being every-where upon
the Defenſive. In the time of K. <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> which I intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in, both Parties were perſecuted.</p>
            <p>The Caſe ſtands thus: That King at his coming to the Crown,
found the whole Nation in a quiet poſſeſſion of Popery, and holding
it as an Article of their Faith, and the Principle whereon they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Unity of their Faith depended, that, <hi>The Pope was the
Supream Paſtor, and viſible Head of Government next under Chriſt,
of the Catholick Church of Chriſt, of which the then National-Church
of</hi> England <hi>was a Member:</hi> The King had defended
this Article by Writing ſo vigorouſly againſt <hi>M. Luther,</hi> that the
Pope had for that very work conferred upon him the Title of
<hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> to be enjoyed and uſed by him, and his
Succeſſors for ever. After this, by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Paſtor, this Viſible Head was thrown off, and this King
put in his place, ſo far as concerned the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97642:5"/>
the Title of <hi>Supream Head of the Church of England,</hi> annexed
to the Crown; and this by a Law, <hi>26 Hen. 8.</hi> C. 1. And then
by another Law, <hi>26 Hen. 8.</hi> C. 13. it was Enacted, <hi>That if
any by Word or Writing, ſhould attempt to Deprive the King of the
Title of His Royal Eſtate, he ſhould be adjudged a Traytor:</hi> This
change of the Headſhip of the Church, was, and is truly (at
leaſt in <hi>England)</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine; and undoubtedly there
is no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> whatſoever, but approves the caſting off the <hi>Popes</hi>
Headſhip, as conformable with the Doctrine of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
And upon the latter of theſe two Laws, divers ſuffered Death
for their denying the Kings Supremacy. This was the firſt ſtep
made in <hi>England,</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> towards <hi>Proteſtancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Vigorous Execution of this latter Law, encouraged
ſeveral <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from Forreign parts to come into <hi>England,</hi> not
doubting but to have a Liberty to Exerciſe their Religion here;
and it gave confidence to many of the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and to others, to entertain good thoughts of <hi>Proteſtancy;</hi>
being perſwaded, that after the ſhedding of ſo much Blood, as had
been ſhed here upon that Occaſion, <hi>England</hi> would never any
more admit of the Article of the Popes Supremacy; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
would every day make greater ſteps from that Church,
of which the Pope was owned to be the Supream Paſtor.</p>
            <p>And certain it is, that <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> upon this Occaſion alſo made
its entrance into <hi>England,</hi> and gained Ground here, and ſuch (if
not by open application to the King for that purpoſe, yet) at leaſt
in their Hearts deſired a Toleration, and to be admitted to Preach,
and Exerciſe their Religion here, without being Perſecuted for
their ſo doing; ſo that their Principle was at that time (at leaſt)
againſt Perſecution for meer Religion. But <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> being now
taken notice of to grow, another Law was made, <hi>31 Hen. 8.</hi> for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
unity of Opinion in the ſix Articles therein named, by which
the denyal of Tranſubſtantiation, and ſeveral other Doctrines
therein named, are Enacted to be puniſhed with Death.</p>
            <p>And now Perſecution in <hi>England,</hi> for matters of meer Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
grew ſharp and high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that it is obſerved by our Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that upon one and the ſame day, ſome who were Profeſſed
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> were put to Death for denying the Kings Supremacy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97642:5"/>
which was a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Article: And ſome who were profeſſed
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> were put to death for denying Tranſubſtantiation,
which was an Article of the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> So that at this time, the
Government could neither be ſaid to be <hi>Popiſh,</hi> nor <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> but
both Parties were Perſecuted moſt ſeverely for matters of meer
Religion: And he who ſhould then have ſaid to either Party, in
juſtification of the Proceedings of the Magiſtrate in the Execution
of either of thoſe Laws, That that Party did not then ſuffer for
any matter of meer Religion, but for breaking of the Peace, in
breaking of the King's Laws, would certainly have been taken
not to have underſtood thoſe Laws, or the cauſe of their then
Suffering.</p>
            <p>And now, ſuppoſe each of theſe Parties ſeparately interrogated,
when thus under Perſecution (for <hi>Afflictio dat intellectum,)</hi> Is it
lawful to Perſecute, and to make and Execute Laws, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
of Pains and Penalties upon quiet and peaceable People,
for matters of <hi>meer Religion?</hi> (for it ſeemed a time to teach both
Parties an Eternal temperance and moderation) moſt certainly
each Party in their then preſent Circumſtances, would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in the Negative, That it was not lawful: They would not
have fallen into the debate to conſider what Religion their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
were of, whether of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> to the end,
to have fixt the Cruelty and Injuſtice of Perſecuting for a matter
of meer Religion, upon that Party, as a Principle of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which their Fancies ſhould have perſwaded them to have
been the Religion of their Perſecutors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> would not have then ſtood formalizing that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the firſt Perſecution was occaſioned upon the denyal of the
King's Headſhip over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which was a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
Doctrine, in oppoſition to the Pope's Headſhip, which was
the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine; therefore the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were the Aggreſſors
in the Perſecution; and therefore the Principle of Perſecution was
a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principle; and the Perſecution of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
was no other than a juſt Judgment of God drawn upon the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> by themſelves, as a Conſequence of that Principle of
Perſecution, which gave them the firſt occaſion of introducing
their Religion nationally into <hi>England.</hi> Nor would the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97642:6"/>
by way of Recrimination, have charged the <hi>Papiſts</hi> then, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that King and the then Government were of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in every point, ſave only in the Article touching the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
therefore the Principle of Perſecution muſt neceſſarily be a
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Principle: No, they would moſt certainly, each Party, have
diſclaimed the Principle, as unwarranted by the Principles of true
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which each of them claimed to be theirs, and each of
them would have agreed, that it was their common Principle, To
do unto others as they deſired others ſhould do unto them. Here
we ſee the Principle of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> when divided.</p>
            <p>The Perſecutions before mentioned, being quieted by the Death
of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and the Crown deſcending unto K. <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixth, an Infant of ſuch tender Years, as made him uncapable
of Exerciſing the Government in his own Perſon, not being come
to the uſe of right Reaſon; the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> took upon him
the Adminiſtration of all things, under the Title of <hi>Protector,</hi>
and with him the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party had their ſole Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Several Penal Laws were made in this King's Reign, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
Pains and Penalties for matters of meer Religion, which
gave occaſion to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to charge upon <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Perſecution for matters of meer Religion, as their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
It is true, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were at that time Sufferers, and were
actually Perſecuted by the then Government for matters of meer
Religion: But true Charity might eaſily have found other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
unto which thoſe Perſecutions might warrantably have
been Aſſigned; and there was certainly no neceſſity of Aſſigning
them to any Principle of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Law which was made, relating to theſe matters, was
<hi>1. Edw. 6. C. 1.</hi> touching the Lord's Supper, Entituled, <hi>The Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for ſpeaking againſt the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,
or againſt the receiving thereof in both kinds.</hi> This ſeems to have no
other tendency than barely to keep both Parties from falling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the Ears, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were more likely to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Puniſhment of this Law, than the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> None could ſay,
That it was the effect of Intemperate Spirits; for though it directed
Communion in both kinds, to ſuch as defired to Communicate;
yet it compelled not any perſon to communicate. And it had a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97642:6"/>
Clauſe of great Temperance in the very cloſe of it, in theſe words;
<hi>Not condemning hereby the uſage of any Church out of the King's
Majeſties Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Law of this Nature, was made in the ſame Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz. 1. Edw. 6. C. 12.</hi> it is Entituled thus, <hi>viz. Statutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Treaſons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>repealed:</hi> and this cannot be denyed to be
ſharp againſt the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> It makes it highly Penal to affirm, <hi>That
the King is not, or ought not to be Supream Head on Earth of the
Church of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>or any of them immediately under
God, or that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or any other Perſon or Perſons, other
than the King of</hi> England <hi>for the time being, is, or ought to be, by the
Laws of God, Supream Head of the ſame Churches, or any of them:</hi>
But there is no neceſſity or reaſon of aſcribing this neither to any
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principle, though it is ſuppoſed to be made in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principle.</p>
            <p>Another penal Law was made 1. and <hi>3. Edw. 6.</hi> Entituled, <hi>The
Penalty for not uſing Vniformity of Service and Adminiſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</hi>
And in 3. and <hi>4. Edw. 6. C. 10.</hi> was made an Act, <hi>For
the aboliſhing and putting away of divers Books and Images.</hi> Both
which were ſevere againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in matters of meer Religion;
yet do I not find any neceſſity, why the Perſecutions, which theſe
Statutes occaſioned, ſhould be imputed to any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principle.</p>
            <p>During the whole Reign of this Infant King, it is clear, that the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> in ſome degree ſuffered Perſecution from the Hands of the
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for matters of meer Religion: And without doubt, had
it been then demanded of the <hi>Papiſts, Whether ſuch Perſecutions
and ſuch Laws Enacting ſuch Perſecutions, were lawful, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with the Principles of true</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>which they pretended to
maintain?</hi> their Anſwer would have been in the <hi>Negative:</hi> And
they would then with one accord have readily agreed, <hi>That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
for matters of meer Religion, was no more conſiſtent with
the Rule of Chriſt, requiring us, To do unto others, as we would that
others ſhould do unto us, than Murder and Robbery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Perſecutions Inflicted upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> by the Law made
in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, did not laſt long; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with his Life; and by the deſcending of the Crown to Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were reſcued from all their Sufferings. All the
Laws made againſt them in the Times of <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> and <hi>Edw. 6.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97642:7"/>
were Repealed. But the caſe was altered with the poor <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
whoſe Sufferings were ſo great, and are ſo ſharply and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reflected on, even to this day, that I, who love not to aggravate
any thing, eſpecially that carries its own aggravation with it,
will ſay no more of them, but beg of our good <hi>God,</hi> to fill us with
mercy in place of revenge, and to forgive them as we would be
forgiven. Sure I am, had any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> been asked his Judgment
in that Age, touching the Principle of Perſecuting for matters of
meer Religion, he would have diſclaimed it, as abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Principles of his Religion, which is the point that I am
labouring to Evince. And after all this, ſhall any one take it ill,
if upon a Principle of Charity I ſhall profeſs, that I could never as
yet ſee any thing offered, which in my poor apprehenſion did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
Evince; <hi>That Perſecution for meer Religion, was even an
avowed Principle of either ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bloody Fury of Perſecution, under which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
ſo miſerably in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> time, did end with her Reign,
which was but ſhort. And after that, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> never ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more from the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> But upon the death of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> the
Crown coming to Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and ſhe thereupon declaring her
ſelf a firm, a zealous, and to all intents, religiouſly a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi>
the Edge was turned againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> before any differences
were diſcerned to be among the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Several of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Clergy ſuffered Perſecution, ſome even unto Death in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of the Kingdom: And new Laws were from time to
time framed and multiplyed for thoſe purpoſes. And if now we
ask the Opinion of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as to Penal Laws, either Sanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or others, and Perſecutions, for meer matter of Religion; they
will tell you, (and they continue in that proteſtation even unto
this day) <hi>That all ſuch Laws and Perſecutions are unlawful, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Principles of the Goſpel.</hi> And though the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſeveral changes, have been in the poſſeſſion of thoſe Laws,
and have at times more or leſs Executed them; yet (ſo far as I
can find) they do not own Perſecution for matters meerly of
Religion to be their Principle, or ſo much as lawful.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had ſome time continued the alone-Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
Party for Matters of Religion, ſeveral Differences, in
Matters meerly of Religion, happened to divide the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97642:7"/>
into diſtinct and ſeparate Parties, during ſome part of the Reign
of <hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> and alſo during the ſeveral and ſucceſſive
Reigns of King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt: And about the
beginning of the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> ſome few deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Male-contents, profeſſedly of the Popiſh Religion, being
found Guilty of a wicked Plot, whereby they had deſigned
the Deſtruction both of that King, and of his Parliament, by
Gun-Powder (for which they were deſervedly Executed) ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
new and more ſevere Laws were then, and at ſeveral times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
made againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in general, by which ſeveral Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were Inflicted on them for Matters of meer Religion; and
ſeveral Penal Laws were alſo made, by which the then Governing
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party, (then, and ſtill diſtinguiſhed by the Name of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> or the <hi>Epiſcopal Party)</hi> perſecuted Them.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenting <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of all ſorts were Proſecuted under
the general Name of <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> who cryed aloud for <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conſcience,</hi> and declared it abſolutely Unlawful to Puniſh
any, for Matters of meer Religion: The refuſal of which, bred
bad Blood in the Kingdom, and we all know what followed.</p>
            <p>During the continuance of the War, and after King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Firſt was not able to make Head againſt the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi>
the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> Retaliated the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not
a little cruſht the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party, both having engaged on t'other
ſide, and being of other Religions, eſteemed themſelves Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for matter of Religion.</p>
            <p>That War being ended with the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt, and the expelling of our late King out of his Dominions,
and the Ruine of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and the Suppreſſion of the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the total Change of the Government; the <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi>
under the ſeveral Forms, took upon them and kept the
Government, until the late King was by the Divine Hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
reſtored to his Crown: During all which time, the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi>
Party and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Suffered, more or leſs, for matters
(at leaſt in their Apprehenſion) meerly of Religion. But theſe
two Parties were not alone in their Sufferings; for during thoſe
Bloody conteſts, there appeared another Party, which from its
very firſt riſe in this Kingdom, hath been ſeverely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97642:8"/>
and that only for Matters of Religion. This Party
was the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi> They did at their firſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves in the World, go under the name of the <hi>Children
of Light,</hi> becauſe they aſſert, as their main and firſt Principle,
<hi>That</hi> Chriſt <hi>is the True Light that Enlightens every Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with a meaſure of ſaving Light; which all ough<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion;</hi> but by one <hi>Bennit,</hi> an Officer, in 1650.
were nick named <hi>Quakers.</hi> They Profeſſed themſelves to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the plain Principles of the firſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and particularly
to hold it as their Principle, <hi>That all Perſecution whatſoever, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any Party, People or Perſon whatſoever, for matters meerly
of Religion, is abſolutely Vnlawful, Vnrighteous, and againſt the
Spirit and Will of God, and Doctrine of true Chriſtianity.</hi> And to
give them their due, they have been true Contenders for their
Principle, both by their frequent Apologies and Remonſtrances
on the one hand, and Invincible Patience in Suffering on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand</p>
            <p>Upon the Reſtauration of the King, the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party was
alſo Reſtored. The <hi>Presbyterians, Independants</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi>
expected a general Toleration in matters of Religion, according
to ſome of the King's Gracious Letters, as a Reward for their
helping or not oppoſing His Reſtauration. The <hi>Papiſts</hi>
alſo expected the ſame thing, as a reward for their Loyalty
in adhering to the Crown. The <hi>Quakers,</hi> now a great People,
grew confident of the like Freedom, becauſe of their Inoffenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to Government. But inſtead of this expected Liberty; all
the former Penal Laws made in the time of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> K.
<hi>James,</hi> and K <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, were Revived, and ordered to be
put in Execution, as well againſt all <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> who were
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as againſt the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> And new and more ſevere
Laws were made againſt them all: And by theſe reſpective Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
we ſee, what all theſe Parties have done when they had
Power.</p>
            <p>I think ſuch as underſtand the Tranſactions of our Country, will
clear me from having made any miſtake as to matters of Fact, in
any thing that I have here ſaid, touching paſt Perſecutions; though
I believe there will not want ſome, who will either think me miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97642:8"/>
in the point of Charity, when I profeſs to believe that
I do not think there is any one Party now in <hi>England,</hi> who holds it
as a Principle of their Religion, <hi>That it is Lawful to Perſecute,</hi> or
to make or Execute Laws for the Inflicting of Pains or Penalties
for any matters of meer Religion: Or elſe they will ſupect, I
do not in Truth believe what I here profeſs to believe in this
point, ſince even what I have ſaid as to matters of Fact before
urged by my ſelf; it plainly appears, that there is not one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
now in <hi>England</hi> (the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> only excepted)
who profeſs themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but have been notoriouſly
Guilty (more or leſs) of the very Fact, or (at leaſt) of a
publick allowing, if not abetting of it: And every Party will
be apt to cenſure me of Singularity (at leaſt,) ſince each Party
thinks that they have Arguments drawn from Facts, ſufficient
to ſix this ugly Doctrine, as a Principle, upon that Religion which
they hate moſt. O that the <hi>Man</hi> could prevail againſt the
<hi>Beaſt!</hi> and that we would permit our Paſſions to give way to
our Reaſon, to conſider things nakedly, and as they truly are,
<hi>Si ſatis eſt accuſaſſe, Quis erit Innocens?</hi> If to accuſe be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Conviction, what Party ſhall be able to clear it ſelf? And
who knows not, that 'tis a <hi>Chriſtians</hi> part to Suffer, but never
to Perſecute?</p>
            <p>I very well know, That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general, who look
upon the <hi>Papiſts</hi> as their common Enemies, do in their Pulpits, in
their Writings, and in all their Addreſſes to the People, charge
them with thoſe Rivers of Blood which ſtreamed in the times of
Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and with the Bloody Intentions which thoſe i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l Men
had in their Hearts, who were engaged in the wicked powder-Plot:
That the firſt was done by Authority, and chiefly by the
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Biſhops: That the other, though the Fact but of private
Perſons, was never condemned by Authority; and Silence is an
implyed conſent and approbation. Do we well conſider, what
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> offer by way of Extenuation in anſwer to theſe Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?
they juſtifie none of theſe Facts: But as to the firſt, they
recommend to us to be conſidered, the circumſtances that Q.
<hi>Mary</hi> was in, when ſhe came to the Crown. All the chief Heads of
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party, had ſet up and Proclaimed the Lady <hi>June</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97642:9"/>
duly Queen, in oppoſition to Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> their Lawful Soveraign.
They had raiſed an Army againſt her: She was compelled to
gain her Right by Force: She was a Conqueror: And if we will
believe them, ſhe had not given any Articles, which might have
obliged her to Pardon any who were guilty of this Uſurpation,
and Treaſon: She was told, It was a Confedracy of the whole
Party of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which gave her a ground to ſuſpect, that
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> held it for a principle, That it was lawful for them
to take up Arms againſt, and Depoſe their Lawful Soveraign, if
of a Religion contrary to him.</p>
            <p>She might, by the Laws then in being, (the ſame which we have
to this day in force amongſt us) have taken away the Lives of all
who were any ways Guilty of endeavouring to Depoſe her: She
did not make any one new Perſecuting Law (which is conſiderable)
by which any of thoſe were taken off who were put to Death. But
being put into fears by her Council; that without making great
Examples of Juſtice in all parts of the Kingdom, ſhe would be in
danger of having new Inſurrections made by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt
her; ſhe was perſwaded that the only way to prevent the ſheding
of more Blood for the Future, was to puniſh conſiderable numbers
of thoſe who had then actually broken the old Laws of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Her Biſhops (and that is the chief and juſteſt ground of the
charge) had their Fears and Revenge alſo, in particular: They
were newly reſtored to their Biſhopricks, and Religion, of which
they had been diſpoſſeſſed in the Time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth;
They were afraid of being again diſturbed; and theſe fears and
paſſions made them take wrong meaſures. They perſwaded the
Queen, that ſhe might as well make Examples of Juſtice, and
prevent future Inſurrections, by puniſhing thoſe for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
who had been Guilty of Treaſon, as if ſhe had puniſhed
them for Treaſon: And they urged, that by this way ſhe ſhould
do her ſelf the greater right: and give a proof to the World, that
ſhe was more offended with Treaſon committed againſt Heaven,
(for ſo they eſteemed <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion) than with Treaſon
committed againſt her ſelf, which might be interpreted Revenge.
They had forgotten the Principles of the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which required to leave unto God to Revenge whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97642:9"/>
Injuries are done to him, and to leave it to God to judge,
what Injuries were done to him; <hi>They did not now think of doing
unto others as they would that others ſhould do unto them:</hi> They did
not remember the wiſe advice of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> before mention'd,
but giving Ear only to their own Fears, and preferring Humane
Policies before Goſpel-Rules, they miſled the Queen, and took
away the Lives of vaſt numbers of ſuch, againſt whom nothing
could be charged, but what was matter of meer Religion;
thereby giving a Juſt occaſion to charge upon their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
the Principle of <hi>Perſecution</hi> for meer Religion, which
thoſe who now profeſs that Religion here, do pretend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
and abominate.</p>
            <p>And as to the buſineſs of the <hi>Powder-Plot,</hi> they pray us to
obſerve, that it was the Treaſon, not of the <hi>Papists</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
but of a few, particular perſons of Deſperate Fortunes and
worſe Conſciences, and not without ſuſpition of being drawn
into the Snare by their Enemies: That upon the moſt ſevere
Scrutiny which could be made into that buſineſs, it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
that the number of the Offenders was not greater than
what happens ſometimes to be engag'd in a particular Burglary,
and not ſo many as make up the fourth part of a Foot Company
of Souldiers: That the Villany of that deſign hath been as fully
and generally, yea, and as publickly decry'd, condemn'd and
reprobated by the whole party of <hi>Engliſh Papists</hi> of that Age,
and of all ſucceeding Ages, as any thing can be by a Party in
<hi>Perſecution,</hi> who have not ever had any opportunities or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
to act in any caſe otherwiſe then each perſon of the party
only in his private Capacity might do: and they Appeal to the
Juſtice of thoſe who profeſs to have the greateſt Averſion of all
others againſt the Religion of the <hi>Papists,</hi> whether they will
admit it as a rule, that the Villanies of ſome private perſons, who
profeſs themſelves to be in Fellowſhip or Communion with any
Church or people, calling themſelves <hi>Christians,</hi> may in Juſtice,
and ought in Reaſon to be charged as proceeding from the
Principles, Doctrines, or Religion of that Church or people
with which private perſons profeſs to be in Communion or
Fellowſhip! They cry out, God forbid any ſuch Rule ſhould
have credit in the World.</p>

On the other ſide, I am not ignorant, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> who
Eſteem the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general as their mortal Enemies, by
whom they apprehend themſelves to have been depriv'd of
what is moſt dear unto them, from the time that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Religion firſt gain'd a Preheminency in <hi>England,</hi> are as highly
Uncharitable towards the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as theſe are ſevere in
their Cenſures towards them. They have almoſt look'd upon
the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did upon the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> They
charg'd upon them the guilt of all Blood that hath been ſhed,
of all the Perſecutions which have hap'ned for matters of meer
Religion, ſince the firſt Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> of that nature, made
by King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII unto this hour: Inſmuating, that what
was ſo Cruelly Acted by Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Biſhops, was occaſion'd by
the Provocations given in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. and
warranted (as far as ill Acts can be warranted,) Firſt, by the
<hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> Retaliations towards the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
when ſubdu'd by them upon the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the I.
and then by the Retaliation made to the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> by
thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Reſtoration of our
preſent Soveraign.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general, to excuſe and juſtifie
themſelves, labour to caſt <hi>Perſecution</hi> for matters of meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as a Principle of <hi>Popery;</hi> ſo the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
are as Induſtrious to perſwade the World, that it is a Principle
of <hi>Protestancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might here by way of Apology and Extenuation refer the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> as they do the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to conſider of Circumſtances
of times and things which occaſion'd their Severities againſt
them, as the unrulineſs which might probably be amongſt the
people in the time of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the VI. to ſee their Religion alter'd
as they conceiv'd, by the <hi>Protector.</hi> And in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time,
beſides the renſentment which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had of the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which were exercis'd againſt them in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, It
is certain, the <hi>Papists</hi> did not look upon Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to have
any Right to the Crown; ſhe having been declar'd by the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Sentence, and judgement of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> to be Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate;
and the Marriage between K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and <hi>Anne</hi>
of <hi>Bullen</hi> her Mother, being by the ſame Sentence declar'd ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97642:10"/>
void <hi>ab Initio,</hi> and that Sentence confirm'd by Act of
<hi>Parliament, 28 Hen. 8. c. 7.</hi> So that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> took Q. <hi>Mary</hi>
of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be the Rightful Heir to the Crown, and Rightful
Queen, and Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was conſtrain'd by great neceſſity to
keep them under; but Apologies are not proper to be made on
the behalf of thoſe, who have the Authority towards thoſe who
are ſubjected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>in general, and the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>reproach'd
each other, reciprocally charging upon each other, that</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<hi>for matters of meer</hi> Religion <hi>was a Principle of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
Religion; <hi>ſo did the</hi> Epiſcopal Protestants, <hi>and the</hi> Non-Conformists:
<hi>The</hi> Epiſcopal Party, <hi>who firſt</hi> Perſecuted <hi>the</hi>
Non-conformiſts <hi>under the general Name of</hi> Puritans, <hi>or</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
<hi>affirm'd,</hi> That their first beginners in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from
whence they deriv'd themſelves, did more than any Party upon
Earth Perſecute others for matters of meer Religion, and had gain'd
a Power by their Vſurpation, Oppreſſion and Perſecution; being a
ſort of people who wanted the very Eſſentials (as they ſaid) of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<hi>viz.</hi> A Right Ordination, without which (as they alleadged)
there could be no True Church, no True Miniſtery, or True Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And that, therefore they ought by Penal Laws, timely
made, to be prevented from making Diſturbances in <hi>England. The</hi>
Puritans <hi>to juſtify themſelves, denying</hi> Perſecution <hi>for matters
of meer</hi> Religion <hi>to be their Principle, or to be lawful, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
to fix it upon the Church of</hi> England <hi>as their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and as taken up by them from the</hi> Papiſts. <hi>And as to the
particulars charg'd upon thoſe of</hi> Scotland, <hi>they ſaid,</hi> That
whatſoever thoſe of the <hi>Reformation</hi> had done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was
approv'd and abetted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> without whoſe Advice nothing in <hi>Scotland</hi> had been
Tranſacted, and without whoſe Aſſiſtance things had not been
ſo Effected: <hi>They further ſaid, as to the point of</hi> Ordination,
That the Church of <hi>England</hi> ought not in Reaſon, to account <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Ordination</hi> to be ſuch an Eſſential of Religion as they charged,
for that if no <hi>Ordination</hi> could be valid but by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that
then it would follow, that no <hi>Ordination</hi> could be valid but from
True and Rightful <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the True Church of Chriſt; and then
the <hi>Ordination</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would be as invalid as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97642:11"/>
               <hi>the</hi> Ordination <hi>of thoſe of</hi> Scotland; <hi>for the Church of</hi> England
<hi>could make out no</hi> Succeſſion <hi>of Biſhops, but through the</hi> Popiſh
Church, <hi>which both parties (as well thoſe of the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>as thoſe of</hi> Scotland) <hi>had condemned and agreed to
be a</hi> Falſe Church, <hi>and no</hi> True Church <hi>of Chriſt, but an</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
<hi>and</hi> Anti-chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Epiſcopal Proteſtants</hi> and the <hi>Puritans</hi> charged and
recriminated each other; the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party nevertheleſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
good their ground, ſo long as they had the Civil Power to
ſupport them; but when upon the Death of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the I, the
<hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> gain'd the <hi>Civil Power</hi> into their Hands, the
<hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>Party</hi> (like all Parties oppreſs'd) being under
<hi>Perſecution,</hi> together with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for matters of meer <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Did abſolutely condemn all ſuch Perſecutions as Vnlawful.</hi>
And then the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> (who were at that time ſub-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and branch'd out into ſeveral other Parties) gave occaſion
to charge them with the Principle of <hi>Perſecution</hi> for meer <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and put them to uſe the ſame Arguments to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as the <hi>Epiſcopel</hi> Party and <hi>Papiſts</hi> had reſpectively before
made uſe of, when the Government was in them, to prevail
with the World to believe that they abhorr'd the Principle of
<hi>Perſecution</hi> for meer <hi>Religion;</hi> and that the <hi>Perſecutions</hi> us'd by
them, were not for any matters of meer <hi>Religion,</hi> nor in Truth
<hi>Perſecutions,</hi> but purely Acts of <hi>Prudence,</hi> and doing right to
themſelves by a juſt care to keep the <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi> and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
out of all poſſibility of <hi>Perſecuting</hi> them any more for the
future.</p>
            <p>But none of them could find any reaſon of that Nature to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> which they us'd towards the people called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> they could not charge them with ever having <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
any Party or Perſon: Yet in Fact, both the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi>
and the <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi> did <hi>Perſecute</hi> them in their turns; and
therefore to prevent being charged for perſecuting a quiet Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for matters of meer <hi>Religion,</hi> They pretended ſometimes, that
the <hi>Quakers</hi> were all <hi>Mad-men,</hi> and that they Impriſon'd them
only to keep them out of the way, and to preſerve them in peace:
And thoſe who had gotten the <hi>Government,</hi> would upon that
Title claim the right of judging what perſons were <hi>Mad,</hi> as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97642:11"/>
they did always of judging what was <hi>Truth</hi> and what <hi>Errour.</hi>
At other times they pretended to puniſh the <hi>Quakers</hi> as Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers,
and the Perſecutors being the only Judges of what
was Blaſphemy under their Government, they might make
what they pleas'd Blaſphemy. When they grew aſham'd of
this Charge, they then pretended, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that every one who ſpoke or utter'd any
thing in their Meetings (whether <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Woman)</hi> was a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit</hi>
Diſguis'd. It was clear, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſuffer'd highly,
and it was as clear, there could not with any ſhew of Truth be
any thing charg'd againſt them, but what was matter of meer
<hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now upon the whole Buſineſs, what ſhall ſuch a perſon judge
of theſe matters, who eſteems himſelf in danger of being judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God, if he ſhall make any raſh Judgment? Shall we take
for a ſufficient ſolid Proof, the Charge of an Exaſperated Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
againſt an Enemy who hath provoked him, and this in a
matter of ſo great a Concernment, as to render not a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but a whole Party unworthy to live? This were to judge
againſt the Rules of common Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, as well
as to Sin againſt Charity: And this way of judging would render
each Party (the <hi>Quakers</hi> only excepted) to be Guilty, and to
give a juſt Title to each Party, where it hath the poſſeſſion of
Power and Government to put to Death all of the other Parties.</p>
            <p>For though we in <hi>England</hi> ſhould refuſe to admit the Charge
of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> here to be a ſufficient proof againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
in ſo great a matter; yet let us not deceive our ſelves ſo far, as
to ſuppoſe that in <hi>Popiſh Countries,</hi> the Charge of <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> would not be taken to be at the leaſt as valid, as the
Charge of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will be taken to be againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> here.
Shall we go another way, and ſay, that in regard every Party
takes it ſelf to be the only good and true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
we ſee every Party, when in Power, practiſing this thing,
and perſecuting the other (when in their Power) for matters of
meer Religion, that therefore every Party agrees in this? <hi>That
it is Lawful for thoſe who are the true</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>to Make and
Execute Penal Laws againſt ſuch as are Erroneous</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>and
to Inflict Pains and Penalties upon them for matters of meer Religion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97642:12"/>
that is, for Errors held by them as Doctrines of Religion:</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will this be reaſonable or convenient; for this will alſo
give Title to thoſe who have the <hi>Actual Power,</hi> and are in the
poſſeſſion of each reſpective Government in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World,
to put to Death, and deſtroy all within their reſpective Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
whom they judge to be <hi>Erroneous Chriſtians:</hi> And this
will be alſo to Entitle the Civil Magiſtrate in every <hi>Chriſtian
Country,</hi> to the abſolute and uncontroulable right of judging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> ſo as to have no appeal from his defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Judgment; and to entail againſt common Senſe an <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
in the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> of every <hi>Country</hi> of determining in
matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion: I ſay, againſt common Senſe;
for</hi> Chriſtianity <hi>teacheth us, that there can be but one true Faith; and
if this Power of judging ſhould be allow'd to the Civil Magiſtrate,</hi>
there would be as many <hi>Faiths</hi> as there are <hi>Governments</hi> amongſt
<hi>Chriſtians:</hi> That would be true Faith in one Country, and the
denyal of it puniſhable with <hi>Death;</hi> which in another Country
would be an <hi>Error</hi> and a <hi>Falſe Faith,</hi> and the affirming of it
puniſhable with <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It would alſo be to juſtify not only what the</hi> Papiſts <hi>in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>but what both the</hi> Papiſts <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants <hi>in all other parts
caſt as a Charge upon our</hi> Nation, That the only Rule of Faith in
<hi>England,</hi> is the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> that nothing is true
<hi>Chriſtian Doctrine</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> nor any Tranſlation or Senſe, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of Scripture, a true Tranſlation or Senſe, or Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scripture in <hi>England,</hi> but what is judg'd ſo to be by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England. Whereas, though in the</hi> Statute <hi>made</hi>
2, 3 Edw. 6. <hi>c. 1 Entituled,</hi> An Act for the Vniformity of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments throughout the Realm:
<hi>It was affirm'd by that Parliament,</hi> That the Book of Common-Prayer
enjoyn'd by that Statute to be us'd, was made by the Aid of
the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>Yet that very</hi> Book <hi>was by that very</hi> Parliament
<hi>alter'd and amended, as appears by Statute</hi> 5 Edw. 6. <hi>C. 1. And
it hath received ſeveral</hi> Reformations <hi>and</hi> Amendments <hi>ſince,
and was in and by a</hi> Parliament <hi>in Q.</hi> Marys <hi>days, judged to be</hi>
Heretical.</p>
            <p>As to my own Judgment in this particular Affair, it leads me
to another way of reaſoning and diſcourſing; I do, and I think I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97642:12"/>
am bound in Charity to believe that every Perſon and Party who
profeſſeth <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> do at leaſt intend to be what they profeſs,
and that they do all in their Hearts fully give conſent unto all
thoſe common Doctrines of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which, as ſtanding Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of that pure <hi>Religion,</hi> were never queſtion'd or deny'd by
any ſort of <hi>Christians,</hi> ſuch as are thoſe which I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
<hi>Of doing unto others, as we would have others do unto us, and
of not doing Evil, that Good may come of it;</hi> and thoſe others of
<hi>Loving our Neighbours as our ſelves; yea, and of Loving our very
Enemies, and doing good to them that who hate us and uſe us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfully:</hi>
All which, when ſoberly conſider'd, without Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or Humane Intereſt, are expreſly againſt all <hi>Perſecutions</hi> for
matters of meer Religion, and do not only tye up <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
from deſtroying of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but even from Perſecuting of any
ſort for any matters of meer <hi>Religion:</hi> as thoſe Commands, <hi>Thou
ſhalt do no Murther, Thou ſhalt not Steal, Thou ſhalt not commit
Adultery,</hi> and againſt and tye up all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from ſhedding of
Blood Unlawfully and Malitiouſly, and againſt <hi>Rapine</hi> and
<hi>Vncleanneſs.</hi> And ſuch do alſo in their Hearts believe, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Counſel or work is of man, will fall of it ſelf; and that
what is of God will ſtand Maugre all the <hi>Perſecutions</hi> and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of man; and that there is none of them do intend to fight
againſt God, or would willingly be found ſo doing. All this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken by me in my own Thoughts, to be moſt certainly true,
when ever I come to enquire, How then can theſe things be?
How can all theſe Parties (among which there are great numbers
of Good, Sober, Judicious and Sincere perſons) offend againſt
theſe common Principles of the common <hi>Faith</hi> of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
by making and Executing <hi>Penal Laws</hi> for matters of meer <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
Immediately adjoyning</hi> to this another Queſtion, which is,
And how can ſo many perſons, profeſſing to be <hi>Christians,</hi> take
revenge by Blood, uſurp the Goods of their Neighours, and
commit the Sin of <hi>Vncleanneſs!</hi> Yet all theſe were once done
by that great and good King, and Prophet, who was <hi>a Man
after God's own Heart.</hi> That which to me Anſwers this latter
Queſtion, ſeems clearly to ſolve the former; That the <hi>Beaſt</hi> gets
the better of the <hi>Man;</hi> The <hi>Paſſions</hi> commit a force upon <hi>Reaſon;</hi>
And Humane Frailty, being too weak, brings the beſt of men
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97642:13"/>
ſometimes (though but for a time) and careleſs men oftentimes
to contradict their <hi>Faith</hi> by their <hi>Practice,</hi> until by Afflictions
they gain underſtanding, and come to <hi>Repentance</hi> for the Saving
of their Souls. This to me ſeems ſo evident a Truth, that, until
ſomething more evident ſhall convince me of my being miſtaken
in this, I ſhould think it as great a Sin againſt <hi>Charity,</hi> for me
to charge it as a Principle of the Religion of any Party (profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to be <hi>Chriſtians) That Perſecution for meer Religion is Lawful,</hi>
becauſe I ſee it practis'd by thoſe who have Power amongſt that
Party, as to charge the ſame Party, to hold it as a Principle of
their Religion, that Murther, Theft and Adultery are Lawful,
becauſe great numbers of that Party, are too often guilty of
the practice of thoſe Sins.</p>
            <p>If this way of conſidering things be not found unreaſonable,
but upon due reflection, ſhall appear to be conformable to the
true Principles of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Rules</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi>
of Chriſt, I hope thoſe who are publick perſons, will forgive me
when I wiſh they would lay it to their Hearts, and think well,
whether it would not be of uſe to preſerve this poor <hi>Nation,</hi>
from the further guilt of thoſe additional <hi>Injuſtices,</hi> and <hi>Cruelties,</hi>
which the contrary way of raſh Judging muſt involve, and daily
do involve us in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is it not more calm Judgment to ſay,</hi> That the <hi>Diſordinate Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. hurried him into thoſe <hi>Cruelties</hi> which
he committed, than to impute them to the <hi>Principles</hi> of any
<hi>Religion</hi> which he profeſs'd? Is it not more becoming us to ſay,
that an over-zealous Paſſion of <hi>Fears</hi> which our firſt <hi>Reformers</hi>
had in the time of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the ſixth, made them apprehend, that
they could not put <hi>Popery</hi> out of its Poſſeſſion otherwiſe than by
force, and conſequently led them unwarily into practices, which
were contrary to their <hi>True Faith,</hi> then to admit the Charge
laid on them by the then Perſecuted <hi>Papiſts, That Perſecution for
meer Religion, was the firſt</hi> Proteſtant Principle, <hi>upon which</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy
<hi>laid its firſt Politick Foundation in</hi> England? Were it
not more Ingenious, to attribute the <hi>Cruelties,</hi> which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, to the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of <hi>Fear</hi> in that Queen,
and of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> in her <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that nothing could
ſecure her againſt <hi>New Rebellions</hi> from the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> nor
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97642:13"/>
fix the Biſhops in their re-gain'd Poſſeſſions, but Examples of
the utmoſt rigour, then to labour to fix thoſe Barbarous Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
as a Principle upon the Religion of the Queen? Is it
not more Charitable to aſſign all the harſh Laws made and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
in the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and in the
ſeveral ſucceeding times ſince by the Government avowedly <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi>
to the Fear, Ambition, Revenge, or other frail Paſſions,
cover'd generally under the ſpecious Titles of <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi>
then to give the World a juſt Ground to charge thoſe Crueltie;
upon a Principle of <hi>Proteſtancy.</hi> This we muſt do, or (which is
as much to our Diſhonour) we muſt give a juſt Ground to the
moſt Civiliz'd Nations of the World, to charge thoſe paſt Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities,
exercis'd ſo long in <hi>England,</hi> upon the People of our
Nation, to the Cruelties of our <hi>Engliſh Natures:</hi> For what other
thing can <hi>Forreign Nations</hi> impute it unto, when they ſhall obſerve
the ſame Perſecution continued for near one hundred and forty
years, under all the various <hi>Forms of Religion</hi> which we have
had, each Party renouncing the Cruelties to proceed from any
Principle of the Religion own'd by that Party, yet exerciſing in
<hi>Fact,</hi> what they renounce to be their <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Charity doth not reſt here, it compels me to make yet
one ſtep further; and ſince it is not to the Diſhonour of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I hope none will be diſpleas'd with it. As I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that all thoſe <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> which have been made in this
our Nation for the inflicting of Pains and Penalties for matters
of meer Religion, have not had their Original from any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of any of thoſe Religions which have been profeſs'd by any
of thoſe Powers or Governments by which they were made, but
ought to be imputed to the Paſſions of thoſe who made, and
caus'd them to be put in Execution: And that a falſe Reaſon
of <hi>State,</hi> or zeal in <hi>Church-men,</hi> gave thoſe Paſſions leave to
work even againſt the Religion which every Party Perſecuting,
Profeſs'd; ſo do I moſt confidently believe, that the True Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the common <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which every Party own'd,
and true Reaſon of <hi>State</hi> grounded upon thoſe true and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
own'd Principles, reſtrain'd all and every the reſpective
Parties, by whom thoſe Laws were made, from all Intentions
of having all, or any of thoſe Laws rigidly Executed; ſo that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97642:14"/>
thoſe who had from time to time, and who ſtill have the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive
and Interpretative Power of thoſe Laws veſted in them,
have always underſtood, and do ſtill continue to underſtand thoſe
Laws not to have been intended by the Legiſlative Power to be
<hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>rigidly</hi> or <hi>conſtantly executed:</hi> My Reaſon is, that had
this been otherwiſe, All of All Parties, except one, who at
ſome time had been in Power, muſt have been e're this totally
Butcher'd or deſtroy'd, and our poor Country ſo far Depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
as to have become a Prey to ſome of our Potent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
For even in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> times, thouſandes eſcaped that
never ſled; and had private Meetings, but the moſt Eminent
were Cruelly uſed.</p>
            <p>I know ſome there are who have imputed the remiſs Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe unkind Laws to the Generous Good Nature which
is found in the generality of our Nation, which abhors Cruelty,
and hath always a compaſſion for thoſe who are under Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and which well appears to any who reflect upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of our Courts of Juſtice, and of the generality both of
our Magiſtrates, and our Juries in all the Countries in <hi>England,</hi>
and how they have comported themſelves under the ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of paſt Times, when they have been call'd upon, and
Provok'd, yea Threatn'd, and endeavour'd to have been forc'd
into a Spirit of Perſecuting.</p>
            <p>Others there are, who have taken the great unwillingneſs in
all ſorts of perſons to be active in the Execution of theſe Laws
to proceed from the innate zeal that is in every <hi>Engliſh</hi> man to
preſerve the Liberties and Properties of their Fellow Subjects,
as well as their own; and that they have obſerv'd, that Liberty
and Property were never any way ſo much Entrench'd upon,
violated and deſtroyed, as by theſe Cruel Laws of Perſecution
for meer Religion: So that every man conſidering when he ſees
his Neighbour (though differing in Judgement from himſelf)
Perſecuted and deſtroyed for what ought to be call'd rather
his miſtake then his Fault (for no man can believe againſt his
Judgement, or take an Oath againſt his Conſcience without ſin)
that though this be his Neighbours turn this year, it may be his
own turn the next year, or next Reign; and no mans Life, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
or Property can be ſecure in caſe ſuch Laws be Executed;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97642:14"/>
but only ſuch men, who have a Conſcience fitted for all Changes
of Government, and for every Religion that is uppermoſt, and
who for that reaſon are as unfit to be Truſted by their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as by the Government.</p>
            <p>But though I take it to be very true that this natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to Mercy and pity, and this real zeal which all men have
for the preſerving of Liberty and Property, may have been
great helps to keep off, or mitigate the ſevere Execution of
theſe Laws of Perſecution for meer Religion; yet when I well
conſider the great power and Influences which the Supreme
Authority always hath upon the Subjects; and particularly
upon all the Magiſtrates in general, who are always perſons
nominated and appointed by the Supreme Authority; and muſt
be therefore ſuppos'd to be ſuch in whom the Supreme Authority
always Confides, as to the due Execution of what the Supreme
Authority intends to have Executed; I think it will Naturally
follow, that a forbearance of the rigid Execution of theſe Laws,
ought to be chiefly imputed to the Religion and true <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
policy of the Supreme Authority; and we ought to believe, that
though a falſe Reaſon of State did ſometimes permit Humane
Frailty, to make ſuch Laws as were contradictory to the true
Laws and Principles of that very Religion which thoſe perſons
profeſſed, by whom thoſe Laws were made; yet true Religion,
and true reaſon of ſtate always kept thoſe perſons from intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have thoſe Laws rigidly and ſeverely Executed.</p>
            <p>I will confirm this by one ſingle Inſtance of the higheſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that not in the beſt of times.</p>
            <p>The laſt <hi>Popiſh Prieſt</hi> that was put to Death in <hi>England</hi> for
being a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> was put to Death in the
time of <hi>Cromwel;</hi> I ſuppoſe, we are not to doubt of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
heat which inflam'd thoſe who were then in Authority
againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Popery;</hi> they look'd on the <hi>Papiſts</hi> as
mortal Enemies to their Government, and as faſt Friends, and
devoted Servants to the Crown and Royal Family: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which, when the ſaid <hi>Prieſt</hi> came upon his Tryal at the
<hi>Seſſions-houſe</hi> in the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and upon his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Pleaded that he was not Guilty of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
himſelf to be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> It clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97642:15"/>
that thoſe who were his Judges, did their utmoſt to
preſerve his Life, and to prevent the Execution againſt him of
thoſe Laws upon which he ſtood Indicted: For they did for
many hours ſuſpend the Recording of his Confeſſion, making
it their endeavour to prevail with him to Plead <hi>not Gluilty</hi> to
the Indictment: They preſſed him to this in the publick Court,
aſſuring him, that if he would ſo Plead, his Life ſhould be ſafe;
and that they had no Evidence which could prove him to be a
<hi>Prieſt.</hi> And when the Old Man (Aged about ſeventy two
years) would not be drawn to deny himſelf to be a <hi>Prieſt;</hi>
(taking it to be a denying of his Religion) and that the Court
was compell'd to give Judgment againſt him; the Magiſtrate
who gave the Sentence, was ſo drown'd in Tears upon that ſad
occaſion, that it was long before he could pronounce the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
which the Law compell'd (as he profeſs'd) to give. Now
I ask, can it be preſum'd that in thoſe ſevere times againſt <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
thoſe who then ſate upon the Seat of Juſtice, would, or
durſt have proceeded thus in a publick (out, and made it
their buſineſs ſo openly, ſo avowedly to have ſav'd the Life of
a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of that Party, if they had not well conſider'd that the
Makers of thoſe Laws, and even <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who had then taken
upon him the Government of theſe Nations, did not in Truth
intend a rigid and ſevere Execution of thoſe Laws, which were
for Inflicting Pains and Penalties for matter of meer Religion?</p>
            <p>But I think, I need give no further Inſtances for the proof of
this my Opinion: Whoſoever ſhall reflect upon the preſent
<hi>Genius</hi> of our whole Nation, and conſider in what deteſtation
all men have the Execution of Perſecuting Laws of matters of
meer Religion, how publickly Informers are Abhorr'd and
Diſcountenanced, when they labour to Perſecute any upon any
ſuch Law, will eaſily ſee that the whole Nation in general is
Convinc'd, that thoſe Laws were never any of them made, with
intention to have them rigidly Executed. I have been told,
(and it ſeems to be grounded upon Reaſon) that it is a Principle
of our Laws, <hi>That even an Act of Parliament, which is againſt
the Law of God, or againſt Reaſon, is void in it ſelf;</hi> If this be
true (as methinks it ought to be) I think we are very near the
time, wherein all our preſent Laws of this Nature, by which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97642:15"/>
any are ſubject to be in any meaſure Perſecuted for matters of
meer Religion, will be Repealed by the general Voice of the
whole Nation, and that when the particular Perſons, of which
the great Body of this Nation is compos'd, ſhall have conſidered
ſomething more deliberately, than their Paſſions have yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
all to do, that every Law of this Nature is againſt the
Liberty and Property of the Subjects of <hi>England;</hi> Unjuſt and
Cruel, in puniſhing men for not proceeding againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
Expreſly againſt the very Principles and Rules of the
Goſpel of Chriſt, and Principles of that true Religion which
every one of us pretends to own; Deſtructive to the Trade and
Well-being of our Nation, by Oppreſſing and driving away
the moſt Induſtrious Working Hands of our Nation, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populating,
and thereby Impoveriſhing our Country, which is
capable of imploying three times the number of People which
we now have: Contradictory to the Rule of Juſtice, grounded
upon common Reaſon, as well as Religion, which requires,
<hi>That no man ſhould do unto another, what he would not have done
unto himſelf,</hi> And conſequently void in it ſelf by the Rule of the
Laws of our Country: There will not be found a Magiſtrate,
nay, a common Subject in <hi>England,</hi> who will not as poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the putting in execution, or being acceſſary to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
of any Law of this Nature, as he will renounce the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
guilty of thoſe deteſtable Sins of Murder or Theft.</p>
            <p>But until Men are a little further convinc'd of theſe Truths,
you (Sir) ought not to be angry with, but rather pity thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
from whoſe Hands you have lately ſuffer'd for a Matter
meerly of Religion: Peradventure they did not fully conſider
that the Matter with which you were charged, was a thing of
meer Religion, but took your Meeting in an Aſſembly meerly
for the Worſhip of God, <hi>to be an unlawful Aſſembly,</hi> becauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
by a preſent Law, as the poor Magiſtrates in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
times took their Meetings in their Aſſemblies meerly for
the Worſhip of God, to be unlawful Aſſemblies, and Breaches
of the Peace, becauſe they were prohibited by their Laws: Or
perhaps their fear that they ſhould themſelves be ſubject to a
Forfeiture, in caſe they ſhould have deny'd their Warrant to
the Informer, made them fall under that Humane Frailty for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97642:16"/>
of themſelves. However it was, I ſuppoſe you have no
juſt Ground to believe the thing to be any effect of Malice againſt
you or your Friends; and if it be not, then the ſame Magiſtrates,
now their fear is over, may yet be inſtrumental to do you and
themſelves Right. It is Odds but upon a ſtrict Reflection upon
what the Informer hath ſworn, the Devil may have prevailed
with him to ſwear ſomething which may be proved untrue; for
Informers are not ſqueamiſh in ſwearing for their own profit,
as it hath appear'd in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and one point
of Perjury proved, will invalidate all his Teſtimony, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
all that is done: At which I am very confident no Man
(beſides the Informer) will be diſpleaſed. And this is in plain
Truth the great Reaſon why your Friends here deſire to know
all the Circumſtances of your Caſe; the certifying of which,
may be an Advantage to your ſelf and your Friends there, and
will be particularly very welcome unto</p>

            <p>I Have here-omitted many of thoſe great Arguments, both which
others have uſed, and which may yet be advanced from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this Subject, partly becauſe there are ſo many <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and partly becauſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> mankind begins to be ſatisfied in the
Matter. Yet this give me leave to add in general, That Force upon
Conſcience, and Corporal Penalties about Matters of Religion, have
not only no Preſident or Example from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, but are
expreſly <hi>againſt</hi> both their <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Examples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Coercion is the old Diſturber of States, the Deſtroyer of
Property, the Depopulator of Kingdoms, the Enemy of Humane
Nature, of Kind Neighbourhood, and of Conſcientious Religion.
At beſt it either maketh men <hi>Religious by Rote,</hi> which is <hi>no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
or <hi>Conformable for Fear and Intereſt,</hi> which is <hi>Ir-religion,</hi>
and baſe <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi> But beſides all this, it corrupteth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracteth
the Nature of all <hi>Civil Government,</hi> by making the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> nor <hi>Love, Honour</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but
<hi>Conformity</hi> to the Clergy and Religion in Faſhion; which deſtroys
the true Dependence and Obligation in Government, and ſubjects
the Lives, Liberties and Eſtates of the People to the frequent Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of Religion; which ought to ſtand fixed and Sacred upon the
common and undeniable Principles of Civil and Juſt Government.</p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall be excus'd for <hi>this Conception,</hi> ſince of all others,
<hi>This renders to</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar's: And would
to God, all the <hi>Caeſars</hi> of the World ſaw the Truth of this <hi>Notion:</hi>
They would not then ſuffer themſelves to be <hi>grown upon,</hi> not only
by another Power then <hi>Caeſar's,</hi> but by a Power <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s and which in the tendency of it leaves <hi>Caeſar</hi> nothing but <hi>His Name.</hi>
Let Him be felt King of all His People, by His Goodneſs, as well
as by His Power. <hi>Optimus</hi> went before <hi>Maximus</hi> among <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;</hi>
and ſhall Pretenders to the beſt of Religions <hi>(Chriſtianity</hi> I
mean) decline it? All Creatures Nouriſh and Defend their Young:
We are the Children of the Government, and ſhould be Conforted and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97642:17"/>
Defended under the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> Wing of Juſt Power and Favour:
He ſhould Endeavour our Encreaſe, Encourage our Induſtry, and
thereby Enrich and Repleniſh the Kingdom, not Impoveriſh and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate
it. For <hi>the Glory of a Prince is in the multitude of his
People:</hi> Not <hi>Beggars,</hi> but <hi>Men of Induſtry.</hi> But who dares to
be Induſtrious, that would not have his Labours made the <hi>Forfeit</hi> of
his <hi>Sober Conſcience?</hi> VNHAPPY AGE! <hi>Come!</hi> 'tis time
for Humane Nature to remember from whence ſhe came, for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to <hi>Love,</hi> for <hi>Caeſar to be kind to all His People;</hi> To let his
Rain fall upon all, his Sun-ſhine upon all, that he may juſtly render
Himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Affections</hi> of all; and not ſerve <hi>Factions</hi>
nor <hi>Intereſt,</hi> nor imbroile his Government with the Opinionary
Differences about Religion, which doth not Enlarge, but <hi>Narrow</hi>
His Empire: And thoſe that put him upon ſuch Meaſures, let their
Pretences be what it will, they are too narrow for his Glory, and do
<hi>Ill Offices</hi> in the great Family of the Kingdom. They ſet the <hi>Father
againſt the Son,</hi> and excite him to Diſ-inherit his Children, and
thoſe <hi>Virtuous too,</hi> meerly for the ſober Exerciſe of a Diſsenting
Conſcience, about matters relating to t'other World: This is <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Reprobation for Opinion, and ſacrificing Nature and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
to Modes of Religion:</hi> Nay, this is to <hi>Engroſs</hi> Caeſar <hi>by
a Party, and to Monopolize Him from the reſt of His People;</hi>
A ſin against the very Nature and end of Government. God grant
us all more Wiſdom, more Honeſty, and more Charity, and that we
may yet live to ſee <hi>all Induſtry encouraged, the Poor employed,
the Kingdom in Love with its own Growths, Virtue only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
