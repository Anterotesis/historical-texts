         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Good and Bad Newes,
FROM
IRELAND:
In a Letter of Credit from YOVGHALL
not forged as are moſt of Pamphlets
lately Publiſhed.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is no ſmall joy unto us here, that Sir
<hi>Charles Vaviſor</hi> is well arrived with his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which putteth us in heart againe; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
otherwiſe, wee could not have held the
Towne much longer: For amongſt other our
wants, the want of fuell was none of the leaſt,
for wee had no coale came a long time out of
Wales, and the River was ſo commanded all
downe from <hi>Capperquin</hi> by the Rebels, that no
wood could come downe. They have taken
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64227:3"/>
the Caſtle of <hi>Piltowne,</hi> and come in multitudes
every day, to the <hi>Ferry Banke,</hi> which is within
Musket-ſhot of the Towne, on the otherſide of
the water; and ſince the revolt of <hi>Water-ford</hi>
they have gotten three Peeces of Ordnance,
which they have planted on <hi>Piltowne</hi> land, to
blocke up the harbour, ſo as Sir <hi>Charles Vaviſor</hi>
got in with much adoe. The loſſe of <hi>Waterford</hi>
is a great loſſe unto us; for beſides that it is a ſtrong
Maritine Towne, it had in it 56. Peeces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery;
beſides, as the rumour goeth, they were
well ſtored with powder, and all other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
but I hope <hi>Waterford</hi> or <hi>Roſſe</hi> ſhall doe us
little hurt, ſo long as the Fort of <hi>Dunrannon</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
out, where wee heare that Captaine <hi>Thomas
Aſton,</hi> and Captaine <hi>William Welden</hi> are arrived
with two hundred men, which is a good ſupply
for that place. My Lord of <hi>Kilmeakell</hi> at Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donbridge
hath played the part of a brave Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman;
for when neere eight hundred of the
Rebels drew neere the Towne in a bravado, hee
ſallied out of the Town with one hundred and fif-foot,
and about eighty horſe, and gave them a
charge, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he routed them, put them to flight,
killed about an hundred, and tooke the Armes of
about three hundred of them. Wee heare for
certaine, that <hi>Limmericke</hi> is revolted, which is a
ſtrong Towne, and very rich, ſo as when our
Army commeth over againe to retake it, there
will be brave booty.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Mountgarret,</hi> in the county of
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and Baron <hi>Loghman,</hi> in the county of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64227:3"/>
               <hi>Tippary,</hi> are very ſtrong, and imperious, and wee
feared daily their approach, untill our new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
put life in us againe, which I hope will deterre
them from aſſayling of us.</p>
            <p>My Lord Preſident of Munſter, hath with
ſeven hundred Foot, and two hundred Horſe,
made his retreat into <hi>Corke,</hi> which I feare not, but
that hee will make good, untill ſuch ſupplyes
come, that hee be able to keepe the field, and the
Fort at one end of the Towne, and <hi>Barriſcourt,</hi>
(which is a Caſtle of good ſtrength) at the other
end; it will being well manned, I beleeve will
defend the Suburbs; but as for the Towne it
ſelfe ſtanding in an Iland, and well walled with
navigable Rivers on each ſide, will hold a long
ſiege without treachery, of the Papiſts in the
Towne, which is feared, as it is our feare here,
untill wee quit our ſelves of many of them,
which alſo quitted our feare.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Dungarnon,</hi> and Sergeant Major
<hi>Aplegard</hi> have beene very vigilant here, or elſe we
had beene betrayed long long ſince: And had
not my Lord of <hi>Corke</hi> nobly of his owne Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
on his owne charge have drawne downe
two hundred men from <hi>Tallogh,</hi> and other parts to
re-enforce our Garriſon, ſo that by that meanes
wee were a ſhelter to all the Engliſh Proteſtants
that fled hither, to whom wee afford what reliefe
wee are able, and furniſh them with ſhipping for
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee ſhall now againe draw downe ſome
Peeces of Ordnance to the little new Fort on the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64227:4"/>
Key; which was abandoned only for want of
men to man it, and we hope when my Lord of
<hi>Kery</hi> ſhall get a Regiment, hee will be appointed
this way, where his experience of the countrey
will leade him to doe the beſt ſervice.</p>
            <p>If I knew any thing more in theſe parts for
newes, I would certifie you of it, but having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe at preſent, but my beſt reſpects unto
you, and duty to my Vncle <hi>Payne,</hi> my love to
Cozens all, I take leave and reſt.</p>
