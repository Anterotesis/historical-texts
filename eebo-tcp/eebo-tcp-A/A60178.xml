            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Duke <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> (Earle of <hi>Cambridge</hi>) The Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Capell</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in the Pallace Yard at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> Hall gate, in the middle of the Pallace yard, toward the old Standard, at that end of the Pallace yard towards the water-ſide, The manner was thus.</p>
            <p>There were a great Guard of Souldiers both horſe and foot, and many thouſands of people. There were many Scaffolds made about the Pallace Yard, and they were very full, inſomuch that divers Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds broke, and ſome people fell down. The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and tops of houſes were all full.</p>
            <p>Firſt Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> (the Earle of <hi>Cambridge</hi>) was brought upon the Scaffold, There came along with him, Lieut. Col. <hi>Beecher</hi> (who had the charge of them all, as well the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110465:3"/>
are reprieved as theſe three who are this day behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) Alſo Dr. <hi>Sibbols</hi> the Miniſter came upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold with him, and a Gentleman of his own retinue with ſome other Officers, and Gentlemen, but very few were admitted to be there.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> was upon the Scaffold above an hour, before his head was cut off.</p>
            <p>Some part of the time was ſpent in a ſpeech to the people, other part of the time was ſpent in ſpeaking to thoſe on the Scaffold; he had much conference with Dr. <hi>Sybolls.</hi> And prayed very humbly (and with a deale of reverence) to God, both with the Miniſter, and with himſelfe, ſome times he prayed aloud, and other times he prayed to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> was in a blacke Suite with a Silver Star upon his cloake.</p>

            <p>Next to him, the Lord of <hi>Holland</hi> was brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scaffold, where were Lieut. Col. <hi>Beecher,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sybals</hi> and moſt of thoſe Gentlemen, ſave (onely two or three of the Dukes attendants) that were upon the Scaffold with the Duke.</p>
            <p>There came with the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> two Miniſters, a Gentleman of his, and ſome others, who were upon the Scaffold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Dr. <hi>Sybals</hi> Lieut. Col. <hi>Beecher,</hi> and the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> came in a long gown of ſilk, lined with fur (that he wore at his Tryall) of a brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh colour, he was upon the Scaffold nigh an houre before he was beheaded.</p>
            <p>When the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> was come upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, he firſt went to that ſide next the water-ſide, and ſhewed himſelf to the people, but preſently turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his face inward to the Scaffold again, and had ſome diſcourſe with thoſe Gentlemen that were on the Scaffold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:110465:4"/>Afterwards he went to the end of the Scaffold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Weſtminſter Hall gate, and there put off his hat to the people, and leaning upon the raile, with his hat off, and in his hand, he made a ſpeech to them.</p>
            <p>He had conference then with the Miniſters, and went to the other ſide of the Scaffold towards the gate going into Kings-ſtreet.</p>
            <p>He had a great deal of conference with Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> the Miniſter, and all the while carried himſelfe very humbly, and with a great deal of devotion and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; he took much delight in thoſe things that Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> ſpake, and heard him a great while with much reverence.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hodges</hi> turned to the other ſide of the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and wept, and ſo alſo did another Gentleman that did belong to him.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> having put off his gown and his doublet, he had a white ſatten waſtcoat on, and after that he ſpent ſome time in prayer, and prayed at the Block alſo.</p>
            <p>He had on the ſame white ſatten Cap, with ſilver lace, that he wore at his Tryall.</p>
            <p>He took his leave of Li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Executioner having asked and had forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and received the ſign of ſpreading out his arms, the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> lay down upon the block, and then prayed a while, and then giving the ſign, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner cut his head off at one ſtroke.</p>
            <p>His head and body were wrapped in a ſheet, and put into a Coffin brought upon the Scaffold for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and he was carried away, and his head was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſewed to his body by a Chirurgion,</p>

               <hi>The ſubſtance of the Earl of Hollands Speech.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That he for Religion is a Proteſtant, for breeding he is of an ancient honourable family, was well bred, though he had not lived ſo well as his breeding was, that he hath been alwaies ſetled in his Reſolutions; and as he took the Covenant at firſt for King and Parliament, as the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament had declared, ſo he had lived, and ſo long as his judgement concurred with the Parliament therein, hee ſtayed with them; and what was the rerſon why he left the Parliament to go to the King? why he came back to the Parliament, and that afterward he roſe for the peace of the King and Parliament, and to ſettle the peace of the Kingdome; He much applauded the King, and ſaid, that as for his owne part, he ſaw no blood ſhed by the Forces that he commanded; Hee died patiently, and prayed to God to receive his ſoul.</q>
            <p>Laſt of all the Lord <hi>Capell</hi> was brought upon the Scaffold; he had no Miniſter at all with him, nor had he any ſhew of ſence of death approaching,</p>
            <p>He was in a ſad coloured Suit and Cloake, and white Gloves, without his Perrewig, and came with his Hat cockt and his Cloak thrown under one arme, outfacing death with a great deale of careleſneſſe, as one notably reſolved.</p>
            <p>When he came firſt upon the Stage he looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the people, put off his Hat, as at a ſalute, and then cockt it, and ſtrutted about the Scaffold in a careleſſe poſture.</p>
            <p>He had a little diſcourſe with the Gentlemen upon the Scaffold, where he ſtayed very little between the time he went upon it, and the cutting off of his head, in all a little above a quarter of an houre.</p>
            <p>He went to the raile of the Scaffold on that end to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:110465:5"/>
               <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall gate, and made a Speech, leaning over to the People, which Speech took up moſt part of the time he was upon the Scaffold: He put off his Hat during the time that he ſpake, and his Speech was made with much earneſtneſſe, as if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter had been in a Pulpit rather then like a man dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. After that Speech he ſaid little, ſome ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe he had with the Gentlemen upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and the ceremonies about the Executioner, in all which he was very ſhort.</p>
            <p>He then took off his Cloake and laid it upon the raile towards the waterſide, and his man took out a linnen Cap and gave him, which he put on, delivering away his Hat, and then he put off his Dublet and was in his Shirt.</p>
            <p>Then kneeling down before the Block he lifted up his hands and eyes towards heaven a very little while, and then lay down, but his ſhirt coller being too high he roſe up againe and had it helped, (for though he was tall yet he had but a ſhort neck.)</p>
            <p>He prayed a while lying on the Block (to himſelfe) lfiting up his right hand from the boards of the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and then ſtretching forth his arme the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner cut off his head.</p>
