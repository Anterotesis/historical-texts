            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mill grinde onely, when the Wind sits in one corner? Or Shippsonely
Saile, when it's in this, or that quarter? Is hee a cunning Fencer, that
lies but at one Guard? Or he a Skilfull Musician, that plaies but on
one String? Is there but one way to the Wood? And but one Bucket
that belongs to the Well? To affect one, and despise all other, becomes
the precise Matron, not the Prostitute; the loyall Wife, not the loose
Wanton: Such haue I beene, as you are now, and should learne, to
Saile with all Windes, defend all Blowes, make Musicke with all
Strings, know all the wayes, to the Wood, and like a good trauelling
Hackney, learne to drinke of all Waters.</p>

                     <p>Who, I Sir, From a Lodging of Lardgesse, a House of Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and a Pallace of Plenty; Where there's Feeding like Horses, and
Drinking like Fishes; Where for Pints, w'are serued in Pottles; and in
stead of Pottle-pots, in Pailes; in stead of Siluer-tanckards, we drinke
out of Water-tanckards; Clarret runs as freely, as the Cocks; and
Canarie, like the Conduits of a Coronation day; Where there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Feeding and Frollicking; Caruing in Kissing; Drinking, and
Dauncing; Musicke and Madding; Fidsing and Feasting.</p>

                     <p>They may be rather called Reakes then Reuells; As I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
by the doore, I was call'd vp amongst them; Hee-Gallants, and
Shee-Gallants, I no sooner look'd out; but saw them out with their
Kniues, Slashing of Shoulders, Mangling of Legs, and Lanching of
Loynes, till there was scarce a whole Limbe lest amongst them.</p>

                     <p>One was Hacking to cut off a Necke, this was Mangling a Brest,
his Knife slip from the Shoulder, and onely cut of a Wing, one was
picking the Braines out of a Head, another was Knuckle deepe in a
Belly, one was Groping for a Liuer, another Searching for the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes;
I saw one plucke the Sole from the Body (Goose that she was
to suffer't) another prickt into the Breast with his one Bill, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke
to indure it.</p>

them and Pull them, till hee left them as naked as my Naile, Pinioned
some of them like Fellons; Cut the Spurres from others of their

Heeles; Then downe went his Spits, Some of them he ranne in at the
Throat, and out at the Back-side; About went his Basting-Ladle,
where he did so besawce them, that many a shrode turne they had
amongst them.</p>

Doe you open your mouth towards me? well, I know what you would

friends at home; gramercy gossip, if I should not pledge thee, I were
worthy to be turn'd out to Grasse, and stand no more at Liuery: And

Meat that was made in't; But it seemes, That the great Storme that
was raised then, is chast now; I haue other Noates to deliuer, one to
Master Rycott—and—I shall thinke on them all in order; My
Old Master makes a great Feast, for the parting of young Master Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldine,

many; But this is strange, the Gates shut up at this time a day, belike
they are all Drunke and laid to sleepe, if they be, I'le wake them, with
