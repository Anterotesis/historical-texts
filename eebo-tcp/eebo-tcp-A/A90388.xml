            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THere hath been in me a zeal for God from my childhood, and a moſt earneſt ſearch into the Scriptures (which my ſoul deeply reliſhed, and my heart honoured and loved, and ſtill doth) for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the mind and will of God. Two things did I earneſtly ſearch and beg for: The one was, for the diſcovery of the outward way of worſhip; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the inward life, vertue and power, which I looked upon the outward, as the proper means to lead me to, At the beginning of the troubles in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there was a lively ſtirring in me, and an hope that God was bringing forth ſomewhat; I likewiſe felt the ſame ſtirring in many others, at which my heart was rejoyced, and with which my ſoul was refreſhed; but I found it ſoon begin to flag and wither, which forced me to retire, and to ſeparate from that, where I found the life and power dying and decaying. In my ſeparation the Lord was with me, my ſoul remembreth it right wel, and he had regard to the ſimplicity, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and integrity of my heart, (which he himſelf bad kindled in me:) And though I felt too ſoon into a way of Church-fellowſhip and Ordinances, yet he had regard to me, and pittyed me, and refreſhed my life even there. But at length the form overgrew vs, and the ſweet and precious life in us began to dye. Then the Lord found out another way to refreſh us (namely by a ſenſible relating of our conditions, and of his dealings with us, and workings in us) which was very ſweet and precious at firſt, but the enemy crept in there alſo, Out of this ſtate I never made any change, but here the hand of the Lord fel upon me, ſtriking at my very root, breaking all my life in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and trampling my crown in the duſt. Then</hi> I <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man of ſorrows (being ſtripped of all my life,
<pb facs="tcp:115387:4"/>
faith, hope; joy, comfort in one day) not knowing which way to looke, nor what to deſire. Sometimes there were breathings ſtiring in me, but they were preſently judged: Sometimes a little glance of refreſhment from a Scripture preſented to me, but ſuddenly taken away, and my death and darkneſſe increaſed thereby. Then ſhould I wiſh, O that I might appear before his throne; for ſurely my conſcience is clear in his ſight, and I have not wickedly departed from my God, but was broken in pieces by his hand, even while my ſoul was earneſtly ſeeking after him. O how my ſoul did mourn, to ſee how I was fit to be made a prey to every raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit! and many did ſeek to devour me, but the hand of the Lord was with me, preſerving me, though I knew it not. And though I was wholly broken, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate of all that I had called, or could call knowledg (inſomuch as that I could not call any thing either good or evil) yet the Lord by a ſecret inſtinct, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me exceedingly out of that which was evil, and kept my heart ſecretly panting after the fountain &amp; wel-ſpring of good. Yea when I was at length (through deep deſpair of ever meeting with God any more in this life) captivated by the world, and betrayed by the love of it (which at laſt roſe up in me, and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon me by perſwading me, that my preſent eſtate and condition did require the free uſe of it, and the enjoyment of all it could afford) yet the Lord follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and often was I viſited with ſecret loathings of the world, and turnings from it, and pantings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſpring of my life: but theſe were dreaded by me, and ſuddenly quenched by the evil part, for fear of that miſery and unutterable anguiſh which I had felt hereby, the remembrance whereof was freſh in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115387:4"/>
               <hi>In this my courting of the world, and eſtrangement from the life, the reaſoning part (which the Lord hath been long battering, and had laid very low) gathered ſtrength in me; and I began to grow wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and able to judge of the things of God, and to hope and wait for ſome great appearance, wherein at length I might be viſited, and meet with that which I ſo vehemently deſired, and ſtood in ſuch need of. Thereby the enemy deeply deceived me, pleaſing me herewith, and keeping me hereby from unity with that, which alone was able to give me the ſight of him, when ever he ſhould appear. And in this fleſhly wiſdome, I judged and deſpiſed the true life in others, as weak and low, and not able to bring them to that which I ſtood in need of, and waited for. Yea the more I conſidred and reaſoned in my mind, and the more I converſed with them (hoping thereby to find ſome clear ground either of owning or turning from them) the further off ſtill was</hi> I, <hi>till at length the Lord powerfully touched, and raiſed up the life in me (which by all theſe reaſonings and conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all this while,</hi> I <hi>ſlew) and then by degrees (wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon that)</hi> I <hi>ſaw,</hi> I <hi>felt,</hi> I <hi>taſted,</hi> I <hi>handled, as the Lord pleaſed to open to me here, that which was ſhut out from me in my narroweſt ſearch and cloſeſt reaſonings. Thus the</hi> Jew <hi>in me was caſt off, and the Gentile called: but who can read this?</hi> I <hi>am ſure the eye of mans religious wiſdom cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereby my eyes have been opened, and</hi> I <hi>have ſeen the fetters, whereby</hi> I <hi>have been held captive from my life all my dayes: yea many of the ſtreets, and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of</hi> Babylon <hi>hath my eye beheld (in the pure life) wherein the Witch dwels which inchanteth from the life: yea I have heard the tongue of the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb facs="tcp:115387:5"/>
which ſpeaketh ſo like the true Prophet, as no fleſh can diſcern or diſtinguiſh between them: yea I have ſeen the Dragon in the Temple, worſhipped there for God by the ſtricteſt ſort of Profeſſors. And now in tender bowels, in the true light of life, from the pure movings of the eternal Spirit (as the Lord pleaſeth to guid and direct) do I come forth to viſit my poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow creatures and captives in</hi> Babylon. <hi>And what I have ſeen and known I teſtifie for the relief of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that if it be poſſible (by the mercy</hi> &amp; <hi>good hand of God) they may eſcape that miſery, wherewith my poor ſoul hath been overwhelmed, and may come out of that filthy abominable City which God is making deſolate; where the pure life, the conquering faith, the ſuffering love, the purifying hope, the putting off of the body of ſin, the putting on the living garment is not, nor cannot be witneſſed but men are only drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of theſe things in</hi> Babylon, <hi>where all the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they have, is from the pleaſure of their dream; but when they awake they will find leanneſſe and penury, and nakedneſs upon their ſouls.</hi>

               <hi>BABYLON is the ſpiritual fabrick of iniquity, the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical great City of the great King of dark eſs, built in imitation of Sion, painted just like Sion, that it might be tae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Sion, and he worſhipped there, inſtead of the true eternall ever-living God and King of Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſeat of the man of ſin: Where there is a building framed in any heart, or in any ſociety of men like <hi>Sion,</hi> there he lodges, there he lives, there he ſits as God, there he reigns, there he is worſhipped, there he is exalted above all that can truly be called God in that heart, or in that ſociety.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a City,</hi> This is a proper parable, to diſcover the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity by, in this ſtate, it is juſt like a City, in its kind it is a City. In a City there are ſeveral ſtreets, in the ſtreets hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in the houſes ſeveral rooms, to which familyes and perſons appertain, and to all theſe there are Laws and Governments. Thus it is here, there are many ſtreets in this City <hi>Babylon,</hi> many hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in every ſtreet, many rooms in every houſe: and the houſes and rooms have their ſeveral familyes and perſons appertaining to them, and they have their Laws and Governments, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Chriſt, their order, their worſhip, their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in which they walke, and by which they order themſelves in their ſeveral ſervices, places, offices, and imployments under the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a ſpirituall or myſticall City,</hi> It is not an outward buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of earthly materials, but an inward building of inward ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115387:6"/>
As the outward <hi>Sion,</hi> the outward <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is paſſed away in it's uſe and ſervice: ſo the outward <hi>Babylon</hi> is out of date too. (Ye need not look ſo far for it.) And as God hath built up an inward City, a ſpiritual building: ſo hath the King of darkneſs likewiſe. (He could never have tempted from the City of the living God, from the City of the myſtery of life, but by the City of the miſtery of deceit.) And as God builds his City of hewen ſtones, of ſquared ſtones, of living ſtones: ſo alſo hath the King of darkneſs his hewings, his ſquarings, his preparations, his qualifications for his buildings. If the light break forth, and make it appear too groſſe to have the whole Nation a Church, or to admit an whole Pariſh to Ordinances, he will gather a Church out of the Nation, and ſelect ſome of his choicer ſtones out of the Pariſh; yea he may graſp in ſome of the ſtones of the true Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if they come within his reach and circle, that is, if they look abroad, if they ſtep forth, and keep not cloſe to the anointing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is the great and only Ordinance of the Saints preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Antichriſts power: for if they ſtep forth, but ſo much as into a prayer againſt Antichriſt, out of this; they are caught in his ſnare, and are ſerving him in that very prayer, which they may ſeem with great earneſtneſs and zeale to put up againſt him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is a great City,</hi> an overſpreading City, a City that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreads the earth. As <hi>Sion</hi> was a vaſt City, a City that did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the Nations: How did the faith of the Goſpel over-run the world in the Apoſtles dayes! ſo this City hath alſo over-run the world. Indeed it hath taken up the whole Territories and Dominions of the other City (and hath enlarged it ſelf further) and <hi>Sion</hi> hath been laid in the duſt, and trodden under foot. And though many Witneſſes, Prophets, and Martyrs have mourned over her, yet none have been able to raiſe up the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> which hath fallen down, nor to recover <hi>Sion</hi> to this day, but <hi>Babylon</hi> hath had the power over her. Look with the true eye, and behold how all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages have been drunk with ſome or other of the mixtures of this falſe womans cup (ſome of them over, and over, and over again) and have been Inhabitants of this City crying her up (though not all in her groſſe habit, but ſome in her more refined ſhapes and transformings) for the true Church, for <hi>Sion,</hi> whereas
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115387:6"/>
alas, ſhe hath only <hi>Sions</hi> dreſſe, <hi>Sions</hi> ſhape, <hi>Sions</hi> outward gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which is the likeneſs wherein ſhe lies in wait to deceive) but not <hi>Sions</hi> ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is a City of iniquity,</hi> of hidden iniquity. That which is hid in this City, it is not the life, it is not the righteouſneſs, the holineſs of the Saints; but iniquity, ſin, tranſgreſſion of the life: Look into any of the ſtreets of <hi>Babylon,</hi> into any of the houſes, any of the rooms, any of the chambers of darkneſs: there's ſin there, there's unrighteouſnes there, there's not one cleanſed heart to be found there, not one pure eye to behold the God of life is to be found there; but in every heart ſin in a miſtery, iniquity in a miſtery, unrighteouſneſs in a miſtery. They ſeem to be for God and Chriſt, and to be cleanſed by them, but uncleaneſs lodges in them, and ſin rules in them againſt God, and againſt his Chriſt in a miſtery, which their eye cannot ſee; and ſo muſt needs mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take their ſtate. Yet this is the true ſtate of <hi>Babylon</hi> in all the parcels of it, it is the unclean City, where purity of heart and life cannot be known, but though it be waſhed and transformed never ſo often outwardly, yet ſtill it remains inwardly polluted, that which defileth keeping poſſeſſion and dominion there in a miſtery. The living water, the living blood runs not in any of the ſtreets of this City, ſo that there can be no true cleanſing there. Nay, ſuch ſtrangers are the choiceſt Inhabitants of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> to the Fountain of life in <hi>Sion,</hi> to the river that cleanſeth and healeth, that they cannot ſo much as beleeve that there is a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of cleanſing, and perfect healing and making ſound and whole here, while on earth. There is great talk of theſe things (of the water, the blood, the cleanſing) in all the Regions of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (which hath heard of the fame, and forms to it ſelf a likeneſs) but the thing it ſelf is not to be found there, and ſo the vertue, which comes from the thing it ſelf alone, cannot be felt there.</p>
            <p>And here, in this there is a great difference between the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the veſſels of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The veſſels of <hi>Sion,</hi> they are weak, earthen, fooliſh, contemptible to the eye of mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (which cannot look for any great matter of excellency there:) but the treaſure, the liquor of life in them is precious. The veſſels of <hi>Babylon</hi> make a great ſhew, appear very holy, very heavenly, very zealous for God and Chriſt, and for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115387:7"/>
up of his Church and Ordinances all over the world. Thus they appear without, but they are Sepulchers, there's rottenneſs within: under all this there lodgeth an unclean, an unſanctified heart, an heart unſubdued to the ſpirit and power of the Goſpel, while it makes ſuch a great ſhew of ſubjection and obedience to the letter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It is the City of the King of darkneſſe,</hi> of the great King of darkneſs, of <hi>the Prince of the power of the ayre,</hi> who rules univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally in the darkneſſe, in the miſtery of iniquiry throughout, even in every heart. Where ever is ſin, there is Satans throne; and there he hath his Laws, his Government, his power in every heart of his dominion. And where there is the leaſt ſubjection to him, he is yet a Prince, his building is not as yet there wholly thrown down, he is not there as yet diſpoſſeſſed and caſt out. As long as there is any thing left wherein he may dwell, he knows his owne, and keeps his hold of it. It is his right, and he will not looſe it. All ſin, all darkneſs is properly his: it is his ſeat, and he hath the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there. Man is the Land where theſe two Kings fight, and what ever is good and holy belongs to the one King, and what ever is evill and unclean belongs to the other, and there is no communion or peace between them, but each keep their own, and gather of their own unto themſelves. And where the fight is once begun between theſe, there is no quietneſs in that Land till one of theſe be diſpoſſeſſed: but then there is either the peace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> moſt commonly under a form of holineſſe, or the peace of <hi>Sion</hi> in the ſpirit, life and power.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This City was built (and is daily built) <hi>in imitation of Sion, painted juſt like Sion.</hi> The intent of it's building was to eat out <hi>Sion,</hi> to ſuppreſſe <hi>Sion,</hi> to withdraw from the truth by a falſe Image, and to keep her Inhabitants in peace and ſatisfaction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a beliefe and hope that it is the true <hi>Sion;</hi> and therefore it muſt needs be made like <hi>Sion,</hi> elſe it could no way ſuite theſe ends. Every ſtreet muſt be like the ſtreets of <hi>Sion,</hi> every houſe like the houſes of <hi>Sion,</hi> every Tribe and family like the Tribes and familyes of <hi>Sion,</hi> every perſon like the perſons in <hi>Sion,</hi> all the Laws, Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like the Laws and Ordinances of <hi>Sion,</hi> the worſhip like the worſhip in <hi>Sion,</hi> the faith like the faith of <hi>Sion,</hi> the painted Chriſt like the Chriſt of <hi>Sion,</hi> all that go for truths like the truths of <hi>Sion,</hi> they would not deceive elſe; City <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115387:7"/>
would be ſoon ſeen through elſe, and become quickly deſolate and forſaken, did ſhe not lay her paint very thick, and with great art and skil. Now here's the wiſdome, here's the true eye tried, to ſee through al the paints of this city in al the ſhapes and forms of it, to turn from every ſtreet, every houſe, every chamber, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry image and falſe appearance of truth, every falſe appearance of ordinances and wayes of worſhip, every likenes of things which this ſpirit forms from the letter, every duty that it thus cals for, every promiſe of Scripture which it endeavours to apply to that to which it belongs not, that it might lull the ſoule aſleep, and coſen and deceive it of the thing promiſed: here I ſay is the true eye tried to turn from all this, and to waite for the raiſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of the true ſeed of <hi>Sion,</hi> and for the ſpringing up of the true life and power in it and from it: For as long as this ſpirit can deceive you with any likenes, ye ſhal never know the truth, nor come to the worſhip of the true living God, which alone is in the ſpirit and in the truth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The end</hi> of al this, of Satans building up this city, this great city (thus accurately in the power of deceit, and in the very likenes of <hi>Sion)</hi> was and is <hi>that it might be taken for Sion, and he worſhipped there as God,</hi> and that without jealouſie or ſuſpition. And he hath attained his end, his city hath deceived and doth deceive, it paſſeth currant for <hi>Sion</hi> among al the inhabitants of <hi>Babylon;</hi> almoſt every ſort of people cry it up for <hi>Sion,</hi> in one appearance or other, though al do not cry up the ſame appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but their own image, way and worſhip, every one extolls; their own image of the truth for the truth, their own way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the way, their own church and family for the church and family of God. And worſhipping here, they worſhip him, and not the Lord: for the Lord cannot be worſhipped in any part of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> is worſhipped in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the King of <hi>Sion</hi> alone in <hi>Sion.</hi> Ah how deeply do men deceive their ſouls! they think they beleeve in God, they think they pray to God, and hope to be owned at length by God, and yet are ſo far from coming out of Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> that it was never yet ſo much as diſcovered to them; but they have either walked in the way of religion and worſhip they were brought up in in the apoſtacy, or perhaps have removed out of one or two of the broad ſtreets of it, and ſo thereby think they have left <hi>Babylon,</hi> when as the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115387:8"/>
ſame ſpirit hath ſit down in another ſtreet of the ſame city, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up another houſe by the direction of the King thereof, and there worſhipping the ſame ſpirit as they did before; but their ſouls never knew the <hi>fire in Sion, and the furnace in Jeruſalem,</hi> by which the very inwards of their ſpirits muſt be cleanſed, before the pure ey of life be opened which can ſee <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe ye are more able to receive things from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-expreſſions, then from the nature of the thing it ſelf, ſpoken as it is felt in the heart (concerning which, much more might be ſaid, were ye able to bear it) conſider a few Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Babylon</hi> is called <hi>a great city,</hi> Rev. 16. 19. and <hi>a great and mighty city,</hi> chap. 18. 10. O the power of deceit in that city to bewitch from the life! O the multitude of lying wonders that are there ſhewn in the heart, to make a man beleeve that he is in the life! to perſwade men that the King thereof is the King of <hi>Sion!</hi> and that the laws and ordinances of worſhip there, are the laws and ordinances oi <hi>Sion!</hi> that the prayer there, is the prayer of the true child! that the beleeving there, is the true faith! the love there, the true love! the hope there, the true hope! &amp;c. Some parts of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſome likeneſſes of truth there, are ſo taking, that none but the elect, by the opening of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal eye, can eſpy the deceit.</p>
            <p>And it is a ſpiritual city, a myſtical city, a city built by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>the myſtery of iniquity,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 7. whereupon ſhe is called <hi>Myſtery,</hi> Rev. 17. 5. It is not a city of plain wickedneſs, but a city of ſin hid, of ſin keeping its life under a covering, under a form of godlines, of ſin reigning in the heart under zeal, under devotion, under praying, beleeving, worſhipping, hoping, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. Where ſin lies hid within under theſe, there's <hi>Babylon,</hi> there's the myſtery of witchcraft, there's the painted throne of Satan, there's ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> where the Lord of life is daily crucified. This is the city, the myſtical city, the ſpiritual city, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 8. And here is building up and throwing down continually. She builds, the ſpirit of the Lord confounds, then down goes her building, then up with another, then down again. This is her courſe without end, when the Spirit of the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs her, for otherwiſe ſhe can ſettle in any form of knowledg or worſhip: though in her ordinary courſe ſhe hath alſo many changes and turnings, One while this or that being a truth, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115387:8"/>
while not, One while this or that being the ſence or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a Scripture, another while not. <hi>Babylon</hi> is hardly ever without this kind of building up and throwing down.</p>
            <p>And this city is a great city, a city ſpread over all the earth, <hi>ſhe made all nations drink of the wine of the cup of her fornication,</hi> Rev. 14. 8. The <hi>woman,</hi> which is this <hi>city</hi> (Rev. 17. 18.) <hi>ſate upon peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues,</hi> Rev. 17. 15. She ſate upon them as Queen, as Princeſs, guiding them in their knowledg and worſhip of the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And thoſe that once hated her, and made war with her, and burnt her fleſh with fire, ſhe coſoned them with a new paint, got them into her new bed of fornication, and made them worſhip the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12, 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> v. 16, 17. and there they lay committing whoredom with her, til the time of her laſt burning and utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: but then they forſook her, for fear of her torment, when they ſaw the ſmoke of her burning, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>In the Temples of this city (for in al the ſtreets thereof, yea in every houſe there are Temples) Antichriſt ſits as God, and is worſhipped, 2 <hi>Theſs. 2. 4. He as God ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God.</hi> He hath clothed himſelf like God, he appears like God (like the holy pure Spirit of life and power) he appears in the temple of God, he ſits there, he rules there, he gives forth laws and ordinances of worſhip and devotion. Yea if any one wil queſtion his godhead, or his right to do thus, he wil prove it, he wil make it manifeſt, in the very temple of God, that he is God: <hi>He as God ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf that he is God.</hi> He hath exalted himſelf into the throne above al that is called God, he hath got into the temple, he ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth there as God, and there he maketh it manifeſt to al his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers that he is the God, in ſo much as among al the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Babylon</hi> he is acknowledged and worſhipped, and the true Spirit of life is hid from their eyes, and denied and crucified. <hi>He ſhews himſelf that he is God,</hi> he gives demonſtrations of his godhead, which that eye which is out of the life cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and take to be true. There is none can ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the true God, the true Chriſt, but thoſe that have the true ey, the true anointing <hi>(no man can ſay, that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the holy Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 3.) and yet how many can ſpeak great words of God and of Chriſt, who know not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115387:9"/>
to the anointing? Alas, alas, Al nations and ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors out of the life, are co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now mark this, Antichriſts coming, when he firſt deceived, was very mighty, exceeding ſtrong, 2 <hi>Theſs. 2. 9, 10. Whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with al deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs</hi> &amp;c. Weigh the thing wel Satan uſed al his art, and al his ſtrength to conceive and bring forth this myſtery of iniquity, ſo like the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of godlines, that it might paſs for currant in the world, and he rule as God in in i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Rev. 13. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. Theſe are the things men look for, ſee but great power, ſigns, miracles, they are ſatisfied: the whole world ſtands ready to be deceived with this. Yea, and if the eye be not opened in perſons, which can diſtinguiſh of power, they muſt needs be deceived. Signs, wonders and miracles had their place in the firſt covenant, and were to that part to which the firſt covenant was (not to them that beleeve, but to them that beleeve not.) Now after the full demonſtration of the truth by ſigns and miracles, the power of Satan riſeth up, and by lying ſigns wonders and miracles overturneth the truth. Now the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving part in man expects and cals for ſigns and miracles, and ſays that wil determine the controverſie, and ſettle the ſtate of the Church again, but that part is not to preſcribe God his way: yea he wil ſteal as a theif upon thee, whoſe ey is abroad, and lookeſt for demonſtrations without.</p>
            <p>And as Antichriſt got up thus, ſo Antichriſt wil go out thus: he wil raiſe up this power, and what lying ſigns wonders and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles he can, to defend himſelf with, now the Spirit of the Lord is riſen up to diſpoſſeſs him, and caſt him out of the houſe which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115387:9"/>
he hath long lodged in. And he that can be coſened <hi>with power, with ſigns, with lying wonders</hi> (which are <hi>lying,</hi> becauſe they come from the ſpirit of deceit, with an intent to deceive, though they may come to paſs, and appear true to mans eye, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3.) or with any of the <hi>deceivablenes of unrighteouſnes,</hi> ſhal never come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but only be tranſlated into ſome of the more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of it, &amp; fed with ſomemore freſh likeneſses of truth, where he ſhall ſtil remain an Inhabitant and worſhipper in ſome Image, perhaps of univerſal love life and liberty, and yet be out of the life, out of the love, out of the liberty of the truth, which ſtands in the power and preſence of the Spirit of God, and not in the moſt refined Image or likeneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the world wondred after the beaſt, and they worſhipped the Dragon which gave power unto the beaſt, and they worſhipped the beaſt,</hi> Rev: 13. 3, 4. <hi>The Dragon</hi> is the Devil, <hi>the beaſt</hi> is that ſpirit of the earth which he raiſeth up, and feeds in men with a form and appearance of truth; to which he gives his power, and his ſeat, and his authority: and every man hath a meaſure of this according to his ſtate, condition, place and ſervice in <hi>Babylon.</hi> And now what a man doth here in Religion (be he never ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and zealous, and frequent in Ordinances and duties) is the worſhip of this ſpirit, and of the Dragon who ſits and rules in this ſpirit. I am run into hard expreſſions, very hard, becauſe the nature of theſe things is hid from mens eyes, and they are in the miſt of Antichriſts raiſing, in the ſmoak which comes from the pit, where there is no opening of the true eye, nor no true ſight of things: but truly, if ever ye eſpy the Dragon, the beaſt, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the whore, the falſe Prophet, ye muſt look at home, and read within: and there having found the thing, and ſeen it in the true light, ye will be able to read it certainly abroad alſo. Now do not go about to diſtinguiſh theſe things, in the notion of the underſtanding, but come to feel the life, to unite with the life, and the eye will open which can ſee into the nature of things, and will behold all in it's ſeaſon: for that eye which is ſo eager to ſee, ſhall never ſee theſe things, but that eye alone which waits in ſtilneſſe and quietneſſe, on the pleaſure and good will of the opener.</p>
            <p>Now all this time, while <hi>Babylon</hi> ſtands, while Antichriſt ſits in the Temple, while Satan reigns over all the Antichriſtian
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115387:10"/>
world, the true and living God hath not been known, feared, nor glorified (but mens knowledge hath been of a falſe God they have ſet up, and him they have feared, and given the glory to in their worſhip) nay the Goſpel hath not been preached, the true Goſpel, the everlaſting Goſpel, the Goſpel wherein is the light and power of eternal life, to turn men from all Antichriſtian forms of knowledge and worſhip to the true life and power. But when <hi>Babylon</hi> falls, and Mount <hi>Sion</hi> begins to appear again, then this Goſpel is to be preached again, even by an Angel who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it from God himſelfe, Rev: 14. 6, 7. for man could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recover it again: it requires a new inſpiration. <hi>The law is to go forth out of Sion, &amp; the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> And this Goſpel is to be preached <hi>to every Nation, and Kindred, and Tongue, and people,</hi> v: 6. mark, There was not one Nation, not one kindred, not one tongue, not one people that kept the everlaſting Goſpel, but it was laid up in <hi>Sion,</hi> it was carried with the Church into the Wildernes, and there it hath been hid all the time of the apoſtacy ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles. But now <hi>Sion</hi> is redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the true woman bringing back again out of the Wilderneſs, ſhe brings back the true everlaſting Goſpel with her; and there is an Angel choſen in the power of the Lord (even in the ſame power and Spirit that firſt preached it) to preach it again to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Nation, Kindred, Tongue and people. And the Lord hath ſo ordered it, that he will have the voice of this Angel as deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the wiſe in Religion, to the zealous in devotion of all ſorts of this backſliding age, as the former preaching was to the wiſe and devout both among the Jews and Greeks. So that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is wiſe in Religion according to the fleſh, whoſoever is wiſe in expectation and waiting for the kingdome, whoſoever is wiſe in reaſoning about it, and can tel the foregoing ſigns. of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall not know the voice: but he that can ſhut his eyes by the leadings of the pure life, and enter into the hidden womb of wiſdom, where the light of life is ſown, he ſhall be new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and come forth a child out of the womb of wiſdom with the new eye, the new ear, the new heart, the new underſtanding and ſences; and keeping in the childiſh ſimplicity, out of the wiſdome, zeal, and devotion which deceived him before, he ſhall receive and enter into the everlaſting kingdome.</p>
            <p>Therefore all people wait humbly for the candle of the Lord,

            <head>The ſins of Babylon.</head>
            <p>Although in the foregoing deſcription, ſome of the ſins of <hi>Babylon</hi> have been touched at, yet I find my ſpirit further drawn forth (in way of ſervice to the Lord and his people) to take a further view, both of them and ſome other of her ſins.</p>
            <p>THe ſins of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the Spirit of life (which hath righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly meaſured and knoweth them) are referred to theſe two Heads, <hi>Fornications and Abominations.</hi> She allureth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the creature into a ſtrange bed, and there it acts filthily and abominably with this ſtrange ſpirit. Now of theſe there are two ſorts; Firſt, ſome more open and manifeſt; Secondly, ſome more hid and ſecret, hard (yea utterly impoſſible) to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned without the ſhining forth of the pure light of li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e.</p>
            <p>All ſorts of men are eſtranged from the life: under the whole heaven is the Lord God forgotten, and his holy and pure Law and way of life, and filthineſſe and abomination is committed every where. Now all this filth (even the common filth of the earth) ſprings out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> hath it's riſe from her womb. Were it not for her, the ſound of life would be heard even among he Heathen, and they would not be ſuch ſtrangers to him that made
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115387:11"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor would they act ſo contrary to thoſe leadings &amp; teachings of the Spirit of God (who is the <hi>God of the whole earth)</hi> which the darkeſt parts are not without. It is ſhe, which withdraws their minds from the pure glimmerings that riſe up in them, ſetting up another God in their eyes, and heatheniſh ſottiſh wayes of fear, worſhip and devotion: and under this ſhe makes them filthy and polluted, unclean in their minds and in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, brutiſh in their knowledge and in their practices: <hi>For ſhe is the mother of fornications and abominations of the earth,</hi> Rev: 17. 5. Look what of pride, of vanity, of cruelty, of envy, of wrath, of luſt, of covetouſneſs, of idolatry, of blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be found any where among men upon the earth, ſhe is the mother of it all. All the common filth and ſtench of the earth ſprings out of this womb; this ſecret womb, this hidden womb: For though in this her open &amp; viſible appearance, ſhe be manifeſt to the eyes of many; yet to thoſe children of hers who are thus conceived, brought forth and bred up by her, ſhe is a miſtery of iniquity, and they perceive her not ſo much as here, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape this her openly polluted bed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The whore hath more ſecret fornications and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. Where ſhe can paſſe thus, ſhe need not paint, either her ſelf or her ware: but where need requires ſhe hath her paint, ſhe hath her delicates for the curious eye (Rev: 18. 3.) ſhe hath her <hi>Cinamon, Odours, Ointments, and frankinſence</hi> for the nice ſcent; ſhe hath her <hi>fine flower and wheat,</hi> &amp;c. for the fine pallace; <hi>and gold, precious ſtones, pearl, and veſſel's of ivory, and all manner of veſſel's of moſt precious wood</hi> for the more ſtately worſhipper; as wel as of <hi>braſs and Iron</hi> for the more common, Rev: 18, 12, 13. ſhe can paint both her ſelf and her ware, ſo as to make them taking to the eye of all fleſh. She can ſo mingle her cup, as ſhall pleaſe every palate, but that which is truly living, and caſt ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour upon her abominations, as no eye that's without can ſuspect, but takes with every young man that's hunting abroad, and knows not the ſpring of life in himſelf. So that all the deceits in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, all the ſeveral forms and wayes of knowledge and worſhip, all the ordinances, duties, and devotions which the ſpirits of moſt men take pleaſure in, are of her. And herein is her pride and glory, in ſubjecting theſe, in ruling over theſe, in blinding the eyes of theſe, and oppoſing the true life and power by theſe.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115387:11"/>
She doth not value whole Territories of the other, ſo much as one Congregation of theſe. For mark,</p>
            <p>The great Maſter-piece of the whore was to paint her ſelf like the Lambs wife, and ſo to withdraw from the true Church, and ſet up a falſe Church, which by reaſon of its paint and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to that which once was the true, ſhould paſſe up and down the world, and be taken for the true: And here lies her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, her glory, her majeſty, her life, her heart, even in the deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of this appearance. Therefore her great care and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is, to keep her poſſeſſion and dominion here. She often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth and changeth her paint, neerer and neerer to the Image and former likeneſs of truth, that ſhe might make it paſs inſtead of the truth, and ſo keep that which is indeed the truth down ſtil under reproach, contempt and perſecution, as ſhe hath done theſe many ages. Therefore ſhe hath her ſorts of paint by her, her varieties of ſorcery, of witchery, of inchantments, whereof her cup is ful, and wherewith her wine is made ſtrong, to make the Inhabitants of the earth drunk thereby, that being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted, being not themſelves, but their ſpiritual ſences bound up (as this wine doth very effectually, where ever her cup is drunk off) ſhe might lead them up and down from one thing to another, from one chamber to another, from one bed to another, from one practice and way of worſhip to another, and ſtil keep them from the true living thing which their ſouls ſeek.</p>
            <p>For were it poſſible for perſons, who did but ſo much as read in the Scriptures, concerning the power of life the Saints former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyed, the living Miniſtry and Ordinances, their ſweet walking and fellowſhip in the light, the preſence of the ſpirit in their worſhip, and in their whole courſe, their ſincere love in the ſpirit, and tender bearing with one anothers weakneſſes, doubts and differences; (which he that reads ſingly, cannot but pant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;) And the ſtate of the Goſpel was not to be a decaying and dying in theſe things, or a looſing of them, ſo that the power of the ſpirit, and the revelations thereof ſhould ceaſe (as the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſpirit, which hath gone out from the life, pleads;) but to grow and increaſe, and the laſt times to abound moſt of all with the power and glory of truth: I ſay, were it poſſible for perſons who ſhould read, and entertain the leaſt taſt or ſavour of theſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, to be ſatisfied with any of thoſe dead wayes and forms,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115387:12"/>
which the whore hath ſet up inſtead of them, unleſs they were wholly bewitched, and altogether deprived of their ſences, being made dead drunk which the whores mingled wine in this dark night of apoſtacy? Yea, profeſſors are drunk, they have deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drunk of the cup, and are ſorely overtaken, and their hearts overcharged with ſtrong liquor, which makes them even mad to draw others into their beds of fornication, and to ſtand up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in great rage, and call alſo to the Magiſtrates for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them. Yea like the clamourous woman they make a great noiſe about ordinances, duties, Miniſtry, Church, <hi>&amp;c. (I have decked and perfumed my bed,</hi> ſaith the <hi>loud woman,</hi> the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted woman, Prov: 7. 16, 17.) but do not ſoberly conſider which are the painted ones, which the truth. We have run on headily after theſe things too long; it is now time to ſtand ſtil a while, and wait for the purging out of the wine wherewith all our brains have been overturned, that we may come into ſoberneſs, and into a fit temper to be led by the Spirit of life, out of the bed of fornications, and out of the wayes, worſhips, ordinances, and duties of fornication, into the bed of the true and undefiled Spirit. Now he that worſhips God aright, muſt feel life within (and that life raiſed and ſtrengthned by him who begets it) and this will ſavour death, and (faithfully following its guid) will come out of the land of death, even that land wherein all the falſe worſhippers inhabit, and wherein all the falſe wayes and worſhips, duties, ordinances, Miniſteryes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſet up and flouriſh.</p>
            <p>Now theſe ſecret ſins of <hi>Babylon,</hi> are the ſame with the more open and groſs, the great difference is their ſecrecy, their not appearing like ſins, their paint, their colour, whereby they are ſwallowed down for holy and good. As to inſtance.</p>
            <p>There is <hi>fornication</hi> (or adultery from the life) in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, in the pureſt way of worſhip man can invent or imitate: but the fornication doth not ſo plainly appear here, but they who have drunk of the cup, take theſe things for the wayes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of God. Thoſe that ſet up the whores Church, do not call it ſo (nor perhaps think it to be ſo;) thoſe that ſet up the whores Miniſtry or ordinances, do not give them that name, but call them the Miniſtry and ordinances of Chriſt: yet this is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115387:12"/>
as truly, as really fornication from the life, as the groſſeſt wayes of Heatheniſh worſhip. O mark it, mark it.</p>
            <p>If thou haſt read the Scriptures, and thruſt thy ſelfe into any practices thou there findeſt mentioned, without the raiſing up of a living thing in thee, and without thy following by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereof, thou haſt done this by the whores advice, and in this thou art committing fornication, and erring from the life: for the true worſhip lies in the Spirit and in the truth, and it is the new birth that God ſeeks to worſhip him: but the ſpirit of man thruſting it ſelfe into theſe things, the Lord abhors and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And this ſpirit never can be thus cleanſed and fitted to enter into Chriſts bed, but only gets a paint from Scripture, and enters into the painted bed and boſome of the harlot, where it remains unrenewed, unchanged, unmortified in the midſt of all it's great talk and profeſſion of theſe things. And thus the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Holy Scriptures of truth (which were given forth from the pure ſpirit of life) the whoriſh ſpirit maketh uſe of to eſtrange from the life. For what ſort of perſons, which have fornicated from the life, but make uſe of the Scriptures to maintain their whoredoms by, and to bewitch others into their whoredoms with? Every ſort cryes up their own way and worſhip, to be the way and worſhip according to the Scriptures: and if any be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of all theſe witcheries into the power of God, then the bewitched ſay that ſuch are bewitcht.</p>
            <p>Then as for all the <hi>abominations</hi> of the earth, all the filth that defiles the heart, it is to be found on the skirts of the whore, even in her moſt refined dreſſe: For her religion, her worſhip, her profeſſion, her practices do not reach to the purifying of the conſcience, but only to painting over of the old Sepulcher, where rottenneſſe ſtill lodgeth within. The ſore was never throughly ſearched, the heart was never throughly circumciſed or baptized, the old man was never put of, nor the new man put on, the blood of purifying (which truly waſheth away the ſin) was never felt in it's vertue and power, but only an apprehenſion and talk that they are cleanſed in Chriſt, from a notion they have ſtollen out of the Scriptures, but not from the ſenſible feeling of the thing in life and power in their conſciences. And ſo the evil nature ſtil remains, the evil heart of unbelief is ſtil to be found in them, and they want the life, they want the power; they want the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115387:13"/>
they want the love, they want the humility, they want the meekneſs, they want the patience, they want the innocency and ſimplicity of the Lamb and Dove. And when the Lord comes to provoke them to jealouſie by the ſhining of his light, and by the appearance of his power in ſome whom they deſpiſe; then the pride, the paſſion, the envy, the heart-burnings, the hard ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the falſe ſurmiſings, with the reſt of the enmity which ſtill abides with them, ſtirs and riſes againſt the life and power, and their hypocriſie is made manifeſt. Yea ſome of the ſtricteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them can ſcoffe and jeer at the appearance of life, ſo ſtrong is the evil and unmortified nature in them, and ſo conceited are they in their wayes and practices, becauſe of their cover, under which all this iniquity (for the moſt part) lyes hid from their eyes. But for all that it is there, it is there, the Lords candle will ſearch it out, and thine owne eye ſhall ſee it, and find in thy ſelfe bloody <hi>Cain,</hi> ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed <hi>Jew,</hi> who is angry that his brothers ſacrifice is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and his not, who diſdains and derides the true ſeed of of life, the living heir, who hunts abroad for food pleaſing to that nature which is to be famiſhed, who crucifies the Lord of glory becauſe of his meaneſs, and becauſe he appears not in that way of devotion and holineſſe wherein they expect him. Neither will he appear ſo, but to overturn all that which ye have ſet up, and to ſet up that which ye diſdain. This is the Lords work, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>
            <p>Now there are ſeveral ſins which the Spirit of the Lord hath charged <hi>Babylon</hi> with, and which he will reckon with her for, and with all that partake with her therein, ſome whereof I may mention. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Her deep fornications from the life, under a pretence of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and worſhipping of it.</hi> (Be not offended that I begin with it again, ſeeing it is alſo mentioned among other particular ſins of hers, Rev: 9. 21.) She ſpeaks fair words, ſhe calls to have the worſhip of God ſet up, and a Godly Miniſtry, and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God in a Nation; but the thing is not ſo in the ſight of God, but in all this ſhe ſeeks the advancement of her owne whoredoms. And this was, and is the very way of Antichriſts ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; he gets into the form, he cryes up the form; and by the form which he cries up, he eats out the power. If Antichriſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115387:13"/>
ſpeak directly againſt the power, (without firſt creeping into, and ſetting up a form, and crying up that) he would ſoon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected: but under a form and profeſſion of truth, he hides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and covers his ſpirit of enmity and perſecution therewith; and here he can ſecretly and ſafely ſmite the innocent, and fight againſt that very ſpirit, life, and power, which he himſelfe in his form makes a profeſſion of being ſubject to. And this is the Wolfe in the Sheeps cloathing, which by this fair appearance of the ſheeps wool on his back, covers his ravenous narure from the eyes of the beholders.</p>
            <p>Now there are three wayes of fornication, one of which this ſpirit is allwayes guilty of, ſometimes of them all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By inventing things which the Lord never commanded, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which the Lord did command.</hi> The mind of man is very buſie, and ful of inventions: and where the heart is touched with devotion and zeal towards God, the inventing part excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly exerciſeth it ſelfe this way, either in imagining and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſomewhat which it thinks may be acceptable to God, or in adding to thoſe things which it finds commanded. In this way of fornication the popiſh Church abounds, being filled with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of their own inventing, and of additions to ſuch things as are found mentioned in the Scriptures. The common Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants alſo have been too guilty here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By imitating of thoſe things, which were commanded to others.</hi> When a man finds in Scripture the things which ſome others did, or which they were commanded to do; and ſo he is venturing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, before he feels the leading of that ſpirit, whereby they were led thereunto. Now in this, he errs from the life, he goes without his guid, he doth that which was a good thing in others (who were led by the Spirit thereto) but in him it is fornication. This man is a theif and an intruder, he ſteals into the outward knowledge and practiſe, without the inward life and power, he intrudes into that into which others were fairly led, coming in by the doore, for which entrance he alſo ſhould have waited, and not have run on headily of himſelf. This way of fornication, the ſtricteſt among the Proteſtants have generally been enſnared in, who have run on further and further to ſearch out the pureſt way of worſhip, the neereſt pattern to the primitive times, and ſo have applyed themſelves diligently thereto, not knowing what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115387:14"/>
they were to wait for to be their guid, and give them the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And here now, thinking themſelves to be in the right, they have contracted a lofty ſpirit, (and held forth their concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the way, as the only way) and ſo have loſt the meekneſs and ſimplicity, which was freſh and lively in ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which ſets them a great way back, and makes the enterance into the kingdom very hard to them: Whereas if that ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and tenderneſs were freſh in them, the Lord would ſhew great regard to that, eaſily pardoning this their errour and (in mercy to them) viſiting that evil ſpirit with his judgements, which ſtood nigh them, and was the cauſe of their error. But they are grown high, they are grown wiſe, they are become confident, they know the way already, and can maintain it by undenyable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as they think) to be the way, ſo the Lord with his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is at a great diſtance from them, that lying very low in them, which the Lord alone will teach.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By continuing in practices, to which they were once led by the Spirit, without the immediate preſence and life of the Spirit.</hi> For the whole worſhip, the whole Religion of the Goſpel conſiſts in following the Spirit, in having the Spirit do all in us, and for us. Therefore whatſoever a man doth of himſelf, it is out of the life, it is in the fornication. If a man pray at any time without the Spirit, that prayer is fornication, and is not either acceptable to God, or profitable to himſelf; but grieves the Spirit, hurts the life, and wounds the ſoul. Now this way of fornication have they eſpecially fallen into, who have been acquainted with true lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and openings of the Spirit, and have afterwards run to them for refreſhment, and ſo by degrees forgot the Spirit that opened. And by this means was that life, which was precious and very favoury in the Ranters (before they were ſeduced, by the Spirit of deceit, into that way of ranting) overturned. And thus they alſo (who deeply ſaw into the miſtery of whoredoms, and into the more inward wayes of fornication, above others) even they alſo were deceived with the whores cup, and drank afreſh of that wine of fornication, which the whore very cunningly had new mingled for them, and they alſo are become a reproach to the Inhabitants of <hi>Sion,</hi> who find a living habitation in that Spirit of life, which they turned from.</p>
            <p>Now if there be a true eye opened in any in the reading of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115387:14"/>
this, how eaſily and manifeſtly will he ſee whoredome, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, fornication, adultery generally in mens Religions practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in their Churches, in their Miniſteries, in their Ordinances, in their prayers, in their whole courſe! O how, think ye, doth the eye of the Jealous God behold theſe things! but your eyes, who are held captive here, cannot ſee it. The God of this world, with his miſts hath darkned you, the great whore with her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries hath inchanted you, and ye are her ſlaves,: ye are drunk with her cup, and how can ye judge ſoberly, ei<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her of your own eſtate towards God, or concerning your practices in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Her notorious blaſphemies.</hi> Having fornicated from the life, and from the Spirit, then ſhe blaſphemes the life, and the holy pure power and movings of the Spirit. <hi>The woman which ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcarlet coloured beaſt (with whom the Kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made dru<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k with the wine of her fornication) was full of names of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> Rev: 17. 2, 3. Yea the beaſt which carried her, which had many heads horns and crowns, he alſo had on his heads <hi>names of blaſphemy,</hi> Rev: 13. 1. <hi>And there was given to him a mouth ſpeaking great things, and blaſphemies,</hi> ver: 5. And he, with the whore together (for he did it by her ſpirit and inſtigation, by vertue of the wine he had drunk out of her cup) <hi>opened his mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwel in Heaven,</hi> ver: 6. This hath been the work of the tongue, in every head of the beaſt, namely, to blaſpheme the life, to blaſpheme the true living power, in all ages and generations, ſince the apoſtacy from the life and ſpirit of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Now there is a twofold blaſphemy, which the whore (and the powers of the earth that ſerve her) are guilty of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a ſpeaking well of the wayes of their own inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the wayes which they have imitated without the life, to call theſe the wayes of God, the true wayes of life is blaſphemy, <hi>I know the blaſphemy of them which ſay they are Jews, and are not, but a Synagogue of Satan,</hi> Rev: 2. 9. There were even in the Apoſtles dayes, perſons who pretended to be Chriſtians, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſtill to be of the Church, though they had loſt the life, and this the Spirit of the Lord ſaith was <hi>blaſphemy.</hi> And what is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115387:15"/>
their gathering into a Church, who were never gathered into the life, and ſetting up Ordinances and paſtors? what is this? what is it for him to call himſelf a Chriſtian, or inward <hi>Jew,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the fore-skin of his fleſh cut off by the circumciſing knife of the Spirit? what will the Lord ſay this is, when he comes to judge?</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a ſpeaking evil of the truths of God.

            <p>Now this double blaſphemy neceſſarily follows the fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <hi>Idolatry is the worſhipping of God without his Spirit</hi> (that is the plain, naked truth of the thing.) to invent things from the carnal mind, or to imitate things which others (who had the Spirit) did in the Spirit, by the command of the Spirit, for thee to imitate and practice this without the Spirit, is idolatry. An invented Church, an invented Miniſtry, an invented worſhip, an imitated Church, an imitated Miniſtry, an imitated worſhip without the life, without the Spirit, all theſe are the <hi>work of mens hands,</hi> and are <hi>idols,</hi> and all that is performed herein is idolatry, Rev: 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20. This is a Religion without life, a worſhip without life, a fabrick for idolatry; and the whole courſe of worſhip and ſervice in it, is idolatry. For the living God, the Lord God of endleſs life and power, is alone worſhipped by his Spirit, and in the truth of that life which he begets in the heart, and all other worſhip (though never ſo ſeemingly ſpiritual) is idolatrous. Ah profeſſors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, if ye knew how many idol-prayers, and ſervices ye have loaded the Lord with, and how ye have been whoring from him, while ye have ſeemed to be drawing nigh to him, ye would hang down your heads and mou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

She may perhaps ſpeak of the Spirit, to hide her ſelf the more (becauſe the letter of the Scripture is ſo expreſſe therein) and teach people to look and wait for the Spirit, but ſo as is never to be obtained: For he that begins in Religion either to pray, or worſhip, or ſeek the knowledge of God without the Spirit, ſhall never meet with the Spirit ſo; but that way of knowledge, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and worſhip of his muſt firſt be broken down, and he become a fool, and recieve the Spirit as a fool (out of all his religious knowledge and wiſdom which he had gathered before) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, following the Spirit which is thus received, he ſhall be led into the true wiſdom. Now mark that which follows, ye that have a deſire to underſtand.</p>
            <p>This ſpirit of deceit, this whoriſh ſpirit, this ſpirit of divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and witchcraft, <hi>(which by her ſorceryes deceived all Nations,</hi> Rev: 18. 23.) came forth curiouſly decked at firſt with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> It had the exact form of life, (the true form of Godlineſs) and a lively ſpirit in it: it had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115387:17"/>
the form of knowledge, and the form of worſhip, and with theſe it came to tempt, and draw away them from the life and from the power, who were in the life and in the power: and it did prevail upon ſuch as kept not cloſe to the anointing. But after it had overcome, and gained the Churches territories, then it might ſafely corrupt the form; and ſo it did, and went into multitudes of inventions and fopperies (as at this day may be ſeen amongſt the Papiſts.) Now theſe are eaſily diſcovered, and ſeen through by any ſimple plain honeſt eye, upon a little breaking forth of the light. Therefore the whoriſh ſpirit, when ſhe perceives her ſelf found out here, ſhe changes her ſhape and attire, and comes back, back again by degrees (as need requires) to the forms of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and worſhip, wherewith ſhe was arrayed, when ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at firſt: yet ſtil ſhe is the ſame, and doth this to keep poor ſimple hearts, ſtill in her bands, from the life and from the Spirit. And thus painted, thus decked, thus holding forth Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-knowledge, and Scripture-wayes of worſhip, ſhe is the more ſubtil witch, the more ſubtil ſorcereſſe, and is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any eye, but that which is opened in the light. With her <hi>Lo here Chriſt, &amp; lo there Chriſt,</hi> ſhe would deceive the very elect, if it were poſſible: but it is not poſſible; for they are taught by the Spirit not to go forth, and the anointing within preſerves them. And he that knoweth not this preſervation, is bewitched by her, and his fear of God is ſuch as may be taught by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men, and practiſed without the knowledge of the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, which is the Saints rule, guide, and preſervation. For as the Apoſtles were <hi>able Miniſters, not of the letter, but of the ſpirit of the New Teſtament,</hi> 3 Cor: 3. 6. So they that received their Miniſtry (or that which they miniſtred) received not the letter only, but the Spirit; and were preſerved, not by the letter, but by the Spirit; and were made able to try words, things, and Spirits, not by the letter, but by the Spirit. But this the whoriſh ſpirit is departed from, and bewitcheth others from, firſt poſſeſſing them that the Spirit is not to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, and then perſwading them to make as good ſhift as they can without it: and then (having thus prepared people) ſhe brings forth her wares. Look ye, ſaith ſhe, this is the way, thus and thus the Saints practiſed, do thou thus alſo. But thou muſt receive the Saints ſpirit, before thou either know or worſhip, or

thou knoweſt and worſhippeſt out of it: and in that path of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery and witchcraft from the life, thou ſhalt never meet with the life, but the further thou proceedeſt therein, wilt be more and more entangled from it, and become ſtil a greater and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemy to it, and more and more in love with the whore, and her whoriſh paths and pleaſing wayes of devotion, whereby the falſe ſpirit in thee is raiſed up and nouriſhed, but thy ſoul famiſhed: for that can be nouriſhed with nothing but the bread of life from the hand of the Spirit, but not with words, or forms of knowledge, or wayes of worſhip invented, or imitated; which doe but tickle the underſtanding or affectionate part of man, but reach not the life, ſo that that which ſhould ſerve the Lord, is not there raiſed, but ſtil bound over with the bond of iniquity.</p>

            <p>There is no other worſhip of God under the new Teſtament, but in Spirit and truth: and he that worſhips otherwiſe, worſhips not God, but that Spirit which teacheth to worſhip out of Gods Spirit, and out of the truth.

Every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance or duty is not an Ordinance of God, or a duty perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to God, but only that which the Spirit leads into, and guids and preſerves in. This is the way that all the earth have depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Lord, namely, by erring from his Spirit. They cry up practiſes in Religion, dutyes, ordinances, the means, the

For that charge ſtands good againſt all the inhabitants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> even to the higheſt and ſtricteſt of them all, whether in forms, or out of forms: There are many men who are very zealous and devout in their wayes of worſhip, who were never taught by the Spirit the way of worſhipping God, nor do at all know how to worſhip in the Spirit: theſe my ſoul exceedingly pittyes. They have received into their underſtandings from the letter of the Scripture, that God is to be worſhipped in Spirit, and that God will give his Spirit to them that ask it. They have asked, and they hope they have the Spirit, but poor deceived hearts, they know not what ſpirit they are of, nor in what ſpirit they act, nor what ſpirit they ſerve; and ſo periſh <hi>for lack of knowledge,</hi> the key whereof hath been hid from them. Now let ſuch conſider:</p>
            <p>There are but two ſpirits, the Spirit of God and the ſpirit of Satan, one of which guid all men in their devotion and Religion, and one of which they ſerve therein. He that is led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, he ſerves God, he worſhips God: He that is led by the ſpirit of Satan, he ſerves not God, but that ſpirit which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the Temple of God, like God, and gives ſuch demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations that he is God, as no fleſh can deny, 2 Theſſ: 2. 4. Here now is the great <hi>deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> In prophaneſſe, in manifeſt wickedneſſe, Satan is eaſily ſeen: and men that are found here, it is granted that they are ſerving the Devil: but that he ſhould ſit as King in gathered Churches, in dutyes, in ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in wayes of ſelf-denyal and mortification, and be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped here, this is hard to be ſeene: yet any of theſe which the Spirit of the Lord leads not into, or which are performed at any time without his Spirit, he is worſhiped in. Conſider this, ye that are wiſe in Religion, and are dilligently reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115387:19"/>
and gathering knowledge, and rules of worſhip, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do ye this in the life and Spirit of God? or in your own wiſdom, and according to your owne underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? Doth not the wiſdom of that ſpirit which is out of the truth, guid you in your ſearchings after truth? O do not ſerve that ſpirit which the Lord hates but come backe to that, from which in all this ye erre, and which in all this ye cannot ſerve and worſhip. And let not your Religion any longer conſiſt in meer practiſing what the Saints formerly practiſed (for that ye may do without the ſame ſpirit) but in yeelding up to that life, power, and pure ſpirit that they were led by. And when ye are joyned to this, then do not preſcribe the Lamb the way that he ſhall go, but <hi>follow the Lamb, whitherſoever he goeth.</hi> Do not tell the Shepheard (by your gathered wiſdom) the way that he muſt lead you in, but know the voice and follow: For this I can truly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that if once ye come in faithfulneſſe and true light to follow the Lamb, he will lead you <hi>in paths ye have not known,</hi> and out of the paths ye have known.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Compelling of others to worſhip,</hi> Rev: 13. 15, 16. The falſe woman and the beaſt ſet up a worſhip in the will, and they do not know why any in the will alſo may not ſubject and ſubmit to it. They can give them reaſons, they can give them arguments from Scripture, and if they will not yeeld to theſe, they are to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as ſtubborn and refractory, and to be compelled by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force. This hath been the courſe generally throughout the Land of <hi>Babylon,</hi> But theſe ſhew hereby that they themſelves are erred from the truth (and therefore very unfit and unlikely to teach it others:) For that which God works upon is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which he convinceth by the light of his Spirit, and no other light can truly convince it.

If it be not good or acceptable, what is that that goes about to compel them? Away with thy carnal weapons; and if thou wilt draw to God, draw by that which is ſpiritual: but if thou wilt ſtill be uſing outward force (running to the laws of men, and power of the Magiſtrate) the Lord hath opened an eye, which diſcovers thy nakedneſſe herein, and is able to make it manifeſt in the ſight of all people, and thou ſhalt not long cover thy ſhame.

She ſets up a way of doctrine, a way of worſhip in a Nation, and gets laws made for the defence of it, and againſt them that will not ſubmit to it, and here ſhe is too hard for the Saints, by this means ſhe overcomes the Martyrs and Witneſſes, and keeps the truth down, and keeps up her way of deceit, which without this prop would ſoon ſall.</p>
            <p>This whoriſh ſpirit ſcents the Spirit of the Lord, ſhe knows it will ſoon be her death, if ſhe cannot make it appear odious, and ſuppreſſe it: Therefore ſhe hunts this ſpirit, ſhe hunts the life and power of what ſhe her ſelf profeſſes (eſpecially if it appear vigorous and ſtrong in any) ſhe ſeeks advantages againſt the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the living God, repreſenting them to the earthly powers as perſons of dangerous principles and bad practiſes, inventing all manner of what can be called evil againſt them, and ſpreading it among the people, that the truth may ſtart up no where in the earth, but every where be knocked down by the violence of the multitude, or by the ſword of the offended Magiſtrate. Now what is the matter of all this great noiſe and fury? Why this: <hi>A Lamb is riſen up in the innocency, the pure harmleſs ſpirit is appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the earth, the true life.</hi> (which diſcovers the hypocriſie, and dead forms and wayes of the whoriſh ſpirit) <hi>is breaking forth:</hi> Therefore ſhe makes a great out cry, awakpeople awak, the church is in danger, ariſe Magiſtrates, Magiſtracy and Miniſtry wil down, if this Lamb-like ſpirit be ſuffered. Nay, nay; Theſe ſhall ſtand,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115387:20"/>
but <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, and her <hi>miſtery of iniquity</hi> be diſcovered, and her <hi>deceiveableneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe</hi> made manifeſt; and the true life and Spirit ſhall ariſe and take poſſeſſion of the hearts of people, and make them a clean and fit habitation for God: and people that are ſubject hereto, ſhall feel it and enjoy it, though the Merchants of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſay, men ſhall never be made cleane while they live, but muſt ſtil have a body of ſin and death hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them. But how ſhall they put on Chriſt, who have not put off the body of ſin? Shall thoſe who are made Kings and Prieſts to God here on earth, miniſter in their filthy garments.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the ſins of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that painted harlot, which is ſubtle in heart and lyes in wait to deceive, in the abſence of the true Church, whoſe cloathing and reſemblance ſhe takes up and appears in.</p>
            <p>And when ſhe hath done all this, When (like <hi>Aegypt)</hi> ſhe hath kept the ſeed in bondage in all her Territories and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in every Church ſhe hath ſet up, and by all her Miniſtries and Ordinances: When (like <hi>Sodom)</hi> ſhe hath filled the whole world with filthineſſe, uncleaneſſe, and all manner of ſpiritual abominations: When (like old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the bond-woman) ſhe and her children have ſcoffed at the Spirit in every appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, all the time of her reigne, and have trampled upon and domineered over them, who have but ſpoken of the coming of the juſt one in his people, ſporting her ſelf in her own deceivings: Yet, after all this, <hi>She wipes her mouth, and ſaith ſhe hath done no harm:</hi> She hath been for the Goſpel, and Church, and Miniſtry, and Ordinances, and the ſaith once delivered to the Saints, and only againſt deceivers, ſeducers, blaſphemers, and hereticks. But the Spirit of the Lord cannot be thus deceived, nor ſhall the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be allwayes thus deceived, and ſuffer her to ſit as a Queen upon their conſciences, but ſhe ſhall ſee ſorrow, and they ſhall taſte joy at the ſound of the everlaſting Goſpel, when once again it cometh to their ears, Rev: 14. 6. &amp; Chap: 19. 6, 7.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>BAbylon</hi> the great, this great City of abominations, which hath reigned over the whole earth, which hath bewitched all ſorts of profeſſors with the golden cup of her fornications,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115387:21"/>
which hath ſubtilly led from the life, and held all ſorts captive in the witchery of her deceit, and hath triumphed over the holy ſeed, making <hi>Sion</hi> their mother deſolate, who ſat in the duſt, and was trampled upon by her. This great City, this glorious City, this rich City, this mighty powerful City, this Queen of the earth (which knows not what belongs to <hi>Sions</hi> miſery, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, poverty, and deſolation) with Antichriſt her King and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (who hath cloathed himſelf with the garments of light, and appeared in the likeneſſe of the King of <hi>Sion,</hi> and hath long been ſo acknowledged and worſhipped) is to be judged by the Spirit of life, which ariſeth up out of the duſt of <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though <hi>Babylon</hi> the great whore (who in all her transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings hath ſtill remained an enemy to the life) hath great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and great wiſdom, and can ſhift very ſubtilly to ſave her ſelf by both; yet <hi>ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her, and he alſo is wiſe,</hi> and ſhe ſhall not eſcape his hand, but he will purſue her with his <hi>voices,</hi> with his <hi>thunderings,</hi> with his <hi>hail-ſtones,</hi> with his <hi>earth-quakes,</hi> with his <hi>woes,</hi> with his <hi>plagues,</hi> with his <hi>cups of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,</hi> till he hath made her manifeſt, till he hath broken her in peeces, till he hath crumbled and laid her in the duſt, till he hath brought her down to the very pit, where the feet of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall trample upon her for ever. Sing, ſing O inhabitant of <hi>Sion,</hi> doſt thou not behold the Crown of pride going down apace? The decree is ſealed againſt her, ſhe cannot eſcape; yea <hi>ſhe is fallen, ſhe is fallen,</hi> ſhe is already taken in the ſnare, the eye of my life ſeeth it, and rejoyceth over her in the living power.</p>
            <p>The plagues of God Allmighty, from the fierceneſſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, are viſiting her whole Territories, and paſſing over all her Land. Nothing can help her to avoid his ſtroak, no paint will ſerve, no cover will hide, no profeſſion, no practiſe, no duties, no ordinances, no Church, no Miniſtry can avail to conceal her, but that ſpirit is purſued by the Spirit of the Lord, and found out every where, and plagues are prepared and powring out upon her. Nay, though ſhe leave all her forms, and pretend to wait and ſeek for the Lord, yet ſhe is found out there alſo.</p>
            <p>Now what is her judgement? Deſtruction and utter deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the hand of the Lord, to be an hiſſing and reproach throughout all generations, to be brought down (by powrings forth of the wrath and vengeance of the Allmighty) into the pit,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115387:21"/>
and there to drink the fulneſſe of his wrath for ever. <hi>Sion</hi> ſhal be exalted, <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall drink the cup of life, the cup of bleſſing, the cup of love, the cup of ſalvation for ever: but <hi>Babylon</hi> the cup of fury, the cup of indignation for ever and ever. <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall ſing, but <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall howl: and all that ſaw any beauty, or took any pleaſure in her, ſhall mourn over her; Alas, alas, for her, ſhe who hath ſo many ages gone for the Church, is now proved to be the whore; thoſe who have been taken, in their ſeveral transformings, for the true Miniſters, made manifeſt to be the falſe Prophets; their ordinances and duties, but thefts and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; things which they have ſtollen from what they read in the Scriptures, but never received from the hand of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The wrath of God, the dreadful cup of his fury and jealous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation for the cauſe of <hi>Sion,</hi> is to goe over her whole Land. Over her <hi>Sea,</hi> and all the <hi>Ships</hi> that trade therein, and all her <hi>Merchants</hi> with all their precious traffique and merchandiſe. All her doctrins which ſhe hath ſtollen out of the Scripture, all her diſciplines, all her experiences, all her performances (even thoſe which are moſt like the performances of former Saints;) nay though ſhe may ſpeak the very words of truth, yet as they come from her mouth, they ſhall be thrown by and judged, and be of no ſervice or eſteem in <hi>Sion.</hi> The preciouſeſt of her ware ſhall be droſſe and dung in the Land of life, where there ſhall be no Sea, nor no ſuch kind of Merchants, traffique or trading for ever.</p>
            <p>Her <hi>Earth</hi> alſo ſhall be made deſolate, and burnt up, with all that is found therein: All her ſettlement ſhall be ſhaken, all her fruit-trees ſhall be rooted up, all her fruit ſhall wither, rot, dye, and periſh. All her converſions of people to God (as ſhe calls it) ſhall come to nothing: Yea, and if ſhe have yet any more dreſſes, or ſecret coverings, wherein ſhe would appear like the Church again, and bring forth again, yet ſhe and her children ſhall immediately be diſcovered, her fleſh burnt with fire, and her children daſh'd againſt the ſtones. Every ſtreet in her City, every houſe and idol in every ſtreet, every room in every houſe, with every inhabitant, ſhall drink of <hi>the cup of aſtoniſhment,</hi> and ſtumble, and fal, and riſe no more. <hi>Thou haſt long triumphed over me, O mine enemy, becauſe I have fallen, and have long ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:

but rejoyce no longer, for I ſhall riſe again, and the Lord ſhall be a light unto me; but thou ſhalt riſe no more, and thy light ſhall be put out for ever; glory to the meeke ſuffering-Lamb, even to him that ſits upon the throne of life for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her <hi>Aire</hi> alſo ſhall be darkned. The Lord ſhall enlighten my darkneſs, but the light of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be darkneſs for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. <hi>The light of a candle ſhall be ſeen no more at all in thee.</hi> Many lights hath <hi>Babylon</hi> ſet up in the dark night, but the riſing of the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhall extinguiſh them all for ever, and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> ſhall be ſhut up in utter darkneſs. Yea all that have retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Babylon,</hi> all that have walked by the light of any of her candles, that have cryed up any of her falſe ware for orthodoxe, that have given up their names to her under any of her dreſſes or appearances, or that have received any of her marks, they ſhall partake of her ſhame, of her miſery, and of her torment from the hand of the Lord God. Yea her throne alſo ſhall be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, and the ſeat of Antichriſt in every heart ſhall feele the wrath.</p>
            <p>Riſe up from the duſt, and ſhout forth with joy, O captive daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> who haſt long dwelt under oppreſſion, in the midſt of the daughter of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Behold <hi>Babylons</hi> King ſhall be no longer judge over <hi>Sion,</hi> but thy King ſhall be judge, and he ſhall judge the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And let all the powers and potſheards of the earth ſtrive to their utmoſt, <hi>yet,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion,</hi> and he ſhal rule in my people, and rule over <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, O inhabitants of the earth, great and ſmal, learn meekneſſe, learn righteouſneſſe, learn the fear of the Lord; <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> harden not your ſelves againſt him, calling him a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a blaſphemer, a ſeducer, an heretick (for what ye do to the leaſt that appear in his life, ye do to him:) but hearken to the word of his everlaſting Goſpel, which ſaith, <hi>FEAR GOD, AND GIVE GLORY TO HIM, FOR THE HO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE OF HIS J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DGEMENT IS COME,</hi> and ye cannot eſcape his hand by that fear, which is taught by the precepts of men, or by traditional knowledge out of the Scriptures, nor while ye ſeek that honour which came out of the earth, and is of the earth, and to that which is earthly. Therefore let your hearts learne to know him, and your tongues to confefs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115387:22"/>
him, and your knees to bow to him: which, if ye do, ye muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all that knowledge, and thoſe confeſſions and bowings, which ye have learned in <hi>Babylon:</hi> for though ye may have confeſſed ſome true things, yet (having learned this in <hi>Babylon)</hi> ye have confeſſed falſly, even as the Jews who ſaid, <hi>The Lord liveth,</hi> yet ſwore falſly, Jerem: 5. 2.</p>
            <p>Now conſider, ye Miniſters of ſeveral ſorts, and ye ſeveral ſorts of profeſſors: We may appear great enemies to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we witneſs againſt your wayes, and tel you what the end of them will be; but are we enemies to you indeed, whoſe deſire it is to ſave you from this great wrath, which hath already entred into the earth, and ſeized on ſome? Should we ſooth you up, and not witneſs theſe things to you (which we infallibly know) how ſhould we anſwer it to the Lord our God, or to your ſouls, when we ſhal appear before him? If we were in your condition, would we be content to be let go on, and to be overtaken with this great deſtruction? We cannot be ſilent. Ye muſt be ſilent, but we cannot. We know ye muſt be ſilent: for that which now ſpeaks in you, hath been ſilenced in us, and is not to miniſter the things of God. But the Spirir of the Lord muſt not be quenched in us, no notwithſtanding all our weaknes, but the treaſure muſt iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue forth from the earthen veſſel, for the relief of the poor in ſpirit, who alone receive the Goſpel. Therefore though ye hate us, though ye perſecute us, though ye ſpeak all manner of evil againſt us, and uſe us never ſo hardly; yet there is love roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our ſouls towards your ſouls, yea and towards your perſons alſo: and having both felt the wrath, and taſted of the mercy, we cannot but warn you of the one, and invite you to the other (and O that ye might find a ſhelter under the ſhadow of his wings in the ſtormy ſeaſon, when wrath ſhall be ſhowred down without mercy!) And this we cannot but tel you, that the ſeveral wayes of Religion in the Chriſtian world, are but ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral coverings; and that that which is covered with them is the whoriſh ſpirit, which the Spirit of the Lord is hunting, who wil ſtrip her, and make her naked, and ſhe ſhall appear to have been the whore under them all. Now that which lyeth beneath this Spirit in you, which is deſpiſed and trampled upon as a thing of nought, which is burthened and daily ſlain by your multitudes of Ordinances, profeſſions and Religious practiſes, this is the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115387:23"/>
heir of life; and by the raiſing up and living of this in you, may ye come to life, and no otherwiſe. And all Religion without this (even the moſt inward) is but the deceit of the whore, who makes a great ſhew of worſhip, and of zeal towards Chriſt, his Ordinances, and Miniſtry (as ſhe cals them:) but by all theſe, and under all theſe holds the life in bondage, and ſtrives by all means to ſlay the heir, that the inheritance might come to her ſon. But <hi>Cain</hi> the ſacraficer, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the ſon of the bond-woman, <hi>Eſau</hi> the hunter abroad after veniſon, the <hi>Jew</hi> full of profeſſion, zeal, ordinances and worſhip, ſhall not inherit: but ſlain <hi>Abel</hi> ſhall be raiſed to life, <hi>Iſaac</hi> (who was born of the dry and barren womb) ſhall have the promiſe, plain <hi>Jacob</hi> the bleſſing, the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt Gentile</hi> be ſought out. Thus it ſhall be, can ye read it? yet it is the deſire of our ſouls that a remnant of you may be ſaved, and now is the gathering. Therefore ſeek humility, ſeek poverry of ſpirit, ſeek the ſuffering ſeed, ſeek the meek, innocent, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Dove-like nature, even the love which doth no il, nor thinks no il, for this is the Spirit which is to be gathered: but the high and lofty, the wiſe and knowing, the fat and ſtrong, the rough and confident in their wiſdom, and in their duties, Churches, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which they have gathered, and ſtollen from the Scriptures, out of the life) are with all theſe to be rejected, and to be ſhut up in blindneſs and hardneſs of heart. <hi>Seeing they are to ſee, and not perceive, and hearing to hear, and not underſtand, leſt they ſhould be converted and healed.</hi> Yea it is this ſpirit, which is to fret under it's pain and torment from the woes and plagues, but cannot repent, but paſſeth on with <hi>Babylon</hi> to ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, Rev: 16. 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Babylon is become the habitation of Devils, and the hold of every foul ſpirit, and a cage of every uncleane and hateful bird. Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues,</hi> Rev: 18. ver: 2. &amp; 4.</p>
            <p>This is the cry concerning <hi>Babylon</hi> juſt upon her fal. Her iniquity is ful, her filth overflows, the pure ſeed is gathering out of her, and nothing but Devils, and foul ſpirits, and unclean and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful birds remain in her. And the cal ſtil is to the people of God, from one remove to another, from one part of <hi>Babylon</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to travel on and paſs away ſtil, til they come quite out of it all. To come out of one part of <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> worſhip, that's not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115387:23"/>
enough, or to come out of ſome peices of <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> knowledge and wiſdom, will not anſwer the cal, but ye muſt come out of it all. <hi>Depart ye, depart ye, this is not your reſt, for it is polluted.</hi> Stay not in any part of the uncleane Land, O child of the pure life: but be ſeparate and touch not the unclean thing, if thou wilt have the holy one to receive thee. Not only the ſeveral dreſſes and forms of the whore are polluted, but her ſpirit alſo, and all her inward fabrick of Religion, out of which thou muſt alſo come, if ever thou be joyned to the pure life. Thy faith, thy hope, thy love, thy patience, thy joy, thy peace, thy juſtification, thy ſanctification, thy mortification, thy ability to pray, to give thanks, to wait, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All muſt down, all muſt ſuffer loſs, all muſt become droſs and dung to thee, that thou mayeſt know the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of true life from and in the Spirit. For the Lord will not own any of theſe, nor receive thee with any of theſe which the whore hath touched, but if thou wilt have the pure life both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, thou muſt part with the corrupt life both within and without. (This is a faithful and true teſtimony, but who can receive it? will not both the houſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be offended and ſtumble at it?) But if any of the people of God will abide ſtil in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not hearken to every call of the Spirit of the Lord, to follow its guidance out of every part of her, <hi>they ſhall receive</hi> (from the impartial hand of the Lord) <hi>of her plagues, and ſhall have torment and ſorrow</hi> proportionable to the glory and pleaſure they have had with her. Therefore, if after one, two, three, or many removes out of ſome parts and practiſes of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the voice ſtil follow, crying, <hi>Come out of her my people</hi> (the ſpirit of Antichriſt is yet among you, the wine of fornication from the pure life, is not yet purged out of you) do not ſtop your ears, thinking this belongs not to you, becauſe ye have forſaken ſome paths which are Antichriſtian; but hear and follow, for it is your life, and your way to reſt and peace in the Land of the living, and your ſure preſervation from anguiſh, perplexity and miſery, in the houre of <hi>Babylons</hi> judgement and ſore diſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>Now there is one thing, which lies as a great block in the way, to hinder this teſtimony from entring into the hearts of thoſe, to whom it is directed, or at leaſt to weaken the ſpirits demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to their conſciences (for exceeding ſubtle is the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115387:24"/>
ſpirit, to keep every one of her ſubjects from the ſight, or ſuſpition of her in themſelves, and to darken every beam of light, whereby it pleaſeth God to make any way for the diſcovery of her in them) which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object:</hi> But hath all our Religion for theſe many ages, been <hi>Babyloniſh,</hi> and whoredom from the life? all our Churches, all our Ordinances, all our dutyes, all our Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> We can never be drawn to beleeve this. We are ſure we have felt lively touches from God many a time, and enjoyed ſweet communion with him in them. God hath often met us there, and refreſhed our ſpirits, which he would not have done, had they not been of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw:</hi> There hath been a ſimplicity and ſincerity of heart, ſtrring in ſome people towards God in all ages, even among the Heathen under all their Idols, and among the Jews in the midſt of their great apoſtacy: which ſimplicity is of God, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, notwithſtanding all the load of filth that may hang round about it. Even in the midſt of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or in the midſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi> if <hi>Iſrael</hi> groans the Lord hears, and may return ſweet anſwers to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even there. <hi>When Iſrael was a child I loved him, and called my ſon out of Egypt.</hi> The loweſt breathings of true life towards God is the voice of his ſon, and enters into his ears from the darkeſt part of <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this Nation, the ſimplicity hath more ſtirred, then in other Nations; the ſeed of God in this Land, hath been excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding precious and dear to him. And at the beginning of theſe late troubles, the ſtirring of the ſimplicity from the pure ſeed, was more vigorous and lively, then it had been in many ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and accordingly the anſwers of God to it were more freſh and ſweet, and there was a taſt of him, and fellowſhip with him, and ſweet hopes and refreſhments to the ſoul. Though the way of praying, preaching and worſhip (either publique or private) was not right before him; yet he over-looked that which his ſoul hated (winking at the time of ignorance and Antichriſtian darkneſs) and met with that which he loved. And if the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity had grown and thriven, communion with God (and life from him) would have increaſed, although the pure path of the Sanctuary had no yet been made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>But this was it deſtroyed all, another thing got up under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115387:24"/>
and the ſimplicity ſunk, and ſo the life with-drew, and God hath grown ſtrange to his people. He miſſed that which he loved and came to viſit, he found that thruſt upon him for his, which his ſoul cannot own or unite with, &amp; ſo he became but <hi>as a wayfaring man, that turneth aſide to tarry for a night,</hi> Jer: 14. 8. Enter into your hearts, O ye back-ſliding children, is it not thus? You, who had ſweet taſts of God is he not become a ſtranger to you? You that had ſweet, freſh, lively breathings after God, are you not ſit down in a form (or under ſome pleaſing notions) and have got a covering, but loſt the ſimplicity of your life, and the ſweet taſts of God, and refreſhments from him? Thus it hath been in all reformations: there was commonly a pure, ſingle, naked begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but an evil thing ſoon got dominion over it, ſlaying the pure living ſtirring by the form which it raiſed up, under a pretence of preſerving the life thereby, and of ſerving God more uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and acceptably therein. Ah the precious ſeed that was ſown at the beginning of theſe troubles! What is become of it? how is every one turned aſide from the pure life, into ſome Idol or other of his own heart! ſome into one way of worſhip, and ſome into another; ſome into one notion, and ſome into another; and all joyning together to keep the ſeed in bondage, endeavouring either to bring it back again to <hi>Egypt</hi> (to make it ſerve there) or to deſtroy and bury it in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the Lord hath viſited his poor deſolate ſeed, and hath been gathering it from all quarters, from amidſt all empty forms, on the one hand, and all vain high notions on the other hand; and he will preſerve it, overturning all his new enemies as wel as his old. This then is the ſum of the Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No way, or particular act of worſhip under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, is acceptable to God without his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All invented or imitated wayes or acts of worſhip, to the performing whereof, the mooving, preſence, and power of his Spirit is not neceſſary (but men can perform them without it) are <hi>Babyloniſh,</hi> and whoredome from that Spirit to which the true Chriſtian is joyned, and in which all that he doth is performed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Under this Antichriſtianiſm, under this whoredom (even in the Land of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> is captive) a true ſimplicity and zeal towards God may ſometimes be ſtirring.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When this at any time is ſtirring towards the Lord, the Lord pityes it, the Lord loves it, the Lord accepts it, When
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115387:25"/>
this cals, the Lord hears, and waits that he may be gracious, and return anſwers of grace to it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Though the Lord accept of this in the midſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in the midſt of the whoriſh wayes of worſhip that have been learned there, yet this doth not make <hi>Babylon,</hi> or her wayes of worſhip acceptable, nor are not to be made uſe of (nor cannot) by any that fears God to juſtifie them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Where they are ſo made uſe of, and the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> wayes and forms of worſhip cryed up (becauſe of Gods viſitations and tender mercy to his ſeed under them) God is provoked, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with-drawn, life loſt, and wrath prepared againſt thoſe forms and wayes of worſhip, which will reach to the very bowels of thoſe who are found there.</p>
            <p>And let this word come home to your hearts, O ye that ever knew what belonged to ſweet communion with God! If God was ſo tender to you in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when he ſtirred up in you a pure ſimplicity and zeal there, what would he have been to you, if ye had come out of <hi>Babylon?</hi> Ah, ye have loſt the ſubſtance for a ſhadow, and that not a right ſhadow neither, but a ſhadow of your own forming! and now ye are angry with them, who will not alſo leave the ſubſtance to cry up your ſhadow. Ah enter into your ſecret chambers, and let ſhame cover your faces, ye who would propagate that apoſtacy from the Lord, which your own hearts have too far entred into, and are ſo deeply involved in. O that the eye were opened in you which can ſee it! Do not your hearts a little feel it? O mourn after the Lord, and mourn after the loſſe of that which once (in ſome meaſure in you) was true to the Lord. O that the loſt ſheep might be ſought out, and that which hath been ſcattered (in the day of your loftines, and ſeeking do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and great things) might be gathered again to the Lord! for great is the wrath and ſeverity that is towards you, and he is become exceeding jealous for his ſeeds ſake; and judgement muſt begin with you, who cry out againſt Antichriſt in one groſſe fleſhly by appearance, and yet are ſerving him your ſelves, ſome of you in other forms, ſome in Spirit.</p>
            <p>This is a ſtanding ttuth, What ever is not of the Spirit of God in Religion and worſhip: is of the ſpirit of Antichriſt. What ever the ſpirit of man hath invented or imitated, is not the thing it ſelfe, is not the true worſhip: for the true worſhip is only and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115387:25"/>
continually in the Spirit, and never out of the Spirit. The true praying is in the Spirit, the true ſinging in the Spirit, the true preaching in the Spirit: Whatſoever is out of it, is of Antichriſt in man. Now therefore give up all your Religion, your knowledg, your worſhip, your practiſes which are out of the Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord, and wait for his raiſing of that ſeed in you, which once began to ſpring, but is now ſlain, and lyes in death and captivity under all theſe, and the earthly part (wherein all this Religion and theſe practiſes ſtand) covers its blood, ſo as ye cannot ſee how ye have ſlaine, and dayly do ſlay the juſt one.</p>
            <p>O the blood, the blood, the innocent blood that daily cryes to the Lord againſt you! How can the Lord accept any of your ſervices, while your hands are ful of blood! while the pure ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity is ſlain, the love grown cold, the life loſt, and the whoriſh way and path (wherein and whereby it was loſt) cryed up for the way of God. Shall not the Lord viſit for theſe things? Shall not his ſoul be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this? Yea his wrath is kindled, the fierceneſſe of his wrath is kindled againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of this age, and wo is from the Lord towards them. Wo to the Proteſtant Congregations, wo to the ſelect Churches, wo to their paſtors, who have helped them to wander from the life to dead idols, which cannot profit: Wo to them who are exalted in notions and high knowledge: ye have judged and condemned the Papiſts, and the Lord hath found out the ſame ſpirit of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in you! But turn from your Idols, return to your ſimplicity, put away your adulteries from between your breaſts, and returne to your firſt love, and the Lord wil receive you, though ye have wandred after many lovers, and have been inflamed with the love of idols under every green tree: but in theſe your Church wayes and worſhips the ſoul of the Lord abhors you, and all your former zeal and ſimplicity is blotted out and forgotten, and in your preſent adultery and idolatry ſhall ye dye, unleſſe ye hear the voice of the Lord recalling you, and turn at his reproofe.</p>
            <p>Now in tender bowels to help you a little, conſider that which follows.</p>
            <p>The ſame ſpirit that ſtealeth away the true ſimplicity, raiſeth up and ſtealeth in a falſe image thereof, which there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115387:26"/>
at preſent, unleſſe the ſoule lye very low, and be kept open and cleer in the pure light.</p>
            <p>And as in the true ſimplicity, the true light, the true knowledg, the true faith, the true hope, the true love, the true meekneſs, the true zeal, the true poverty and humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſprings up and is nouriſhed: ſo in the falſe image of ſimplicity (which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſecretly conveys in, when he ſteals away the true) there's a likeneſs of all theſe ſpringing up and growing.</p>
            <p>And here's the beginning of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the heart, here are the inward riches and treaſures thereof. What can <hi>Sion</hi> pretend to, which <hi>Babylon</hi> hath not in the reſemblance? Is there ſimplicity of heart in <hi>Sion?</hi> and is there not ſimplicity of heart among the inhabitants of <hi>Babylon?</hi> yea; a falſe image. Is there light in <hi>Sion?</hi> and is there no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alſo light in <hi>Babylon?</hi> yea there's the light of the Sun, and the light of the Moon, and the light of the Stars which fel from heaven, and the light of many candles ſhining in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Is there true knowledge in <hi>Sion?</hi> There's <hi>knowledge faſiy ſo called</hi> in <hi>Babylon:</hi> a falſe knowledge of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of Chriſt, a falſe knowledge of his <hi>death,</hi> a falſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his <hi>blood,</hi> without feeling the living vertue thereof, which truly waſheth away the ſin. So for <hi>faith, hope, love, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, zeal, humility,</hi> &amp;c. There are falſe images of all theſe in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of what ever elſe is wrought in truth in the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when the truth is loſt, and the falſe image crept in (both which are done at unawares, while the husbandman is aſleepe; and ſo he perceives it not, but thinks in his very heart that it is ſtil the ſeed of truth that is growing up in him) then begins the <hi>miſtery of fornication, idolatry, witchcraft,</hi> and all manner of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wickedneſs and deceit to work in the heart. Thy <hi>beleeving,</hi> thy <hi>hoping,</hi> thy <hi>love,</hi> thy <hi>zeal,</hi> thy <hi>praying,</hi> thy <hi>waiting,</hi> &amp;c. All here is abomination, it's from a falſe root, it's of a falſe kind: it is not of the true ſeed; the enemy hath ſtollen away that, while thou waſt negligent and ſlumbering, and all this ariſeth in thee from the ſeed which he did ſow inſtead thereof, and is the fruit of the Land of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having thus committed inward whoredome in thine own heart, then thou ſeekeſt and ſetteſt up outward wayes of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alſo. Having firſt ſet up an inward image of the inward life
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115387:26"/>
of the Saints, thou then ſeekeſt and ſetteſt up another image of their outward worſhip, an image of a Church, an image of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, an image of Ordinances, an image of praying, an image of ſinging, an image of preaching, an image of baptiſm, an image of the Saints communion. And thus thou art defiled within and without, and art mad with envy and rage that thou canſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch the inhabitants of <hi>Sion</hi> (who are kept pure from all theſe defilements, and reſerved as witneſſes againſt thee) into thy bed of whoredoms. And thus while thou thinkeſt thou art the chiefe worſhipper, thou art all over polluted, <hi>the whole head is ſicke, and the whole heart faint,</hi> there isno cleanneſs, no ſoundneſſe within or without, but <hi>wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores,</hi> which <hi>have not been cloſed, neither bound up, nor mollified with oyl:</hi> but the hurt of the daughter of my people hath been healed deceitfully, by Phyſitians of no vallue, who had notthe oyl. (Iſa: 1. 5, 6. &amp; Ezek: 13. 10.)</p>
            <p>This is generally the ſtate of profeſſors at this day, but they cannot ſee it: for they have put out the eye of the ſimplicity (wherewith alone God will ſuffer the things of life to be ſeen) and God hath blinded the eye of their wiſdom, that they ſhall not ſee, nor be converted and healed that way. So that exceeding miſerable is their eſtate: They will not ſee Gods way, and God will not let them ſee their way. So that though there be <hi>line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little; yet it is that they might ſtumble, and fall, and be ſnared, and broken, and taken:</hi> For as diſcoveries of truth grow more cleer and manifeſt; ſo they grow more hardned againſt it. And as they, on the one hand, increaſe in walking contrary to God; ſo God on the other hand, proceeds in walking contrary to them, delighting more and more to ſtumble the wiſe diſputing part, which would ſo fain know, but muſt be made blind, that the eye of the babe may be opened, which ſees that in the childiſh ſimplicity, which the other eye can never reach in the moſt manly wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Therefore put away all your <hi>images and likeneſſes of truth:</hi> Put away your <hi>falſe faith</hi> (which can never overcome the worldly nature and ſpirit in you) and your <hi>falſe hope</hi> (which can never purifie your hearts) and your <hi>fained humility and ſelf-willed faſts</hi> (which can never bring down the lofty exalted nature in you) and your <hi>falſe love</hi> (wherewith ye can never love the brethren in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115387:27"/>
truth, but only the brethren in your own, or ſome ſuch other like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the truth) and your <hi>falſe zeal, meekneſs, holineſſe, &amp;c.</hi> All which ſpring and grow up from the wrong ſeed, in a ſeeming ſimplicity; and all your <hi>praying, reading, preaching,</hi> &amp;c. which ye have taken up and practiſe in your own wils, which ſhould be crucified, and wherewith no ſervice, worſhip, or performance can be pleaſing to God: and wait for the raiſing of the true ſeed of life in the true ſimplicity, whereby ye may ſerve God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably here, and be ſaved hereafter. And be not mockers, leſt your bands be made ſtrong, for the conſumption is determined againſt you by that Spirit of life, whoſe breath wil waſt you: <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and the glory thereof as the flower of the field! Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this people is graſſe, and their zeal, and profeſſion of God, like the fading flower.</hi>

            <head>Some conſiderations, helping out of the Suburbs or out-skirts of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that her inward building may be the better come at, and lye the more open to the Axe and Hammer, which is to batter it down, and to cut it up for the fire.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, Conſider what it was the Church fled out of, when ſhe fled into the wilderneſſe. Was it not out of that Church-ſtate or building, which the Spirit of God had raiſed up for her here in the world, to which her ordinances and way of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip belonged? Was it not here that the Dragon aſſaulted her, and from whence ſhe fled into a deſolate place and ſtate?</p>
            <p>Secondly, What ſpirit entred into theſe, when ſhe fled out of them? Were not theſe the Conquerors ſpoils? did not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt get poſſeſſion of the form? did not the whore get the Spouſes attire? did not the Wolves gather up the ſheeps cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and cloath themſelves therewith? Was not the outward Court (what is the outward Court under the Goſpel, but the viſible Church-ſtate with the viſible Ordinances thereof?) given to the Gentiles, who trod under foot the holy City, all the while they were worſhipping in the outward Court? Rev: 11. 2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What ſpirit is it directs men to theſe, ſince the true Church hath been fled out of them? and to what intent? Is it not that ſpirit which would keep men from the life, that they might not be born of the barren womb in the wilderneſſe, but be born of ſome of the fruitful wombs of the viſible Churches, while the true Church is inviſible, and hath no viſible place in the earth, but remains in that place in the wilderneſſe which God prepared for her, and where ſhe receiveth her food all the 42 Months? Rev: 12. ver: 6. &amp; 14.</p>
            <p>I have ſmarted deeply for theſe things, and have been taught by the bryars and thorns of the wilderneſſe, whereby my ears came to be opened, to hear the ſound of the everlaſting Goſpel, to which they were before through ignorance ſtopped. For I alſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115387:29"/>
did beleeve and expect great things in a Church ſtate and way of worſhip; and in ſimplicity of heart did I enter into it, and walke in it, and was not without knowledge, warmth and experiences there. But all this the Lord broke down by a ſtrong hand in one moment, and hath taught me ſince to throw away all my gains here and elſewhere, and to count them but droſſe and dung, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord. And having taſted, having ſeen, having felt, having handled, I cannot but commend the life, and diſſwade all men from all knowledge, all worſhip, all Religion, all wayes and practiſes (though never ſo taking, pleaſant, and promiſing) out of the life. And this is to know Chriſt, namely, to know the life: and this is to obey Chriſt, to obey the life: and this is the kingdom of Chriſt which is to come, to have the life reign in power and great glory. But the knowing or beleeving of an Hiſtory concerning Chriſt, this is not the knowledge or the faith: Antichriſt all along the apoſtacy, in all his various forms and dreſſes, hath known and beleeved thus: and this kind of knowledge muſt paſſe away, further then it can find a place and ſervice in the life. Be not angry at my teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it flows from pure love, and comes forth in great good will to your ſouls.</p>
            <p>Yea if it be poſſible that I might be a little ſerviceable to you (for my ſoul travels for the redemption of profeſſors from the witchery of the whoriſh ſpirit, even of ſuch as are ready to revile that which alone can redeem them) in the meekneſs and coolneſs of your ſpirits, out of the fiery falſe zeal, conſider yet a little further theſe few things following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſtate of the Goſpel is an inviſible ſtate, a ſtate conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of inviſible things (as the Law was a viſible ſtate, or a ſtate conſiſting of viſible things) The light inviſible, the life inviſible, the power inviſible, that which converts inviſible, that which is converted inviſible, that which it is converted to inviſible, and the whole courſe ofſpiritual life lyes in the inviſible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This inviſible ſtate hath a viſible way of appearance to the world, by garments which it wears, by motions and exerciſes which the life chooſeth for itto appear in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe garments are ſubject to corrupt, and to be worn by that which is corruptible and corrupted. That which hath not the life, may put on the garment; and that which hath loſt the life, may ſtil keep the garment.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:115387:29"/>
4. The preſervation of the life lyes not in the garment, or in the obſervation of any thing wherein the life did once appeare; but the preſervation of the garment lyes in the life. And the life may change it's garment at it's pleaſure, and may refuſe to wear thoſe any more, which the whore hath worn, but as the life again leadeth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When the life is at any time loſt, the only way of recovery, is by retiring to the inviſible, and keeping there, and growing up there, and not coming forth in the viſible further then the life leads, nor ſtaying there any longer then the life ſtayes.</p>
            <p>Now this is the miſtake of perſons generally, they look for the finding the inviſible life in viſibles. They run to corrupted or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and wayes of devotion, and think to find God there; but do not wait to feel him in their hearts, and to be led by him into what he pleaſeth: and to ſtay no where any longer, then while he ſtayeth there, but to follow the Lamb whereſoever he goeth.</p>
            <p>Some others miſtake in running to that, and waiting there where they once felt life, but do not know the way to wait on the life it ſelfe: and ſo they are running to an image, waiting at an image, worſhipping of an image, and the living God will not meet them there. But throw away your images, let <hi>Ephraim</hi> the dear child ſay to his idols get you hence, thruſt away your adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries which provoke the eye of Gods jealouſie, receive the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner (the ſevere purifyer) into your boſoms, and let the fire of his jealouſie cleanſe your hearts, and the pure will ſoon come after, and lodge again between your breaſts: Can ye hear this ſound? That which is born of the ſame wiſdome, cannot but hear it: but the other birth muſt have it's ear ſtopped.</p>
            <p>Now hearken to this advice. When the inviſible life is felt and known, doe not diſdain to follow it into what ever viſible thing it leads. Let not thy wiſdom be judge what the life will lead into, or what the life is to be followed in; but let the life it ſelfe be judge: and let the child, which is born of the life, follow it ſingly without murmuring, without diſputing. The life hath fooliſh wayes (to the eye of thy wiſdom) of breaking the wiſdom in thee which is contrary to it, which thy wiſdom will be reaſoning and diſputing againſt, and if that wiſdom be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, the life is overturned in its courſe, and the head of the

Serpent remains ſound in thee, which the fooliſh and weak things (which the wiſdom of God chooſeth to croſſe and diſturb it by) would help to break and cruſh.</p>

            <head>An Exhortation to the preſent Powers.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>BAbylon</hi> the great, the miſtery of iniquity, which hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and held captive the whole Chriſtian world, for theſe many generations, under forms and appearances of Godlineſs and devotion, is at length come into remembrance before God, who is ariſen to judge her, and overturn her ſeat. The Army hath been preparing, and many Souldiers have been drawn forth, the trumpet hath ſounded, the battel is begun, and blood hath been ſhed on both ſides; the blood of the creature on the one ſide, the blood of the whoriſh ſpirit on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>The whore (with the power of the beaſt on which ſhe rides, and by whoſe ſtrength and aſſiſtance ſhe makes war with the Lamb) is mighty and dreadful; and it hath long been ſaid, <hi>Who is able to make war with the beaſt?</hi> (whoſe ſtrength is hers.) But the Lord God (who hath ariſen out of his holy habitation to judge, and hath begun to judge her) is more mighty, by whoſe arm &amp; ſtrength ſhe ſhal fal, &amp; the beaſt ſhall not be able to carry her up and down any longer, nay nor to uphold her in her ſeat of government over the conſciences of men.</p>
            <p>Be wiſe now therefore, and conſider the preſent ſtate of things: and if ye find not hearts to help the Lord againſt the mighty, yet take heed of helping the mighty againſt the Lord. The veſſels, wherein the life ariſes and appears, are poor and very contemptible, and ye may eaſily trample upon them: but the life which riſeth up in them, is very precious, and too ſtrong for the powers either of earth or of hel. The Lord did not appear formerly among you, or of late begin to raiſe you up again, that ye ſhould become enemies to him, or aiders of his enemies againſt him, but that ye might let his ſeed go forth to worſhip him in the wilderneſſe: (for in this dark Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.) Therefore break the yoaks, and take off the burdens, an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>er there be no new ſnares laid, but leave the conſcience (where the Lord chooſeth to appear, &amp; which he delights to draw out of the world to himſelfe) free to the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath kindled, and is kindling the fire, with which he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115387:30"/>
is burning, and wil burn the fleſh of the whore. Come not neer to help her, leſt ye feel the flames. Stand afarre off, and ſee her burning, and at moſt pity her, but help her not.</p>
            <p>We fight not againſt the fleſh and blood of creatures, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that evil ſpirit which captivates, and makes them miſerable: nor do we fight with carnal weapons, but with ſuch weapons as are able to reach that Spirit. Now if ye interpoſe with your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weapons, and ſmite the veſſel which the Lord is pleaſed to make uſe of in this warfare, his hand will be upon you: yea if ye endeavour to bear off the ſtroak from the whore, it will light upon your ſelves, and the Lords hand (and his ſtroaks in this day of his jealouſie and vengeance) is very heavy.</p>
            <p>Do what ye can, ye ſhall not be able to hinder the Lords victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (who will overcome, even by this very people, whom the wiſe of all ſorts deſpiſe:) all that ye can doe in taking part with the enemy, is but to bring wounds and judgements upon your ſelves, and to ſhorten the dayes of your government: but the worke of the Lord will go on and proſper; and this painted harlot (which pretends to be the Spouſe of Chriſt, and has deckt her ſelf ſo pleaſingly with her ſtollen knowledge of Scriptures, and layes claim to his Miniſtry and Ordinances) ſhall be ſtripped naked, and her ſhame ſeen, and every child in the life ſhall be able to point at her, and the ſong of triumph over the Dragon, the beaſt, the falſe Churches, and all the falſe Prophets (who are not made, nor propheſie not by the anointing) ſhall be ſung in righteouſnes, even to the Lamb who dayly getteth, and will get perfect victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for to him it is given, over all his enemies.</p>

            <p>THe redemption of the ſoul is by the Spirit of the Lord, which he that would enjoy from it, muſt know its appearance and operation in himſelf, and not quench or limit it, but univerſally be ſubject to its guidance and leadings. All mans inward miſery ariſes from mans inward rebellion, which is as the ſin of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft (ſpringing from the ſpirit of witchcraft:) his recovery and happineſs is in the faith and in the obedience to the pure power, movings, and operations of the Spirit in him.</p>
            <p>The Lord God who made all mankind, who is the Lord of all, he is redeeming a people to himſelfe by his Spirit. And this
<pb facs="tcp:115387:31"/>
Spirit will not be limited by the powers of the earth, but will break Nations in pieces, and trample upon Princes as Mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay, til it hath made its way through them.</p>
            <p>O open the eye, the inward eye, which can diſcern the ſeaſons! It is not now the time for Antichriſt to prevail, or for proud fleſh to riſe up in its heady will to ſtop the outgoings of its maker. This ſeaſon is paſt; and the ſeaſon of the prevailing of the life, and power of the Son of righteouſneſſe is now come.</p>
            <p>Therefore lift up your heads, O ye weak and faint of the flock, for iniquity and oppreſſion muſt fall both within and without, and the tender God of everlaſting love will turn back the captivity of his people, and of his creatures. Be not therefore affrighted at the inward power of ſin in the heart, nor at the outward oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing powers of the earth: for the redeemers ſtrength is above all, and he is ſtretching forth his mighty arm to ſave: in the true, and living faith of the elect it is felt, it is felt.</p>
            <p>And O ye potſheards of the earth, ſtrive not with your maker, limit him not, for he wil aſſuredly break through you. Think not to ſubject him to your Laws, but learn his Law, come under his yoake, and be bound by him, that ye may taſt of his liberty. Waſh your lips, and kiſſe the Son, and be not angry at his, various appearances ſo contrary to your wiſdome, but fear his dreadful name, and his threſhing inſtrument which hath teeth, and ſeek an hiding place under the ſhadow of his wings, againſt the ſharp ſeaſon of the breaking forth of his wrath, and jealous indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the cauſe of <hi>Sion</hi> which haſtneth apace.</p>
            <p>He hath long let the Spirit of <hi>Babylon</hi> have its liberty, and his hath been ſilent: now is the time for his Spirit to ſpeak, and for <hi>Babylous</hi> to be ſilent. Wil ye ſtil force him to ſilence, and open <hi>Babylons</hi> mouth? Will ye not ſuffer him to ſpeak, but according to the Laws and orders of <hi>Babylon?</hi> Muſt that counterfeit Queen ſtil ſit on the Throne among you, and the true Princeſſe be made her ſervant? O let it not be grievous to you, to ſee the Spirit of the Lord ariſe, and make <hi>Babylon</hi> appear <hi>Babylon!</hi> Her wiſdom, her knowledge, her unity, her uniformity, her order, her come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, her beauty, is but folly, confuſion, diſorder and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before the Lord. happy is the eye that ſees it, and the foot that turns from her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115387:31"/>
Therefore awake, ariſe and ſtand up from the dead, come out of the thick dark Land, where the pure God of life is not to be found: <hi>Come out of Babylon, and touch not the unclean,</hi> that the pure life may receive you into unity with it ſelfe: but the ſpirit that is unpurged from its <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> worſhips and practiſes, the Lord will not ſuffer to come neer him. Therefore ſearch what is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of <hi>Babylon</hi> in all your wayes and worſhips; and wait on the Spirit of the Lord to be redeemed out of it, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it, or ye muſt remain ſeparated from the Lord, and not partake of his life and vertue, from which that City (with all her inhabitants) is ſhut out for ever.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath had a ſore controverſie with this Nation (with her Rulers, her teachers and people) for his ſeeds ſake, which he hath been begetting to himſelf, and calling forth to worſhip him (according to the pure Law of his ſpirit of life) out of the wayes, worſhips, and Heatheniſh cuſtoms of the earthly ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> is his firſt born, whom he will not have any longer kept in bondage. They are his own, of his own begetting and forming, of his own nouriſhing and bringing up, the plants of his own right hand, whom he watereth with the dews of Heaven, and with the ſhowrs of his everlaſting mercy and loving kindneſs; whom he hath gathered by the arm of his power, and whom he leadeth and defendeth by his cloud and pillar of fire, over whom he is tender as of the apple of his eye. They are his anointed ones, whom he will not have touched, but rebuketh Kings and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, Armyes and Councils for their ſakes, ſaying, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have ye not ſeen, how no ſtrength nor Council hath been able to prevail againſt them? They have had no fence, but the arm which hath gathered them. What plottings and contrivings hath there been againſt them? How are they as ſheep appointed for the ſlanghter, deſtinated to be devoured, cruſhed, and trodden under foot? what divinations and inchantments have been uſed againſt them, even to blot out their name and remembrance from the earth?</p>
            <p>But why do ye ſtrive and contend thus with the God of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob?</hi> can ye proſper? He that made the earth, will not ye let him have room therein for his people? Muſt they be ſubject to your wils? Muſt they bow to your image? ſhall not the God

of the ſpirits of all fleſh, have the command of the ſpirits of his own people? can ye ſtop the Spirit of God from breathing upon them? or will ye fal foul upon them, if they be obedient to the breathings and movings of his Spirit? May it not ſuffice that they are innocent, and harmleſs among you in their converſations and practiſes, but will ye ſtill Lord it over their conſciences? will ye put the Lord to it to the very laſt, to try it out with you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can defend his people and make way for their liberty?</p>
            <p>Wel, If peace be taken from you, if your rulers, laws, and governments be broken in peices, if his hand be ſtretched forth againſt you, if he curſe your very bleſſings, whom can ye blame? Why do you provoke him againſt your own ſouls? are ye ſtronger then he? If ye be ſtronger and wiſer, ye may prevail: but if he be ſtronger, and will put forth his arm, his people ſhall be ſaved and find a ſhelter in him, in the midſt of all that wrath which is powring down upon you. Your peace hath been length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out for their ſakes, <hi>If it had not been for their ſakes</hi> (for the remnant which the Lord hath had to gather) <hi>ye had ere this been as Sodom, and like unto Gomorrah.</hi> The Land is ful of filthineſſe, which the Lords ſoul loaths; and inſtead of drawing forth the ſword againſt it, ye draw it forth againſt his witneſſes. There is liberty enough for ſin and vanity, for exceſs and riotouſneſſe, for images and idols: but to worſhip God in Spirit, to obey his pure movings, this kindles your rage, and theſe are the people who are a burthen to you. Ah how fain would ye eaſe you of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! <hi>(Sion</hi> is indeed a burthenſome ſtone, and will fall heavy on all that meddle with her) But the Lord will eaſe himſelfe of the adverſaries of his life and Spirit, and he will bring forth his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which he hath prepared, and ſet it up in the earth, and none ſhall be able to ſtop him. Therefore gather your ſelves together in battel; aſſociate your ſelves, that ye may be broken in peices; take council together, it ſhall come to nought; ſpeak the word, it ſhall not ſtand: but the Lords council ſhall ſtand, and he will fulfil all his pleaſure, and will delight himſelfe in his people, and raiſe them up by the fall of their enemies: and then ye ſhall ſee againſt whom ye have plotted and contended, and what ye have helped to bring about by all your ſecret plots and deſigns <hi>If the Lord had not been on our ſide, now may Iſrael ſay:</hi> if the Lord had not been on our ſide, what had become of his poor

people! Ah poor worm <hi>Jacob,</hi> how often would the foot of pride have trampled thee down (again and again) had not the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting arm been ſtretched out for thee! But fear not worm <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor be not ſollicitous for thy preſervation, but truſt that arm which delighteth to preſerve thee.</p>
            <p>Ah fooliſh people and unwiſe! who ſtrive againſt your own mercy, who ſee not upon what hinge all your mercies hang, but make it your work to break down the Wall that defends you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the City of the great King, which is coming down from heaven, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> is his people, and both muſt have a place in the earth: the Lord hath determined it, and who can withſtand it? what prejudice can <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the inhabitants thereof bring unto you? They are enemies indeed to this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate of things, and would have all brought in ſubjection to the life and power of their King, and all that ſtands in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God brought down, and made pliable to his ſpirit; and this the unyoked earthly ſpirit cannot bear. But this is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of your ſouls, and the way to unity with that life which is their happineſs, peace, and reſt for ever: for if ye could paſs through the fire, and bear the burning up of your droſs, ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo might become veſſels for the Finer, and might dwell with them in their everlaſting habitation.</p>
            <p>The Saints formerly had an entrance miniſtred to them into the everlaſting Kingdom, and came to mount <hi>Sion</hi> which cannot be removed, and to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the City of the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. where the blood of ſprinkling, the peace that paſſeth underſtanding, the everlaſting righteouſneſs, and the joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory was witneſſed in the renewed ſpirit, which receiveth the Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the everlaſting reſt.</p>
            <p>And this is again revealed, and the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

And his City ſhall be a quiet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, free from all the noiſe and hurry of <hi>Babylon;</hi> where the pure river of life runs clear, free from all the mud and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and the Lord God of infinite fulneſs will not

diſdain communion with his creatures, but will tabernacle among them, dwell with them, ſup with them, walk in them, and take them into his holy habitation, and they ſhall dwell with him, ſup with him, and walk in him.</p>
            <p>But who ſhall abide in his tabetnacle? who ſhall dwell in his holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſpeaketh the truth in? his heart, &amp;c. he who contemns the vile perſon (how great and high ſoever) but honoreth them that fear the Lord, be they otherwiſe what they will. This man ſhall dwell on high, above the reach of all low, creeping, dark ſpirits, even in that holy habitation of life and power, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can touch or annoy.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude with a few words concerning the preſent eſtate of this poor diſtracted Nation.</p>
            <p>This Nation hath long lain wounded and ſick: She hath had many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians (on whom ſhe hath ſpent much) who have promiſed her fair, but have not effected her cure. Of late her wound hath been much enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea ſhe is become ſick at her very heart, and in great danger. Many are ſpending their judgement upon her, ſome thinking a King would help all, ſome a Parliament, and ſome hoping for good from the Army; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very eye ſees her caſe to be very deſperate. Ah <hi>England, England,</hi> Thou ſtriveſt with thy Maker, and he overturns thy ſtrength and councils. The life and wiſdom which thou deſpiſeſt, is that which alone can heal thee. Thou ſtriveſt to keep off the ſtrokes from the enemies of God, and ſmiteſt his dear ones, how can he ſpare thee? Hand ſtils joyn in hand to keep the Lords ſtroke from reaching <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he hath directed at her heart, and will not miſs her, but will peirce through every thing that ſtands in his way. Though the cry hath long been, <hi>Hurt not the tender conſcience,</hi> it is that on which God works, and wherein he chuſeth to appear, and with which he is pleaſed, and pitties. Many promiſes have been touching li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience, yet ſtill the meek of the earth, the innocent lambs of Chriſt (thoſe that are faithful to the light of God in their conſciences) are perſecuted and ſuffer. What canſt thou plead, O <hi>England,</hi> why the Lord ſhould not break thee all in peices, and ſave his people himſelf, by and in the midſt of thy ruins. The Lord will have the victory over thee in this particular, about which he hath ſo long ſtriven with thee. It would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and eaſier for thee to yield unto, then be forced by his hand. Therefore at length hear his voice, which hath ſo oſten and ſo loud cryed unto thee. <hi>Let my people go, that they may ſerve me.</hi>
