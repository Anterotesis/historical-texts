            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Cittizens perceiuing the Archdukes Campe to be néere hand, and trusting to be by their approach, better furthered and relieued, then afterwardes they found themselues, beganne to shewe themselues some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bolder then before, by diuers signes of brauerie, and some sallyes in the night vpon our Campe, howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it to their losse, for that they still lost more (by far) then we did, which is contrary to common chaunce, where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Before the enemies approach, the Cittizens kept themselues very quiet, and now hoping of rescue, they made sundry fires in the Citty to the Campe: the which out of the Archdukes Campe were answered with the like signes, without that ought else haue ensued therof.</p>
            <p>In the enemies Campe there is great want of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, by reason whereof, many <hi>Italians</hi> come ouer into
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18557:3"/>
his Excellencies Campe.</p>
            <p>The 18. of August there came aboue foure score <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> into our Campe, some of them were whole Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralships, with all their weapons and furniture: His Excellency vsing them very kindly, victuals them, and to euery man he giueth a Gilden in money, with a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to returne into <hi>Italy:</hi> with them hee sendes a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger to aduise the States, that where they passe, they should be victualled, and so sent forwards.</p>
            <p>At the same time the Cittizens made a salley vpon our Trenches, but being preuented and not daring to come on any farther then their owne counterscarpe, it is not knowne whether they lost any men or no.</p>
            <p>The 19. of August, there came againe into his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencyes quarter, aboue 150. of the enemyes reuolted Soldiers, most of them <hi>Italians,</hi> some of them with their weapons and furniture, and othersome without: they were all well vsed and each man giuen a Gilden in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and so shipt away.</p>
            <p>The 20. of August, there came ouer to our Campe, a Horse-man with his horse, and al his whole furniture, with two Horse-men without their horses: also two Spaniards which would receiue no Pasport, but wold remaine in his Excellencies seruice.</p>
            <p>The 21 of August, there was a Jesuite or Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Priest taken prisoner, and carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>At the same time there were brought nine prisoners which were taken in the skirmish néer vnto the Sconce which his Excellencie tooke from the enemy at his first comming before the Citty, being on the other side of the Mase. In this Sconce (whilst the enemy helde it) there was but a <hi>Corpes de Guarde,</hi> but it is now a stronge three square Sconce: howbeit, there is no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18557:4"/>
thereon, but onely one great murderer, which casteth balles of fire-worke into the Citty: also, they shoote great péeces of blewe square stone, and other great stones out of it: of such bignes, that a man (with all his power &amp; strength) is but able to lift one of them. These stones (making way wheresoeuer they fal) brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king through Churches and houses, the people doe cry very pittifully, when the said peece is shot off, which can easily be heard out of the said Sconce. The balles of fire which they shoote, are filled with Musket-shot, and doe lye still on the ground, about halfe a quarter of an houre before they worke: and then the flame is séene aboue al the houses of the Citty, insomuch (for as much as can be perceiued, and is most apparant and likely of truth) those of the Citty, doe more feare these fire balles and these great stones, which are shot out of the sayd Sconce, then all the rest of his Excellencies great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynance, which he hath in foure batteryes.</p>
            <p>Betwéene the 21. and 22. of August, the enemy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to put about 2000. men into the Citty, together with 400. horse, furnishing them al with ladders, deale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boords, shouels, pickaxes, and other instrumentes, to breake in vpon the Redu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The same night there was taken a horsemans boy, who was found swimming from the Citty, and was carryed before his Excellency, but they could gather nothing by him, because he shewed himselfe as if he had béen drunk or simple: and the selfe same night, the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

               <head>Extract of a Letter, written by a man of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship out of <hi>Nimingem,</hi> the fist of September, to his friend in London.</head>
               <p>WOrshipfull Sir, it was reported heere by some, that Sir <hi>Frances Ueare,</hi> being in a skirmish before the <hi>Graue</hi> (shot through the head) should haue dyed neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>reof, and was since said onely to be but hurt in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ck. Also, Captaine <hi>Meetkerek</hi> was dead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y wounded. The quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Regiment belonging vnto Sir <hi>Frances Veare</hi> in this Siedge, is giuen vnto Prince <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes yongest brother. The enemy lyeth betweene <hi>Uerb &amp; Ruremond,</hi> seeking by all meanes to assure those two towns with stronger Garrisons: but the townes would as fayne keepe them out, and enjoy a newtrall freedome: the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the siedge goe daily forward; his Princely Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency intending, not any more to put his Soldiers to the aduenture of any assaults, but endeuours to win the towne with Myning, (a costly and new winning of townes) for the towne is very stronge, and the shot doth but little harme vpon the walle. From this towne we can both heare the report, and see the smoake of the Artillery. In the Campe is good hope that it will be shortly recouered: I shal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture take occasion to goe see the Campe, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of others, that from hence doe dayly resort thether, both men, women and children, for the Campe is wonderfully well stored of victuals and other necessaries: hauing been there, I will as then relate further vnto you the true estate of all, as neere as I shall be able to collect them. Vntill which time I commit you to God.</p>
               <p>By letters of the 29. of August, according to our compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, there is certaine newes, that Sir <hi>Frances Veare</hi> was yet liuing, &amp; on the mending hand; howbeit his hurt was very sore and daungerous.</p>
