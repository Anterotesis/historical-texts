         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY Duty and Affection obliges me to Dedicate these Acts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
to your Lordships, because they are your own; I have
only been your Servant in Observing and Collecting them, and
am confident, they will serve for the Illustration and Vindication of your
Justice, and Faithfulness in your Service to the King and Kingdom, to whom
it cannot but be highly acceptable and satisfying to see, that in so long a tract
<pb facs="tcp:55692:3"/>
of time, you have kept so steady and equal a course in the Administration of
Justice with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>It hath been looked upon as the priviledge of Judges<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to bring in Causes to
be determined, in what order they thought fit, which gave occasion of great
Reverence to, and dependence upon them, and of gratifications to their Friends,
but your Lordships having found so much inconveniency to the Subjects, by
their tedious, expensive, and uncertain attendence, unavoidable in that way,
you did therefore willingly, and of your proper motion quite that Priviledge,
and ordered that all men should have dispatch in Justice, as their own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
put them in readiness to demand it, without pretence of complaint for
being postponed or delayed; and you gave the rise for interposing the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Parliament to that Order, which could not but avoid the suspition of
inequality, which did occur, while every Judge in his course, did choise at
discretion what Causes to hear, which were readily supposed to be these of his
Friends and Relations.</p>
            <p>As your Lordships have been equal in the Order, so these Decisions will
show that you have been impartial in the matter of Justice, and it will appear
that you have followed the same uniform Course of Justice, otherwise it had
been impossible for you to quadrat with your selves, if you had followed any
other Rule; for if personal Interest had great influence, it could not fail but
the same case, would have been diversly determined amongst different Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
The way of Truth and Justice is one, and never crosseth or just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth with
it self; but the way of Error and Partiality is infinite, and can never be long
consonant, and the pretence of varying upon differences in the cases will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be perceived, when these are not the true motives of Variation, nor can the
greatest caution keep former Cases so in memory, as not to fall in flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
in some length of time, when Justice is not the Rule; It was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that inconsistencies did occur, when former Decisions were but little
known, and were only Transmitted by uncertain Tradition, from the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Judges or Advocats, where a constant Custom was not introduced;
but in circumstantiat Cases, all the points of Fact, could not be so preserved, but
Pleaders would differ about them, and controvert whether the difference were
so material as to be the just motives of alteration; and if they should have recourse
<pb facs="tcp:55692:3"/>
to Records, they could thence have little remedy, seing many eminent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
came to be Transacted before any Act or Decreet thereupon were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
and though they were, yet the Motives upon which the Lords did
proceed were seldom decernable in the mass of Disputes. The contrarieties
that are remarked by the judicious and industrious Lord <hi>Dury</hi> (who did serve
and observe about the same length of time that I have done) are the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseable,
that before his time the Decisions of Session were not much marked,
and but in few hands, yea it was a long time before the Decisions observed by
<hi>Dury,</hi> were become common, and were cited by Pleaders, or noticed by
Judges.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to evite the clamours of Parties coming short of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when they are in heat and fervency carrying on their Cause, and when
they have heard the Wit and Eloquence of their Advocats, endeavouring to
make their Case, if not evidently just, at least probably such; but when that
fervour is cooled, upon second Thoughts, re-considering the Motives upon
which the Lords proceeded, if they see that they Decided not otherwise upon
the same Grounds, they cannot be so far wanting to their own quiet, as not to
acquiesce and rest satisfied, considering that their first Thoughts were in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and at best, were but the Conceptions of Parties, whose interest hath a
secret influence to byass their first Apprehensions, they could not but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that the private and particular opinion of Parties interressed, should
quietly cede to the Judgment of so many learned and experienced Judges, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other concernment in the event of the Cause, but that Justice might be
inviolable, and that no pernicious or dangerous preparative might be laid, to
the common detriment of all, and who by all the obligations whereof men
are capable, towards God, their Prince, Countrey and Posterity, are engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be careful and tender of Justice.</p>
            <p>It is the great interest of Mankind, that every man should not be Judge in
his own Cause, but that there should be indifferent Judges, <hi>of good report,
men of courage, fearing God, and hating covetousness,</hi> who might hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the Controversies of Parties, which necessarly doth imply, that either
Party should acquiesce in the publick judgment of Authority.</p>
            <p>It is amongst the greatest interests of Mankind, that they may securely enjoy
<pb facs="tcp:55692:4"/>
their Rights and Possessions, being free from fear to be over-reached, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
without remedy; which can not be attained, unless their Rights be
lodged in the hands of just and judicious Judges, wherein at first they could
have little more to rest on, but the Reputation that their Judges were such,
nor could the Judges then have any other Rule then <hi>bonum &amp; equum,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the discretion of good men, and therefor did differ little from Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
until they came to have fixed Customs and Statutes, clear and known,
which could not come the length of a sufficient Rule for all Cases, for there
will ever be new Cases occurring; and therefore the best expedient to give
this most desireable Security, is, to show that Judges do alwayes proceed suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to themselves without interfeiring; and that they make not Law like the
<hi>Delphick</hi> Sword, bowing or bending to the several Parties, but as a firm and
stable Rule, which will ply to no obliquity, but whatever must be regulate
by it, must be applyed to it, and be straight like it, and so quadrat one to
another, which can be no way better known, than by the publishing and
comparing of Decisions, whereby it may be seen, that like Cases have like
events, and that there is no respect of persons in Judgment; all men cannot be
Lawers, nor can the most part have discretion enough to understand <hi>aequum
&amp; bonum;</hi> yet few will be found to want capacity to compare Decisions,
and so perceive if they be congruous and uniform, and if they find them such,
they may easily be perswaded, that their uniformity could be by no other
Rule than Law, and Justice.</p>
            <p>It is no small prejudice to any Nation, to make them believe or suspect that
their Rights are not secured in just hands, for that overturns their quiet and
security. The most part will never have a Pursuit determined against them,
and far fewer will find themselves worsted by personal considerations, But
no man can say but he may, and most do fear that they shall be involved in
Law Suits, and if they be not perswaded to find a sure Remedy by just and
knowing Iudges, then all is unsecure and disquieted, so that it is more the
advantage of a Nation that their Judges were but reputed just, though they
were not, then that they were just, yet were reputed unjust, for this Case
toucheth and grieveth all, whereas the former can reach but a few.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, who Institute the Colledge of Justice, Ordered one of
the Lords to keep a Journal of their Decisions, with which <hi>Henry Sinclar</hi> Dean
<pb facs="tcp:55692:4"/>
of <hi>Rastalrig</hi> was entrusted, and did observe the same for the space of ten years, as
<hi>Maitland, Hadingtoun, Hope, Balfour, Spotswood, Dury,</hi> and several others since
have done; And after Our Sacred Soveraign who now Reigns, did Restore
the Colledge of Justice to it's ancient Constitution and Splendor, and did
make a full Nomination of the Senators thereof; and Call most of the
Eminent Advocats to the Bench, so that after a long interruption, the Session
was almost wholly new, therefor it was very necessary that their Decisions
should be Observed, which induced me (being one of that Nomination) to
undertake that Task, which I did constantly follow, making up this Journal
of all the Decisions that had any thing of difficulty or importance in them,
which I did design to leave behind me, as a Token of my most devoted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to that excellent Society, <hi>The Colledge of Iustice,</hi> in which, with much
satisfaction I spent the far greatest part of my Life, and was very happy in
the mutual affection of my Colligues, both while I was at the Bar, and on
the Bench, yet the weight of the Charge I did bear, (which in a few years
sunk my Predecessor Sir <hi>Iohn Gilmour,</hi> though a man of great strength of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Spirit, when he undertook that Office) made me consider, that it was fit
for me, before Age or Infirmity should make that burden more uneasie, to have
some remnant of my Life, of which I might be Master, without Diversion, for
which some of your Lordships and others knew my Resolution to retire long
agoe; and therefore I did propose to your Lordships the publishing of these
Decisions wherein I have your allowance and approbation.</p>
            <p>I shall need to say nothing as to these Decisions in behalf of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
I hope the Matter will speak more for your Honour, than to need any
thing further from me; I might say great things of that Judicature, and of
your selves particularly, but I shall forbear, least any should think it might
look like flattery, and therefore shall only add a little for my self.</p>
            <p>I did not pick out such Decisions as I liked best, leaving out others which
might have showen contrariety; nor did I express my opinion when diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the plurality, but I had ever that Deference to your Judgement,
that I did not omit any thing that was said for it, much less did I magnifie my
own opinion against it, though I cannot say that I did oft differ from it.</p>
            <p>I did form this Breviat of these Decisions, in fresh and recent Memory, <hi>de
die in diem</hi> as they were pronunced; I seldom eat, before I Observed the
Interlocutors I judged of difficulty, that past that day, and when I was hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any extraordinary occasion, <hi>I</hi> delayed no longer then that was over. It
was neither feazable nor fit that <hi>I</hi> should set down the large Pleadings, or the
Written Informations of Parties, <hi>I</hi> did peruse them throughly, and pitched
<pb facs="tcp:55692:5"/>
upon the Reasons which were of moment, as to the points determined, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the same Informations, there were many obvious clear Points insisted on,
which I omitted.</p>
            <p>I did alwayes relate the Case as it was proposed or resumed to the Lords,
and with the important Reasons offered by Parties, I added these which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
to the Lords in their Deliberations; so that all the Reasons and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
upon which the Lords proceeded, will neither be found in Parties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
nor Clerks Minuts, for though it was not fit for the Lords to
suggest any Point of Fact not alleadged by Parties: Yet it was most proper
for them to supply the Points of Law arising from the Fact proposed. And
in such a Breviat it is not to be expected that I should at large set down the
Elegant and Eloquent Disputes of the Lawers, but that I should express the
Matter and Moment of their Reasons, with the greatest plainness and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that I could.</p>
            <p>It is like, some of my Colligues may have observed other Cases than these,
and in these, may have worded Interlocutors otherwise, and adduced some
other Reasons, which cannot at all weaken the Credit of these, for some
Decisions were past when I kept my Course in the Outter-House, and others
were Reported long after the Informations were given, which might escape
me, and many I thought of no such intricacy or importance, as made them
fit to be published, but I do with all sincerity and confidence assert, that I
did omit none I found of difficulty, upon any design to cover inconsistencies,
or any other end of that kind, nor is it of import what the words were, if the
Matter were truly exprest; for no Observer did ever look into the Clerks
Minuts, and different Observers will not alwayes have the same Opinion of
the importance of Reasons, nor will find themselves obliged to adduce all the
Reasons proposed: Neither have I Recorded any Decisions but what was
determined while I was present, being resolved to take nothing at a second
hand.</p>
            <p>These Decisions were Written with many different hands, but all of them
were then in my Family, and some of them understood not the Matter, by
which, and the haste I was forced oftimes to put them to, there was much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct,
but I did expect that I might have been present, and have overseen the
Press my self; I began to cause Transcribe them with a better hand, and did
consider whether it were not fit to amplifie and embellish the Disputes so, as
might have been expected from so pregnant and eloquent Pleaders, as our
time hath afforded, who have been nothing short of their Predecessors, but
<hi>I</hi> thought that this would look too like a new Frame from my own Fancy or
Memory, after so long a time, and therefore I resolved they should be keept
<pb facs="tcp:55692:5"/>
as they were at first Written, and if so they prove uniform, as it will be a
great evidence of your Lordships Justice, so it will be a strong proof that
they are sincere and authentick, having been Written on the several <hi>Sede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt</hi>
dayes, for more then twenty years together; and therefore I do int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat
the favour, that what is uncorrect may be excused and supplied from the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>I had the best opportunity to make these Observations, being scarce a day
absent in any of these Sessions wherein <hi>I</hi> have marked them from the first of <hi>Iune</hi>
1661. until the first of <hi>August</hi> 1681. And <hi>I</hi> was not one day absent from the
thirteenth of <hi>Ian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be constant President of the Session in place of my Lord <hi>Craigmiller,</hi> who
had then demitted, except the Summer Session 1679. when I attended His
Majesty by His own Command, during all which time, I hope your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
will bear me Witness that <hi>I</hi> never used Arrogance or Insolence, or the
least reproachful or bitter expression against any of the number; and <hi>I</hi> do
with great thankfulness acknowledge that <hi>I</hi> could not have expected more
kindness and respect than <hi>I</hi> found from your Lordships, which made me in
gratitude take this Opportunity to testifie the Honour and Value I have
for that honourable Society, and that <hi>I</hi> am in great sincerity,</p>

Iune 6. 1661.</head>
               <p>THE Lords taking to their serious consideration, of how dangerous
consequence the alteration of Formes and Customes is; They have
therfore ordained, and hereby ordain all Summonds which formerly

thereon, as was in use to be done before the Year 1651, not exceeding
the Rates and Prices formerly exacted. And also, considering that during
the Power of the late Usurpers, the use and custome of writing in Latine
was then discharged, by the pretended Commissioners for Administration
of Justice: Therefore the saids Lords ordain all Charters, Seasings,
and other Writes of that nature, alswell such as pass the Seals, as other ways,
which were in use to be formed and written in Latine, to be continued in
the same Language as formerly, before the Year 1652. And to the effect

consideration, That the custom of the Clerks in the Usurpers time
of giving back to the Parties the Principal Bonds, Contracts, and
other Writes, given in to be registrat, did tend to the hazard and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the Leidges, and was contrary to the practise formerly observed.
They do therefore ordain, that the Clerks of Session, and all Clerks of
Inferiour Courts and Judicatories, shall henceforth keep and retain the
Principal Writes (for which they shall be answerable and give forth only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
thereof as formerly, before the Year 1651.) and ordains these Presents

when they had the said alteration of the former Custom, under their

his Deputes should be prejudged of their dues, and profits formerly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the said distinct warrands for Citation, are in effect, and upon the matter,
two several Summons, and are equivalent to Summons, Acts and Letter,
and have the same effect to all intents: and the profits formerly arising
from all Acts of Continuation, and Letters thereupon, are a considerable
part of the Dues belonging to the Lord Secretare, Lord Register, and his
Deputs, for their Incouragement, and Service in their respective Offices<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and upon the considerations foresaid, it was resolved. That notwithstand,ing,
the said alteration, the same should be continued, and secured to them,
in manner after mentioned. Therefore, and in order to their satisfaction:
The Lords of Session does Statute and Ordain, That for the Signing of all
Summons, which formerly did abide continuation; and in lieu thereof,
shall now, and hereafter continue the said warrands for two several Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

benefite thereby, when they carry any provision of Victual, or other Counterband
Goods to the Ports of Our Enemies, or when they have Goods belonging to Enemies
on Board. As to the other part of the Letter, it was deliberatly thought fit in the
Council of <hi>England,</hi> That any number of the Dutch Nation being found aboard,
should not confiscat Ship and goods, as it did during the last War, and therefore,
that Article was kept out of the Rules, which were given to the Court of Admiralty
here in <hi>England.</hi> But if any part of the Ship belong to any Inhabiting within

Probation: and seing it will be a great prejudice to the Leiges, if after

should be permitted to to offer new alledgances, not formerly insisted on in the

where the Parties Pursuer, or Defender are, before answer to the relevancy
burdened with the Probation of any point: they shall have the same Terms,

but if in the same Acts, any point be found relevant, and admitted to

declare, that where any Alledgance, or Reply is founded upon Writs, and
that before Answer there to, the Writs are ordained to be produced, in case
the Party burthened with the producing of these Writs shall fail therein and
thereupon the Term shall be circumduced against him, that the alledgance,

the Lords would allow him the same priviledge, which is assumed by the Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor

poor, and not able to satisfie the saids Expenses; Therefore, the saids Lords
do Authorize, and allow the Magistrates of Burghs, to set at Liberty out of
their Tolbooths, Persons imprisoned for Debt, by vertue of Letters of Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon production of a sufficient discharge of the Debt, granted by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,

merks <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Prisoner be not arrested at the Instance of other Parties,
the Magistrats, or Keeper of the Tolbooth, being always careful to keep an
Extract of the said discharge; and finds no necessity, in this Case of a Charge
to set at Liberty. But if the sum, for which the Debitor is Incarcerat, exceed
two hundred merks <hi>Scots,</hi> the Lords discharge the Magistrats of the Burgh to
Liberat him out of Prison, without a Suspension, and Charge to set at liberty

               <head>ACT concerning Bills of Suspension.
November 9. 1630.</head>
               <p>THE Lords considering, that by former <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> of the 9. of
<hi>February</hi> 1675. and the 3. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1677, They did give Warrant to
the Ordinary upon the Bills, to allow a sight of a Bill of Suspension, to
the Charger, and to stop Execution for some time, not exceeding a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
declaring also, that a Bill of Suspension signed by the Ordinary,
though not expeded at the Signet, should import a stop of Execution for
the space of fourteen dayes, from the date it was signed, that in the mean
time sufficient Caution might be found, and that the Clerk of the Bills
might enquire anent the condition of the Cautioner. And now finding that
abuses have crept in, stops being procured from several Ordinaries, from
time to time, and that when the first fourteen dayes after, a signed Bill were
elapsed, a new one was presented and past, which stopped Execution for
other fourteen dayes, and so might continue for a long time. Therefore the
Lords do declare, that they will give no stops of Execution hereafter, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Bills of Suspension, fourteen dayes from the date being a sufficient time,
both for seeing and expeding the Bill. And Declares all other stops to be
void, except where Causes are ordained by the Lords, to be Discust upon
Bills; and ordains the Clerk of the Bills to make a Minut-book, both of
past and refused Bills, by the Alphabetick Order of the Parties sirnames,
which he is to make patent to any Charger that shall desire to see the
same, <hi>gratis,</hi> and discharges him to present any new Bills in that Cause
except to the whole Lords in time of Session, or to three Lords in time of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance,
as he will be answerable at his peril; and because Parties, or their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators,
are accustomed to procure Suspensions, upon pretence, that the Copy
of the Charge given by the Messenger is general, or unformal; and for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
thereof, do produce forged Copies, and sometime forged Writes,
for instructing Reasons of Suspension, founded thereupon, never intending
to make use of the same; and therefore do suffer Protestations to pass. For
remeid whereof, the Lords do declare, that if the Charger shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
such a Suspension, or a duplicat thereof, under the hand of the
Keeper of the Signet, that in that case, the Lords, besides the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
expenses of Protestation, will modifie large Expenses to the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
for his delay; and in case Protestation shall not be admitted but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55692:29"/>
the Suspension shal come to be Discust: and at the Discussing the Charge,
or other Writes mentioned in the Reason of Suspension, be not produced:
The Lords Declares, they will hold these Writes false and sorged, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie

<hi>Iames Tailzifer</hi> having Right to the Reversion of

a Loch, which fell into the Water of <hi>Etrick,</hi> and thence into the
Water of <hi>Tweed,</hi> which had given a red Tinctur to all the River to the
Sea, most noysom to the Salmond, which were found never to swime
where the said Tinctur was, but in other clearer places of the VVater,
all the Salmond Fishing was prejudged to a great sum, to the detriment of
the Countrey, and the Kings Customes; Therefore desiring that he might
be ordained to desist and cease: The <hi>Parliament</hi> remitted the Bill to
the <hi>Lords.</hi> It was alleadged for the Defender, that the Bill was
not Relevant, because of any alleadged prejudice of the Pursuers, to take
away from the Defender his undoubted Right of Propertie, giving him
power to dispose of his own at his own pleasure. And so to drain his Loch,
or to cut his own ground, especially seing His <hi>Majesty,</hi> by His Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
having invited all His Subjects to drayning. The Pursuer answered,
that his Petition was most Relevant, and no ways contrair to the Right and
Effect of Propertie, which giveth the Proprietar power to dispose of his
own, so that he keep him within his own bounds, and do not send
forth any noisom thing upon his Neighbours, but he may not do so
to his Neighbours detriment, especially if he make use of that which is his
own, not according to the nature and common use thereof, but
against the same, and so though he may build upon his own ground,
albeit to the detriment of his Neighbours light or prospect, or may
dig a Well in his own ground, albeit thereby he cut off the veins of his
neighbours well, yet can he not otherwise prejudge his neighbours,
as if he had a Loch on a Hill, he might not cut it, if it drowned his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ground below, nor may he build a Milne upon his own ground, so
as to take the the water from his Neighbours Milne, nor may he turn the water
out of the old Channel, or make it rune other wayes upon his Neighbours,
then was accustomed. In like manner, in Superiour and Inferiour Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Town, The Superiour may not be made use of, to the detriment of
the Inferiour, nor the Inferiour to the detriment of the Superiour, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Fire on the Floor, which would smoak the same. The like is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by many Interdicts in the Civil Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
might not contrair to the nature of a Loch, which hath perpetually been
a Loch, do any deed beginning within his own Bounds, but ending in a
publick River, to the detriment of the Fishing; which is worth more then

might not make use of his own, to emit any thing upon his Neighbours
propertie contrare to Nature, to his Neighbours Detriment, as in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
alledged, they did not meet with this case, because here he offered
him to prove, That his Loch had a perpetual Current to the water of <hi>Et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi>
which made a Milne go, and when his drayning was done (which
would be shortly) the Current to the River would be as little, and as
pure as ever, so that albeit there was Detriment, it was but Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,

nor was he working contrary Nature, but helping it, by redding
the passage, to let the Loch run quickly away. 2dly. Albeit he might
make no new work on his own ground, to the Detriment of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Propertie, yet might he well send away any stagnant water, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
or filth, by a publick River, whereof one prime use is to purge
the earth of all corruption, and to carry it to the Sea, and therefore
the Corruption, not only of Men, and Beasts, but of the Earth, as of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
Coal-pits, Lime, and all others might be freely turned thereunto,
unlesse there were a positive Law or Custome to the contrair, albeit there
may be detriment of Fishing, which is but a Casualitie, and must carry
the accident of such inconvenience along with it. And as for the <hi>Roman

               <p>THE Laird of <hi>Buchannan</hi> Pursues, Reduction of a Decreet, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
against him, at the Instance of Lieutennent Collonel <hi>Oseburn,</hi>
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. upon many Reasons, mainly, because the ground of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
was only a Bill not past the Signet, at the Instance of umquhil, Mr.
<hi>William Cunninghame,</hi> continued in <hi>Oseburn,</hi> after his decease, without trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring,
for rectifying or rescinding a minute of Disposition, of the Lands
of <hi>Ballindalloch,</hi> by Mr. <hi>William</hi> to <hi>Buchannan,</hi> put in the hands of Mr.
<hi>David Buchannan,</hi> who gave his Ticket that the same should be keeped,
until it were perfeited according to Equity and Justice; and Deponed,
that the Point to be rectified, was only the warrandice which in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
was absolute, upon which Bills, the then Judges, ordained the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to submit, who accordingly submitted to four Friends, and two Overs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who were to report, <hi>February</hi> 10. 1653. Which Oversmen did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably
report, after the expyring of the said Reference, upon the
19. of <hi>February,</hi> to <hi>Buchannans</hi> great prejudice, contrair to Justice, in
so far as they ordained him to pay <hi>Oseburn</hi> sixteen years Purchase, for the
price of the Lands, without Production or Debating of the Parties Rights,
or calling, or hearing the Arbiters; and with warrandice from <hi>Oseburn,</hi> and
his Goodfathers Fact, and Deed only, albeit the Lands were insecure, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Ward, and lying in the Highlands. And found the Rental of the Lands
to be five thousand merks yearly, without distinguishing between Stock
and Teind, though the Testimony of the Witnesses proves not above three
thousand merks, beside the Teind; of which Lands, <hi>Oseburn</hi> nor his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
had neither Title nor Possession of <hi>Buchanbeg; Buchanmore</hi> and <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochroon,</hi>
which are parts of <hi>Ballandoloch,</hi> whereunto the Judges did unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interpone their authority, superceeding twenty thousand merks, until
the Right of <hi>Buchanbeg, Buchanmore</hi> and <hi>Ballachroon,</hi> were discussed; and
whereas the Decreet bears, <hi>Buchannan to have consented,</hi> he denyed the same,
neither was there any minut of Process taken upon the day of his alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
consent; but by an Ordinance of the Judges half a year thereafter,
made upon their memory, which cannot prove against him, not being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by him, at least he might have resiled, <hi>re integra,</hi> before extracting
the Decreet, as he did. The Defender answered, that whatever was the
ground of the Processes, yet there was a Submission subscribed by both
Parties, and a Report by the Oversmen conform, which is express contrair
to all that is alleadged: and is sufficient and full Probation, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters
having so great Trust. And the Decreet beareth, <hi>the Report made
upon the</hi> 9. of <hi>February:</hi> And albeit the minuts of Process were wanting, or
contrary, <hi>nihil est,</hi> because the Clerk being <hi>publicus proto notarius</hi> his solemn
Instruments make full Probation, and the minuts are but the notes taken
by him for remembrance, till the full Instrument be compleated; against
which, Parties may object at Extracting, as not conform to the Warrands,
but not thereafter; otherwayes the Clerks by altering, or losing the minuts,
might destroy all Decreets, which are the greatest Securities of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

in write:</hi> And if <hi>Buchannan</hi> saw not <hi>Oseburns</hi> Rights, it was his fault, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55692:34"/>
called not for them out of the Overs-mens hands, where they long lay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expired Appryzings and Infeftments against <hi>Glengarnock,</hi> the ancient
Proprietar, and against the Lairds of <hi>Buchannan</hi> themselves; so that the
Report being a Decreet Arbitral, and Confirmed by the Judges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to by Parties, is most solemn. And as to the Consent, it was Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and Palpable, by joyning hands, and needed no Subscription; it be-being
most ordinary, that Decreets bear, <hi>Consent of Parties;</hi> especially
when the Consent quadrateth with, and is conform to a Process; as the
compearances of Parties, whereby Decreets became irreduceable, accepting
of Offices of Tutory, or Curatory: and so if <hi>Buchannan</hi> had appeared,
and said for fourty thousand pound, <hi>non faciam vim;</hi> but as for the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand merks, the Right of these Lands would be first cleared.
It would have been an unquestionable consent, albeit contrary or extrinsick
Acts require Subscription, and <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> have the same: yet they need
not, seeing <hi>publica scriptura,</hi> by the Instrument Judicial of the Clerks,
of Supream Court, is more Solemn than a private Write by Parties Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and albeit <hi>de recenti,</hi> at the same time, when consents, or offers
are proposed, Parties may resile, yet <hi>ex intervallo,</hi> they cannot: For there
is only <hi>locus penitentiae</hi> in Dispositions, or Tacks of Lands, where Writ is
requisit, not only as an Evidence, but as a solemnity accomplishing
the Right: But in other Pactions and Promises, where Write is not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential,
there is no place therefor. The Lords having considered the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
and whole Warrands thereof, Reduced, and turned the same in a
Libel, ordained <hi>O seburn</hi> to proceed upon the two Supplications, on which
the Decreet was pronounced, and continued his Possession, till the close
of the next Session, for they found beside, many informalities, the sentence
and Report of the Overs-men, to have been after expyring of the Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
by the Warrand thereof, subscribed with their hands: And as to
the Consent, they found by Signature of Process under all the then Judges
hands, that there was no minut of the said Consent at the time it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
to have been, but half a year thereafter, made up of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories:
Upon which two Points mainly they Reduced, without Discussing
the other Alleadgences: neither had they respect to <hi>Buchannans</hi> Homolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of the Arbiters Sentences, by taking out Diligences conform, and

It was further alleadged, that the Reduction of the Pursuers retour is not

Reduction was long posterior to his Decreet, and he was not cited to the

The Pursuer answered to the <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Presbytrie</hi> had no power to
dispose of that Steipend, by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> 1644. because the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct

that it was a debt restand by their, Father and payed since his death, as <hi>Patrick's</hi>

to be presumed, if it was a Debt at all, to have been payed by
their Father, and the Bond cancelled by him, and left amongst his writs,
and found by their Mother there; and now after her second Marriage made
use of against her own Children; albeit she made no mention of it before:

were Evidently, and Legally Instructed and Proven, yet the Debt was pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Mother, she can have no allowance of it, because she payed
Voluntarly, not being <hi>Tutrix</hi> nor <hi>Executrix</hi> at that time, and cancelled it,

be presumed to have been of purpose, to gift it to her Children out of her

Irrelivant, for as to the first, anent the Probation of the truth of the Debt,
and payment by the <hi>Executrix;</hi> It is sufficiently proven by the cancelled
Bond, at which the Witnesses Names are yet standing; by <hi>Patrick Scot's</hi>

Death, which is abundantly sufficient, to take away the Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <hi>INter eosdem,</hi> There was another Article of the said accompt, whereby
the said Dame <hi>Elizabeth Flemming,</hi> having lent out a sum of money,
in the Name of <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ome</hi> and <hi>Andrew Flemming's,</hi> two of her Bairns,
she craved, that the said Sum should be taken in part of payment, of
the Portions of the whole Bairns; or at least, in so far as was more nor
the Portions of these two Bairnes, might be declared, to belong to her
self. It was answered for the Bairns, that this Bond was a Donation by
the Mother, out of her own means, in favours of her Children;
and could not be imputed as a part of their means, because, <hi>First</hi> The
Bond did bear the Money to be lent by her in her Childrens
name, and not in her own; Neither did it bear to be as a part of
the Bairns means, nor in satisfaction thereof, as she had specially
taken other Bonds in these same Bairns names, and so presumed consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly,
to gift the Sum to these two Bairns, of whom one was <hi>a pocthmus</hi>
Child, born eight moneths after his Fathers Death, and so was not
thought upon by his Father, nor provided with Legacies as the rest were,
<hi>Secondly,</hi> The Tenor of the Bond bears expresly, the Sum to be payable
to the Mother, in Liferent; and one of the Children is substitute Heir
to another, in case they had not Children of their own, (Whereas
another would have fallen Heir of Lyne to them, <hi>viz.</hi> An intervenient
Brother) and to them both the Mother her self, and her Heirs were
substitute. The Pursuer answered, That supposing this were a Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet it being a free gift, the mother might do it upon what Terms,
and Conditions, and what way she pleased. <hi>Ita est,</hi> by the Tenor of the
Bond. It is provided, that she shall uplift the Sum, during her Life,
and the Children after her decease; by which Clause, she is more nor a
naked Life-renter; and seeing this Clause must be interpret <hi>cum effectu,</hi>
the only meaning of it can be, That during her own Lifetime, she might
uplift the Sum, and dispose of it at her pleasure: and so evacuat the fee
in her Childrens Persons, seeing there is nothing to oblidge her to
re-imploy it for the Bairns use, if she should once uplift it,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55692:37"/>
it, as when a Father Infeft his Son in his Lands, reserving his own Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
with power to Dispone, during his own life; there the Father is
Liferenter, yet by that Reservation, he may annull and evacuat the Sons
Fee, even so here: For which two Practicks of <hi>Dury</hi> was adduced, that a
Father providing a Sum to himself and his Wife, and the longest liver of
them two; and failzing of them by Decease, to his Son, the Son being
Infeft in Fee: and in the other Practick, the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expresly infeft in an Annualrent for his Lifetime; Yet the Lords found,
that the Father, during his lifetime, might uplift the sum, and Dispose of
it at his pleasure. The Lords found, by the Tenor of the Bond, that
the Mother had Constitute her self expresly Liferenter, and the Children
Feears: And that the power to Charge for the Money, did bear nothing
of a power to her to Dispose of it; but was only the ordinar Reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
adjected after the Clause of Annualrent, in these words, <hi>but prejudice of
the said Annualrent to her, during her life, and after her Decease, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Bairns
to uplist the money;</hi> and so, that albeit she was not expresly oblieged
to re-imploy it; yet she Constituting her self Liferenter, without a power
to Dispose of the Fee, did sufficiently obliege her to re-imploy the sum.
And as to the Practicks, the case clearly differed, in this; that there the
Father and Mother were not Constitute Liferenters in the sum, though the
Father was mentioned Liferenter, of an Annualrent, accessory to the sum:
But the Clause being to the Father and Mother, and after their Decease
to the Son. It was clear by the common Practicks, that the Son was not
Feear, but Heir Substitute; so that the Father was Feear, and might Dispose
at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> 20. 1661. In the foresaid Cause, It was further alleadged for
the Tutrix, that the Bond in question could not be accounted a Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
notwithstanding the Reasons before adduced, in so far as she was
Debitor to the saids two Bairns, for their Portion, <hi>quia debitor non presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur
donare;</hi> and therefore, Provisions granted by Husbands to their
Wives, albeit they mention not the Contract of Marriage, but <hi>love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:</hi>
And so in the Terms of a Donation, yet it is alwayes interpret,
to be in satisfaction of a prior obliegement in the Contract of Marriage,
and not, that both the posterior and former Provision, are due to the Wife.
It was answered for the Bairns, that though Donation be not presumed, yet
when by the Nature of the Deed done, it appeareth to be <hi>animo donandi;</hi> I
it is truly such, albeit it bear not the name of a Donation, especially in
this case: Which Law excepteth from that general Rule, that Parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
sums for the use of their Bairns, from their natural affection, are
alwayes presumed to gift, and not to satisfie any former Provision, unless
it were so exprest: Upon which ground an Infeftment granted by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his Son, though but a Bastard, Redeemable upon a sum of Money,
was not found in satisfaction of a former Bond, granted by him to that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Son, as is observed by <hi>Dury,</hi> upon the 24. of <hi>Iuly 1623. Stuart</hi>
contra <hi>Fleming:</hi> But here, not only is this Bond, not in satisfaction of
the former Portion; but bears a Clause of a Liferent, and of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Mother, which are incompatible with an intention of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Bond to be in satisfaction of the Bairns Portions, <hi>pro

seeing the Law gives Heirs the benefit of Deliberation, they must have
the necessary means thereof, by Inspection, not only of the benefite,
but also of the burden of the Defunct, without which they cannot
know, <hi>num sit damnosa haereditas:</hi> Especially in this case, against a

to grant Right to her, that might Evacuat the Heritage: And
in this case, the appearand Heir had a more large Interest to crave
Exhibition, nor the Heir Entered, who could only crave Exhibition
for Delivery, Transumpt, or Registration, and so behoved to Libel a
peculiar Interest; but the appearand Heirs Interest, is only <hi>ad deliberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi>
And therefore, the Exhibition, as <hi>medium</hi> thereto, must reach to
all, whereupon he ought to Deliberat. Especially the Defuncts Debt;

or give Title to the Pursuers Action: Yet he having Title by the Law,
to crave Inspection for Deliberation, hath good Interest: Yea, if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

Writes, <hi>ad probandum,</hi> by an incident, as well as third Parties, to whose

               <p>The Lords having heard this Case in their Presence, because the

for only the Natural Possessors can have Decreet of Ejection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
if there be no deed of violence Lybelled, but only Intrometting with
the Maills and Duties, Ejection is not competent, nor any Violent Profits,
but only Action for Maills and Duties, against the Tennents, or Intrometters.
The Pursuers answered, That Ejection may be Competent, though the
Pursuer was not in Natural Possession, when a Tennent is Ejected, and a
Stranger, without Interest, enters in the Natural Possession; albeit the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
should Collud, or neglect, the Heritor having but civil Possession,
by uplifting of Maills and Duties, needs not warn the Ejecter; but may

The Defender alleadged, the Case is not here so, unlesse it were alleadged,
the Tennents were cast out; but the Defender may Defend the Right, to
the Maills and Duties, upon a better Right then the Pursuer. The Pursuer

Profits. <hi>The Lords Ordained the Parties to Dispute their Rights to the Maills
and Duties, and Possession, as in a Double Poynding, and as if the Duties were yet

Wife represents her Father as Heir, or at least as <hi>Lucrative Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>
after the Back-bond; and so as he might thereupon have debarred the
grant of the Back-bond, so might the Pursuer, as Representing him. The
Pursuer alleadged, 1. <hi>Non Relevat,</hi> because the said Back-bond is but a
Personal Obligation, and the Defender had thereupon no Real Right, but
only to the Superioritie; because, by discharges of the Few-dutie produced,
he acknowledged the Pursuer to be Proprietar. 2dly, If any such Back-bond
was (no way granting the same,) he offered him to prove, that it
was Conditional; so soon as the said Umquhile <hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Kirkcudbright</hi>
should require: <hi>Ita est,</hi> he has never required. The Defender alleadged,
he had done the <hi>equivalent,</hi> because in a Double Poynding formerly pursued be

That if he should abstain, and suffer the Tennents to keep the

that his Legall should thereby expire, and the Debitor and

they never possest; yet in so far as they once entred to possesse,
they must do Diligence. It was further alleadged, that no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

given to the Superiour, in respect a prior Appryzer had given a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

answered, that both the Prior and Posterior Composition was within a
Years Rent, which was due to the Superiour, <hi>which the Lords allowed,</hi>
seeing it was not alleadged that the Composition of a Years Rent was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged

it was then the Custom, that all Confirmed principally the same things,

he offers him to Renunce to be Heir: The Pursuer replyed, the

has done a Deed prejudicial to his Renunciation, <hi>viz.</hi> he granted a Bond
for two thousand pounds <hi>sterling</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Dirltoun,</hi> only simulatlie to

that Adjudication assigned to the Earl himself, and so he having intromet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
be that Simulat Title, with the Maills and Duties of his Fathers Lands,
he hath behaved himself as Heir, and cannot Renunce: The Defender

such Rights, to the Sums he truly payed for them, and not to exclude the

that was here done was Legal, there being no Law, nor Custom to hinder

were Simulation, or Fraud, that might be a ground to Reduce upon, but

be Sir <hi>Thomas Hope,</hi> and many since; That the Heir Appearand might grant
a Bond, and thereupon the Lands being Adjudged, might take Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
The Pursuer answered, the Defender had intrometted with the Rents of his
Predicessors Land, which albeit not <hi>animo adeundi,</hi> yet <hi>animo Immiscendi &amp;
Lucrandi,</hi> which cannot be maintained by a <hi>simulat null Bond,</hi> by himself to
his own behove, and Adjudication thereupon; and if this were sustained,
no Person would ever after enter Heir to his Predecessor, but take this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
way, to the Defraud, and Vexation of Creditors; and entring
so to possesse, would buy in other Rights, and maintain his Possession; as
this Defender hath done, and would not be oblieged, or willing to restrict
these Rights, as he doth.</p>

was most justly Repelled, because, albeit it be true, that the naked Office
of Executry, doth not compleat the Right in the Executors Person, and
doth not transmit, yet it is as true, that by the Law of God, and of this
Land (which is cleared by the express Statute, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1617. anent
Executors) Children surviving their Parents, had always a distinct Right,
from the Office of Executry, of their bairns part of gear, which belonged
to them, without any Confirmation, and could not be prejudged by the

                  </gap>ablished
in the Person of a Stranger Executor, by executing the Testament: and
by the said <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that benefit is extended, not only as to the

succeed, as nearest of Kine, and therefore they have right to the Moveables,
not by vertue of the Conformation, or Office of Executry, which before
that <hi>Act</hi> carried the whole benefit; as is clear, by the <hi>Act,</hi> but by a several

as a Reduction, when all was produced that was necessar to be produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ground of Nullity were Discussed, with which all the rest will fall in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
and that Reduction was only necessar to force tho Defenders to produce
by the Certification, but if the Defender would produce himself, he might
proceed by way of Declarator of Nullity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Defender alleadged no Processes, because by the Co-cepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Clauses irritant, the Rights is declared to belong to the nearest
Heir of the Contraveener; and therefore the Pursuer as served Heir-male
general to <hi>Andrew</hi> Lord <hi>Balvaird,</hi> hath no Interest till he be served Heir-male
to <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Annandale</hi> the Contraveener, in which case he cannot
quarrel his Deeds or Debts. The Pursuer answered, that by Heir here can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be understood the Heir actually served, but the Person only that might
be Heir, for the Pursuer insisted in this same Processes against the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandale,</hi>
when he was living, and could not have been then excluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was not his heir; and therefore as is ordinar in all Clauses in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Heirs, which cannot be effectual, if Heirs served be understood, their
Heirs appearing are understood, <hi>verba sumenda sunt cum effectu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords also Repelled this Defense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Defenders alleadged absolvitor: Because, first, Clauses <hi>de
non alienando,</hi> are never understood to extend to necessary alienations, as for
provision of the Feears Wife and Children, for Redemption of him from
Captivity, or any other accident, without his Fault. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Clauses <hi>de
non Contrahendo debitum</hi> are against Commerce, and utterly rejected. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
Clauses irritant are resolutive, albeit contained in the Infeftment, are but
personal obliegements, and the ground of an Action against the contraveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
but if the Contraveener be denuded, are not effectual against singular
Successors; Especially Creditors Contracting <hi>bonafide,</hi> with one standing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft,
before the matter became litigious by Processes, upon that Clause, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Inhibition was used: <hi>ita est,</hi> thir Creditors had Apprized and were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55692:61"/>
before any such Processes upon this Clause, or Inhibition used, and no
personal provision could transmit the Right from <hi>Annandale</hi> to <hi>Stormount,</hi>
upon contraveening the Clausses, nor could hinder the transmission thereof
from <hi>Annandale,</hi> who had the only real Right to the Creditors, by vertue of
their Appryzings and Infeftments, which denuded <hi>Annandale</hi> of the real Right,
and which real Right stands now only in the Person of the Creditors Infeft, so
that there can be no more in <hi>Stormounts</hi> Person, but a Personal Provision,
for the being within the body of the Infeftment, will not make this Clause
real, and to affect the Right, <hi>quo ad singulares successores,</hi> more then the
Clause of Warrandice in the Infeftment, which without question, reaches
not singular Successors; and albeit some Provisions in themselves Personal,
may aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st; albeit alienations do not comprehend judicial
Alienations by Appryzing in Recognition, and are oftimes not extended to
necessar Alienations: Yet here the Clause bears expresly <hi>not to altenat, and
also to do no Deed whereby the Laws may be Evicted and Apprized;</hi> without
which the Clauses <hi>de alienando,</hi> were utterly ineffectual, and repeats the
same to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Appryzers Infeftment, yet it is in them effected, with that quality in the
condition and bosome of it, that gives good ground, not only against the
Earl of <hi>Annandale</hi> Contraveener, to annul his Right; But also the Appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in consequence, <hi>quia resoluto jure dantis, resolvitur jus accipientis,</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in Feudal-rights, where <hi>provisionis investiturae, sunt legis feudi,</hi> as all
Feudists agree, and therefore all such Pactions and Provisions are equivalent
to Law. <hi>2d.</hi> This Clause of the Infeftment is not only resolutive, but also is
an Interdiction Prohibiting the Feear for the time, to alienat, or do any Deed
prejudicial, without consent of such other Persons of the Tailzie, were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors
for the time; and therefore, though the Pursuer should enter Heir to
<hi>Annandale,</hi> he might annul these Rights, just as in the Case of an Heir of an
Interdicted Person, who may annul all Rights by his Predecessors after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction.
The Defenders answered, that as to this Point concerning the
Interdiction, it cannot be effectual; because by a particular <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
all Interdictions are appointed to be published, and to be Registrat
in the Registers of Inhibitions, otherways they are null: This Interdiction is
neither published nor Registrat in that Register. The Pursuer answered, it
is als publick, because it is not only in his Infeftment, at the great Seal, but
it is <hi>verbatum</hi> in the first Seasine, and repeated in the Earl of <hi>Annandales</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
and Seasine, so as that the Creditors ought to have considered his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
when they lent him Money, and known that he was Infeft, otherwise
their mistake, though it might be alleadged to be <hi>bona fidae;</hi> yet if <hi>Annan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
hade never been Infeft, their <hi>bona fides</hi> would have wrought nothing,
seing therefore they did it on their peril, unless they knew he was Infeft, and
they could not know he was Infeft by inspection of his Seasine, or of the
Register, but they behoved to know this Clause, which is <hi>verbatum</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:55692:61"/>
The Lords did also Repel this Defense and Duply, in respect of the Reply and
Triply, and found the resolutive Clause effectual against singular Successours, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering it was so publick and <hi>verbatim</hi> in the Seasine, and that it was
equivalent to an Interdiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Defender further alleadged absolvitor, because the pursuer

the Mails and Duties of the same Lands.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled this Defense, because the Pursuer having intented Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
against <hi>Annandale</hi> in his own life, they thought the provision was equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

hath peaceably possessed this Tenement twenty or thirty years, and
thereby hath the Benefit of a possessory Judgement, by which his Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be questioned without Reduction and Declarator. Thirdly,
The <hi>Englishes</hi> possessed this Tenement several years by the publick Calamity
of War; and therefore there must be Deduction of these years Annualrents,
as is frequently done in Feu-duties. Fourthly, The two Tenements being
now in the hands of different singular Successors, <hi>Balmerino's</hi> Tenement can
only be poinded for a part of the Annualrent. The Pursuer answered, that
Poinding of the ground is <hi>actorialis,</hi> chiefly against the Ground; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
during the Obtainers Life, it is valued not only against the ground,
while it belonged to these Heretors and Possessors, but against the same in
whosoever hands it be, that the Moveable Goods therein, or the Ground
Right thereof may be Apprized. To the second, Annualrents are <hi>debita
fundi,</hi> and a Possessory Judgement takes neither place for them, nor against
them. To the third, though in some cases Feu-duties ceass by Devestation,
that was never extended to Annualrents, due for the profit of a Stock of
Money. To the fourth, the Annualrent being out of two Tenements pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously.
The Annualrenter may Distress any part for the whole, in who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hands the Tenement may be.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled all these Defenses, but superceded Execution for one half
of the Annualrent for a time, and Ordained the Suspender to give Commission to
<hi>Balmerino</hi> to put the Decreet in Execution against the other Tenements for its

own Liferent; after his Sons Death, his Oye pursues him for an
Aliment out of the Estate, conform to the Act of Parliament, appointing the
Heir to be Entertained by the Donatars to the Ward, Conjunct-feears, or
Liferenters thereof. The Defender alleadged absolvitor, because the Act of
Parliament cannot be extended to his case, who voluntarly Infeft his Son in
his Estate, with the burden of his Liferent. Secondly, If any Aliment
were due, the Mother who is Liferenter must bear her part. Thirdly, Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is only due where the Heir hath no other means; But here the Heir
hath a Stock of Money, which though Liferented by his Mother, yet he
may Entertain himself out of the Stock. The Pursuer answered: First,
That the Act of Parliament anent Alimenting of Heirs, is generally against
Liferenters without exception. Secondly, The Disposition by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Son, was for a Tocher worth all the Estate he then had; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no part was Liferented by the Son, or his Wife, the Pursuers Mother,

the bargain being incompleat, the Heir must perfit it, and dispone the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement,

Deceast Earl of <hi>Levin,</hi> for the Sum of due by him to umquhil
<hi>Lamertoun:</hi> The Earl suspended upon Compensation, by six Bonds granted
by umquhil <hi>Lamertoun,</hi> to the umquhil Countess of <hi>Levin,</hi> four of them to
her self; and after her Decease to her Daughters, and two of them blank,
in the Creditors name, which being done <hi>stante Matrimonio,</hi> by this Lady,
did belong to her Husband <hi>jure mariti,</hi> and not to her or his Daughters.
These Bonds were produced out of the hands of <hi>Alexander Kennedy,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Master Porter of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who declared that he had the
foresaid six Bonds in Trust from the umquhil Countess, and the Laird of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mertoun,</hi>
in <hi>Anno 1649. Levin</hi> being then Captain of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,
Lambertoun</hi> Constable, and the said <hi>Alexander,</hi> Porter, and produced a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Trust, subscribed by <hi>Lambertoun</hi> and my Lady, bearing, <hi>that the
Bonds were put in</hi> Alexander<hi>'s hands, as a faithful Person, whom both Trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to be keeped till after the Ladyes Death, and then delivered, according to
her direction:</hi> against which Writes, <hi>Lambertoun</hi> raised Improbation, and
<hi>Alexander Kennedy</hi> abode by the same, and the Earl of <hi>Levin</hi> declared, he
made use of them upon the ground foresaid, in his Improbation; The six
Bonds being written by <hi>Alexander Kennedy</hi> and <hi>Iames Rule</hi> who is dead,
and the Witnesses being <hi>George Watson, Spittel</hi> and <hi>Young,</hi> and in some of
them <hi>Alexander</hi> himself, all being dead but <hi>Alexander</hi> the Producer; the
direct manner of Improbation thereof ceassed; and therefore they proceed
to the indirect manner, and give in many Articles of Improbation, and the
Earles Articles of Probation. The Relevancy of which being Dispute, to
quadruplyes in Write, and all Persons that either Parties desired, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
<hi>hinc inde,</hi> and their Testimonies published to either Party, and
they having thereupon Dispute, both as to the Relevancy and Probation,
in Write, and being heard at last <hi>viva voce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords proceeded to Advise the Cause.</p>
               <p>The weight of the whole matter lay in these Particulars mainly; <hi>First,</hi>
For astriction of the Writs; the said Paper of Trust holding in it, <hi>two li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Witnesses and one dead,</hi> being true, the Bonds related therein could not
be false. This Paper could not be Improven indirectly, because the direct
manner was competent by two living Witnesses, whereof the one Depon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Subscription was like his Subscription, as he Subscribed at that
time, being young, and the third Witness being dead, proves. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the Witnesses insert, proved not; because <hi>comparatione litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
Crawford</hi> the Defunct's Subscription, was altogether unlike his true
Subscription produced; <hi>Learmont</hi> sayes his Subscription was only like his:
and though <hi>Kill</hi> sayes it was his Subscription, yet none of them Depones
to have seen it Subscribed by any Body, or by any Witness, nor to know
any thing of the time, place, or truth of the matter contained in the Writs,
being but an Evidence to keep the Witnesses in remembrance, either of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55692:70"/>
Matter or of the Subscription, of the Principal or themselves, albeit they
need not be proven here as in <hi>England,</hi> by the Witnesses insert: Yet in the
case of Improbation, if the Witnesses prove nothing of the Fact or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
as remembring that they or the Party Subscribed, but only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning
that it is their Subscription, which can import no more of certain
knowledge, then that it is like their Subscription, seeing none can swear
that it may not be feigned so like that they cannot know it: and albeit that
would be sufficient, where nothing is in the contrair; Yet where there is
strong presumption in the contrair, as the Writ not being in the Parties
hands, but in the hand of a third Party, <hi>malae famae,</hi> and who hath at least
betrayed his Trust, never having made these Bonds known, till six or seven
years after the Countess of <hi>Levins</hi> Death; and then offering to sell some of
them to others, and with all the Paper of Trust, the Body thereof being
written with one hand, and the filling up of the Witnesses with another,
which no body hath, or can condescend upon, nor are Designed therein;
so the same being null by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> cannot sufficiently astruct the
truth of the other Bonds, being in themselves suspect.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Paper of Trust not sufficiently to astruct, nor the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
not to prove it sufficient, in respect of the grounds foresaid being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
and the many presumptions against these Writs. Therefore they improved
the said pretended Paper of Trust.</p>
               <p>There was further produced for astructing the Bonds, two Holographs
alleadged, Written and Subscribed by <hi>Lamertouns</hi> owns hand, relative to
the Bonds and Trust; and for proving these were Holograph, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a Holograph Accompt Book of <hi>Lambertouns,</hi> and six Witnesses, of
whom three or four were without exception, and the whole Deponed that
they truly believed that the Holographs were <hi>Lamertouns</hi> hand, and <hi>Lamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>
and the Lady <hi>Levins</hi> Subscriptions. The question then was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these Papers were so proven to be Holograph, that they did sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
astrict the Bonds, notwithstanding all the grounds instructed against them.</p>
               <p>The Lords found Negative, upon this consideration, that when the Probation
of Holograph is by Witness, who saw the Holograph Writ, Written and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
albeit they be not instruct, it is a full probation, admitting no contrary
probation, but when it is only <hi>comparatione literarum;</hi> or by Witnesses, Depon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they believe, or that positively it is the hand writ of the Party, that can
import no more, but that it is so like, that it is undecernable for no man who
saw it not written, can positively swear with knowledge, that it is impossible to
fenzie the hand so like, that it is undecernable, and therefore holograph so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
admits a stronger contrary Probation; and therefore the Lords found that
the Evidents against the Bonds were stronger nor this Probation of holograph.</p>
               <p>There was also produced three Contracts betwixt umquhil <hi>Lambertoun</hi>
and <hi>Kennedy</hi> at <hi>Striveling,</hi> upon the ninth of <hi>August</hi> 1651. by the last of
them, <hi>Kennedy</hi> was oblieged to deliver <hi>Lambertoun</hi> the Bonds for such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sums, he obtaining the Lady <hi>Levins</hi> consent, of all these the Writer
and Witnesses were dead, and the Date proven to be false.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:55692:70"/>
In this Process the Lords having considered all the indirect Articles of
the Improbation, in respect that these Writs in question were never in the
alleadged Creditors hands; and that there was not one Witness that did De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone,
that either they remembred to have Subscribed any of these Writs
themselves, or that they saw either the Parties, or any other of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Subscribe, or any thing communed, done or acknowledged by either
Party, contained in the Writs, and that the Subscription of <hi>Watson,</hi> one
of the Witnesses in all the Bonds, was by comparison with other contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Writs, about the same time, altogether unlike his Subscription, and
that the <hi>Word</hi> Witnesses adjoyned to the Subscription, of all the VVitnesses,
did appear to be so like, as written with one hand.</p>
               <p>They found sufficient ground to Improve the foresaids writs, besides many preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
presumptions from <hi>Kennedies</hi> inclination and carriage; which being extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
were accounted of less value, and yet the astructions aforesaid, and presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on that part were so strong, that several of the Lords were unclear simply,
to find the Bonds false, but not authentick probative writs.</p>

Father, obtained Certification against <hi>Doors</hi> Seasine; so that it being now
improven, all the Rights Libelled on, falls <hi>in consequentiam,</hi> because <hi>Doors</hi>
is the common Author to them all: and if he had no real Right, all their
Rights are <hi>a non habente potestatem;</hi> so that now the Pursuer has no more in
his Person, but a Disposition made by <hi>Phillorth's</hi> Grand-father to <hi>Doors,</hi> and
a Charter following thereupon, and is in the same case, as if <hi>Doors</hi> upon that
ground were craving declarator of Property, which he could not do, nor
would the Lords sustain it, albeit there were no Defender; because that
can be no Right of Property, where there is no Seasine. The Pursuer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:
1. That the Defense is no ways Relevant, nor is the Pursuer in
the case of a Declarator, upon a Disposition or Charter without a Seasine,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55692:71"/>
because he produces a progress of Infeftments, and is not oblieged <hi>hoc ordine,</hi>
to Dispute <hi>Doors</hi> his Authors Rights, as being <hi>a non habente potestatem,</hi> which
is only competent by way of Reduction; some representing <hi>Doors,</hi> his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
being called. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Defense is no way competent to this Defender,
unless he alleadge upon a better Right then the Pursuers; for the Pursuer hath
done all that is requisit to instruct his Declarator, by production of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments,
and his authors Rights are presumed, and need not be instructed; and
albeit the Defender be called, yet he cannot quarrel the Pursuers Authors
Right, or hinder his Declarator, unless he alleadge upon a more valide Right
in his own Person. <hi>3ly.</hi> The Defense ought to be Repelled, as proponed
by this Defender; because he represents <hi>Frazer</hi> of <hi>Phillorth</hi> his Grand-father,
who Disponed the Lands in question to <hi>Doors,</hi> and was oblieged to infeft him,
and did <hi>de facto</hi> resign in the Kings hands, in his favour, and so personally
objection, umquhil <hi>Phillorth, Doors</hi> Author would be for ever excluded
from objecting against <hi>Doors</hi> Right, which flowed from him; so neither can
the Defender who represents him object against the Pursuer, who is Successor
in <hi>Door's</hi> Rights. The Defender answered, that being called, albeit he had
no Right in his Person, he might propone a Defense upon a Nullity in the

whatsomever, to pay to the Daughters of the Marriage 3000. merks,</hi> and
craved that the Executrix as representing their Father, might pay the same.
The Defender alleadged Absolvitor, because it is clear by the Clausses of the
Contract, that the Father did not bind himself simply, or himself and his
Heirs, but that he bound only himself and his Heirs-male, which is the more
clear that the Narrative of that Clause bears, <hi>because his Estate is provided
to his Heirs-male.</hi> The Pursuer answered, he opponed the Clause, by which
he did not only obliege his Heirs-male, but himself and his Heirs-male; and
so in oblieging himself, he hath oblieged all that Represent him, and he might
have been pursued in his own lifetime, if his Daughters had come to the age
appointed by the provision. <hi>2ly.</hi> He has not only oblieged himself and his
Heirs-male, but his Successors whatsomever, and therefore his Executors.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that by the Tenor of the Clause, and Narrative thereof, the
Defuncts meaning was chiefly to obliege his Heir-male, and albeit Successors what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somever

the Heir-male was first burdened, and behoved first to be discussed. Therefore

is only a desire or recommendation left in the Pursuers option: and for <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi>

for <hi>Babirny</hi> that he ought to be preferred to Mr. <hi>Thomas Nicolson,</hi> and the
said Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> excluded from all Commonty, because <hi>Babirny</hi> stands Infeft
in the Lands of <hi>Babirny,</hi> which infeftment bears, with common Pasturage
in the Muir of <hi>Bighty,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> had no express Infeftment therein.
It was answered for Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> that the alleadgence is not Relevant
to exclude him, because he, his Predecessors and Authors, are, and have
been Infeft in his Lands <hi>cum communi pastura,</hi> and by vertue of the
saids Infeftments, in peaceable Possession Immemorially; or by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55692:77"/>
the space of 40 Years, which was sufficient to establish the Right of
Communitie with <hi>Balbirnie,</hi> notwithstanding his Infeftment bears express. It
was answered for <hi>Balbirnie,</hi> that not only was his Infeftment more express;
but Mr. <hi>Thomas Lands</hi> and his were holden of divers Superiours, <hi>viz. Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birnie</hi>
of the KING, and Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> were <hi>Kirk-lands;</hi> and albeit the
Muire lyes contigue to Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> Lands, yet it is not of the same Paroch.
<hi>The Lords repelled the Reasons of Preference for Balbirnie in respect of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi>
It was further alleadged for <hi>Balbirnie,</hi> that the Alleadgeances and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
for Mr. <hi>Thomas Nicolson</hi> ought to be repelled; because he offers
him to prove, that <hi>Nicolson</hi> was interrupted since the Year 1610. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended,
by yearly turning his Cattel off the ground, and stopping him
from casting Peits; and therefore he must say 40 Years Possession, by vertue
of an Infeftment preceeding that Interruption. It was answered for <hi>Nicol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
non relevat,</hi> unlesse either a Legal Interruption by Lawborres, or Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
or at least a compleat and full <hi>Interruptio facti,</hi> by debarring him on
whole year from any deed of Community, but for turning off his Goods,
which were presently put on again, and he enjoying all his Profit, such
were Attempts, and Incompleat Interruptions, whereof he needed take
no notice thereof, seing he continued his Possession, otherwayes there
would be great inconveniences by such Interruptions, which would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
by the Leidges, and yet would cut off the Probation of the old Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
before the same.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that whatsoever the Interruption, 40 Years, or <hi>immemoria
possessione</hi> before the Interruption behoved to be proven, for they thought that
what Servituds were introduced only by Possession, by the patience and presumed will
of the other Partie, being either Proprietar, or having right of Communitie,
any Interruption was sufficient to show, that the other Party willed not, nor consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to the Right; and if by such Interruptions Parties got wrong, it was
their own fault, who did not either declare their Right, or insist in a molestation
<hi>debito tempore,</hi> or use mutual Interruptions; but here it was considered, that
Possession before the year 1610. would be equivalent to Immemorial Possession, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the Witnesses were not positive, upon 20. Years Possession before, in respect
the Years were 50. Years since.</p>

November 20. 1662.</head>
               <p>IN a Persuit at the instance of the Children of <hi>Wolmet</hi> for the Profit of the
Coal of <hi>Wolmet,</hi> intrometted with by the said <hi>Iean Dowglas</hi> Lady <hi>Wolmet</hi>
in her Viduity, by vertue of a Tack of the Coal granted by Umqhile <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
to his Children for their Portions, it was alleadged for the Defender.
<hi>First,</hi> absolvitor, because the said <hi>Iean</hi> had right to the said Profit of the said
Coal, ever since her Husbands Death, by vertue of the Wodset of the
Lands and Coals of <hi>Wolmet</hi> granted by Umquhile <hi>Patrick Edmonstcun</hi> of <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
to <hi>Iames Loch,</hi> wherein there is a Back-tack of the Land and Coal set
to the said Umquhile <hi>Wolmet,</hi> and the said <hi>Iean</hi> his Spouse, for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrent
of the Money. It was replyed for the Pursuer, that the foresaid
Back-tack was taken by <hi>Wolmet stante matrimonio,</hi> and so was <hi>donatio inter
uirum &amp; uxorem</hi> null in it self, <hi>nisi morte confirmetur,</hi> and was confirmed by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55692:78"/>
                  <hi>Wolmets</hi> Death, but Revocked by the Pursuers Tack granted to his Children
after the said Back-tack. It was answered for the Pursuers, that the reply
ought to be repelled, because the Back-tack was no Donation, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation,
in so far as the Lady by her Contract of Marriage was Infeft in the
half of the Lands of <hi>Wolmet;</hi> which Infeftment she renounced in favours of
<hi>Iames Loch,</hi> at the taking of the Wodset, and in lieu thereof, she got
this Back-tack, which therefore can be no Donation, which must be <hi>gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tus</hi>
without a cause onerous. It was replyed by the Pursuers, that the duply is
not relevant; for albeit it be not a pure Donation, yet <hi>quoad excessum</hi> the
superplus of the benefit of the Back-tack above the benefit of the Contract
of Marriage is gratitude, and a Donation, and the reason of the Law against
Donations betwixt Man and Wife being <hi>mutuo amore se spolient,</hi> it holds in it, and
it would be easie to allude the intent of that good Law, if Donations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
under the way of permutation without any real equalitie were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
It was answered for the Defender, that the duply stands relevant, and
the superplus of a permutation cannot be called a Donation more then the
benefit of an advantagious Vendition: it is true, that if the Donation of the
Back-tack had been <hi>ex intervallo,</hi> after the Ladies Renounciation, it would
have been <hi>vincus Contractus.</hi> but two distinct Donations, or if the matter
exchanged had been <hi>aliquid ejusdem specei,</hi> as an Annualrent of
500 merk with an Annualrent of a 1000 <hi>lib.</hi> the superplus would have
been a Donation; or if the Lady had received a notable excess above the
half, yea, above the third of what she quat, it might have been revocable
by her Husband, she being reponed to her first Condition, by her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of Marriage, but here there is no such exorbitant excess, she having quat a
certain Land Rent for the profit of a Coal, which is most uncertain, for
the hail Land Rent would not pay the Back-tack, and it is now Wodset, and
likewise she is personally lyable for the Back-tack Dutie.</p>
               <p>The Lords repelled the Defense, and Duply, in respect of the Reply and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
and found the Excess so considerable in this case, that it was as a Donation,
and was revocked by the Childrens Tack, but found that before the Defender made
payment of what should be found due by this accompt she should be reponed and
put <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> by her Contract of Marriage.</p>
               <p>It was further alleadged for the Defender, absolvitor, because that albeit
her Right by the Back-tack were revocked by the Childrens Tack, yet she
is <hi>bona fide</hi> possessor, <hi>&amp; fecit fructus consumptos suos,</hi> according to the
Law of this Kingdom, and of most of other Nations necessarily introduced,
for the good and quiet of the People, because as to and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
they spend as they have, and therefore what they spend <hi>bona fide</hi> by a
colourable Title; they are secured in that, albeit their Title be taken away;
yet they shall not be called in question for what they have injoyed <hi>bona fide</hi>
before Sentence, or Citation. It was answered, for the Pursuers, that the
Defense was not relevant in that case, where the Question is not of industrial
fruit, but of natural fruit, such as Coal. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is not relevant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it were <hi>cum titulo</hi> not <hi>ipso jure</hi> null, but here the Defenders Title being
a Donation betwixt Man and Wife, is by the Civil Law, which herein we
follow null <hi>in se nisi morte confirmetur. Thirdly,</hi> there must be <hi>bona fides</hi>
which is not here; because it is instructed by a minute of a Contract produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within five moneths before the Childrens Tack, that the Lady consented
to the providing of the Children by the profit of the Coal, and she cannot be
presumed ignorant of so Domestick an affair in favour of her own Children
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55692:78"/>
done by her Husband, and she hath given up an Article in her accompt of
the expense of Registrating the Childrens Tack; by her self, and so she
must be presumed to have possessed as protutrix for her Children, and not
to Defraud or Exclude them. It was answered, for the Defender, that the
defense stands yet relevant, and the Law makes no difference betwixt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrial
and Natural Fruits, he who possesses Lands <hi>bona fide</hi> is no more
comptable for the Grass that growes of it self, nor for the Corn that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for. 4. And Coal is an industrial Fruit, having as much pains and
expense as Corns, and other industrial Fruit, and more uncertainty: as to
the Title albeit be valid, yet <hi>sufficit coloratus vel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the antient <hi>Roman Law,</hi> such Donations were null <hi>in se nisi confirmentur

valid in themselves, unless they be revocked, and therefore are not
<hi>null,</hi> but <hi>Anullantur medio facto,</hi> and there are many <hi>nullities,</hi> which may
consist with a colourable Title, <hi>ad hunc affectum lucrari Fructus consumptus,</hi> as
if the <hi>nulitie</hi> be not <hi>ex defectu substantialium,</hi> but by defect of some solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as the not Registration of a Seasine will not make it so <hi>null,</hi> but that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor
<hi>bona fide</hi> thereby will imploy the Fruits, but if it want tradition of the
symble, it will be null <hi>in se,</hi> but here such Donations have all there essentials,
but they are only anullable by a subsequent fact; and as to the Evidence, that
the Lady was in <hi>mala fide;</hi> they are no wayes sufficient, by her consent that
the Children should be provided with the Coal, was in contemplation of her
eldest Sons Marriage, which took no effect, and the rest are meire presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and <hi>dato</hi> she had known <hi>privata notitia non nocet,</hi> unlesse there had
been some Intimation, Citation or Judicial Act to put her in <hi>mala fide;</hi> and
especially private knowledge infers not <hi>mala fide,</hi> unless it had been anterior
to her possession. The Pursuer answered to the last point, that albeit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
knowledge in some cases would not infer <hi>mala fides</hi> among strangers, yet
a mother knowing the right of her own Children, whereof one were in her
womb, it puts her in <hi>mala fide,</hi> seing she was thereby oblidged to have
sought Tutors, and preserved their Right.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Evidences sufficient to prove the Defender to have been
in <hi>mala fide,</hi> and therefore repelled this Defense also, and Ordained the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
to comp for the intromission, but found that the charge ought not to be stated
according as the profit of the Coal fell out to be, but as the profit thereof might be

an undelivered discharge would not be sufficient, yet that being but

declared effectual; and albeit the Lords <hi>ex gratia,</hi> are in use to suffer Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

the second Reason; It was Answered, that the said <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> was special, in
relation to Clauses Irritant, for not payment of the Sum in the Wodset, which
was <hi>stricti juris,</hi> and could not be extended to this wilful Failzie, in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers

               <p>The Lords found the Decreet not to be <hi>in foro contradictorio;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55692:82"/>
Families, was ever a burthen on their Moveables, and upon their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutry.
The Pursuer answered, though it was ordinarly retained off the
Moveables, yet the Heir was also lyable, seing the Defunct was oblieged to
entertain his Servants and Children, at least to a Term, but much more when
there were no Moveables, or where the Defunct was Rebel, and the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
intrometted. The Defender answered, that it was <hi>novum</hi> to conveen
an Heir on this ground, and that the Alledgiance of there being no Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
held not here; neither is it relevant that the Moveables were gifted,
unless it had been declared before the Defunct's Death and Possession obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

Rights produced, if the Defender would rest thereon, he needed not stand
that Certification should be granted against any others not produced, seing
these produced are sufficient; but if the Certification should be thus stopped,
the effect of all Improbations and Non-entries should be marred by dropping

the Sum himself, at least his Brother by his order, whereupon the Lady

pursue, hath pursued the Collonel upon the Warrandice for Re-payment;
which Action being seen and returned, and ready to be discust, the Suspender
craves Compensation thereon. The Charger answered, That the reason of
Compensation is not relevant, because it is not liquid, the foresaid Sum not
being confirmed by any Executor, nor Sentence thereupon; neither can it
be instantly verified, because it must abide Probation, that the Collonel or
his Brother by his order uplifted the Sum, and there being only a licence to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
the Debt cannot be established till a Confirmation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Albeit
the Compensation were relievable, yet the Reason ought to be repelled;
because, that any such Assignation was granted, it was in trust, to the Collonels
own behove, as is instructed by a missive Letter to the Charger produced.
It was answered for the Suspender, that the Answers founded upon the missive
Letter ought to be repelled, because it was null, neither being Holograph,
nor having Witnesses. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is most suspect, being written upon old
blacked Paper. The Charger answered, that Letters amongst Merchands,
though not Holograph, are sustained, and ought much more among Souldiers,
especially between the Charger and Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> who then was his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Collonel; which is the more clear, that there was never a question

about that time. It was alleadged by the Lady, that she ought to be pre-ferred,
because she being joyned with her Husband in the Conjunct-Fee, and
thereupon Infeft; it is sufficient to give her the Right of Liferent, which
is but a personal servitude. It was answered, first, That Major <hi>Campbel</hi>
having procured the first Confirmation, which is expresly limit unto his
Annualrent, must be preferred to the Lady, and that such limitations might
lawfully be, because it being free for the Superiour to Confirm, or not, or

could not perfectly know his Debitors condition; which if he had known;
and given in expresly a Confirmation to the King, it would have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
seeing the King respects none, and therefore the King's granting

therefore, before the Justice, and being Charged to underly the Law, for

to be Inbrought: The Criminal Libel proceeded, both upon the Act of

that killing of Persons under assurance of Trust, to be Treasonable;
Hereupon the King granted a Gift of Sir <hi>Iames</hi> Forefaulture to Sir <hi>Patrick

who had Right by Appryzing, that there could be no respect to the Gift

Fugitive, and Denunced as said is; and that any Doom of Forefaulture had

that Act of Murder under Trust, doth not directly quadrat to this Case, upon

are Relevant against the Assigney, and condescends upon several Bonds and
Decreets against the Cedent, assigned to the Suspender, before the Chargers
Intimation. The Suspender answered, that albeit any Debt due by the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

the Assigney; yet that will not extend to Sums assigned to the Debitor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to be a Suspensive Condition. 3ly. Absolvitor, because though the
Seasine had been accepted warrantably, yet the Accepter was minor, and
thereupon Leased, and ought to be restored and the Seasine annulled, and
consequently the Recognition. The Pursuer answered to the First, <hi>non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levat,</hi>
for albeit there had been no Acturney out of the <hi>Chancellary,</hi> the
Seasine would have been valid, because there needs no other Procuratory,
for taking of Seasine, but only the Precept of Seasine, which is an express
Mandat of the Disponet, and the having thereof in the Acturneys hand, is
a sufficient evidence of the Warrant or Mandat to be Acturney, for the
Receiver, which proves sufficiently his Warrant, neither was there ever any
more required to a Seasine in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and if more were required, all Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines
would be null, it being ordinar to give Seasines to Infants, or absents
out of the Countrey; but the delivery of the Precept by the Disponer, to
any Person in Name of the Accepter, is a sufficient Mandat, or Acturney
for the Accepter, especially here, where a Grand-Father gives Infeftment to
his Oye, he might well give a Warrant to an Acturney for him to accept.
To the second, albeit the Disposition bears, failing Heirs-male of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poners
Body: Yet the Precept is directed to give present State and Seasine
without delay; whereby it is clear, that the Disponers meaning was not,
that this condition should be Suspensive to impede the Infeftment: And
therefore all it could operate is, to have the effect of a resolutive Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that if any Heir-male should be Supervenient, he might upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
pursue <hi>James Cicile</hi> to renunce the Right, or to declare it null, neither
is a Seasine <hi>actus legittimus,</hi> and though it were, and were incapable of a

of the Name of <hi>Frazer,</hi> for 38000 pounds. The said <hi>Robert Frazer</hi> of <hi>Doors,</hi>
Disponed the saids Lands to <hi>Staniewood,</hi> during the life of Sir <hi>Alexander Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer:</hi>
Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> assigned the Contract, and the foresaid Clause to this
<hi>Phillorth,</hi> whereupon he raised Improbation and Reduction, of the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
granted by <hi>Doors</hi> to <hi>Staniewood,</hi> the Lord <hi>Frazers</hi> Grand-Father upon
this Reason, that he as Assigney by his Father to the Clause <hi>de non alienan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
had good interest to pursue Reduction of the Disposition contraveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the said Clause; and true it is that the said Disposition granted by <hi>Doors</hi>
to <hi>Staniewood,</hi> was null; as proceeding <hi>a non habente potestatem,</hi> in so far as
by the foresaid Clause, in the said alienation granted by his Grand-Father
to <hi>Doors;</hi> it was expresly provided, it should not be leisom for <hi>Doors</hi> to
sell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which being a Provision in the Disposition repeated, at the
least generally in the Procuratory of Resignation, is <hi>pactum reale,</hi> effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
against singular Successors, as was lately found in the case of the Lord
<hi>Stormont,</hi> and so must annul the Right made contrair thereto. 2ly, Albeit
it were not a real Paction, yet unquestionably the Obligement not to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize,
did personally oblige <hi>Doors,</hi> and thereupon there was an Inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
raised before my Lord <hi>Frazers</hi> Grand-Father <hi>Staniewoods</hi> Right: And
therefore the Disposition made thereafter ought to be reduced, <hi>ex capite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitionis.</hi>
It was answered for the Lord <hi>Frazer,</hi> to the first member of the
Reason, <hi>non relevat;</hi> for such an Obligation, <hi>de non alienando<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
in Law, as being contrair the nature of Property. 2ly, It is not <hi>reale
pactum,</hi> albeit it were in the Charter or Seasine, much less being only in the
Disposition, and in the Narrative of the Procuratory of Resignation thus,
and to the effect the said <hi>Robert Frazer</hi> may be Infeft, upon the provisions
and conditions in manner foresaid, but no further mention thereof; in
the Procuratory of Resignation or Infeftment, and so meets not with <hi>Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi>
Case, where the Clause was expresly resolutive, that in such a Case
the Right should be null <hi>ipso facto;</hi> and return to the next person who
might be Heir of Tailzie. Which Clause was not only in the Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but in the Procuratory, Charter, and Seasine Registrate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
equivalent to a Publication of an Interdiction: but here there is no
resolutive or irritant Clause, nor any Right reserved to return in case of
contraveening, nor is it in the Infeftment at all. As to the second, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
cannot make the Clause effectual to annul the Alienation, because
<hi>Doors</hi> was not simply obliged, not to Alienat during Sir <hi>Alexanders</hi> Life,
but if he did in the contrair, to pay ten thousand pound for Damnage
and Interest, <hi>ex pacto convento,</hi> which cannot be understood of Damnage
by delay, or Expence in attaining the principal Obligation, seeing it bears
not as is ordinar by and attour performance, and the quantity thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so great, it must be evidently understood of the value of the principal
Obligation, so that it becomes an alternative or restrictive Clause, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it was in <hi>Doors</hi> option, whether to forbear to sell, or to pay the ten
thousand pounds if he did sell, so that the Inhibition can reach no further
then to the ten thousand pounds, seing <hi>Doors</hi> by selling, became obliged
for the ten thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:55692:92"/>
The Lords found the Defense Relevant, and that the Clause or Inhibition
could extend to no further then ten thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>It was further alleadged for <hi>Frazer</hi> absolvitor, from the ten thousand
pounds, because it being a Moveable Sum, fell under Sir <hi>Alexander Frazer</hi>
his Escheat, which was Gifted to one <hi>Forbes,</hi> and declared expresly as to
this ten thousand Pounds, and assigned to the Lord <hi>Frazer.</hi> The Pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
answered that this Sum was Heretable, because it succeeded in the place of
the principal Obligation, not to alienat for such a time; and after that time
to offer the Lands of <hi>Phillorth</hi> and his Heirs, for eight thousand pounds,
which is clearly an heretable Clause; and therefore this Sum coming in leu
thereof, must belong to the Heir or Assigney, and so fell not to the Fisk,
seing <hi>surrogatum sapit naturam surrogati,</hi> as Sums Consigned for Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Lands before Declarator, are not moveable, but belong to the Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setters
Heirs or Assigneys; so in mutual Obligations, whereby one person
oblieges to Dispone, or Resign Lands; and another is oblieged for a price,
the price would not belong to the Executor, or Fisk, but to the Heir;
any sums due for Damnage and Interest, not performing a Disposition, or
upon Eviction, belongs to the Heir, not to the Executor. The Defender
answered, that this sum is not in the case of any of the former alleadgences,
neither is the question here, what would belong to the Executor, but what
would belong to the Fisk, for Moveable Heirship belongs to the Heir and
not to the Executor, and yet belongs to the Fisk, so do sums without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination
of Annualrents, wherein Executors are secluded. So also doth
the price of Lands, when they are <hi>de presenti,</hi> sold by the Defunct.</p>
               <p>The Lords found this sum moveable and belonged to the Fisk, and therefore
Assoilzied the Defender from that Member also.</p>

               <p>THis day afternoon the Lords Advised the rest of the Defenses, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
for the Lord <hi>Cranburn,</hi> in the Recognition pursued at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of my Lady <hi>Carnagy,</hi> who alleadged first, that Recognition was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
competent in proper Ward-holdings, and not in blench Feu, or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage;
these only being <hi>feuda recta &amp; militaria,</hi> and all others but <hi>fendastra;</hi>
But the Lands of <hi>Innerweek</hi> are not a proper Military Feu, holding Ward, being
only a Taxed Ward, wherein the word Duties is Taxed yearly, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is Taxed to so much, and so is in the nature of a Feu; neither was
it ever yet found in <hi>Scotland</hi> that a Taxt-ward did fall in Recognition. The
pursuer answered, that the Defense is not Relevant to rule in our Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that alienation of Ward-lands, without the consent of the Superiour,
infers Recognition, and neither Law nor Custom hath made exception of
Taxt-wards, which have but lately occurred in the time of King <hi>Iames,</hi> who
and King <hi>Charles</hi> were most sparing to grant Gifts of Recognition, whereby
there hath been few Debates or Decisions thereanent, and there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that because the Casuality of the Ward, when it falls, is liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat
and Taxed, or the value of the Marriage, that therefore the Fee is not a
Military Fee, wherein the Vassal is oblieged to assist his Superiour in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
and in War, in the stoutest Obligations of Faithfulness and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
and therefore his withdrawing himself from his Vassallage, and
obtaining another to him, is the greater Ingratitude that the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55692:93"/>
Superior had Taxed the benefite of the Ward, and Marriage, at low rates,
which Casualties, cannot be drawn to prejudge the Superior, of other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualties
but on the contrair, <hi>exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords repelled this Defense.</hi> It was further alleadged, that here was
no offer of a Stranger, but of the Vassals own Grand-child, who now is his
apparent Heir in one half of these Lands, as being the eldest Son of his second
Daughter: and Recognition was never found in such a Case. The Pursuer
answered, that albeit the Defender be now apparent Heir to the Vassal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poner,
yet the Case must be considered, as it was in the time of the Disposition,
when he had an elder Brother, the then Lord <hi>Cranburn</hi> living, and was not
<hi>alioqui successurus:</hi> and the Lords had formerly found; that an alienation of
Ward-lands, by the Earl of <hi>Cassils</hi> to his own Brother, albeit he was his
nearest of Kin for the time, having no Children, yet seing he could not be
esteemed <hi>alioqui successurus,</hi> or Heir apparent, in regard the Earl might have
Children, therefore they found Recognition incurred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords repelled this Defense: 3ly,</hi> It was further alleadged, that there
could be no Recognition, where there was no alienation of the Fee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the the Superiors consent, here there was no alienation of the Fee; because
the Seasine being taken to be holden from <hi>Dirletoun,</hi> of the KING, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
was altogether null, and therefore <hi>Dirletoun</hi> was not Divested, nor
<hi>Cranburn</hi> Invested, for such an Infeftment is ineffectual, and incompleat,
till Confirmation, and could never be the ground of Pursuit, or Defense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any Party. <hi>2ly,</hi> By such an Infeftment, the Superiors consent is a
Condition implyed, for an Infeftment to be holden of the Superior, is null till
Confirming, and implyes as much as if the Seasine had been expresly granted,
<hi>si dominus consenserit,</hi> and so can be no obtrusion, or ingratitude. <hi>3ly, Craig</hi>
in his <hi>Dieges. de recognitionibus,</hi> Reports the Decision of the Lords betwixt
<hi>Mckenzie</hi> and <hi>Bane,</hi> whereby they found, that the Seasine being unregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat,
was null, and inferred no Recognition, <hi>quia non spectatur affectus, sed
effectus;</hi> yet that was but an extrinsick nullity, much more here, the Seasine
being intrinsically null. The Pursuer answered, <hi>First,</hi> That if this ground
hold, there could be no Recognition, except by subaltern base Infeftments
holden of the Vassal, in which there is far lesse ingratitude, there being no
new Vassal obtunded, nor the Vassal withdrawing himself from his Clientel,
nor any prejudice to the Superior, because subaltern Infeftments would
exclude none of the Casualities of the Superiority, yet such Alienations,
exceeding the half of the Fee, do unquestionably infer Recognition, though
the ingratitude be no more then this, that the Vassal renders himself unable
fitly to serve his Superior, by delapidating his Fee, or the Major part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
how much more, when he does all that in him is, to withdraw himself
from the Superiors Clientel, by obtruding to him a Stranger, alienating
from him the whole Fee, and albeit the Seasine be null, as to other effects,
till it be Confirmed: Yet as <hi>Craig</hi> observes in the foresaid place, <hi>Vassalus
fecit quantum in se erat. 2ly,</hi> Though by our Statute, or peculiar Custom,
such Seasins unconfirmed are null; yet by the Act of Parliament 1633.
Anent Ward holdings, Recognition is declared to proceed according to
common Law, which can be no other then the common Feudal Customs,
by which Customs it is sure that the Recognition is chiefly inferred by the
Vassals alienation: As to the implyed condition, <hi>si Dominus consenserit,</hi>
though that were expresse, yet the Vassal giving Seasine, the Tradition of
Seasine is inconsistant with such a condition, being understood, as a Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55692:94"/>
condition, for he that delivers Possession <hi>de facto,</hi> cannot be said upon any
condition not to deliver the same <hi>de facto,</hi> and therefore it is but <hi>protestalio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria
facto,</hi> and if it be understood as a resolutive condition, as needs it must,
it impedes not the Alienation, but only might resolve the same. As to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
upon the not Registration of the Seasine <hi>una herundo non facit ver,</hi> and
albeit it might be a rule in that individual Case. It cannot be extended <hi>ad alios
casus,</hi> although it were a Statute, much lesse a Practick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords also repelled this Defense. 4ly,</hi> It was further alleadged by the
Defender, that <hi>Dirletouns</hi> Infeftment was granted by the KING, <hi>Haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
&amp; assignatis quibuscunque,</hi> and thereby the KING consented, that he
should dispone his Right to any Assigney, or singular Successor, and this
Clause is equivalent to the ordinar Feudal Clauses, <hi>Vassallo &amp; quibus dederit,</hi>
which is ever understood to exclude Recognition, neither can this be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be <hi>stilus curiae,</hi> as when Assigneys are casten in in Charters passing
the Exchequer; but this is an original Grant under the KINGS own Hand.
The Pursuer answered, that this Defense ought to be Repelled, because such
Concessions, contrair to common course of Law, are <hi>stricti juris,</hi> and not to
be extended <hi>ad effectus non expressos praesertim prohibitos,</hi> but the adjection of
Assigneys is no ways to allow Alienations of the Fee, without consent, but
to this effect, because <hi>Feuda</hi> and <hi>Benficia</hi> are in themselves <hi>stricti juris,</hi> and
belong not to Assigneys, unlesse Assigneys be expressed; and therefore albeit
no Infeftment had been taken, the Disposition, Charter, or Precept could
not be Assigned: so that this is adjected, to the end that those may be As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
before Infeftment, but after Infeftment, Assignation hath no effect, and
this is the true intent of Assigneys. In Dispsitions of Land, it is clear,
when the Disponer is obliged to Infeft the Acquirer his Heirs, and Assigneys
whatsoever, there is no ground whereon to compel him to grant a second
Infeftment to a new <unclear>Assigney</unclear>; but only to grant the first Infeftment to that
Person himself, or to any Assigney whatever, which clears the Sense in this case.
It hath also this further effect, that singular Successors thereby
might have right to a part of the Lands, which though it would not infer
Recognition if done, yet if there were no mention of Assigneys it would be
null, and as not done in the same Case as a Tack, not mentioning Assigneys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords Repelled this also. 5ly,</hi> It was further alleadged, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition
takes only place, where there is contempt and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and so no Deed done through ignorance infers it, as when it
is dubious whether the Holding be Ward or not; and therefore Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
cannot be inferred, seing there is so much ground here to doubt, this
Right being a taxed Ward, and to his Heirs and Assigneys, and it is not
clear, whether it would be incurred through a Seasine <hi>à se,</hi> or to one in his
Family, whereupon the wisest of men might doubt, much more <hi>Dirletoun</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
illiterate, not able to read or write. It was answered, <hi>ignorantia juris ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem
excusat. 2ly, Vbi est copia peritorum ignorantia est supina: Here Dirletoun</hi>
did this Deed clandistenly, without consulting his ordinar Advocats, or any
Lawyers, and so was inexcusable; and if pretence of ignorance could suffice,
there could be no Recognition, seing it cannot misse to be ignorance that
any should do that Deed that will be ineffectual, and losse their Right.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled this Defense, and all the Defenses joyntly, and Decerned.</p>

Father, and Assignation thereto, by his Father to him, against
the said <hi>Marjory,</hi> producer thereof. It was alleadged no delivery, because
the Assignation, in favours of the Pursuer, was never delivered, but keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

seing the Pursuer is a Bastard. <hi>2ly,</hi> The conception of the Assignation is to the
Pursuer and his Heirs; which failzing, to the said <hi>Marjory,</hi> and her Heirs, and
he being now Minor, ought not to dispose of the Sum in her prejudice.</p>

the Defender, <hi>primo, Minor non tenetur placitare de Haereditate Paterna.</hi> The
Defender is Minor, and now the Question of Reduction is, upon her Fathers

is of the Disposition made to the Minor, whether valid or not, but where the
Question is not upon the Minors Right, but upon the Fathers Right; which
Right of the Fathers, or Predecessors, the Minor is not holden to Dispute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords repelled this Defense, in respect of the Reply. 2dly.</hi> It was alleadged
absolvitor, because the Pursuer having only a Personal Provision, in his Fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
conceived in the Contract of Marriage, and there being as yet, no Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Heirs Male, the maxime, that no deed upon Death-bed, can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to Heirs, can be extended to none, but such as are Special Heirs, and
not to those who are by destination Heirs, which is less then if a Charter had
been granted to the Heir Male, which according to <hi>Craigs</hi> Opinion, is but as
<hi>nudum pactum,</hi> and an uncompleat Right and could not compell the Heirs of
Lyne, to Resign: The Pursuer answered, that the maxime is general, and there
is no Distinction by Law, or Custome; whatsoever the Heirs be, so that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
having a Right to Heretable Bonds, bearing Clause of Infeftment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
no Infeftment had followed, could do nothing upon Death-bed in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Heirs, who would have succeeded unto those Bonds, as to <hi>Craigs</hi>
Opinion of a Charter, it is against Law, and the common Opinion now receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that a Charter, or any Provision in Write is effectual against the granter,
and his Heirs to compel them to compleat the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords repelled this Defense. 3ly.</hi> It was alleadged, absolvitor, because
the maxime, can be only understood of the Heir of Lyne, as nearest of blood,
so that nothing can be effectually done in their prejudice, but here the Diposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is but in prejudice of an Heir Male, and in favours of an Heir of Lyne, in
respect of whom the Heir of Male is but a Stranger, which is the more clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this maxime being very ancient, was produced before their was any Heir
Male, or of Tailzie; and because the Reason of the Law is founded upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Obligation, Parents and Predecessors have, of providing their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
and so can do them no prejudice: especially, when they are weak, and on
Death-bed. The Pursuer answered, as before, that the maxime is general; and there
is no distinction introduced by Law or Custome of Heirs Male: and albeit the
Law had introduced such Heirs since this Common Law; yet in so far as it
makes them Heirs. It gives them the Priviledge of Heirs, to which the Reason
of the Law doth well Quadrat, which is not that Natural Obligation, but
this presumption of Law, that Persons on Death-bed are facile, and weaker
in their Capacities then at other times, and therefore the Law disables them
at that time, to alter the Setlment of their Estates, as they were in their
Health; and so allows of no deed, in prejudice of any Heir of whatsoever kind,
although in favours of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords repelled this Defense. 4ly.</hi> It was alleadged, that the Defunct,
having himself constitute this interest of the Heir Male, had reserved this
power to himself, to alter it during his life, can signifie nothing, unless it
Impower him to do it on Death-bed, because, without any such Reversion, he
might have altered the Tailzie, during his <hi>Leigpoustie.</hi> The Pursuer answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Pactum privatorum non derogat jure communi;</hi> Therefore this being a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
part of our common Law, anterior to either Act of Parliament, or
Practique, no privat Provision, or Reversion can capacitat any Person to
do that which the Law declares void; especially, being upon a Reason of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and infirmity, which is presumed in Persons on Death-bed, <hi>presumptione
juris &amp; de jure,</hi> admitting no contray probation, for it will not be admitted,
to prove that the Disponer was in perfect soundnesse of mind, and therefore,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55692:101"/>
if any Person should reserve a Power to Dispone, though he were not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos
mentis:</hi> the Reservation would signifie nothing, so here neither is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
word adjected, <hi>etiam in articulo mortis,</hi> or on Death-bed, and so
cannot be extended to that case and can reach only to what is done law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<hi>legittimo tempore &amp; modo,</hi> and there is far lesse inconvenience, that
a Cause should be superfluous, which is very ordinary, then that it should
extend to take away common Law, neither is the Provision adjected as an
expresse condition upon which the Tailzie was made, and no otherwise.</p>
               <p>The Lords repelled also this defense, in respect of the Reply, and so having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
all the Defenses, and Disputes in the afternoon, albeit the Parties had ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed

against him as behaving himself as Heir, by intromission with the Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

that the Defunct was a Person who could have an Heir, as to
Heirship Moveable, as being Prelat, Baron or Burgess, and if the Lands
of <hi>Foules</hi> be condescended on: It is offered to be proven, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuded
by Appryzing, before his Death to which Appryzing he had Right
before he was Apparant Heir, being Tutor to another, who was Apparant
Heir for the time, and therefore the Defender has neither behaved himself
as Heir, by Intrommission with the Moveable Heirship, or the Rents of
the Defuncts Lands. <hi>3dly.</hi> The Defender died Rebel, and his Escheat
Gifted, and Declared, and so <hi>nihil habuit in se bonis,</hi> and could have no

               <p>THe Lady <hi>Milntoun</hi> pursues the probation of a Tenor of a Bond granted
by <hi>Maxwel</hi> of <hi>Calderwood,</hi> her Husband, bearing, that in respect of his
Facility he might be induced to dispose of his Wifes Liferent, and thereby
redact them both to want and misery; therefore he oblieges himself not to
dispose thereof without his Wifes consent, seing he had no means but what
he got by her, hereupon she used Inhibition, which she now produces as
an Adminicle, and craves the Tenor of the Bond to be made up by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
The Defender having alleadged. that there behoved here to be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
and proven a special <hi>causus omissionis,</hi> because albeit it were proven
that such a Bond once was, yet unless it were also proven how it was
lost, it must be presumed to have been given back to the Husband, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thereof, whereby he is liberat, and this is the course observed in the
Tenors of all Bonds of borrowed Money. The Pursuer answered, that
this was not like a Bond of borrowed Money, the intent whereof is, not to stand
as a constant Right, but to be a mean to get payment; but this Bond by its tenor
was to stand as a constant Right, to preserve the Dilapidation of the Liferent,
and so cannot be presumed to have been quite by redelivery thereof; albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
it had been in the Husbands hands.</p>
               <p>The Lords before answer to this Dispute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what the effect of this Write would be, if it were made up; for

               <p>The Pursuer condescended upon the effect thereof thus, that it would
be effectual as an Interdiction published by the Inhibition, to annual and
reduce the Disposition of the Pursuers Liferent, made by her Husband,
without her consent, in favours of <hi>Milntoun,</hi> her Step-son 2. This Bond
being accessory to the Contract of Marriage betwixt the same, and the
Marriage is <hi>pactum dotale,</hi> and must have the same effect, as if it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Contract of Marriage; and so is a Provision for Securing
of the Pursuers Liferent to her self, and that no Deed by her Husband,
without her own consent, should be effectual. The Defender alleadged
that none of these Condescendences could be effectual, not the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if the foresaid Bond were an Interdiction, it would have no effect,
unless it were instructed that the granter thereof were <hi>prodigus,</hi> and if it

Disposition of her Liferent.</p>
               <p>The Lords after they had Reasoned the several Points, <hi>in jure,</hi> and found
that without the offer, the Bond could not be consistent as an Interdiction, in
so far as concerned the Husband to annul the Disposition, but were inclined to
Sustain the same for the Wife, in so far as might extend to a competent Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Husband: Yer they found the offer so reasonable, to Repay the Sum Payed for
the Liferent, being 5000. merks, and the Liferent it self being eight Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of <hi>New-lesly</hi> and <hi>Syde.</hi> The Defender answered to the first, that his Father

So the Gift with the Escheat must purge vitious intromission with
Heirship, being before intenting of this Cause. <hi>3ly.</hi> He offers him to prove
that the Heirship moveable was Confirmed promiscuously with the rest of

as well as before intenting of the Cause, and that the Defender

               <p>THe said <hi>Elizabeth</hi> pursued the Executors of her Husband, and insisted
upon several points; First, she craved the Ann, as belonging
wholly to her, seing there was no Children, and the Ann being in favours
of the Wife and Children, the nearest of Kin could have no part thereof.
The Defenders answered, that the Ann was introduced the time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
when the had no Wife nor Bairns, and so did
still most properly belong to the nearest of Kin, who would get it, if
there were neither Wife nor Bairns.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Ann to divide betwixt the Pursuer and the nearest of
Kin.</p>
               <p>The Pursuer insisted next, and alleadged, that a Bond bearing Clausses
of Annualrent and Obliegement to Infeft, behoved either to give a Right to
the half of the Stock, or else to a Terce of the Annualrents.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Clausses of Annualrent and Destination, to exclude
her from the Stock as Heretor, and the want of Infeftment to exclude her
from the Terce of Annualrent.</p>
               <p>The Pursuer insisted in the next place, and produced a Bond granted by
her Father to her Husband, and here the longest liver of them two, and the
heirs procreat betwixt them, without any addition or termination, failzing
these heirs, and without Clausses of Annualrents or Infeftment, and therefore
she claimed the whole Sum as being the longest liver. It was answered, that this
Bond did Constitute in her only a Liferent, according to the ordinar concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and interpretation of that Clause, the longest liver of them two betwixt
man and wife; but especially heirs procreat betwixt them, being mentioned,
which behoved to be the mans heirs, who if they had existed, would have had
right as heirs to their Father, not to their Mother; and therefore the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to be Feear, and the Mother only Liferenter. It was further alleadged,
that beside the Liferent, the Pursuer behoved to have right to the half of the
Stock, because the sum being moveable, albeit the Tenor of the Bond made
it payable to the Relict for her Liferent use, yet she behoved to imploy it so,
as the Stock would remain; which Stock would still be divisible betwixt the
Relict and nearest of Kin, as being moveable.</p>

it was answered, that the Disposition was simulat, <hi>inter conjunctas

The Pursuer answered, that this is but a provision to Children, and could
not be preferred to the Defuncts Creditors, especially being a provision be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Children were existent, and if such should be allowed, it were easie

The Defender answered, that if the Pursuers Debt had been anterior to the

their own Deed. The Pursuer answered that the Bond belonged to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Guild</hi> the Husband, <hi>jure mariti,</hi> and was recovered by his Heirs and
Executors, already from the Defender; and therefore this being <hi>legatum

it, by Liberation; and which failzing, the principal Legacy stands, and
must be fulfilled and adduced, a Decision the last Session, betwixt

was ordained to be made up by the Executor, out of the Moveables.
The Defenders answered, that their Defenses stood yet Relevant; for
Legacies being poor Donations, did not carry warrandice, so that a thing

the value thereof to the Lagator; but where he leaved it as his own, and
his knowledge of the Right of another, appears not there, as in all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
the Legator hath it upon his peril, without warrandice; as if a
Testator should leave a Bond, or sum, to which he had right by Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if it were found that there were a prior Assignation intimat, and so
the sum Evicted, the Lagator would have no remeid: Or if he left a
sum due by a Bond, defective in some necessar Solemnity, as wanting
Writer and Witness, such Bond failing, the Legator could not return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

The Defender answered absolvitor, because by the missive produced, he
offered him to become the Pursuers Debitor, for the sum due by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Pursuer to Intimat to him, or his Friends at <hi>Falkland,</hi> whether he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>MR. <hi>Iames Farquherson</hi> having obtained a Decreet of Spuilzie, against
<hi>Iohn Gairdiner</hi> and others. <hi>Gairdiner</hi> Suspends on this Reason, that
he medled with the Goods in question, as a Souldier in a Party in Arms,
being then in the Regiment of the Master of <hi>Forbes,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Earl of <hi>Midletoun,</hi> and therefore is freed by the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity.
The Charger answered, that he oppons the <hi>Act</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnifying
only these who Acted by Warrand of any Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of Estates, or Commander, or other Authority, so that it is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant,
unless the Suspender alleadge, that as he was a Souldier in Arms,
so he had such Warrand, and did apply the particulars to the publick use,
under which he served: And it is offered to be proven, that he took the
Goods lybelled to his own House, and made use of them to his privat use.
The Suspenders answered, that this Reason stands Relevant as proponed,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55692:111"/>
because it is clear by the Act of Indemnity, that all things done under any
pretended Authority or Command, are Indemnified; and therefore there
is a special Exception of privat Thefts and Robberies, which confirms the
Rule as to publick Pilledging in any War, and if there were a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to every person to instruct the Command, or Warrand of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
which was not accustomed to be in Writ, the whole Act would be
elusory; so that it is sufficient, that the thing was done in the way of
a publick War; otherwise, all that was taken or converted to privat use,
of those that were either with <hi>Montrose</hi> or <hi>Glencairn,</hi> might ly open to
Pursuits, notwithstanding of the Act of Indemnity.</p>
               <p>The Lords after serious Consideration of this, as a leading Case, found the
Reason of Suspension Relevant, that the Defender needed not to prove that he
had Warrant, but that the Warrant was presumed, if he proved he Acted with a
Party in War, against which, they would admit no contrary Probation, unless
it were offered to be proven by the Defenders own Oath, that he did without
any Warrant, converted the Goods to his own privat use.</p>

Legacy being left to be payed, the one half at the Chargers marriage, and
the other half at the Death of the Defuncts Wife; buire no Annualrent,
as neither doth any other Legacy, much less this, being <hi>in diem incertum,</hi>
which is equivalent to a Conditional Legacy: For if the Defuncts Wife
had Survived the Legatar, or if she never Marry, nothing will ever be
due. The Charger answered, that this Legacy was in effect <hi>alimentar,</hi>
though not expresly left <hi>eo nomine;</hi> and therefore ought to be profitable,
and that the Lords had been accustomed to give Annualrent in such cases,
as in the case of the Lady <hi>Otter,</hi> and her Daughters. The Suspender
answered, that the case was far different, these being lawful Daughters,
and their Provisions being in lieu of an Estate of Land, and this Charger
being but a Bastard, and come to that age that she may serve for her
Maintainance.</p>
               <p>The Lords considering that the one half of the Sum was payable at the time of
the Chargers Marriage, being a Condition in her own power, and that it was
not favourable to put her to a necessity of Marry: Therefore they sustained Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alrents

that the Clause in favour of <hi>Grant,</hi> who was no Contracter, could not

he had a Reduction of the Certification, upon Minority and Lesion, and
the unwarrantable Extracting of it. The Pursuer answered to the first, that
seing <hi>Swintoun</hi> did use the Pursuers Right, all reall advantages which were
not Personal, but consequent upon the Real Right, and which belonged
not to <hi>Swintoun personaliter,</hi> but as prerended proprietar: do follow the Real
Right it self; and Accresce to the true Proprietar, as if he had acquired a

the Second, oppones the Certification, wherein compearance was made, for
<hi>Wolmet,</hi> and three Terms taken to produce, and no such Defense was alleadged,
as that the Valuation was in a publick Register. To the Third, the Pursuer
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55692:114"/>
needed not know the Wodsetter, because it was an Improper Wodset, the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
Possessing by his Back-bond, as Heretable Possessor, seing the Decreet of
Valuation was at the Heretors instance, it was sufficient to Reduce it against
his Heir; for it would not have been necessar to have called the Wodsetter,
to obtain the Decreet of Valuation, but the then Heretable Possessor: so neither
is it necessar to call the Wodsetter to the Reducing or improving thereof. To
the last, no such Reduction seen nor ready, neither the Production satisfied.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Defense, and <unclear>duplyes</unclear>, in respect of the Certificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which they found to accresce to the Pursuer, but prejudice to the Defender,

used diligence, in the Reduction, they would take it to consideration at the
conclusion of the cause.</p>

from making use of, or instructing his Reason of Compensation. The
Creditors answered, it was most ordinar for the Lords, to make up Minuts by the

being a famous Clerk, his Testimony must make up the Minute, after
which the Lord <hi>Balmirrino</hi> cannot resile from his Reason of Compensation,

<hi>Iohn Steuart</hi> of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> which being <hi>jus superveniens authori,</hi> must accresce to
the Defender, and defend him in this Pursuit. The Pursuer answered to the
<hi>First</hi> Defense, that the Defenders <hi>bona fides</hi> was interrupted, by Process
against him, long before the Years lybelled. <hi>2ly.</hi> Albeit there had been none,
yet this Author, the Earl of <hi>Hooms</hi> Right being reduced in Parliament, his <hi>bona
fides</hi> being <hi>sine omni titulo;</hi> is not sufficient; neither needed the Tacks-man
to be called to the Reduction, but his Right fell <hi>in consequentiam</hi> with the
granter of the Tacks right. The second Defense, It was answered, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
maxime of <hi>jus Superveniens,</hi> has its own <hi>fallancies,</hi> for the Reason of
the maxime is, that when any thing is disponed for a cause onerous, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to the Value thereof: It is always understood, that the Disponer
dispones not only what Right he hath already, but whatever Right he
shall happen to acquire; seing he gets the full Value: and therefore <hi>sixione
juris,</hi> whatever Right thereafter comes in his Person, though it be after the
Acquirers Right, yet it is holden as conveyed by the Acquirers Right,
without any new Deed or Solemnity, but where that Reason is wanting,
it holds not as first, if it appear, that the Cause of the Disposition is not at
the full Value; then it is presumed, that the Disponer only disponed such
Right as he presently had; or if the Disponer deduce a Particular Right:
as an Appryzing, or Tacks. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and either Dispons, but that Right,
<hi>per expressum,</hi> or at least dispones not for all Right he hath or may have,
or does not dispone with absolute Warrandice; In these Cases, the Authors
Right supervening, accresces not to the Acquirer, but himself, may make
use thereof against the Acquirer, much more any other having Right from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55692:116"/>
from him. <hi>2ly.</hi> The maxime holds not, if the Authors Right be Reduced
before he acquire the new Right, in which case, the first Right being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
nothing can accresce thereto, but the Author may acquire any other new
Right, and make use thereof. <hi>3ly,</hi> The maxime hath no place, if the
Author do not acquire a new Right to the land, which could be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and ground of the Tack granted; as if he acquired but the Right
of an Annualrent, which could be no ground of the Defenders Tack,
much more, if he acquire a Right to the Mails and Duties of the
lands, either upon Sentence to make Arrested Goods furthcommand, or
an Assignation, or Disposition of the Mails and Duties made to the Author,
for satisfying of a Debt to him, by the Disponer. This would be no
Right to the land that could accresce to Validat a Tack. The Defender
answered, <hi>First,</hi> that his first Defense was yet relevant, because, albeit his
Authors Right were reduced, he not being called, his Right would be a
sufficient colourable Title, to give him the benefit of a Possessory judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
untill his <hi>bona fides</hi> were interrupted by Process, because his subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
Right is not extinct, till either by way of Action, or Exception, it
be declared extinct; as falling in consequence, with his Authors Right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
seing there is no mention thereof in the Decreet of Reduction. <hi>2ly</hi>
Albeit Diligence had been used, yet if the user thereof insisted not, but
suffered the Defender, to possess <hi>bona fide</hi> seven year thereafter, it revives that
benefit of a new Possessory Judgement.</p>
               <p>The Lords, as to this Poynt, found that the Interruption of the <hi>bona fides</hi> by
Process, did still take the same away, unless it were Prescrived, but found, that
before any Process, the Defense should be relevant; and therefore sustained only
Process, for the year, since the Citation.</p>
               <p>As to the other Defense <hi>in jure.</hi> The Defender answered, that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
stands yet Relevant, notwithstanding all the Fallacies alleadged
which are without warrant in Law, and without example with us, where
this Maxime hath ever been held unquestionable, that <hi>jus Authoris accrescit
Successori,</hi>
unlesse the Successors Right be expresly limited, to a particular
Right, or to any Right the Author then had, but the Defender needs not
Disput the Equivalence of the Cause, unlesse such expresse Limitation
were, added there is no ground to presume an Exception upon the
Personal oblidgment of Warrandice, from fact and deed, which oftimes is
put in Contracts fully onerous, but on the contrair, there is a several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
upon that very Clause: that the Earl of <hi>Hoom,</hi> whatever Right he should
acquire, yet if he should make use of it against this Defender, he comes
against his own Warrandice, whereby he is oblidged, that he has done, nor
shall do no deed prejudicial to the Defenders Tack, neither is there any
ground of Exception; albeit the Authors Right was reduced, before the
new Right acquired from that ground, that the new cannot accresce unto the
old Right, being Extinct, because the Maxime bears, that it accresces <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessori,
non jure Successoris;</hi> so that albeit the new Right do not Validat the
old Right: yet the new Right becomes the Defenders Right, <hi>eo momento,</hi>
that it became the Authors Right, <hi>per fictionem juris,</hi> without deed or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and cannot be taken away by any subsequent deed of that Author,
more then if before such a deed, he had particularly established his Successors
therein; because the fiction of the Law is equivalent to any such establishment,
neither is their any ground of Exception, that the Authors Right Superveening,
is but an Annualrent, which cannot Validat a Tack; because, if the Author
were making use of that Annualrent to poynd the ground, the Defender up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Tack and Warrandice would exclude him, because he could not come
against his own d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed and oblidgment; yea, albeit it were but a Right to the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55692:116"/>
Mails and Duties, <hi>quocunque modo.</hi> The Lords having considered the
Earl of <hi>Hooms</hi> new Superveening Right, and that it was but the Right of
an Annualrent of 300 <hi>lib. Starling,</hi> with a Clause, that incase of failzie of
payment, he might uplift the hail Mails and Duties till he were payed, and
that the Defenders Tack included only Personal Warrandice. <hi>They repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Defense, and found that such a Right could not accresce to the Defender,
to validat his Tack, wherein some of the Lords had respect to that point that
the Right was Reduced before this new Right; but others, as it seems, on better
grounds layed no weight on that if the cause onerous, had been the full value, and
equivalent, or if the Tack had born for all Right that I have, or shall acquire,
which would accresce to the Successor, as oft as ever it was acquired, though all
the prior Rights had been reduced, but in this Case, the Author not acquiring a
new Right to the Lands, but only to the Mails and Duties, which in effect is
but Personal, it could not accresce to the Defender, more then if the Author had
been Factor to a thrid Part by the new Right, and albeit the Clauses of Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Warrandice might have Personally excluded the Earl of</hi> Hoom <hi>himself, yet
seing, that Right could accresce to the Defender, the Earl of</hi> Hoom <hi>having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunced,
or assigned it to a thrid Partie. The Personal Objection against the Earl
of</hi> Hoom <hi>upon the Personal Clause of Warrandice ceases, neither did the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer

being Contracted with her in Tochar, and <hi>Blackhall</hi> granted a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

his Son was induced to give Bond for this 2000 merk, to take away 2000
merk of the Tochar: and it was remembred by some of the Lords, that in
the like Case, a discharge of a part of a Sons Provision granted to his Father,
contrair to his Contract of Marriage was found Fraudulent and null, by excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>The Baillies found, that this qualitie adjected in the Oath, that the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture

which they found probable by Write, or Oath of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> who having depon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

Against which her Reason of Reduction is, that she ought to have been As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soilzied by the Baillies, because her Oath did not prove the lybel. <hi>viz.</hi> That
she bought the Wair from <hi>Cornelius,</hi> or made her self Debitor, therefore,
but only that she received the same from him without any Contract, or
Ingadgment, which would never make her Debitor, for a Wife, or a Bairn

but only the Father; and in the same manner, the Mourning for the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls

Defender answered, that the Reason was no ways Relevant, seing the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers
Oath proved the receipt of the Goods, which was sufficient <hi>ad

The Son being the Fathers ordinar Merchant.</p>
               <p>The Lords found, that the Oath before the Baillies proved not the lybel, and

Rectification to have more. They also sustained not the first Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

in so far as extended to an <hi>enorme lesion</hi> beyond the latitude of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts

that albeit the Right, if it were compleat, would be real; yet this
Action for obtaining thereof, is but Personal; for real Actions are such
only which proceed upon real Rights, and against the Ground, such as
upon Annualrents; and therefore this being a Personal Action, might
be excluded, or qualified by a Personal Exception upon the Back Bond.</p>

               <p>THe Earl of <hi>Sutherland</hi> pursues a Declarator against <hi>Hugh Gordoun</hi>
his Vassal, that his Right being holden Feu, two terms has run
into the third, and thereby the Right is extinct, not only by the Act of

in the Disposition, whereupon his Charter and Seasine proceeds. There is
also called an Apprizer, who alleadged, that he being a singular Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor

is not oblieged to possess, and cannot omit his Right by his Authors
fault, or by his own Ignorance.</p>
               <p>The Lords having considered this Case, and reasoning amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
upon the difference of a Clause Irritant, in an Infeftment Feu,
and the benefit of the Act of Parliament, they found that if the Pursuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon the Act of Parliament, the Defender might purge the Failzie
by payment at the Bar, but if he insisted upon the Clause in the Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it behoved to be considered, whether that Clause was in the real
Right, by the Charter and Seasine, either specially or generally, under
the provisions contained in the Disposition: Or if it was only in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
               <p>In which case, though it might operat against the Vassal, or his Heirs,
yet not against the Appryzer, unless the Seasine had been immediatly upon

Colluded with the Defender, and gave him a voluntar infeftment, the next

be drawn back to his Charge and Diligence, and he preferred. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
answered, that the Reason ought to be Repelled, because the weight
of the Reason is the Pursuers Diligence, and the Superiours Collusion, which
hold not, because all the Diligence Sir <hi>William Dick</hi> did, was the first Charge
upon the Letters of four Forms, which bear only with Certification, that in

               <p>The Lords found that the first Charge was sufficient, in this case, where
the Superiour gave an Infeftment before the Expyring of the first Charge,
and before the second Charge could be given, and thereby that a Superiour
might prefer an Appryzer, though posterior to a prior, do what Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
the prior could. But they found, that seing Sir <hi>William Dick</hi> had been
silent, until his Legal Reversion was Expyred, and had not challenged the
Defender, who was in Possession, and thereby had Excluded him from the
benefit of Redemption competent to him, if he had been found to be but the

the Defender having protested for Reservation, <hi>contra producenda.</hi> It is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
verified, that the Grand-Father died not in the Right of the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but that he was denuded by Disposition to his Son, instructed by his
Charter produced. The Pursuer answered, that he opponed the state of
the Process. And if such a Defense were now competent, it ought to be
Repelled, because he hath Right from Sir <hi>Iohn Vrquhart,</hi> who is Heir
Served and Retoured to his Father, in whose favours his Grand-father was
Denuded, and has declared, that he consents to the Declarator upon that
Ground, and Renounces all other Right. The Defender an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the order having been only used upon the Adjudication from
<hi>Vrquhart,</hi> as Heir to his Grand-father, if that be excluded, albeit the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
have another Right, he must use the Order, <hi>de novo,</hi> and redeem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
<hi>2ly.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Vrquharts</hi> Right produced Renounces, but does not
Dispone any Right to the Pursuer.</p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the state of the Process, found that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
instantly verified, is receiveable <hi>post conclusum in causa,</hi> unless it were
alleadged to have been known to the Proponer, and <hi>dolose</hi> omitted; by
which the Pursuer might be put to a Duply, suffering new Probation.
But the Lords found that the Charter produced, bearing the Grand-father
to be Denuded, did not instantly verifie, because it expressed not <hi>Balmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi>
and would not allow a Term to prove, part and pertinent.</p>
               <p>It was further alleadged by the Defender, no Declarator till the Sums
consigned were reproduced at the Bar; especially, seing it was offered to be

was the immemorial custom that the first buyer from the Fishers, should
be lyable to the Bishop of the <hi>Isles,</hi> for the Teind of the Fish, bought, and
for proving thereof, produced a Decreet at his Predecessors instance, against

Corns in the Mercat, or Barn-yeard; but if any body should buy the whole
Cropt, when it was upon the Land untaken off, being in the Sheaves or
Stoucks, he would undoubtedly be lyable as Intrometter for the Teind: so
if any Merchant bought not upon the place, where the Fishes were taken,
he was not lyable: but buying the Fish fresh, as they were taken, in whole
Boat-fulls, and selling them there themselves; such Merchants must be liable
as Intrometters. The Defender answered, that the Immemorial custom was
indeed Relevant, but a Decreet against some few Persons, could not prove
it against others, being <hi>inter alios actum.</hi> But here there was only a Decreet
bearing, that there was a former Decreet, in which that was proven.</p>

that, because the <hi>Act</hi> bears expresly, <hi>That such Appryzing shall come in</hi> pari

return the Bond to its first condition, before the Appryzing: So that the
Bond being since 1641. the Relict is excluded; and the Charge cannot

the Heir is constitute Debitor; and so cannot be thought to be Creditor
in the same Clause.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the conception of the Clause, that the Brother, by falling
now Heir, was excluded; seing it was clear, by the meaning of the Defunct,
that his Heir should have his Lands, and his Bairns of his second Marriage,
should have, though but one, 4000 merks: but here the Heir, of the

of contra <hi>Meldrum;</hi> yet as to the Solemnity of Acts
to the Law, and Custom of the Place, where such Acts are done, takes
place, as where an Act is done in <hi>Scotland:</hi> albeit it be only probable by Writ,

though it were of the greatest moment, and though the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
in Writs of Importance, requires the Subscription of the Partie before
Witnesses, or of two Nottars, and four Witnesses: yet Writs made in <hi>France</hi>

and <hi>Holland,</hi> by the Instrument of one Nottar, are valid; so here there being
no difference from the Law of <hi>Scotland:</hi> which always preferres Executors
nominat, before nearest of Kin; and the difference only as to the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and manner of Probation, that there it may be proven by Witnesses,
there was a Nomination, and here only by Writ.</p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the Reasons, and former Decisions, preferred
the Executors, confirmed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for they found, that the Question was not
here of the manner of Probation, of a Nomination, In which case, they would
have followed the Law of the Place, but it was upon the Constitution of the essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
of a Right, viz. A nomination, which, albeit it were certainly known to have
been by word; yea, if it were offered to be proven by the nearest of Kin, that
they were Witnesses thereto, yet the Solemnitie of writ not being interposed, the
Nomination is in it self defective, and null <hi>in substantialibus.</hi>

Ianuary 26. 1665.</head>
               <p>THe Heretors having Salmond Fishing in the Water of <hi>Don,</hi> above
<hi>Aberdeen,</hi> pursue a Declarator of their Right of Salmond Fishing;
and that they ought to be Free of the prejudice sustained by the
Cruives built at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and insist upon these Particulars. That the Town
of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> hath no Right to Cruives, but is only Infeft <hi>cum piscationibus &amp;
piscarijs,</hi> and within such a bounds, which cannot carry Salmond Fishing,
being <hi>inter regalia,</hi> much less Cruives. It was answered, that such a Clause
granted to an Incorporation, or Community, or being in <hi>Baronia,</hi> with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial
Possession is sufficient; and that there is a later Right granted to
the Town, with power of Cruives, within the said Bounds, <hi>uti possidebantur.</hi>
It was answered, that the Pursuers had their Cruives established before that
time.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Town of <hi>Aberdeens</hi> Title to Cruives, albeit conceived,
but conform to the first Clause, with long Possession was sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> The Pursuers insisted against the Transporting of the Cruives from one
place to another, which they could not do; Cruives being a Servitude,
<hi>strictissimi juris:</hi> as a way being once chosen, and fixed, cannot be changed:
especially, in respect of the Clauses <hi>uti possidebantur.</hi> It was answered; that
there being a Bounds expressed, and mentioning Cruives to have been there
before, the meaning can be no other, then that these Cruives should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
if Inundations alter the present stans, and <hi>uti possidebantur</hi> is
only understood of the way of building, as before.</p>
               <p>The Lords found, by the said Clause that the Cruives might be Trasplanted
within the Bounds having but one Cruive Dyck, and the former Dyck demolished,
so that the Fishings above be in no worse condition then formerly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> They insisted for the wydnesse of the Heeks, whereanent it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged,
that by an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth, Hecks were
appointed to be five Inches wyde; which is confirmed, by an <hi>Act</hi> 1661. It
was answered, that the <hi>Act</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> the 4th. did relate to a former
<hi>Act</hi> of King <hi>Davids,</hi> which was not to be found, but there were two <hi>Acts</hi> by
King <hi>Iames</hi> the 3. Relating to the old <hi>Act</hi> by King <hi>Alexander,</hi> which
was found to bear three Inch. So that the <hi>Act</hi> K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 4th. though

               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:55692:135"/>
The Lords found, it was a mistake, in the writing of the Act; and that
in the stead of <hi>King David,</hi> it should have expressed <hi>King Alexander;</hi> and so
born only three Inches, seing otherwayes five Inch would let the greatest part of
Salmond passe.</p>
               <p>

the whole Cruives might stand open: So that no Fish might be taken
thereby; according to the old Statute of <hi>King Alexander;</hi> from the Even Sun
on <hi>Saturnday,</hi> till the Sun rising on <hi>Munday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords found, that the <hi>Saturndays</hi> slop ought to be of the whole Cruives, and
that from <hi>Saturnday</hi> at six a clock, till <hi>Munday</hi> at Sunrising.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5ly.</hi> They Insisted for the Hight of the Cruives, and alleadged, that
the same ought to be no higher then the water, in its ordinar Course, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the time of the Flood, nor of Drought; otherwayes they might build
the same as high as they pleased, and that it ought not to be builded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,
which will hinder the Salmonds up-coming, but slopping from
the Ground to the top.</p>
               <p>The Lords considering, that there was no particular Law, as to the hight of
Cruives, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hir Parties had suffered the other to enjoy the Cruives above
40. Years, that therefore the same should be <hi>uti possidebantur,</hi> no higher then
the old Cruives were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6ly.</hi> They Insisted for the Liberty of the Midlestream, beside and attour <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turndays</hi>
Slop, which is specially contained in the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>King
Alexander,</hi> and <hi>King Iames</hi> the third and fourth, and is renewed in the
late <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>King Charles</hi> the second. The least quantity of
which bears, <hi>That five foot of the middle Stream must be constantly free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was answered 1. That the old <hi>Acts</hi> anent the midle Stream were
wholly in desuetude, and were in effect derogate, by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>King Iames</hi>
the sixt, anent Cruives; which ordains the <hi>Saturndays</hi> Slop to be keeped, but
mentions not the midle Stream. And as for the late <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> it
was Impetrat by these same Parties, and never past in Articles, or noticed
by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> but as an ordinar Confirmation. It was answered, that
there was no prescription of publick Rights, against standing Laws,
and albeit the desuetude of such Laws could be effectual, yet the
late Law Revives and Confirms them all, <hi>per expressum,</hi> which is not a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Confirmation; bearing mention of any particular Partie, or particular
Right; but as a general Confirmation of general Laws, anent all the Cruives
in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords considering that the midle Stream has been long in desuetude, and that
this late Ratification was past without notice; therefore, before answer; They
Ordained the Parties to adduce Witnesses, whether the midestream was accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any Cruives in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and whether the same would be beneficial, or
hurtful to the Salmond Fishing of the Kingdom, in general, and whether it were
destructive to the Cruives in Common: and likewise, they gave Commission to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Witnesses <hi>hinc inde,</hi> whether their new Cruives were builded upon chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,

for their Pupils Rent, which are in Tennents hands; yet not for the
Annualrent of their Money, being in secure hands then, and now if the
Tutor had lifted it, it would have been lost he being broken; and the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
also: and the Debitors being great men, as the Marquess of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>

               <p>The Lords found, that Tutors were oblidged to uplift their Pupils Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
though the Creditors were secure, and to imploy them for Annualrents,

she had carried her self unchastly, and born another Bairn; albeit it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

from <hi>Fairholm,</hi> till <hi>Williamson</hi> was broken, so that first, <hi>Fairholm</hi> is free,

whereby <hi>Fairholm</hi> was hindred to draw his Provisions out of <hi>Williamsons</hi>

<hi>Fairhlom,</hi> and <hi>Williamson,</hi> might at his option, take himself to either, or to
both; and cannot be accompted to have done any fault, in forbearance

at</hi> Williamsons <hi>conveniency:</hi> So that <hi>Pallat</hi> has not failed, in the strick
observance of the Order. And if need be, <hi>Pallat</hi> offers him to prove, by
the custom of Merchants, in the most eminent places abroad, that such Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
did never liberat the Writer. And <hi>Fairholm</hi> offered to prove, that
such Letters did liberat the Writer, unless the receiver had protested,
and intimat to the Writer, that he would not acquiesce therein simply, but
also in the Credit of the Writer.</p>
               <p>The Lords found, that the Letter did not liberat <hi>Fairholm,</hi> notwithstanding

               <p>THe Magistrats of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> having deposed Sir <hi>William Thomson</hi>
Town Clerk, from his Office, on this ground, That a Tack of
the new Imposition, and Excise being set to their Tacks-men, (which was
to have been subscribed by him, as Clerk, for the Deacons of the Crafts,) he
had given it up to the Tacks-man, and had not taken their subscription
thereto, neither to their own double, nor taken another double for the
Town, albeit the Tack duty was fourscore thousand merks yearly, for two
years; and that it being an uncertain casuality, the value of it was most
difficult to prove, and not but by the Tacks-mens own Oath. Sir <hi>William</hi> raised
Reduction, on several Reasons, especially that the sentence was unjust, in so
far as it was the puting on of an exorbitant, and incommensurable punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of deprivation from an Office of so great Value, upon a Fault of
meer negligence, or escape: and that before the Sentence, the Tack-dutie
was all payed, but four monethes, and now all is payed, and
that Sir <hi>William</hi> was still willing for to have made up the Towns dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.
It was answered, that here was no Process to put a punishment
commensurable on a Fault, but Sir <hi>William</hi> having, by the free Gift of
the Town had so profitable a place for his life, upon consideration of his
Fidelity and Diligence, there is implyed in it, as effectualy, as if exprest,
that it is <hi>ad vitam aut ad culpam:</hi> so that the cognoscing of the Fault is
the termination of the Gift freely given, so if their be a fault Justly
found by the Town, they might well take back their Gift, they gave up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that condition implyed, for it was not the loss <hi>in eventu;</hi> nor <hi>dolus
in proposito,</hi> that made such a Fault; else all negligences imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
would not make it up, though a Servant should leave his Masters
House, and Coffers open, if nothing happened to follow; yet the
Fault was the same, and could not be taken away, by making up the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
but here was a Fault of knowledge and importance: for Sir <hi>Wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could not by meer negligence, nor ommission give away the Tack to the
Tacks-men, and neither see them subscribe their own double, or any other,
nor subscribe himself, this Fault was likeas in his Office, he had a particular
gratuitie, as Clerk to the excise.</p>
               <p>The Lords repelled the Reason of Reduction, and found the Sentence
not to be unjust, upon this ground; because they thought that Sir <hi>William</hi>
being a common Servant, who by his Act of admission, had specially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged
never to quarrel the pleasure of the Magistrats, they, as all Masters
have a latitude, in cognoscing their Servants Faults, wherein, though they
might have been wished to forbear rigor, yet having done it by
their power, as Masters over their Servants; The Lords could not
say they had done unjustly, but found that the committing such a
Fault terminat their free Gift, being of knowledge and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
but found that if it could be proven, that the Tack was
duelie subscribed, and lost thereafter, which was not of knowledge,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55692:142"/>
but of meer omission, incident to any Person, of the greatest diligence,
they would not find that a sufficient ground to depose him.</p>

of the Earl of <hi>Hoom</hi> himself<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Person, but in general, all Right; and so is but a privat Right, impetrat from
the Parliament, without hearing of Parties; and therefore falls under the
Act of Parliament, <hi>salvo jure.</hi> And as to the former Interlocutor of the Lords.
The reason why the Lords sustained the said Rescissory Act, was because
they found themselves not competent to Judge, as to Sentences of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or to annul the same, upon the not calling of the Parties, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that the Act <hi>salvo</hi> 1621. relates to Ratifications; but not to such Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
as this: but by Act <hi>salvo,</hi> 1633. It is expresly declared, that that
Act, and all former Acts <hi>salvo,</hi> should not only extend to Ratifications; but
to all other privat Acts impetrat without hearing of Parties, and prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to other Parties Rights: and therefore now the Lords ought to proceed
upon the Parties Right, without consideration of that Act Rescissory.</p>

Dishabilitation of their Children, so that the Parliament doing nothing
prejudicial to any Parties Right, but restoring <hi>Iohn Stewart</hi> to his just

upon <hi>Iohn Stewarts</hi> Dishabilitation, and with it the Defenders Tack.</p>

the Act of Parliament, 1633. be much larger then the Act <hi>salvo,</hi> 1621. so
that thereby the Lords might have cognosced upon <hi>John Stewarts</hi> Rehabilitation
as without Citation, if it had wronged any other Persons Right, but finding that
it was an Act of Iustice, wronging no Persons Right, they found the same Relevant.</p>

It was alleadged for <hi>Notman;</hi> 1. That that member of the Libel
was not Relevant, whereby he was pursued, not only for that he Intromet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

he uplifted the same; especially seeing the Ticket bears, that he received

the first, that his Lybel was most Relevant, not only for Intromission, but Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
because a Pro-tutor in Law is oblieged in all points as a Tutor, not only

Intromet, that cannot free him from being lyable passive more then a vitious
Intromettor, or one behaving as Heir; but he ought either to have
forborn, or procured to himself a Tutory dative, and unless Pro-tutors be
universally lyable, Pupils will be destroyed, because any body will meddle
with their Means, knowing they are lyable but for what they meddle
with, and the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against them; but if they be universally lyable, they will either wholly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain,
or orderly Intromet, by procuring a Title: and albeit Overseers be
not lyable in the first place, yet they are <hi>tutores honorari,</hi> lyble after the
other Tutors are discussed. As to the third, the receipt of the Bonds, albeit
it bear in Custody, yet it is proven by the Writs produced, <hi>quod se immiscuit,</hi>
by uplifting the sums contained in some of the Bonds, and therefore is lyable
for the whole.</p>
               <p>The Lords having heard and considered this case at length, found, that
seing there was no Law nor Custom of ours to make a Pro-tutor lyable in

ought to consider the equity and expediency thereof, and therefore they
found, that they could not condemn the Defender for omissions, seing there
is no Antecedent, Law, nor Custom: and therefore found, that as Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer,
he was oblieged to nothing, and that as Intrometter, he was lyable for
what he intrometted with, and the annualrent thereof, after his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and found him lyable for the hail Bonds in his Tickets, seing he
meddled with a part of the Money thereof, and found, that if he had

meddled with a part of the Sheep, that would make him lyable for the whole

as to the matter, or as to the manner of Probation; and in expedience, the
excluding of the Cedents Oath in this case, opens a way for Fraud, that
after Debts are payed, they may be assigned, even freely, and the Debitor
is excluded from his Probation of the payment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>GIdeon Murray</hi> having obtained Decreet against for certain
Merchant Ware, wherein he was holden as confest, and thereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned,
and the Decreet turned in a Libel. The Receipt of the Goods was
found probable, <hi>pro ut de jure,</hi> and was accordingly proven, and the Cause
being concluded, and the Depositions advised. It was alleadged for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>first,</hi> that he produced and instantly verified, that the Pursuer had
granted him a Bond, after the furnishing of the Account of a greater sum,
which must be presumed to have included satisfaction of the Accompt,
<hi>2ly.</hi> The Decreet was more then three year after the furnishing, and so was
not probable by Witnesses; but that manner of Probation was prescribed
by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> The Pursuer answered to the first, that both those
Exceptions were competent and omitted, and now after Probation taken;
there was no reason to sustain that alleadgence, for after <hi>Litiscontestation,</hi>
no new exceptions can be admitted, unless they be instantly verified and
emergent, or at least new come to knowledge, as this is not, for it was
obvious, being founded upon so known a Law, as to the Prescription:
and as to the other, it is but a weak presumption, no way relevant, unless
the posterior Bond had exprest to have been after Compt and Reckoning.
The Defender answered, that the Lords might <hi>ex nobile officio,</hi> repone Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to Defenses, instantly verified, after <hi>Litiscontestation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> and albeit they
ordinarly repone them when the Exceptions are emergent, or new come to
knowledge: yet in other Cases, <hi>ex officio,</hi> they may, as when there is so
pregnant a presumption concurring. <hi>2ly</hi> Albeit Prescription hinder Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
active: Yet seing the Defender was Creditor by Bond, in a greater
Sum. The Pursuer needed not pursue for the Accompt, <hi>quia intus habuit,</hi>
and the other Party might have compensed upon the Bond; and therefore,
as in the Civil Law, <hi>in debitis naturalibus &amp; non civilibus licet non dat actionem dat
tamen exceptionem:</hi> so here the Pursuer may except upon account after three
years.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the presumption not Relevant, and found that the manner
of Probation being prescribed, it could not be made use of, either by Action or
Exception, albeit there was a compensation competent, yet it befell not, <hi>ipso
jure,</hi> seing it was not liquid, but liquidable by the other Parties Oath. But as
to reponing in this state of the Process, though many of the Lords were in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
yet seing the exception was but a Prescription, which is but by positive
Law, and odious, so that the Pursuer might as well have craved to be repon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the Prescription, as the Defender against his omission of a palpable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense,
yet in respect of the Prescription, and that the Party was poor, the Lords

requiring all Writs of importance to be subscribed before Witnesses;
and this Disposition wanted Witnesses. The Defender offered to prove it
was Holograph. The Pursuer Replyed, that the question being <hi>de data,</hi> not
that it was subscribed, but when it was subscribed, whether prior or poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior

was not against the granter of the Writ, or his heir, but against a third

               <p>The Lords before answer, did appoint Witnesses to be examined, <hi>omni

Town Officer, and the other Procuratorfiscal of a Sheriff Court, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
seing there were strong presumptions of fraud, as that nothing follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon this Disposition, that it remained Clandestine for several years,
that thereby the Disponer becoming Bankrupt, had excluded some of his
Creditors, and preferred others, and that there was no <hi>penuria testium,</hi>
seing both thir Witnesses assert they saw it subscribed, and the one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned,
that he Dited it so, that their Names might easily have been insert;
and therefore it must be thought, it was done for some Fraudulent intent,
as to be of an anterior Date to the Inhibition: and therefore in such a case,
the Witnesses should be Persons of Fame, and known Reputation. It was
answered, that the Witnesses adduced, were sufficient, seing they were
above exception. <hi>Frst,</hi> because they were publickly called to the Bar,
and received without any objection, so that now none is competent. <hi>2ly.</hi>
That there is no relevant Exception yet alleadged, for the being a Town
Officer, is no legal Exception, neither to be of a mean condition, nor
to be of a small Estate, if he were worth the Kings Unlaw and for
the presumptions, they were but meer conjectures; for it was free for a
man to make his Disposition all with his own hand, or before Witnesses,

that albeit the Tutor was not lyable to uplift, and imploy the Annualrent
every year, as it was due; yet he was lyable, once in the Tutory: but it is

in their Tutory, to re-imploy the Annualrents of the Pupil; albeit the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor
were secure, but if the Case had been of Rents of Lands, the
Lords thought these ought to have been uplifted yearly, and to be imployed
on Annualrent; but they found the second alleadgance Relevant, not to
free the Tutor of payment of the Annualrent it self, though in secure hands,
because he ought to have uplifted it, and had it ready, but found him free
of the Annualrent thereof, there being a competent time, in which he
might have given it forth, before the Pupillarity past, if he had not been

his Rights were reduced, and they restored to their Possession. The
Earl of <hi>Argyl</hi> produced his Seasine, upon the Kings Gift, with two Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of these Lands, granted to his Father, one in <hi>Anno</hi> 1632. and another
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1639. And thereupon craved to be preferred. <hi>Mcdougals</hi> produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a disclamation of the Process, in name of the Tennents, and alleadged
no Process; because the Tennents, who were pursuers, past from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute.
It was answered, that their names was but used, that the Parties might
discusse their Rights, and so they could not disclame it, being ordinar to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55692:155"/>
use Tennents names in double poyndings. It was answered, that there was
no Reason, that Tennants should be forced to make use of their names, to
intervert their Masters Possession.</p>
               <p>The Lords found, that the Tennants could not disclame; especially the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being but late, by Decreet of Parliament, and was contraverse.</p>
               <p>It was further alleadged for <hi>Mcdougals,</hi> that there was nothing particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
lybelled, as Rents due by the Tennants; and therefore there could be
no sentence.</p>
               <p>The Lords repelled the alleadgeance, and found the Sentence might be in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
to be answered, of the Mails and Duties, as is ordinar in Decreets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>It was further alleadged for <hi>Mcdougals,</hi> that seing this double poynding
was in effect, now used as a Declarator of Right, no Process thereupon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in all Declarators, Law allows the Defenders 21 days upon the first
Summons, and six on the next, that they may prepare, and produce their
Rights; and here there is but one Summons on 6 days. <hi>2ly.</hi> No Process,
because <hi>Mcdougals</hi> being founded upon a Decreet of <hi>Parliament;</hi> my Lord
<hi>Argyl</hi> produces no Title, but only a Seasine not expressing these Lands. <hi>3ly.</hi>
Decreets, especially of <hi>Parliament,</hi> cannot be taken away, but by Reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not thus summarly. It was answered, that my Lord <hi>Argyl</hi> insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here for taking away the pretended Decreet, in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King, and Donatar to the possession of the Lands: so that in effect
it is not so much a Declarator of a Right, as a possessory Judgement. And
as for the Title, it is sufficient to produce a Siasine, seing in the Decreet of <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi>
My Lord <hi>Argyls</hi> Right and possession is quarrelled as wrong, and
therefore was acknowledged to have been, and seing <hi>Mcdougals</hi> produces
no other Right, and the King's Advocat concurres; and if need beis, my
Lord <hi>Argyl</hi> offers to prove the Lands in question, are parts and pertinents
of the Lordship of <hi>Lorn,</hi> exprest in his Seasine: and albeit this be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a Decreet of <hi>Parliament,</hi> yet by Sentence of <hi>Parliament</hi> since, it
is remitted to the Lords, and is in it self visibly null, as having been intent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against my Lord <hi>Argyl,</hi> and pronounced after his death, and Forefaulture

<hi>stricti juris,</hi> and was to be extended to Majors; and as for the warrandice,
it was never sustained as a ground, to exclude a Reduction, because war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randice

the Minors tollerance.</p>
               <p>It was answered, that the Pursuers Reduction, behoved to accresce to him

Liferenter dyed during the Minors Minoritie, he might return to the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the Lords have already found, that the Debitor acknowledging, that he

than he for whose Debt it was Arrested, for in that Case, as the first Creditor that
got the Blank-bond might have caused his Debitor retire that Bond, and give a

she having no other Right, she had possest five or six years after her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands

is not inferred, but where the Homologator cannot but know the Right
Homologat, and can do the Deeds of Homologation no otherwayes, but by
vertue of that Right, neither of which holds here, because the personal
oblidgement in the Contract, was a ground for the Wife to have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her Husbands possession, and would have excluded his Heirs, if they
had quarrelled; and not only the Clause must be presumed to be without
the Womans knowledge, but the Bond it self, and the Infeftment especially,
considering the simplicity of Wives, and their confidence in their Husbands,
who, if this were sustained, would easily deceive them. It was duplyed for the
Defender, that he offers him to prove, that the Pursuer did not continue her
husbands possession, but did begin Possession, her Husband being never in
possession before his death, and that she set two several Tacks, expresly as
Liferenter, and the third, with consent of Mr. <hi>David Thors</hi> her Husband being an
Advocat; and so she cannot be presumed to have been ignorant, but on the

denominat her self Liferentrix, by a personal oblidgement, to Infeft her in
so much Victual and Money, without mentioning any Land in particular,
and her acceptance, though to her detriment, may be the more easily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
because she had two Children surviving her Husband, in whose

she could not return upon Sir <hi>Andrew,</hi> her Husbands Brother, contrare to

ignorance was not to be presumed, but knowledge.</p>

it appears to flow from the Mother, yet that is but <hi>dolose,</hi> and in effect it flows

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55692:165"/>
Retour. This Action of Reduction, and all other Actions competent,
are prescribed. It was answered for <hi>Younger,</hi> that he being Heir to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the right of Blood, which is the most important Right, competent by
the Law of Nations, no Statute, nor positive Law can take it away, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be express and evident, for the right of Blood can never prescrive,
seing it is certain, that a man may serve himself Heir to his Predecessor,
though he died a 1000. years since, if he can instruct his Service. And as
for the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> alleadged upon, they cannot take away any Right
of Blood, for the first <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Prescription,</hi> on three years expresly, bears,
to extend to these within the Countrey, as <hi>Stephenlaw</hi> was not: and
the last <hi>Act</hi> is expresly, only in relation to Retoures, to be deduced
thereafter, but this first <hi>Retour</hi> quarrelled, was deduced long before, <hi>viz.</hi>
in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1608. As for the general <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Prescription,</hi> seing it mentions not
Retoures, but only Infeftments<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Reversions and Heretable Bonds; The
general Clause of all Actions whatsomever, ought not to be extended to
Retoures, especially, seing the meaning of the <hi>Parliament</hi> appears not to
have been extended by them to Retoures, because the very next Act doth
specially Order the prescription of Retoures. As to the <hi>Iohnstouns</hi> Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they have not the benefit of Prescriptions, never being cled with
Possession: For the Liferenters Possession, as it was the Defuncts Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
So it did continue to be the true appearand Heirs Possession,
although none had been Served to this Day; and therefore the Service
or Infeftment following thereupon, cannot take away from the true Heir
the presumptive Possession of Law, which the true Heir hath. <hi>2ly.</hi> No
Prescription can be valid against others: But these that know, or are at
least oblieged to know the Right, whereupon it proceeds; but the true
Heir was not oblieged to know their Service, nor was he oblieged to Serve
himself, but when he pleased, especially seing he could get no benefit as
long as the Liferenter lived, and that he was not oblieged to know the first
Service, appears, because he was not called thereto, otherways then by a
general Citation at the Mercat Cross, to all Parties having Interest, which
is but a point of meer form and prejudges no body, and at least could
not prejudge a Stranger, living out of the Countrey, <hi>animo remanendi,</hi>
there being neither special nor general Citation, as to Persons out of the
Countrey on 60. dayes.</p>
               <p>The Lords found no weight in this last Point, seing the Law requires no
Citation on 60. dayes, in cases of Retoures, but only 15. dayes generally,
at the Mercat Cross, which they find every man, <hi>origine Scotus,</hi> oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take notice of, or to have a Procurator at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni
patriâ,</hi> who may search the Register of Retoures, whether in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Register, or Town Books, before they prescribe. They also found
that there was no ground for Prescription upon the first <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as bearing only relation to these in the Countrey, nor upon the
last <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as bearing only relation Retoures, to be deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereafter, neither did they sustain the Prescription upon the
first part of the general <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Prescription;</hi> for they found the
Liferenters Possession in the Competition of two Heirs, not to
be profitable to either of them, in prejudice of the other, nor
yet to be the Possession of singular Successors, seing it flowed not
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55692:165"/>
from these singular Successors, but from the Defunct, to whom both
Parties pretended to be Heir; but the Lords found the posterior clause
in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> of all Actions whatsomever to extend to the
Reduction of Retoures, and to be general, as to all Actions that may
concern Heirs, in prejudice of others: And found it so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to extend to Retoures, that the next ensuing <hi>Act</hi> finds Retoures to
be Deduced thereafter, only to be Reduceable within twenty years, and
so finds the Reduction thereof to prescrive sooner than other Rights; and
therefore cannot be thought, not to have meaned to reach bygone Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures,

having granted a Bond to <hi>Samuel Veatch,</hi> blank in the Creditors name,
<hi>Samuel</hi> filled up <hi>Marion Geddes</hi> Name therein, whereupon she Registrat the
Bond, and Charged him, in the mean time <hi>Telzifer,</hi> as <hi>Veatches</hi> Creditor,
having Arrested all Sums in <hi>Marjory Sandilands</hi> hands, adebted by her to
<hi>Samuel Veatch,</hi> and pursuing to make the same forthcoming, she depones that
the time of the Arrestment, she was no wayes Debitor to <hi>Veatch,</hi> but by a
Bond blank in the Creditors Name, and that she did not know whose
Name was filled up in it: But now <hi>Telzifer</hi> the Arrester compearing,
craves to be preferred, because he had arrested the Sum, as belonging to
<hi>Samuel Veatch</hi> his Debitor, before <hi>Samuel Veatch</hi> was Denuded, by filling
up <hi>Marion Geddes</hi> Name, and intimating, or showing the same to <hi>Sandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
the Debitor, and that the filling up of <hi>Geddes</hi> Name, being but an
Assignation, did necessarly require to accomplish it, to Denude the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
an Intimation, for seing express Assignations do necessarly require
Intimation, to prefer them to arrestments; much more ought indirect As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signations,
which are suspect of Fraud, and by which a Debitor
may keep all his Estate in the Cloud, that none of the Creditors
can reach the same, by arrestment or otherwise. And it being

answered, that the Bond being delivered blank, there was no present Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
but a power granted to the Receiver of the Bond, to make Creditor
whom he pleased; at least there was no certain Creditor, so that <hi>Samuel
Veatch</hi> was never Creditor, but had only the power to make the Creditor,
and so needed not to be Denuded, nor was there any Law or custom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
intimation of the Names filled up in blank Bonds, and if any such
thing were done upon the accompt of Expediency, it ought only to be in

               <p>The Lords adhered to their former Interlocutor, and found <hi>Veatch</hi> to have been
the true Creditor, and the filling up of the other Name, to be a Transmission equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent

that this passive Title was never extended to Bonds of Provision,
granted by a Father to his eldest Son, and if in security and satisfaction of
such a Bond of Provision, an Assignation of a Debt, due to the Father
and his Heirs, were granted, could not infer an universal Title, to make
the Accepter lyable to his Predecessors whole Debt, so neither can an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation

the Reversion of that Wodset, and thereby his Father was Denuded of the

It was answered, that the Father was not simply Denuded du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Legal: During which time, the Appryzing was but like a Right
granted in Security, which Denuded not the Fiar; as if the Son
for Security of a Sum, had been assigned to the Reversion, the Father was
not Denuded, but might use the Order, by which the Security was not
worse but better; the same holds in this Case; and therefore it is, that he

the second Appryzer has appryzed the Reversion, otherwise no man
could redeem an Appryzing, unless he redeemed all his appryzings at once,
which have different legals; and this Case is as favourable, because the
Reversion was only to the Father in his own life; and therefore the Son
endeavoured to hinder him to Redeem, by taking Right to this Appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It was answered, that the Case was not alike in a Conventional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
as in a legal: And that the Appryzing led against the Father in

need of Confirmation, but that it did accresce to the second Daughter, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the death of the first, and so was carried by the seconds Testament: In
this account, Mr. <hi>Robert</hi> as Heir, pursuing for the Heretable Bonds. The
Tutrix answered, that she ought to have allowance of what was wared out
upon repairing of the Tenement in <hi>Glasgow.</hi> It was answered, that she as
Tutrix, <hi>ex officio,</hi> was oblieged to exhaust the Moveables first, one Person
being both Heir and Executor, and not to exhaust the Heretable Bonds,
that bore Annualrent, and to let the other lie unprofitable, and now to
apply it to her own use, by her Legacy. It was answered, That it was
employed upon the Heritage, and so was profitable to the Heir only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
employed upon the House, and that by a Warrand, the Heir being then
under Tutors, to repair it out of the first and readiest of the Defuncts Estate.</p>

The Defenders alleadged absolvitor, because the Jewels were Impignorat by
Mr. <hi>Robert Byres</hi> for a considerable Sum of Money, who having them in his
Possession, it was a sufficient ground for the Defenders to Contract with him,
because property of Moveables is presumed by Possession; and therefore it is

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55692:171"/>
either against her Heretage, or Liferent, and alleadged several Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions

               <p>The Lords repelled the alleadgeance, and found the oblidgement to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft
valid, albeit accessory, because Deeds, and Obligations of Wyfes not
to affect their Persons, but Estates are valid; and albeit she had not been

are never counted fraudulent deeds, or without an onerous cause; nor do

neither was the Defenders Father lyable though there was a Decreet of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistration
against him, because before any Execution, the Marriage was
dissolved. It was answered, for the Pursuer, that that member of the Lybel
stands relevant, because the Defenders Mother being Heir to her Brother,
the Contracter could not transmit her Estate to her Husband, without the
burden of her Brothers Debt; and it is a most unquestionable Ground in
Law and Equity, <hi>quod nemo debet cum alieno damno locupletari,</hi> and therefore
Creditors are still preferred to Portions of Children, though given for their
Tochar.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that Member not Relevant, that Decreet was obtained
against the Husband and Wife, <hi>stante matrimonio,</hi> seing it received not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution;
and as to the other Member, they thought, that if there were but
a moderat and ordinar Tochar, proportionable to the burdens of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
it would not infer Repitition, or if the Tochar was great, or an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Disposition of all the Heirs Right, they thought the Husband would
be lyable, in so far as it was above a proportionable Tochar, and therefore
before Answer, Ordained the Contract of Marriage to be produced, and the
Pursuer to condescend, if there was any other benefit accresced to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
by his Wife, then by vertue of the Contract.</p>
               <p>It was further alleadged, for the Lady <hi>Pitmedden,</hi> one of the Sisters on
Life, that she could only be lyable for her own sixth part, as one of the six
Heirs Portioners. It was answered, by our Law, that all Heirs were lyable
<hi>in solidum.</hi> There was several Decisions alleadged on either hand, on the
7. of <hi>February 1632. Hoom</hi> contra <hi>Hoom:</hi> Where the Lords found the Heirs
Portioners lyable but for their own share. Another <hi>February</hi> 15. and <hi>March
21. 1634. Watson</hi> contra <hi>Or,</hi> Whereby one of the Daughters having a
Disposition of the whole Estate, was found lyable for the whole Debt. And
another <hi>Ianuary</hi> 24. 1642. Where one of the Heirs Portioners, having
Disponed her share to the other, and thereby being insolvent, that other
was found lyable <hi>in solidum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the Case, found the Heir Portioner lyable,
<hi>iprmo loco,</hi> only for her own share, untill the rest of the Heirs Portioners
were discust, but determined not whether these who were <hi>solvendo,</hi> should be
lyable <hi>in solidum,</hi> albeit the Debt exceeded their Portion, or only intirely for

It was alleadged, for the Defenders, absolvitor from this Reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because the Defenders produced an Appryzing led against the common
Author, before the Inhibition, and which is sufficient to maintain the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders

the Pursuers can have thereto. It was adswered, <hi>non relevat,</hi> seing
the Pursuer is not insisting in a Reduction of all Right competent to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
upon general Reasons, either bearing expresly, or by equivalence that
the Pursuer had good Right, and the Defender had no Right; but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tner
is insisting specially upon particular Rights called for, and upon a
special Reason. <hi>viz.</hi> That they were after the Pursuers Inhibition, so that
albeit the Defender have another better Right than the Pursuer, it will not
be prejudged by this Reduction, nor can it hinder the conclusion of this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Dispositions are null, as being <hi>post Inhibitionem.</hi> It
was answered, for the Defender, that his Defense is relevant, for he alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and producing a sufficient Right to the Lands whereof the Dispositions
are called for to be Reduced, it takes away all Interest in the Pursuer to
these Lands; and therefore he may justly thereupon exclude the Pursuer from
troubling the Defender in this, or any other Reduction, which can have
no effect. It was answered, that if this ground were layed, no Reduction
could be sustained of any particular Right, called for to be reduced, unless
the Pursuer did reduce all Rights, that the Defender could produce, which
is neither just, nor conform to the Custom; because Pursuers may have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to reduce some Rights, in respect of the probation, which may be
lost, as either Oaths of Parties, or Witnesses: and yet may not be in readiness
to insist against all the Defenders Rights, not having found out theirs, or
their Authors progress, but the Lords may reserve the other Rights, seing

The Lords, in respect the Defenders were very poor, and their case favourable,
Ordained the Pursuer to insist upon what he had to alleadge against the Defenders
Appryzing produced, as if it had been contained in the Reduction; but it is not to
be layed as a general Ground, that in no case Reduction may proceed, albeit it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

               <p>THE Ladie <hi>Bute</hi> and her Husband pursue a Reduction of a Right of a part
of her Conjunct-fee, made in favours of her Son, upon this Ground,
that it was done after her Contract of Marriage with her present Husband,
and publick Proclamation in the Kirk thereupon. It was answered. <hi>First,</hi>
That once Proclamation was not sufficient. <hi>2dly,</hi> That it was offered to be
proven, that the Husband knew, that the Right was granted, and yet he
proceeded in the Proclamation, and Marriage, which behoved to proport
his acquiescence and consent; and alleadged likewise the Case was most fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable:
because the Lady had married, unsuitably, her Husbands Chapland.
It was answered for the Pursuer, that once Proclamation is sufficient, as has
been several times found, and that there is no weight to be layed upon her
Husbands knowledge, who knew he had a remeed competent in Law, whereby
the Deed done by his Wife after the Contract and Proclamation would be
null; and so his going on in the Marriage did not infer his acquiescence, or
Homolagation. And as for the favour of the cause, it is much more on the
Pursuers part, who being provided by her Husband, to 27 Chalders of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
had before the Contract of Marriage, quite 20 to her Son; and of the
seven remaining, he had urged her to quite 100 <hi>lib.</hi> And 7 bolls of Victual
were only now in question.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Reason of Reduction relevant, and repelled the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
upon the Husbands knowledge, for they thought, that as Deeds of a
Wife cled with a Husband, without his consent, are null, after the Solemniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Marriage, because she is then <hi>in potestate viri, &amp; sub ejus tutelà,</hi>
So that she is truely Wife, after the Contract of Marriage, becoming publick
by Proclamation, and it occurring, as a doubt amongst the Lords, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Reduction ought to be sustained at the instance of the Husband only,
in so far as concerned his interest <hi>jure mariti,</hi> so that the Right might be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid

               <p>The Lords sustained the Reason simply, at the instance of both; and found it

himself was a lawful Creditor of the Rebells, whereupon there is a stronger

the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> can be only meant of Donatars, who have no Interest,
but their Gift, and are not Creditors. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Lands were Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,

               <p>The Lords repelled the first alleadgeance, and found the <hi>presumptio juris</hi> in

is no Presumption of Simulation. <hi>2dly.</hi> By several Decisions alleadged and
produced, it is clear, that the Lords did prefer base Infeftment of Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to posterior publick Infeftments of Propertie, which interveened before
the next Term; so that the Infeftment of Annualrent could not attain Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but if base Infeftments without Possession, were unvalid Rights; The
Lords could not have found so. <hi>3dly.</hi> The Lords have allowed Indirect, and
Interpretative Possession to be sufficient, not only in the Case when Liferents
are reserved, that thereby the Liferenters Possession is the Feears, though he
never possest himself, but even when Liferents are not reserved; but that the
base Infeftment is thereby excluded from Possession: so base Infeftments
granted to wyfes are preferred to posterior publick Infeftments, though the
Wyfes do not, nor cannot possesse, during the Husbands Life, yet the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
possession is counted the Wifes possession, and if a Person Infeft by a base
Infeftment should pursue for Mails, or Duties, or Removing; and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by a prior Liferent, constitute by the Pursuers Author<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> though not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in his Right; that very Action would be sufficient to validat the base
Infeftment without Possession. <hi>4thly,</hi> Whatever might have been alleadged,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55692:175"/>
before the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> 1617. For Registration of Seasines, there is
neither Law, nor Favour since, for posterior acquirers, who might have
known the prior Infeftments. And therefore in Infeftments of Warrandice Lands,
the Possession of the principal Lands is accompted Possession of the Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
Lands; neither is there any ground to oblidge a Person who takes a Feu
of Lands, to demand a more publick infeftment of the Warrandice Lands,
then of the principal. It was answered, that albeit the Narrative of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
mention Fraudful alienations, yet the dispositive words are General,
that wherever an Infeftment hath been publick, by Resignation, or Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and hath attained Possession year and day, the same shall exclude
any prior base Infeftment, attaining no Possession, and if the said <hi>Act</hi> were
only to be measured by Fraud then if it could be alleadged, and astructed,
that the first Infeftment, though base, was for a cause onerous, and without
Fraud, it should be preferred; which yet never hath been done. And for the
Practiques, they meet not this Case, nor the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> because the
posterior publick Infeftment had attained no Possession. It was answered,
that now consuetude had both Interpret and Extended the foresaid <hi>Act;</hi> for
thereby posterior publick Infeftments, though they be not for cause onerous,
or cled with Possession year and day, are ordinarily preferred contrair to the
tenor of the Statute, and base Infeftments, <hi>retenta possessione,</hi> where
the obtainer of the Infeftment is negligent, are accounted Simulat
<hi>presumptione juris, &amp; de jure</hi> but where there is no delay, nor ground
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Infeftment attain Possession for year and day, or not.</p>
               <p>The Lords having heard this Case at length, and debated the same accuratly
amongst themselves, in respect they found no preceeding Decision, whether base
Infeftments of Warrandice, where there was possession of the Principal Lands were
valid, or not; against posterior publick Infeftments. They found this base Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Warrandice valid against the posterior publick Infeftment. The Infeftment
in Warrandice being <hi>Simul</hi> with the Principal, and not <hi>ex intervallo,</hi> and being
after the Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> 1617. but did not decide the Case to be of generall

they had produced their Fews granted by the Abbots of <hi>Coldinghame,</hi>
prior to the Pursuers Infeftment, free of any such burden. It was answered,
The Defense ought to be Repelled, because the Pursuer has not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
his own Infeftment, but his Predecessors, and Authors Infeftments,
and his progresse to them. <hi>viz.</hi> The Infeftment granted to <hi>David Evin,</hi> of

is great odds betwixt Infeftments granted by Kirkmen, who are but admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators
of the benefices, and others, who have <hi>plenum dominium,</hi> so that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments
upon Resignation of Kirkmen are to be understood to confer no
more Right than the Resigner had, and not to constitute any original Right
where there was none before, in the same way, as Infeftments granted by
the King, upon Resignation, are but <hi>periculo petentis,</hi> and give no Right
further then the Resigner had, even against the King. It was answered, for
the Pursuer, that his Reply stands relevant, and he produces sufficiently to
instruct his predecessors Right; for there is no Law nor Reason to compell
Parties to produce the old Original Feus granted by Kirkmen, but Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon Resignation are sufficient, neither is the Case alike, as to the
King, and Kirkmen, because things passe not by the King <hi>ex certa scientia,</hi>
which no other can pretend; but in this Case, declaring a Right granted
by an Abbot, with consent of the Convent; it must be considered what made a
Right, the time that it was granted, when there was no more required then
his Concession, with consent foresaid, which is sufficient against him, and his
successors, neither can they pretend, that such grants are <hi>salvo jure suo.</hi> And
if in matters so Ancient, Original Infeftments from Kirkmen behoved to be

               </p>
               <p>The Defenders further alleadged absolvitor, because by several <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
infeftments of Kirk-lands before the Reformation, are required to
be Confirmed by the Pope, or the King thereafter. <hi>Ita est,</hi> this is Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by neither before the Feuers Right: And by another <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
it is declared, that the first Confirmation, with the last Feu, shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.
<hi>Ita est,</hi> the Defenders has the first Confirmation. It was answered,
that no Law, nor <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> required Confirmation of an Office;
neither was any Confirmation absolutely necessar before that <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
but the Kirk-men might always have Feued without diminution of
the Rental of the Lands, as they were the time of the feu; but that <hi>Act</hi>
was made, in regard that at the time of Reformation, the Kirk-men being
out of hopes of preserving of Monasteries, and Kirk-lands, did Feu them to
their nearest Friends; and therefore the foresaid <hi>Act,</hi> as being correctory of
the common Law, ought not to be extended to any thing, but what is
exprest in the <hi>Act,</hi> which is only Feues of Kirk-lands; and so would neither
extend to an Office, as a Baillirie, Forrestrie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor yet to a Pension, or
Annualrent: neither would it extend to Infeftments, by Kirk-men, Ward,
such as most of the Infeftments of this <hi>Abbacy,</hi> and many others are. And
seing Confirmation was not requisit, but the Feu it self was sufficient alone,
the last <hi>Act</hi> preferring the first Confirmation, takes no place, which can
only be understood where Confirmations are necessar. It was answered for
the Defenders, that albeit an Office requires no Confirmation, where there is
nothing given but the Office, and Casualities thereof; Yet where there is
a burden upon Lands given therewith, such as this Threave of Oats out of
every Husband-land, being far above the proportion of a suitable Fee for
the Office, there being above 111. Husband-lands in the <hi>Abbacie,</hi> and some
Forrester-lands following the Office, besides other Casualities, Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is necessar, or else the <hi>Abbots</hi> might have eluded the Law, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
the Benefice. It was answered for the Pursuer, that he oppones the
<hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> requiring only Confirmations of Kirklands; and albeit the
Duties, of this Office affects the Lands <hi>nihil est,</hi> for if the <hi>Abbay</hi> had Thirled the
Lands of the <hi>Abbacy</hi> to a Miln without the <hi>Abbacy:</hi> for a Thirled Duty of a far
greater value then the Duties of this Office, the constitution of that Thirlage
required no Confirmation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:55692:178"/>
The Lords Sustained the Pursuers progress, and Repelled the first Alleadgence, and
also Repelled the last Alleadgence, and found no necessity of Confirmation of the
Office, and Duties thereof aforesaid, whether the samine were holden Feu, or Ward:
but did not cognosce, whether the same was Feu, or Ward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> albeit that was
contraverted: neither whether Infeftments of Kirk-lands, holden Ward, needed
Confirmation or no.</p>

and oblieged him never to quarrel, or recal that Obligation, being charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereupon, he Suspends on this Reason, that it was <hi>donatio inter virum &amp;
uxorem,</hi> and so he might recal the same, and now offered to Cohabite
with his Wife, and aliment her according to his Means. It was answered,
that he had Renunced that priviledge, in so far as he had oblieged himself,
never to Recal, or come against this obliegment. It was answered, that
though he had expresly Renunced that priviledge, yet the Renunciation was
<hi>donatio inter virum &amp; uxorem,</hi> and he might therefore Recal, and come
against both.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Reason of Suspension, and Reply relevant in time coming:

at the year 1616. and continuing till the year 1657. in the beginning whereof,
there was ordinarly one Ship every year, and thereafter several Ships every

mentioning a prior Infeftment by King <hi>William,</hi> Erecting them into a free
Burgh, with their Books of Entries, of several Ships, for divers years, with
an Interlocutor of the Lords, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1609. wherein <hi>Dumbarton</hi> having
charged for all the Duties now in question. <hi>Glasgow</hi> Suspended, and <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
insisted for none of these in question, but only for Entries; and the
Lords found, that the Merchants of <hi>Glasgow</hi> might either Enter at <hi>Glasgow,
Dumbarton,</hi> or any other free Burgh where the Kings Customers were, and
might break bulk there, with a Contract between <hi>Dumbarton</hi> and <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1590. oblieging them to concur against unfree-men, and not to
break bulk upon the River, but in their Towns; and in case of any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
six of each Town to meet at <hi>Ranfrew,</hi> and decide the same, and
thereupon alleadged, that they being a free Burgh, and having the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> both in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and so acknowledged by the
said Contract, and enjoying equal, and free Trade in the River of <hi>Clyde,</hi>
without any such Burden, whereof no mention is made in the foresaid
Contract, and being charged for, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1611. there was not so much
as an alleadgence of any Possession of <hi>Dumbartons</hi> of these Dues at
that time, and the Entry decerned to be free at either Town;
and therefore they alleadged, that their Priviledge of Trading as a free
Burgh, ought to be declared, and they assoilzied. It was answered for the
Town of <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> that they had good Right to these Duties, by His
Majesties several Infeftments, granted to them; for the King having power
to impose petty Customs, not only in Ports built, and preserved by Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
but in Stations, and Rivers, Creiks and Bays, as is the Custom of all
Kings and Princes, such are the Customes upon the Rivers of <hi>Rhyne, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronnie,
Thaimes,</hi> and others, to all Ships that anchor there, or pass that
way: and whereof, there are severals in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the <hi>Tunnage,</hi> due
to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> of all the Ships breaking bulk at <hi>Leith:</hi> and the petty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of <hi>Alloway, Cockenie,</hi> and other places. <hi>2ly.</hi> Albeit the Kings grant
were not sufficient alone, yet being cled with immemorial, or 40. years
Possession, instructed by Witnesses, and the Books of Entry, it is more
then sufficient. It was answered for <hi>Glasgow,</hi> to the first, That petty Duties
imposed for Ports, having a mutual Cause, may be appointed at any time by
Kings and Princes; it being free to these who are burdened therewith, to
come in to that Port, or not: they also appoint petty Customs to be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to any City, for Goods Imported, and sold there, in consideration of
the upholding of their Harbours, and Mercats, as the Tunage of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of <hi>Leith,</hi> or anchorage at any Shore, where anchorage is casten upon
the Land, or any Goods laid out upon the Land, or where Imposition for
anchorage, or other Dues in a River, or Station, hath been approven by
long Custom, and acquiescence; but where Burghs Royal, have not only
by their priviledge of Trading, but by immemorial Possession, prescribed a
liberty of making use of Stations, without burding; no Right granted, or
Impetrat by any Party in prejudice thereof, if it be quarrelled before Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription can take away the liberty of Trading: Nor is the Kings Gift any
way to be understood, but <hi>periculo petentis:</hi> and <hi>Dumbartons</hi> second Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did expresly bear, that these petty Customs were due, and accustomed
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55692:182"/>
before; so that the Kings express meaning is, not to Gift them <hi>de nova,</hi> or
to impose a servitude in their favours, upon a far more eminent City then
themselves. And as to the Point of Possession, nothing is proven thereanent,
till the year 1616. and then it is neither universal, seing more Entered at
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> then at <hi>Dumbarton;</hi> nor is it peaceable, nor voluntar, nor is it
continual, but interrupted; and albeit it were uninterrupted, yet it is but
by single Persons, which cannot infer a Servitude upon the Burgh, and
if the Kings Gift be <hi>periculo petentis,</hi> and be surrepticiously impetrat upon a
false Narrative, no Possession can validat it, as no Possession of it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Title, could infer such a Servitude.</p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the Depositions of the Witnesses, Books of Entry,
and the hail Writs produced; they found that the alleadgence against <hi>Dumbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
Declarator, as founded upon their Charters, without Relation to Possession,
was not Relevant, and that the first Charter could not extend to these particulars,
not being exprest, unless it had appeared that they had been in immemorial Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
before the second Charter, and the interruption by the Suspension, raised
by <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and the Lords Interlocutor thereupon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Immemorial, or 40. years Possession immediatly preceeding, might have presumed

or Suspending that particular in question, and no alleadging of Possession by
<hi>Dumbarton</hi> then; but on the contrair, an Interlocutor, as to the liberty of
Entry at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> takes off that Prescription: And likewise they found, that
there was nothing proven as to 40. years Possession, save only 13. sh. 4. d. for
the Anchorage of each Ship, and 8. d. for the use of <hi>Dumbartons</hi> Measures of
Salt, for each Boll: and seing that Possession was also proven to be Interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in that several Ships of <hi>Glasgow</hi> Resisted, and came away free, and that
they had several Salt Measures of their own there. Therefore they found the Charter
not validat by 40. years Possession uninterrupted, and Assoilzie from <hi>Dumbartons</hi>
Declarator, and Declared upon <hi>Glasgows</hi> Declarator of Liberty.</p>

               <p>THere being an old Thirlage of a Paroch, which was a part of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony

there is a Decreet in <hi>Anno</hi> 1610. pronounced by the Chancellor, as
Lord of the Regality, decerning all the Feuars to pay the five and twenty
Curn of all Grains that they brought to the Miln, and a greater of that they
Abstracted. The Feuar of the Miln pursuing for Abstracted Multures, and
for instructing the <hi>Quota,</hi> producing this Decreet. It was alleadged for the
Defenders, that they offered them to prove that, past memory of man, at
least 40. years bygone, they have been constantly in use to pay five Bolls
of Bear in satisfaction of all Multure; and so can be lyable for no further,
they having prescribed their liberty from any further. <hi>2ly.</hi> That no respect
ought to be had to the Decreet, in so far as it Decerns a greater quantity for
the Corns Abstracted, then for these grinded, which is without all Reason;
especially seing this is but a Burn Miln, and not sufficient for the Thirle.
<hi>3ly.</hi> They offer them to prove, that the Miln was insufficient, the years
pursued for, and no ways able to serve them, and the rest of the Thirle,
as being but a Burn-miln, dry in Summer, and not having Water enough
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55692:183"/>
in Winter. It was answered for the Pursuer, to the first, that they offered
them to prove, they were in Possession of the Multure Lybelled within these
40. years, at least that any lesser Duty was accepted by a particular Pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for a time only. To the second, opponed the Decreet standing, against
which there has neither been Suspension, nor Reduction, nor any ground
for the same. for its like the coming to the Miln frees them from a greater
quantity, for abstraction. And seing the <hi>Quota</hi> is but the five and twenty
Curn, far below the ordinar Thirle Multures; it was very reasonable, that
the samine being abaited to a less quantity, they should pay a greater if
they came not. As to the insufficiency of the Miln, it was answered <hi>non Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levat,</hi>
unless it were through the default of the Pursuer, or his Millers, for
they being astricted to a Burn Miln, what defect is therein, without the
Pursuers fault, cannot louse the Restriction.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Replys Relevant, unless the Defenders condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon an insufficiency, through the Pursuers fault.</p>
               <p>Here occurred to the Lords, whether the Feuars could by Possession,
prescrive their liberty as to a lesser Multure, seing the Possession of a part
of the Multure was sufficient to exclude Prescription, as to the whole: some
thought, if the Multure had been a certain <hi>Quota</hi> in the Infeftment of the
Miln: Possession also not of the hail, would hindred Prescription of any
part; but if the Infeftment of the Miln, was only with the Multures used,
and wont, and that the speciality was but by a Decreet, as the use and wont:
that in that case, use and wont might change. Others thought not, but in
respect the Pursuer insisted not on that Point, but offered to prove Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>THe Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> pursues a Declarator, or to hear and see it
found and Declared, that Commissars ought to be persons qualified,
and able to judge according to Law, and that if they be not, they might
be deprived by the <hi>Act</hi> 1609. empowering the Bishops, then restored, to
appoint able, and sufficient men, Commissars in all time coming; and
by the <hi>Act</hi> of Restitution 1661. whereby the like power is granted, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Commissars nominat by the King, unless he be insufficient, or malver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant:
and subsumes that <hi>Mr. William Fleming</hi> is not sufficient, nor quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for that Place; and also, that by the injunctions given to Commissars;
mentioned in the <hi>Act</hi> 1609. there is no place for Deputs, unless it were by
special consent of the Bishops, and craves that it may be declared, that the
said Mr. <hi>William</hi> may not Serve by a Depute. The Pursuer insisted on the
first member. It was alleadged for the Defender, that he had his Place both
from the King, and Bishop <hi>Fairfoul</hi> confirming the same with a <hi>Novo damus:</hi>
and therefore, though he might have been questioned before the said Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and new Gift; yet now he cannot be questioned upon insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but only on Malversation, whereof there is no point alleadged, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
on, nor is his insufficiency qualified by any <hi>Act</hi> of inorderly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
or injustice committed by him now these five years, and as Bishop <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foul,</hi>
who acknowledged him to be a fit, and qualified Person, by his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
could never quarrel him upon insufficiency, neither can this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
<hi>2ly.</hi> The Defender has his Place with power of Deputation; and
therefore having given eight thousand merks to the former Bishop for his
Ratification, with power of Deputation, he cannot be questioned on his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
being able, <hi>per se aut per deputatum,</hi> and no <hi>Act</hi> alleadged of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
It was answered by the Pursuer to the first Defense, that albeit this
same Bishop had admitted this Commissar, upon hopes of his Qualifications,
yet if contrair to his expectation, it appears he is not qualified for so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
a Judicature. He may justly quarrel him of insufficiency, as well as a
Minister whom he ordained. <hi>2ly.</hi> Though the same Person might not, yet
his Successor in Office might, and is not bound to acknowledge what his
Predecessor did by mistake, or otherwayes to the detriment of the Sea,
which were in his option, without a Rule, or requiring Qualifications, as
the naming of Commissars. To the Second, albeit Deputs were allowable,
as they are not by the Injunctions, yet the principal Commissar, who must
Regulat, and answer for them, must also be qualified, both by the <hi>Act</hi> 1609.
and the exception 1661. which enervats both the Defenders Gifts.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that Member of the Lybel on the Qualifications, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency

               <p>MY Lord <hi>Ley,</hi> having Right by progress to the Reversion of an old
Wodset, uses an Order, and pursues Declarator thereupon. The
Defender alleadged no Declarator, because by the Reversion, there is a
Tack to be granted, to begin after Redemption, and to continue for so
many years. It was answered, that Tack was null, and invalide, not only
by Common law, as an usurary Paction, giving the Wodsetter more then
his ordinary Annualrent, but by a special <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament, Ia. 2. Par. 1449.
cap.</hi> 19. whereby such Tacks taken in Wodsets, to endure long time after
the Redemption, for the half mail, or near thereby, shall not be keeped:
and as by the late <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> between Debitor and Creditor, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
that where old Wodsets were granted before 1650. when annual
was at ten for ilk hundreth, the Wodsetter may, upon offer of Caution for
the annualrent, take Possession, unless the Wodsetter offered himself to be
comptable for what exceeds his annualrent. It was answered for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
that his Defense stands yet Relevant, notwithstanding the answer,
for as to the old <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> it is in desuetude, and it hath been
the common custom to grant such Tacks in Reversions, which have still
been observed, and were never quarrelled, neither are they usurary, seing
the Tacksman has the hazard of the Fruits, and all burdens, so his Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Duty,
how small soever, unless it were elusory, can be no usurary paction,
more then taking Lands in a proper Wodset, which pay more then the true
annualrent, which was never found usurary. <hi>2ly.</hi> This Wodset is granted
since that old <hi>Act,</hi> whereby the benefit thereof is totally past from. As to
the new <hi>Act,</hi> the Clause bears expresly, that during the none Redemption,
or none Requisition, the conditions therein shall take place, which cannot
be extended to a Tack, to be granted after Redemption. It was answered, that
the first <hi>Act</hi> bears, not only a Regulation of Wodsets already then granted, but to
be granted, bearing expresly, who takes or has taken Lands in Wodsets, &amp;c. and
there is nothing in the Wodset to renunce the benefit thereof. As for the
custom, <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> are not derogat by custom of privat parties, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The reason of Reduction is founded upon an Interdiction, against the Lord

formerly depending at the instance of umquhil Sir <hi>Archibald Stewart,</hi> and
being Transferred after his Death, the Lords allowed the Process to proceed

was also the Tenor of the Usurpers <hi>Act,</hi> and therefore the Exception of the
Renuncing such <hi>Acts,</hi> cannot extend to the Case of accounting for Wodsets,
which could not be thought upon, the time of the Wodset, and of the
Renunciation; this Clause being according to common Law, to hinder
Usury, which might have been indirectly taken by proper Wodsets, though
these by the Custom, use not to be quar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Lords Repelled the Defense, in respect of the Reply, and found the
Exception not to extend to the Case of Wodsets.</p>
               <p>It was further alleadged for the Defenders, that they were not lyable to
to compt for the Superplus, for all years bygone since the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
nor at all, except in the Case that they had been required to quite the
Possession of the Wodset, and Security had been offered them for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and they had chosen rather to retain the Wodset, and to compt for the
Superplus; for as to all years preceeding, they were <hi>bona fide</hi> Possessors,
and had ground to presume that the Pursuer did acquiesce in the Wodset, as
only proportionable to the annualrent, and it were unjust and of evil conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that if the granter of the Wodset should forbear to offer Security for
20 years upon his offer then, the Wodsetter should be oblieged to Compt from
the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> It was answered, that there was no inconveniency,
seing the Wodsetter might, if he pleased, quite the Possession, and then was
not comptable at all: But if he would retain the Possession, he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to compt for all bygones, since the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the Clause of the Act of Parliament, found the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
only lyable from the time of the offer of Caution, and Requiring the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and not from the date of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> seing the Clause bears, they
shall have by the Wodset, which looks to be future only; and seing the Wodsetters
might have Builded or Planted for their own accommodation, and therefore might
rather reain the Possession then other Security.</p>

               <p>THe Bishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> insisted in his Declarator against the Commissar
of <hi>Glasgow;</hi> and alleadged first, that by injunctions related to in the <hi>Act</hi> of
<hi>Restitution</hi> 1609. It was provided, that all Commissars should Reside at the
place where the Commissariot Sat, and should not be absent, but upon neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,

in case of the absence of the Commissar, through sickness, or other necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or through being declined in these Causes, the Bishop should name a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put:
From whence it was alleadged, <hi>first,</hi> That the Commissar had already
Transgressed the Injunctions, and deserved Deposition for none Residence,
and for appointing Deputs himself, not appointed by the Bishop; yea, for
continuing to make use of these Deputs, albeit the Bishop did intimat the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions to him, and did Judicially require the Deput not to sit, and took
Instruments thereupon. <hi>2ly.</hi> That in time coming it ought to be De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the Commissar ought to Reside, under the pain of Deprivation, and to
<hi>Act</hi> by no Deput, but such as were authorized by the Bishop. It was alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Defender, Absolvitor from this Member of the Declarator, because
the Defender had his Office from the King, and the late Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
with power of Deputation. And as to the Injunctions, <hi>first,</hi> They had no
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:55692:189"/>
authority of Law; for albeit the Act of Parliament 1609. related to Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to be made, yet it did not authorise any Persons to make the same,
nor is it constant, that these are the Injunctions that is alleadged to be made
by the Bishops in <hi>anno 1610. 2ly.</hi> Albeit they had been then so made, they
are in de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uetude, because ever since, all Commissars have enjoyed their
place with power of Deputation, and exercised the same accordingly. <hi>3ly.</hi>
There is no Injunction against the Bishops, giving power to the Commissars
to Deput; for albeit the Injunctions bear, that in such cases he could not give
Deputation; and therefore the Commissar did not wrong, to continue his Deput.
And it is most necssar, that the Commissar should have a Power of Deputation,
or otherwise, their Office is elusory, seing the Bishop may be absent, or refuse
to Depute any Person, in case of the Commissars necessary absence, and so
both delay Justice to the Leidges, and Evacuat the Gift. It was answered
for the Pursuer, that first, the Injunctions were commonly received and
known through all the Kingdom, and are Registrat in the Commissars Books
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> being the Supream Commissariot, and according thereto, the
Lords have decided in Advocations and Reductions; and albeit they have
not been observed, seing there is no contrair Decision, they cannot go in
desuetude by meer none observance. <hi>2ly,</hi> That the Injunctions do import,
that no Deputation can be granted by Commissars, but only by the Bishops
<hi>in casibus expressis.</hi> It is clear from the foresaid two Injunctions; for to
what effect should the Commissars Residence be required, if he might at his
pleasure act by Deputs; and why were these cases exprest, if Deputation were
competent in all Cases. <hi>3ly.</hi> Albeit the power of Deputation granted by
Bishop <hi>Fairfowl</hi> be sufficient, during his life, and seclude him from quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the same, <hi>personali objectione;</hi> yet that Exception is not competent against
this Arch-bishop. <hi>4ly,</hi> The Injunctions being sent up to the King, His Majesty
has Signed and Approven the same, which therefore Revived them, and for
the inconveniency upon the Bishops absence or refusal, is not to be supposed,
but that the Bishops concerned in the Commissariots, would provide remeid
in such Cases. The Defender answered, that <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> were not
drawn <hi>ad pares casus &amp; consequentias,</hi> much less their Injunctions, and though
they were now Revived, yet that cannot be drawn back to the power of
Deputation granted before: Neither can this Bishop be in better condition
then his Prececessor, or quarrel his Predecessors Deed, which he had power
to do. The Defender did also resume the Defense, as to sufficiency and
tryal, that seing he had power of Deputation, he was not lyable to Tryal,
nor to Reside, if his Deput were sufficient.</p>
               <p>The Lords found, that albeit the power of Deputation should absolutely
stand; yet the principal Commissar behoved to be be sufficient, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly
Resident, seing his sufficiency was both requisit by the <hi>Act of Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
1609. and by Exception in the <hi>Act of Restitution</hi> 1661. and that he
ought to direct and over-rule his Deputs, for whom he was answerable; and
therefore was oblieged to Reside, that albeit he did not constantly sit, yet
he might advise with his Deputs in important Cases, and the Lieges might
have access to him to complain in case of the Deputs Malversation, and as
to the power of Deputation it self, and the Injunctions.</p>

The Lords found, that the Defender was <hi>in bona fide,</hi> to enjoy these Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
till it was declared, notwithstanding he was required to the contrair: but
as to the future, they found that he ought to reside, and make use of no Deputs,
without the consent of the Archbishop, but whether that should be only <hi>pro re na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
or by a warrand for such Persons, not only upon necessar occasions, mentioned
in the injunctions, but also in others, that the Deputs might ordinarily sit, and
advise with the Commissars, in Cases of importance. The Lords were of different
judgements, and recommended to the Bishop in common, to consider what was fit
in that Case, but declared only according to the Injunctions without interpretat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how far the Deputation should reach.</p>

               <p>THe six Children of the Earl of <hi>Buchan</hi> pursue their Mother for Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It was alleadged absolvitor, because their was neither Law,
Statute nor Custome of this Kingdom, oblidging a Mother to Aliment her
Children. <hi>2ly,</hi> Albeit there were, she offers her to admit them in her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to entertain them according to her means, but can never be oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pay a modification, in Money out of the Family; for in all Cases of
Aliment of Wives, or Children against Parents, the offer to accept, and
Aliment them in the Family, according to the Parents Means, doth alwayes
exclude Modification? as was lately found in the Case of Sir <hi>Andrew Dick</hi>
and his Son. It was answered, that the Law of Nature is a part of the Law
of this, and all other Civil Kingdoms, and according thereto the Lords do
alwayes decide, in Cases now occurring, where there was neither Statute nor
Custome and if Aliment be due, the manner and measure is <hi>in arbitrio judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
who may justly ordain their Children to be bred from their Mothers, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
she hath miscarried, and Married a deposed Minister. It was answered,
that the Law of Nature, without our Custome is no sufficient Law to us,
and does not induce <hi>obligationem civilem,</hi> but only <hi>pietatem &amp; affectum,</hi> upon
which ground it is, that there was necessity of this Statute to appoint an Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Heirs against the Wairdatars and Liferenters, which insinuats that
there was no such Law before, and if the Law of Nature, be the adequat
Rule, we are oblidged to entertain the Poor, and all in distress; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they might pursue us thereupon. <hi>2dly,</hi> There is no Reason to put it <hi>in
arbitrio judicis,</hi> whether a Child should be Educat with the Parent, who
must Aliment him, even upon pretence of the Parents miscarriage, for that
being the indispensable Right of Parents to educat their Children, as they see
cause, especially who demand Aliment of them, it ought not to be in the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trament
of any Judge, unless it were a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and this arbitriment would
lay the Foundations to encourage Children to desert their Parents, and to
claime Aliment out of their Family, and to pretend the Parents miscarriages,
as unfit Persons to be bred with, and not breeding them in a fit way;
which accusations were prohibit by the Civil Law, and never admitted by
our Custome; for albeit the Lords may appoint the way of Education of
Pupils, their Parents being dead: yet Tutors have no such interest, as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>

The Lords found the Mother oblidged to Aliment the Children <hi>jure naturae,</hi>
which was sufficient to infer this Civil Obligation, and Action, but found that
the offer of Alimenting them in her Family, was sufficient according to her means
and they could demand no Aliment, nor Modification <hi>extra familiam:</hi> For they
found that the Lords had thus sustained Aliment to Children against theîr Fathers,
not upon the Act of Parliament, which is competent against all Liferenters and
Donatars, without consideration of their being Parents, but <hi>super jure naturae,</hi>
which they found, would not extend to the obligation of Charity, and which had

or Teind was excepted, as it was in the General Act of Annexation,

not Annexed, yet by the suppression of the Popish Clergie, they returned to
the Crown, for the General Act of Annexation, doth not give the King a
Right, but acknowledged his Right by the Ceasing, of the ends for which
these Benefices were granted, but the Annexation makes them indissolvable,
from the Crown, and indisposable by the King, and so the Teinds being
Annexed, they cease not to belong to the King, but they are at his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall,
and he having disposed of them to the Earl of <hi>Hoom,</hi> before he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

so the King could not dispose of the Benefice, till it were demitted by the

in the said Heretable Office, long before the Erection, and before the Anuexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Abbacie of <hi>Culross,</hi> to the Crown, no Right granted thereafter

upon Burgesses of the Town, committing Bloods in the Town, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Strangers committing Bloods, as is instructed by his Court-books, and
Witnesses, which is sufficient to hinder Prescription. It was answered,
that the Defense stood yet relevant, for the granting of the Bailliery could

the Abbots, so the King retained Jurisdiction, and might dissolve a part of

Right, <hi>Thirlstonn</hi> could not misken, because, by a special Printed

Defense, and Duply ought to be Repelled, in respect of the Reply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Confirmation of the Queens Heretable Right in Parliament was <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo
jure,</hi> and he was secured by the Act <hi>salvo jure,</hi> in the same <hi>Parliament,</hi>
and that he knew thereof, at the passing of the great Seal, is but a weak
presumption, and such knowledge could not prejudge him, nor was he in
any capacity to pursue upon his own Right, for attaining possession; seing
the Queens Liferent Right, and Heretable, were both compatible; and it
was evident, the Queen would exclude him, by his Consent, in the Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Right, neither can the Queens acceptance be questioned, after so
long time; seing the acceptance of the Liferent was to her advantage and
profit, before she got the Fee, and did exclude <hi>Thirlstouns</hi> prior Right,
which would have undoubtedly reduced the Queens Right; and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in the General Act of Annexation; and would not fall under
the Act <hi>salvo jure.</hi> It was also severally alleadged, that this Earl of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdales</hi>
late Right was Confirmed in <hi>Parliament</hi> 1661. And all other
Rights declared void, and that the Ratification should have the force of
a publick Law, and not be derogat by the Act <hi>salvo jure.</hi> It was answered,
for the Defender, that <hi>in Prescriptione longissimi temporis non requiritur tempus
utile, sed continuum,</hi> In consideration whereof the time of the said Prescip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made so long, and therefore captivity absence <hi>reipublicae causa,</hi> want

declared his own Right of Fee to be effectual after her death. And as
to the late <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> albeit it does exclude the Act <hi>salvo jure,</hi>
yet that is <hi>parte inaudita;</hi> and upon the impetration of a Party <hi>suo periculo,</hi>
but the <hi>Parliament</hi> have never assumed power to take away the privat
Rights of Subjects, except upon another, or better Right, otherwayes,
no man in <hi>Scotland</hi> can call any thing his own, but a Confirmation in
<hi>Parliament,</hi> with such a clause surreptitiously obtained, shall take away the
Unquestionable Right of any other. It was answered, for the Pursuer, that
the <hi>Parliament</hi> had not incroached upon the just Right, of any other, but
had only restored the Pursuer to his Grand Fathers Right; and seing there
is no question, but that Right was prior, and better than the Queens, and
the Defenders, and was in no hazard, but as to the point of Prescription,
that being a rigorous Statute, the Parliament might well excuse the Pursuer,
for not pursuing the King and Queen, but rather patiently to abide their
pleasure, till they were denuded, in favours of privat Parties. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
for the Defender, that all our privat Rights, especially of Property,
are founded upon positive Law, and there is none stronger then the Right
of Prescription; and therefore, if the Parliament can take that away, as to
one Person, and not generally, they may annul the Right of any privat Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whatsomever.</p>

               <p>The Lords found the acceptance of the Feu dutie Relevant, only for these
Years, for which it was received, but it occurred to some of the Lords, that if

of the Decreet; which was a tripartite Contract, whereby the Earl of <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingtoun</hi>
agreed for so much Victual, out of his Teynd, beside what was to
be payed by the Town of <hi>Irving,</hi> and Heretors; and the Heretors oblidged
them, and their Heirs, and Successors of these Lands to pay so much Money;

Heretors, and the Teynd not being theirs; but the Earl of <hi>Eglintouns,</hi>
who was oblidged so much out of his Teynds, besides these oblidgments.
It was answered, that this being, to lay a burden of Stipend upon the

unless it had born expresly, out of the Stock; especially, seing the Teynd
was under Tack, and it was <hi>ex gratia,</hi> for them to pay any more then their

                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:55692:198"/>
The Defenders further alleadged Absolvitor, because the Minister, and
Parochioners of <hi>Rathan</hi> had possest the Kirk-yard, and Dyke peaceably, by
the space of 30 years, which is sufficient, to give them a Right upon this
Point.</p>
               <p>There occurred to the Lords these Points; <hi>first,</hi> Whether less Possession
then 40 years could Constitute the full Right of a Kirk-yard? <hi>2ly.</hi> VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
less Possession, by burying of the Dead, could take away anothers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty?
And whether simply, or so as to give him Damnage, and Interest?
<hi>3ly.</hi> VVhether an Interruption, made after the Building of this Dyke, by
the Pursuers raising Summons, shortly thereafter, could operate any thing?
if the Defenders had bruiked, since the Interruption, by that space, that
would have been sufficient to Constitute a full Right before Interruption.</p>
               <p>Many were of the opinion that Kirk-yards have as great priviledge as any
Kirklands; and that in Kirk-lands, 10. years Possession before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or 30. years after, according to the old <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Sederunt</hi> of the Lords,
did Constitute a full Right; as well as the long Prescription in other Cases;
and likewise that in <hi>Ecclesiasticis,</hi> 13. years Possession did Constitute a Right,
<hi>decennalis &amp; triennalis possessor non tenetur docere de titulo;</hi> and that accordingly
the Lords were in use to decide in all such Rights; But the Point to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
was, Whether Interruption once used, endured for 40. years? so that
albeit 13. years would suffice; yet the Interruption long before these 13.
would alwyse be sufficient till the Interruption did prescrive by 40. years;
wherein many were in the Negative, that as in a possessoy Judgement on 7.
years, if Interruption were alleadged, it was always a relevant Reply, that
since the Interruption, the Defender has Possest 7. years without Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
so if 10. or 13. years be sufficient to the Kirk, no Interruption pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
but only such as are done during these years, can be sufficient; for
if 13. years will take away the Solemnest Rights, and Writs; much more
may it a Citation.</p>
               <p>Others were for the Affirmative, on this ground, that in the short Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of 3. years, in Spuilzies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Interruption once used serves for
40. years; so it must in this case; for he that once Interrupts, is alwise hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
as continuing in that Interruption, until it Prescrive, or be otherwise
past from. But it was answered, that it did Prescrive by Possessing 13. or
30. years <hi>in rebus ecclesiae,</hi> Church-men seldom have, or keep Evidents; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
in other Cases, Interruption would only prescrive in 40 years.</p>
               <p>Yet the plurality found, that after Interruption, no less then 40. years Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was sufficient, but reserved to the Lords the Question anent the ground, in so

base Infeftment, which could not be presumed to be privat, or simulat for

Possession, wherein they thought that there was great odds, if the Appryzers
Infeftment, or Diligence had been before <hi>Whitsonday,</hi> in respect the first
Term of the Annualreni; was not the next Term after the Seasine, and so if
it might pass one Term, by the same Reason it might pass ten Terms, and be

Titles thus, that umquhil <hi>Vdney,</hi> after the Receipt of the Sums contained

to himself a power to alienat, and Dispone; after which Infeftment, this

instruct payment, the Letter being after, and no Obligement therein could

his favours, and had gotten sums of money therefore. It was answered,
<hi>non relevat,</hi> unless they had so Renunced, as to prejudge the Creditors, or
to Assign, Dispone, or Discharge any thing they might succeed to, but if
they only got Sums of Money from the Heir-male, in way of gratuity for
their kindliness to the Estate, and to grant a Renunciation voluntarly, as

is, that by the Defuncts Contract of Marriage, the Estate is provided on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

granted by the Patron to the Parson himself, could be sufficient, because the
intent of the Act of Parliament, requiring the consent of Patrons, was not
for any advantage, or Interest of the Patron, to his own behove, but to
the behove of the Benefice, that the Incumbent might meliorat the same; and
so the Patron was by his Right of Patronage, as Curator <hi>Ecclesiae;</hi> but Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
cannot authorize their Minors by Commission, at least the Patron can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give commission to the Beneficed Parson himself, no more then he could

               <p>The Lords found that Member of the Alleadgence, of <hi>Buckcleughs,</hi> being dead

defend the Tack; for the Right of Patronage, being <hi>jus incorporale,</hi> might be
Transmitted by Disposition, without Infeftment, and albeit <hi>Buckcleugh</hi> was
not formerly denuded, even by Disposition, so that if he had consented to another

Lady and her Husband, for all Right that either of them had, had given a
Right to their Cautioners to uplist the Mails and Duties of the Lands in
question, for payment of Debts, and this Debt particularly, whereon this
Appryzer proceeds; with power also, to the Cautioners, to Dispone any part
of the Lands for payment of the Debts; which the Lady Ratified Judicial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and which now Excludes her from hindring any of these Creditors to

It was only in favours of the Cautioners, for their Relief; but the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

could condescend, that by the Creditors, or Cautioners fault, in not making

Iuly 23. 1666.</head>
               <p>THE Earl of <hi>Southesk,</hi> and the late Marquess of <hi>Argyl,</hi> being Caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for the late Marquess of <hi>Huntly,</hi> for the Tochers of the Daughters
of <hi>Huntly,</hi> they got an Infeftment of the Lands of <hi>Badzenoch,</hi> for their relief,
bearing, that according as they should be distrest, they should have access to
the Rents of the Lands, in so far as might pay the Annualrent of the Sum,
which they should be distrest for. whereupon they were Infeft in <hi>Anno</hi>
1643. And thereafter <hi>Southesk</hi> was distrest, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. Whereupon, in
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55692:207"/>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1655. He pursued an Action of Maills and Duties, upon the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment
of relieff against the said Lord <hi>Argyl,</hi> who was in Possession; and
my Lord <hi>Argyl</hi> having long before granted an Bond of relieff to <hi>Southesk,</hi>
he used Horning, and Caption thereupon, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1655. and in <hi>Anno</hi> 1658.
he used Inhibition upon the said Bond against <hi>Argyl,</hi> who in <hi>Anno</hi> 1658 En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in a new Contract with <hi>Southesk,</hi> whereby, in Corroberation of the first
Infeftment, he granted him a Wodset of the Lands of <hi>Enzie,</hi> with a Back-tack,
by vertue whereof, <hi>Southesk</hi> uplifted several years of the Back-tack
Dutie. <hi>Southesk</hi> now pursues the Marquess of <hi>Huntly,</hi> and his Tenents, for
declaring of his Right, and payment of the Maills and Duties. it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
for the Defenders. <hi>First,</hi> absolvitor, because the Marquess of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyl</hi>
hath been Retoured, to have possest the Lands of <hi>Badzenoch,</hi> peaceably,
by the space of 5 years before his Forefaulture, which was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1661.
Conform to the Act of Parliament 1584. By vertue thereof, this Marquess
of <hi>Huntly,</hi> as the King's Donatar, to the Forefaulture, in so far as concerns
the Estate of <hi>Huntly,</hi> has undoubted Right, and needs not dispute what
Right <hi>Southesk</hi> had, before the five years. It was answered, for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer.
<hi>First,</hi> That the Act of Parliament, 1584, ought not now to take effect,
because, by the late Act of Parliament 1617. Seasine and Reversions are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be Registrat, otherwise they are null, and therefore the ground
of the Act of Parliament 1584. <hi>viz. The abstracting of Evidents Ceasing,</hi>
the said Act it self must also cease. <hi>2dly.</hi> The said Act can only take place,
where it is not constant, what Right the Forefault Person had, but that he
was repute to be the ancient Heretor of the Lands, but where the Forefault
Persons Right is known, to have been <hi>Beations</hi> Compryzing, or this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
Right, granted to him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and the Pursuer, for their Cautionrie, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptio
cedit veritati,</hi> and the Right must only be holden to be such a Right
as truly it was. <hi>3dly.</hi> The five years Possession being in effect a Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in favours of the King, and his Donatar, whatsoever would interrupt
any other Prescription; must interrupt this; as if within the five years, the
Pursuer had intented a Reduction of the Forefault Persons Right; or an
Action for Maills and Duties, or had required for his Sums, and charged
thereupon, all these would be sufficient interruptions, against this quinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Possession, and would take away the presumption of Collusion, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting.
<hi>4thly,</hi> The five years possession, by the Act of Parliament bears,
expresly, to be peaceable, so that if it was <hi>turbata possessio,</hi> it would not be
enough, and being once a troubled possession, by any legall interruption,
after the said interruption, that subsequent possession ceases not to be a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
possession; though there be no furder interruption, within the 5 years,
because interruption once used, endures for 40. years. <hi>Ita est, Argyls</hi> posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was troubled, by pursuits, to compt for the Maills and Duties of these Lands,
upon this Right, and that within a year, or two, before the five, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
within the 5. year, the Marquess of <hi>Argyl</hi> did corroborat this Right,
and in corroboration thereof granted Wodset of the Lands of <hi>Enzie,</hi> for the
Sums accummulat, by vertue whereof, the Pursuer, within the 5. years,
was in Possession<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by uplifting the Back-tack Dutie; which being a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative
Right, possession thereon is valid, for both. The Defender answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that his Defense upon the Act of Parliament stood valid, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all the Replyes, because the Act is clear, and unrepealled, that 5. years
peaceable possession of the Forefault Person, gives the King unquestionable
Right, it being retoured by an Inquest, as now this is. And as to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the possession, no Deed, done before the 5 years, can have any effect,
because, as the 5 years cut off the most Solemn anterior Rights, much more
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55692:208"/>
a Citation, or other Interruption, and as to the Interruptions, within the 5.
years, they are only two, one is an Inhibition against <hi>Argyl,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not upon this Infeftment, but upon a Personal obligement, by <hi>Argyl,</hi>
to relieve the Pursuer; neither does it at all relate to the possession, nor any
other Action; but only as an Inhibition, prohibits Alienation. And as for
the Contract of Wodset with <hi>Argyl,</hi> it is <hi>post commissum crimen,</hi> and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prejudge the Donatar. It was answered, that albeit the Forefault Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
Deeds being voluntar, <hi>post commissum crimen,</hi> cannot be effectual; yet
where it is upon a cause anterior to the Crime. <hi>viz. Argyls</hi> Intromission, by
the Infeftment of Relieff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and the distress occurring against the Pursuer after
the Crime, and he having pursued <hi>Argyl</hi> for compt and reckoning, in <hi>anno</hi>
1655. does not constitute any new voluntar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Right, nor can it be any way
collusive, being for an anterior cause; and after a pursuit: and therefore it
must work this much, to show, that the 5 years was interrupted, and in the
Course thereof, both the Pursuer, and Forefaulted Person acknowledged
this Right in question.</p>

This Coutract of the Cumulative Wodset, being granted, in
<hi>Anno</hi> 1656. It was answered, that <hi>Beatoun,</hi> before he was Infeft upon that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing,
had renunced all benefit of the Appryzing, and discharged the same,
in so far as it might be prejudicial to the Pursuers Right; which is presently
instructed. It was answered, that Renunciation was but personal, and was
never Registrat; and so could not be effectuall against any singular Successor;
much less against the Kings Donatar, having a real Right. It was answered,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55692:208"/>
that Appryzings are not of the nature of other real Rights, but they may be
taken away, by Intromission, Payment, or Discharge of the Appryzer, and
there needs no Resignation, nor Infeftment. It was answered, that albeit, by
the Act of Parliament 1621. Appryzings may be taken away by Intromission,
and that it hath been extended to payment, yet never to such personal Back-Bonds.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Appryzing to be taken away, by <hi>Beatons</hi> Back Bond,

<hi>contra non producta. William Blackwood,</hi> to whom by progress, the
Right is now come, produces the Appryzing, and the Extract of one of
the Bonds, whereupon it proceeded, and alleadges no Certification against
the Letters, and Executions of the Appryzing after so long time; the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing
being led in <hi>Anno</hi> 1621. and no Process of Reduction Rais'd, till

               <p>Likeas, he further alleadged, no Certification for not production of any
of the principal Bonds, because they were Registrat in the Registers of Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the Principals were lost. The Pursuer answered, that there were
pregnant Points of Falshood, <hi>viz. Purves</hi> having gone and left the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. And having been a Souldier Abroad, till

               <p>IN <hi>anno</hi> 1636: Sir <hi>Thomas Vrquhart</hi> of <hi>Cromerty</hi> gave a Security of a
House and some Lands, and a Salmond-fishing near <hi>Bamff,</hi> for 4000:
merks: and in <hi>anno</hi> 1637: There was 700: merks eiked and a Back-bond
relating to the first Wodset Renounced, and a full Possession granted on
both: There is a Clause of Redemption and Requisition upon payment of
the principal Sums, and Annualrents resting for the time. Sir <hi>Alexander
Vrquhart</hi> pursues <hi>Sherem,</hi> as now having Right to the Wodset, for Compt
and Reckoning: Who alleadged Absolvitor, because this being a proper
Wodset, wherein he had the full Possession, hazard of the Profits was not
comptable, especially, seing the chief part of the Wodset was a Fishing,
which was most uncertain; and though <hi>de facto</hi> he happened to get much
more then his Annualrent yet it is no Usurary Wodset, seing he might have
losed all. The Pursuer Replyed, that by the saids Clauses of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Requisition, he was not only obliged for the principal Sums, but
for the bygone Annualrents, resting unpayed; so that the Wodsetter had no
hazard: and therefore it is no proper Wodset, and he is comptable. The
Defender answered, that the Clause was only adjected <hi>ex stylo,</hi> for it did
not bear, that what Annualrent should be resting over and above Intromis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
should be Consigned, but the whole resting Annualrents; or at least
it had been adjected, in respect of the Back-bond, restricting the first Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set:
or in case the Wodsetter had been excluded from Possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:55692:211"/>The Lords found the Defender comptable in respect of the saids Clauses,
but there occurred to themselves this question, whether the Superplus more then
the Annualrent should compense? and abate the principal Sum at the time of
the Intromission, or only now, whereanent the Lords were of different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
many thought that when the meaning of the Parties was not full, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
that should be followed, which is most ordinar amongst provident Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ns,
hardly could it be thought that any would take a Wodset upon these Terms
to draw out the principal Sum, with excress yearly, but the Lords reserved that
Point to be considered, while it appeared whether there was any excress above
the Annualrent.</p>

Dec: 7: 1666:</head>
               <p>IN a Competition between <hi>Monteith</hi> and the Laird of <hi>Gloret.</hi> It was
alleadged for <hi>Monteith,</hi> that he ought to be preferred to the Sums in
question, because <hi>Glorets</hi> Assignation was obtained by <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> of
<hi>Kinglass,</hi> and was lying by him blank in the Assigneys name, and by him
filled up with <hi>Glorets</hi> Name, and delivered to him, so that <hi>Kinglass</hi> being
his true Author, any Discharge granted by him while the Bonds were
blank, and in his power, was relevant against <hi>Gloret</hi> his Assigney, <hi>Ita est
Kinglass,</hi> while or before the Bonds were in his power, did equivalent
to a Discharge, <hi>viz.</hi> oblieged himself to pay this Sum, and relieve the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Debitor thereof; and instead of the Discharge he took this blank Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
filled up by him in <hi>Glorets</hi> Name. <hi>2ly,</hi> The Charge though in
<hi>Glorets</hi> Name, is to <hi>Kinglass's</hi> behove: and if he were Charging his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liegment
to pay the Debt, would exclude him: And therefore must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Charger. It was answered that <hi>Gloret</hi> was in <hi>bona fide,</hi> to take
this Assignation, knowing nothing of the Back-bond; and that an Oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to satisfie the Debt, was not equivalent to a Discharge: Neither is
the having of the Assignation, though blank, equivalent to an Assignation,
unless the Name of <hi>Kinglassie</hi> had been filled up and Intimat.</p>
               <p>The Lords having taken <hi>Glorets</hi> Oath before Answer, wherein he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,

               <p>The Lords found that the Assignation being accepted by <hi>Gloret</hi> in Terms
aforesaid, that it was but a Corroborative Security, and so found the Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

               <p>SIr <hi>George Mckenzie</hi> Advocat pursues a Reduction of a Bond granted by
him as Cautioner for his Father, (the Bond is now Assigned to <hi>Iohn
Fairholm</hi>) on these Reasons. <hi>First,</hi> That the Bond is null, as being done
by a Minor, being in his Fathers Family, and not being Authorized by his
Father, as lawful Administrator: And therefore in the same condition as a
Minor having Curators, they not Confirming such Deeds are null, and may
be Reduced at any time, though they have not been quarrelled within the
Minors Age of twenty five. <hi>2ly,</hi> Because Curators being chosen as a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Levity of Minors, they cannot Authorise the Minor to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
behove, but such Deeds are null: So neither could the Pursuers
Father Authorize him to be Cautioner for himself. The Defender answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>First,</hi> That albeit a Father, as lawful Administrator, and Tutor
to his Children, excludes all other Tutors, yet he is not Curator after
their Pupillarity, because they may choose other Curators, and that <hi>filij fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milias,</hi>
in the Civil Law could not Contract without their Fathers consent.
It was a special Statute, <hi>per Senatus consultum Macedonianum,</hi> and not as
Curator. <hi>2ly,</hi> The Father cannot be lyable for his Omissions by his unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Authorizing his Children, for such Actions would be <hi>contra pieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
&amp; obsequium. 3ly,</hi> There is nothing more frequent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then
Sons to have a distinct Estate, while in their Fathers Families, given by
the Father, or otherwise, whereof they have the full Administration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Authority. <hi>4ly,</hi> Whatever may be alleadged for Children residing in
the Family of their Father, yet that cannot be extended to Children, Acting by
themselves, far from their Fathers Family: but the Pursuer was so living,
and Acting at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> attending the <hi>Tolbooth,</hi> and was <hi>majori ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ati pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi>
being past 20. The Pursuer answered, that his Reason stood still
Relevant, because by the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Father is lawful Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to his Children, and is not ordinarly designed lawful Tutor, but law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Administrator, which does not only endure during their Pupillarity,
but during their Minority; but at least, till they be Married, or <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risfamiliat;</hi>
or till they have a distinct Subsistence or Calling. And albeit
the Children be not Residing in the Family, yet they are <hi>in familia,</hi> so long
as they are there, and not separat from the same, as the Pursuer was: and
albeit the Son may choose other Curators, if the Father permit, or the
Judge think fit, and is not conveenable for his Mis-authorizing, or Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that infers only that he is only Curator <hi>honorarius.</hi> The Defender did
furder alleadged, that the Father had furder Authorized, in so far as he Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
the said Bond, and so consented that his Son should Subscribe, and
neither was the Deed <hi>in rem su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Lords found the Reasons of Reduction Relevant, and Repelled the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenses:
and albeit many thought that the Father Subscribing with the Son, was
sufficient to Authorize; yet that it was not sufficient, being Caution for himself,
<hi>in rem suam</hi> but did not proceed to cause the Parties condescend how near Sir
<hi>George</hi> was to Majority, and what was his way of living.</p>

Decem: 11: 1666:</head>
               <p>AN Action of Double Poynding, at the Instance of the Tennents of

It was alleadged for the Earl of <hi>Cassils,</hi> that the Lands in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being holden Ward of him, is now in his hands, by reason of the Ward
of <hi>Knockdaw</hi> his Vassal, he had now Right to their Multures, and they

and shew his Infeftment, containing the Lands of <hi>Dalmortoun per

because that <hi>Kennedy</hi> of <hi>Blarquhan,</hi> the Earls Vassal, both of the Lands
of <hi>Dalmortoun</hi> and <hi>Blarquhan,</hi> had Disponed to him the Lands of <hi>Blarquhan</hi>

time <hi>Blarquhan</hi> caused his Tennents of <hi>Dalmortoun,</hi> to come to the said Miln
of <hi>Sklintoch,</hi> whereby the Thirlage was not only Constitute of the Lands of
<hi>Blarquhan,</hi> but of <hi>Dalmortoun.</hi> It was answered for the Earl: <hi>First,</hi> That
the Thirlage of <hi>Dalmortoun</hi> could not be Constitute by the said Clause;
because the Lands of <hi>Dalmortoun</hi> being no part of that Barony, whereof
the Miln of <hi>Sklintoch</hi> is the Miln: But a distinct Tenement holden of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Superiour: Such a general Clause could never have Constitute a
Thirlage, unless the Lands had been exprest. <hi>2ly,</hi> Albeit the Servitude had
been Constitute never so clearly by the Vassal: Yet if it was without the
Superiours consent, it could not prejudge him by Ward, or Non-entry.
It was answered for <hi>Iohn Whitefoord</hi> to the <hi>First,</hi> That the Clause was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to Constitute the Thirlage: and if it wrought not that Effect, it
was of no Effect, because the hail Lands of the Barony were Disponed with
the Miln, and neither needed, nor could be Thirled: And therefore the
Clause of Thirlage behoved to be meaned of some other Lands. <hi>2ly,</hi> Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
may lawfully Constitute Servitudes without consent of the Superiour
which are not Evacuat by Ward, or Non-entry. <hi>3ly,</hi> It is offered to be
proven, that the Earl consented to the Right of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lture, in so far as
the Lands of <hi>Dalmortoun</hi> being Appryzed from <hi>Blarquhan</hi> by <hi>Iohn Gilmour,</hi>
he assigned the Appryzing to <hi>Iohn Whitefoord,</hi> who Assigned or Disponed
the same to <hi>Kilkerren:</hi> in which Asignation, there was an express Reservation
of the Multurs of <hi>Dalmortoun</hi> to the Miln of <hi>Sklintoch:</hi> upon which Infeftment

The Lords found the Clause aforesaid in <hi>Iohn Whitefords</hi> Charter not to

and holden of another Superiour: Nor no Decreets nor Enrolments of Court,
alleadged to astruct the Servitude. And found also the second Reason Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Earl as Superiour, not having consented, was not

found that the Reservation in <hi>Kilkerrens</hi> Right, unless it were <hi>per expressum,</hi>
contained in the Charter Subscribed by the Earl of <hi>Cassils,</hi> could not infer

The Pursuer was not obliged to know, or enquire whether the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

himself as Heretable Possessor, by uplifting the Duties he did pursue him, and
if need beis, offers him to prove, that he did require him to keep him skaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
though he took no Instrument thereon. The Defender answered, that
he was not obliged to take notice of such Requisitions, not being Solemn by
Instrument.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Defender lyable, albeit there had been no Requisition ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
or otherwise, it being proven that the Ruinousness of the Tenement that fell,
was notour and manifest to the Defender himself, whereby he was obliged, either
to demolish the House, if it was not Reparable, or to have quite his Possession, to
evite the imminent damnage of Neighbours.</p>

               <p>THe Lord <hi>Colvil</hi> as Heretable Bailzie of <hi>Culross,</hi> having Charged the
Lord <hi>Kincairn</hi> and others for the Taxation of their Lands in <hi>Culross,</hi>

Roll contained a fifth part more then the Taxation. It was answered, and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55692:214"/>
offered to be proven, that it was the Custom of that and other Benefices at
their meeting of making the Stent-roll, to add a fifth part for Expenses and
Charges of ingathering the Taxation. The Defenders answered, that if any
such Custom were, it was against Law, and against the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
who could be lyable for no payment, but by Law, or of their own
consent; or if any such Custome were, it hath been by the consent of the
Vassals, or at least they have not questioned the same, nor is there any ground
for such an addition, for the Kings Officers being obliged by their Office, to
Collect His Majesties Taxations, they can demand nothing of them who pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without Process; and if they be put to Process, the Lords will modifie
such Expences as they see cause. The Charger answered, That such imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
Customes have the strength of Law; and that it was done with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all the Vassals who conveened; and that it was the Suspenders fault
that they conveened not to make the stent Roll, which should not put them
in better case then they had conveened: or if they had conveened, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assented,
there is no reason, that the dissassent of a few should be preferred
to the consent of the most part, who as they may Vot in the stent Roll, for
the Taxation it self; in which the plurality carries: so must they for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Expences: and all that can be alleadged with reason is, that the
Lords may modifie the Expences of a fifth part, if it be too high. The Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penders
answered, that Law authorized the Feuars, as a Court and Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to meet and stent, which implyes a power to the Plurality, but there
is no such warrand for Expences; as to which, the consent of a hundred can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
oblige the dissassent of one, or of one absent, and the absents have loss
enough, that they have not a Vot in their own Stent.</p>
               <p>The Lords sustained the Reason of the Suspension, notwithstanding of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
and found that no Expences, nor any thing more than the Taxation could
be stented, to have effect against these who consented not, but they would modifie Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
in case of Suspension, as the Cause required, but modified none in this case,
because a fifth part was Charged for, more then was due.</p>

The Defender alleadged that his Infeftment was cled with Possession, in so
far as his Fathers Liferent was reserved thereby, and his Father Possessing by
vertue of the Reservation, did validat his Infeftment. <hi>2ly,</hi> Albert the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Liferent, seing the Father had no more, neither needs it have an Infeftment,
seing it hath but the effect of an Assignation to a Liferent. It was answered,
that if the Father had expresly assigned his Liferent, reserved in the base In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment,
it might have been the ground of a question, whether the Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
Possessing so, would have validat the base Infeftment? But since the

clears that he did not Possess by the Reservation, but by his own prior Right.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Reason of Reduction and Reply Relevant, and that the

whatsoever Testament, Legacy or Disposition, made or to be made by the

expresly sums of Money, did comprehend all sums, although Infeftment of

               <p>THe Debate betwixt <hi>Paul Henrison</hi> and <hi>Ludquharn,</hi> was this day heard

War against the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and his Subjects, <hi>Ita est</hi> the Owners of
the Ship are Subjects to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> because it is notour that this
Isle is a part of the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and till of late was in the same
condition, as any other of his Territories; and albeit the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi>
have now an Interest by Possession, or Infeodation, that alters not their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but the same is still presumed, unless
they will positively prove, that the same is alter'd, and the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi>
constitute Soveraign therein, and they liberat from his Jurisdiction, Tolls,
and Imposts for War. It was answered, that this Stranger was not obliged
to Dispute the Right or Investiture of the Duke of <hi>Holstein;</hi> but it was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for him to say, that before this War they did own him as their Prince
for simple acknowledgement of a Superiour, or Investitur from him, doe
not make Subjects, or comprehend them within the Wars, and Quarrels of
their Superiours: yea, though there were a Tribute or Jurisdiction due to
that Superiour, yet if the Prince do enjoy the Priviledges of making War
and Peace, he is not a simple Subject, but in so far a Soveraign Prince, as some of
the Princess of the Empyre, hold of the Emperour paying him Tribute: and
there lyes an appeal to the Soveraign Imperial Court; yet because they can
make War and Peace, they are not necessarly involved within the Emperours
Quarrels. So the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> being a Soveraign Prince, and possessing
this Island, so as to make use of the Subjects thereof in Peace and War;
therefore is not comprehended in the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Quarrel; nor is he,

him in certain Lands, Disponed to him by the Defender, wherein he
was oblieged to obtain him Infeft. The Defender alleadged absolvitor from
the payment of the Ticket, because it must be presumed to be payed on these
grounds; <hi>first,</hi> Since the Ticket, the Defender sold Land to the Pursuer,
so that it must be presumed it was Counted and included in the price, and
albeit that presumption were not sufficient alone, it is fortified by these two,
<hi>viz.</hi> That it is twenty eight years since the Bond was granted, and no word
ever heard thereof: and that umquhil <hi>Polwart</hi> in his Testament, gave up
an Inventar of the Debts owing to him, wherein no mention is of the Bond.
It was answered, that a Writ could not be taken away by Witnesses proving
payment: much less by presumptions: and as to the Taciturnity, which is the
main one, umquhil <hi>Polwart</hi> dyed about seven years after the Bond was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Pursuer was Minor most of the time since. It was answered,
that Presumptions have been oftimes sufficient to take away VVrits, as was
found in the case of the Lady <hi>Trabroun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords Found the Presumptions not Relevant, and that they were
nothing so strong, as these of the Lady <hi>Trabroun,</hi> which were thus; <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broun</hi>
granted a Bond of 5000 merks to <hi>Alexander Peebles,</hi> which was taken
away on these Presumptions, that thereafter <hi>Trabroun</hi> had granted a Bond
of 10000 merks to the said Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was his Advocat, with
whom he had many Affairs; and therefore it was to be presumed, the last
Bond included the first; especially seing <hi>Trabroun</hi> decaying in his Fortune,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55692:219"/>
Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> apdryzed his Lands upon the last Bond, and not upon the first,
which he might have done with the same Expence, and that he never mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing thereupon all his Life, by the space of twenty six years; and
in the Inventar of his Testament, he made no mention of it: and that his
Executors being Examined <hi>ex officio,</hi> did acknowledge they had found it
amongst old cast Papers. The Defender furder alleadged absolvitor from
the Composition, because he was never required by <hi>Polwart,</hi> to procure
the Infeftment from the Earl of <hi>Hume,</hi> which he could easily have done <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
he being his Uncle, especially seing there was no Term in his Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

No Declarator upon this Order, because the Back-bond is Personal to my

Drummond,</hi> nor no Stranger can have Right thereby to Redeem. <hi>2ly,</hi> The
Back-bond is extinct, and null by committing of the Clause Irritant, in so
far as payment has not been made before 1662. The Purswer answered
to the first, that albeit the Reversion had been Personal to my Lord, only
excluding his Heirs and Assigneys; yet my Lord in his own Lifetime might
Redeem, and being Redeemed, the Right would belong to any to whom
my Lord had, or should Dispone. <hi>2ly,</hi> This Clause Irritant is <hi>pactum legis

Bonds Modified of consent of Parties, especially in this case, where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
is not of a single liquid sum, but comprehends a general Clause of
all Debts that were, or should be after due. The Defender answered, that
Clauses Irritant in Wodsets, are not rejected by our Law, but are valide,
only, where Declarators are requisit, The Lords may Reduce them to the
just Interest of Parties before Declarator: But here there needs no Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,
because the Defender is in Possession, and may except upon the Clause
Irritant committed, and the Clause bears, to be Effectual without Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and albeit this Clause could now be Reduced to the just Interest, it is
only this, that seing <hi>Tullibardine</hi> hath sold the Land, the Defender should

that <hi>Ochtertyre</hi> should have the Lands for the Price Sir <hi>John Drummond</hi> gave,

her Liferent of the Lands of <hi>Innertyle,</hi> to <hi>Cuninghame</hi> of <hi>Woodhal,</hi>
who transferred the same to Mr. <hi>Alexander F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Liferent should be applyed to the Aliment of their Families joyntly; and
therefore obliged himself to Dispone in their favours, and <hi>de presenti</hi> did
Dispone. The next day after this Disposition, there is a Contract of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

should have the Mails and Duties, to the effect contained in the Back-bond,
and that he would not make further use of the Re-disposition contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
It was answered for the Lady, that <hi>Collingtouns</hi> concourse could not
sustain this Process, because <hi>Ratho</hi> was already <hi>de presenit,</hi> denuded in favours
of <hi>Collingtoun</hi> and her; Likeas <hi>Collingtoun</hi> was denuded by his Contract of
Marriage whereby he renunces his <hi>jus ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ds, in favours of the Lady, and so renunces the Clause of
the Back-bond, in so far as it is in his favours. It was answered, that the
Contract of Marriage could not derogat to the Back-bond, unless the Back-bond
had been <hi>per expressum,</hi> Discharged or Renunced therein, because
albeit the Contract of Marriage be a day posterior to the Back-bond, yet
both are parts of one Treaty of Marriage, and so in the same condition, as if
they were in one Writ, so that a posterior Clause in general Terms, cannot
take away a prior special Clause of this moment; yea though it were in a
Contract le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

general Clauses are not extended above what is specially exprest, and the <hi>jus
mariti</hi> being exprest, and the Back-bond not exprest, it cannot be presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they changed their minds in one night, to Renunce the benefit of the
Back-bond; but this Conveyance was made of purpose, because <hi>Collingtoun</hi>
being in Debt, if the Right were Constitute in a third Party, and only to
their behove as an aliment, the Creditors could not reach the same, but it
were the greatest Cheat imaginable, to conceive that the general Clause sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,
should evacuat the whole design, and take away the provision of
the Back-bond: Neither doth the general Clause renunce all Right that
<hi>Collingtoun</hi> had, or might have to the Liferent-lands, any manner of way;
but only all Right he could have by the subsequent Marriage, any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of way. <hi>Ita est,</hi> that he doth not claim Right <hi>jure mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
nor by the subsequent Marriage; but by the Paction contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:55692:225"/>
in the Back-bond; and it is most certain that the <hi>jus Mariti,</hi> which is
most peculiar to this Nation, doth not comprehend all Rights a Husband
hath, in relation to the Person, or Means of his Wife, but only the Right
of moveable Goods, or Sums, which without any Paction, whatsoever way
they come in her Person, belong <hi>ipso facto</hi> to him, not by Paction, but by
Law; and that <hi>jure mariti,</hi> or by vertue of the Marriage: so tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> albeit
he could not have Right, even by the Paction, except that he were Husband,
or that Marriage had followed, yet his Paction is his Title, and not the
Marriage, which is but <hi>tacita conditio,</hi> or <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> so that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging,
or Renuncing of the <hi>jus mariti,</hi> or the benefit by the Marriage,

was further alleadged by the Lady, that albeit the Renunciation could not
reach the Back-bond, in so far as it is a Paction, so that it yet stood effectal
for application of the Liferent right, for the aliment of the Lady and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingtouns</hi>

equally, and the Husband could pretend no Right in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and therefore he acknowledging that he has renunced his <hi>jus mariti,</hi> cannot

that it was a true accompt, nothing omitted in prejudice of the publick;
after which he could not be questioned, either for any thing in the accompt,
or for any thing omitted and not charged. The Pursuer answered, that the
<hi>Act of Indemnity</hi> contains an express exception of all Persons, that medled
with any publick Moneys, and had not made Compt therefore, that they
should yet be comptable. <hi>2ly,</hi> The accompt produced contains
two accompts, one in <hi>anno</hi> 1641: another in <hi>anno</hi> 1643. The first is not
approven by the Committee, but adjusted by three persons, who were no
members of the Committee, and whose Warrand is not Instructed: and
the second compt is only approven, wherein the Charge is a Rest in the
Tennents hands of the former accompt, and the Oath is only adjected to
the second accompt, which cannot Import that <hi>Lambertoun</hi> ommitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the first accompt, but only that he ommitted nothing in the second,
and his Oath is only to the best of his knowledge, and can import no more,
than the Oath of an Executor upon the Inventar, which excludes not the
Probation of super Intromission. It was answered for the Defender, that
the second accompt being the rest of the first accompt, the approbation of
the second must approve both, and the approbation is sufficient Warrand
for him to intromet, and the Auditors to compt with him.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Defense upon the Act of Indemnity, in respect of the
foresaid Exception contained therein; and likewise found, that the Oath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to the second accompt, could not exclude the Pursuer from insisting, for
the Defenders Fathers intromissions ommitted out of the first accompt, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

this casualty to be, the avail of the appearand Heir of the Vassals Marriage,
Marrying after his Predecessors Death: and as to the ground insinuat of fraud,
by precipitation it is no wayes relevant. <hi>First,</hi> Because, albeit it did appear

yet here is no fraud, but a warrantable Providence, which is not <hi>dolus

the Right, and Interest of another is taken away: as for example, any He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retor
may dam, or divert the water upon his ground, as he pleases, and
cannot be hindred, upon pretence that his Neighbour might thereafter make
use of that water for a Miln to be built, and yet if the Miln were built, he
could not thereafter alter the course of the water; so here the Superior
having no present Right, but in <hi>spe,</hi> the Vassal endeavouring to prevent
the casualty, commits neither fraud, nor fault; otherwise upon pretence of
fraud, a Marriage might be claimed, when the Predecessors resign in favours
of his appearand Heir, or suffers his Land to be Appryzed, in name, or
to the behove of the appearand Heir, which yet was never challenged,
neither hath a Marriage been obtained, or demanded upon this ground by
the space of these threescore years. <hi>2ly,</hi> Albeit prevention could be fraud,
yet here is nothing alledged to infer fraud, which is never presumed, unless it

<hi>viz.</hi> That the Defunct desired to see his Successor Married to his satisfaction, it

take place, in all the largeness he sets it down, or else there shall need no

is only introduced in favours of Heirs, that their Predecessors shall not
prejudge them, shall now be made use of against the Heir, that his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
can do nothing to his benefite, on Death-bed. The Pursuer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the feudal Contract being of its own Nature Gratuitous and
most favourable on the Part of the Superior, that which he hath for his
Fee, being ordinarly the Service of the Vassal, and the profit of the Fee
when the Vassal is unserviceable, through Minority (reserving the Vassals
own Aliment) and the profit of the Vassals Tocher; the Vassal ought not
to defraud, or prejudge him therein. And albeit custom hath introduced
an exception, that the Tocher is not due to the Superior, which was gotten
during the Predecessors Life, it being ordinarly consumed, and applyed
to the Predecessors use; yet that by precipitation the appearand Heir should
enjoy the same, and not the Superior, is against the Gratitude, Amity,
and Obliegement of the Vassal: neither is there any Parity in the Case of a
Resignation, to which the Superior consents, or in the Case of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing,
wherein the Superior must Receive, by the force of Law; nor
can the forbearance of sixty years infer a contrary Custome, because this is
a Case rarely contingent, and oft times not known to the Kings Officers;
and though it were, their negligence prejudges not the King, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Act of Parliament; neither is that a Custome which People use to do,

albeit the Decisions Adduced by him be not at large, yet the circumstances of

more pregnant in any other Case, where there was no Proclamation, and

whereupon this Redemption proceeds. It was answered for the Pursuer. 1.
That the Earl only consents, and the Charter bears that the Sums were pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Barcklay,</hi> whose Right produced is a Wodset, granted by the

of a great value, and did no ways stop nor hinder the same, nor call
them to an Account. <hi>2ly,</hi> He himself Intrometred with the said Wood,
at least others by his Warrand; which Warrand must be presumed in so
far as he having a Commission, and oblidged for diligence, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suffer the Wood openly to be cutted, but applyed a part thereof to his

                  </gap>
The Defender answered, <hi>First,</hi> That he could never be lyable to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
for his Omission, because his only Tittle was his Right of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
whereby the Defender was lyable to Restore to him what he
had Intrometted with, and not Counted for, but for his oblidgement to
do Diligence, it was only personal granted to the Estates; and albeit they
Restored the Pursuer to the Estate, they never Assigned him to that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.
<hi>2ly,</hi> The Defender is secured by the Act of Indemnity, except
in so far as he Intrometted, and did not duely Count, as was found by the
former Interloquitor in this Cause: and as to the second member, It was
answered that the Defender being only Countable for his Fathers Intromission
not Counted for, albeit he had given warrand to others, except he had
received satisfaction from them, it is not his own Intromission. <hi>2ly,</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
or Command, is only Probable by Writ or Oath, and no way by
Presumption, upon such Circumstances, which Presumptions are also
taken off by others more pregnant, <hi>viz.</hi> That these Woods were cutted
by Persones in Power and Interest in the Countrey, who had no Relation
or Interest in the Defenders Father, whom he was not able to stop or
hinder, and most part thereof was Clandestinly cut and stolen away by
meaner Persons. It was answered for the Pursuer, that he being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored,
Succeeds in place of the Estates, and as what is done by a <hi>nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorum
gestor</hi> without Warrand, is profitable for these for whom he negotiats,
so must this be which was done by the Estates. As to the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity,
the meaning thereof can be no more then that Parties who
Acted shall be in no worse case then they would have been with that
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:55692:231"/>
Party whom they followed, As to the second member, the Pursuer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that what was done by others, by the Defenders Fathers Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
must be his Intromission, seing it is all one to do by himself, or by
another; and seing it cannot be called Omission, it must be Intromis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
<hi>2ly,</hi> Though Command or Warrand is ordinarly Probable by Writ,
or Oath. Yet there are <hi>casus excepti,</hi> as whatsoever is done for any Party
in his presence, is by all Lawyers said to be <hi>ex mandato &amp; inde oritur actio
mandati, &amp; non negotiorum gestorum,</hi> so that the presence, or tollerance of
a person not only having Power, but being oblidged for Diligence, must
much more infer his Power or Warrand: And albeit he was not alwayes
present, yet the Deeds being publick, and near the place of his abode, it is
equivalent:</p>
               <p>The Lords inclined not to sustain the first member, both in respect of the Act
of Indemnity which bears in it self to be most amply extended, and in respect
that the Pursuer had no Right to the Personal Obligation, or Diligence: but as
to the second member, the Lords were more clear as to what was done in the
Defenders Fathers presence, but in respect it was more amply proponed. The
Lords, before answer, ordained Witnesses to be Examined by the Pursuer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or not the Woods were publickly cutted, and whether or not <hi>Lambertoun</hi>

pursued him before the late Judges for Payment of the Profit of the Coal. In
which pursuit he did alledge that he could not Count, nor Pay to the
Children the whole Profit of the Coal, but so much thereof as was free
over and above the Back-tack Duty, due both out of Land and Coal,
by vertue of the Wodset granted to <hi>Iames Loch,</hi> who stood thereupon
publickly Infeft, and to which Wodset Mr. <hi>Mark Ker</hi> his own Son had
Right, to whom he had payed the Back-tack Duty, and obtained his
Discharge; this being found relevant by the Judges, he produced Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
Discharges granted by his Son; the Judges found that these Holograph
Discharges did not prove Payment made <hi>debito tempore,</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
without allowance of the Back-tack Duty: <hi>Andrew Ker</hi> pursues
a Reduction of this Decreet as unjust, in so far as the Back-tack Duty
was not allowed, as not payed <hi>debito tempore,</hi> whereas the Back-tack being
a real Burden upon the whole Profits <hi>jure hypothecae;</hi> all Intrometters with
the Profits were lyable to the Wodsetter; and so <hi>Andrew Ker</hi> as Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metter
was lyable to the Wodsetter, and was not obliged to imploy that
part of the Profit for Anualrent to the Children, although he were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to imploy their own means, and so might lawfully have payed the
Wodsetter, or keeped it in his own hand for his own relief, and the
Wodsetters Discharge at any time was sufficient to free the Children. It
was answered that there was no iniquity committed, because <hi>Andrew Ker</hi>
could only be lyable for the Back-tack Duty as Tutor and Overseer to the
Children, and even in that case he ought not to have payed without a
distresse, otherwise he prejudged the Children of their relief against the Heir,
who is obliged to relieve them of the Back-tack Duty, and when ever he
were distrest, he would not he obliged to pay any Anualrent to the Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setter
for the Back-tack Duties which was the Wodsetters own Annualrent,
so that till the time of the distresse the whole Annualrent should have been
put out to the use of the Children upon Annualrent, so that the Back-tack
Duties can only be allowed from this time, but not yearly as they were
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:55692:232"/>
due, otherwise the Bairns lose the benefit of the Anualrent the mean time,
but there being no distresse <hi>Andrew Ker</hi> could never be lyable to the Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setter.
It was answered for the Pursuer, that the Wodsetter being his own Son,
there was no reason to put him to any Action, especially seing the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
cannot alledge that in any such Action they had a competent Defense,
or that the Heir has any Defense whereupon to exclude their relief: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any reason that the Children should have Anualrent for the
Back-tack Duty till it was payed, because it was not theirs, nor might he
safely put it out of his hands, albeit the Wodsetter had been a stranger,
and albeit he be now <hi>functus officio</hi> as Overseer, the Title that made him
lyable to the Wodsetter, was as Intrometter which is a perpetual obligation,
the Wodsetter, as all Masters of the ground, having <hi>jus hypothecae</hi> upon the
Profit; for payment of Tack Duty for which all Intrometters are lyable.</p>
               <p>The Lords reduced that part of the Iudges Decreet, and found that <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoun</hi>
as Intrometter was lyable to the Wodsetter, and might retain so much of the
Profits in his hands as would pay the Back-tack Duty, and was not obliged to give
out for the Children upon Annualrent: But if <hi>de facto</hi> he had given it out in
his own name for Annualrent found that the Children should have the benefite
thereof.</p>

contra
Laird of Milntoun.
Feb. 25. 1667.</head>
               <p>THe Lady <hi>Milntoun</hi> having obtained Divorce against <hi>Iohn Maxwel</hi>
younger of <hi>Calderwood</hi> her Husband, before the Commissars of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Whitefoord</hi> of <hi>Milntoun,</hi> who had gotten a Disposition of her
Liferent-right from her Husband, pursues Reduction of the Decreet of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
on these Reasons that the Decreet was in absence, and that he
compeared befor the Commissars, and craved to be admitted for his entrest,
and was refused, and if he had been admitted he would have objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Paterson</hi> and <hi>Clerk</hi> the only two proving Witnesses, that they were
not <hi>habile</hi> Witnesses, being neither men of Fame nor Estate, and <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
by common Reputation of very evil Fame, and that they were not purged
of partial counsel, but suborned by the Lady, and had both received mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to bear Testimony, and promise of more, and were prompted by the
Pursuer how to Depone. <hi>2ly,</hi> As they were not <hi>habile,</hi> so neither did they
prove the Commission of Adultery. The Lords caused produce the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and Testimonies before the Commissars, and finding that the Witnesses
were not purged of partial counsel, they ordained them to be re-examined
upon such Interrogators as were not contrair to their former Depositions,
whereupon they were twice re-examined. <hi>Paterson</hi> in his first examination
before the Commissars, Depones that he knew <hi>John Maxwel</hi> and his Lady,
and that he saw <hi>John Maxwel</hi> in naked Bed with <hi>Margaret Davidson</hi> lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
her, and that he upbraided <hi>Iohn Maxwel</hi> for it, who answered he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
not alwise his Wife about with him. <hi>Clerk</hi> Deponed that in another
Moneth, at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> he saw <hi>John Maxwel</hi> in naked Bed with <hi>Margaret Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidson,</hi>
and that the said <hi>Iohn</hi> was very displeas'd at his coming in to the Room.
The Goodman of that House being another Witnesse, deponed that <hi>John
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:55692:233"/>
Maxwel</hi> and another Man, and two Women lay altogether at one time in one
Bed in his House, and that he saw <hi>John Maxwel</hi> very familiar with one of the
Women, Embracing and Kissing her, and keeping her upon his knee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he put them out of his House. Another Witnesse Deponed, that seeing
<hi>Margaret Davidson</hi> with Child, she acknowledged to him that it was to <hi>John
Maxwel,</hi> and that it was commonly reported that she called the Child <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
after <hi>John Maxwel. Paterson</hi> and <hi>Clerk</hi> being re-examined by the Lords,
did purge themselves of partial counsel, but at the close of their Deposition, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terson</hi>
acknowledged that the Lady threw down a Dollar and a half upon the
Table, which he took up before his first Testimony; and in his second Re-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
acknowledgeth that she offered him five hundreth Merks, and to
be a Bairn of the House. And both acknowledged that she gave them Tokens,
to make appear they knew <hi>Margaret Davidson</hi> by her Countenance and Cloaths,
but both adhere to the truth of the former Deposition, and being asked how
they knew that Woman was <hi>Margaret Davidson</hi> Deponed that they knew her
not, nor saw her ever before nor after, but that <hi>John Maxwels</hi> Servant, called
<hi>Dougal Campbel</hi> being in the utter Room told them several times that that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
name was <hi>Margaret Davidson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the Depositions first and last, ordained the Parties
to Debate, whether Corruption or Subornation of the Witnesses being acknowledged
by themselves in their Re-examination did invalidat their Testimony, and whether
their Testimonies not ag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeing as in the same individual Act, but as to divers Facts,
and divers Times, and Places, were sufficient to prove.</p>
               <p>IT was alledged for the Lady, that whoever adduced Witnesses was obliged
to entertain them, and also denied that ever she gave Money, or promise;
and that it could not be instructed by the Re-examination of the Witnesses,
whose Post<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rior Testimony could never invalidat the first, or else there were
an open door for prevarication and bribing of Witnesses to alter their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
but the opinion of all Lawyers is, that a Witnesse may correct himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Testimony be perfected, and subscrived, not after. But the only way
was to protest for Reprobators and by other Witnesses to prove the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the witnesses, in which Case it behoved to be Proven, that there was
an undertaking, or at least endeavour, that they should bear witnesse to that
which they knew not to be true. As to the second point, it was alledged, that
albeit the common rule be that in matters Criminal, the witnesses must be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testes,</hi>
both being witnesses at once to the same indevidual Act, yet it had these
limitations. 1. That though this hold in <hi>Criminals specifico,</hi> yet not in <hi>crimine
generico,</hi> which may be perpetrat by reiterable Acts when the pursute is not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
but either for Tortour, Canonical Purgations, or to any Civil Effect, as
in Adultery it is <hi>crimen genericum,</hi> by reiterable Acts, and therefore being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
<hi>
                     <unclear>civiliter</unclear>
                  </hi> to separat the Marriage, or to restore the Joynture, it might be
proven by two witnesses, though not concurring in the same individual time
and place, and therefore singular, albeit not single witnesses. And the Lawyers
do generally give the instance in Adultery, which is a secret and transient Fact.
And if such proof were not sufficient it would be impossible to prove it;
but if Adultery were pursued Criminally in these Cases where it is Capital, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
were required more exact, and agreeing in time and place. Or if the
Case were in Murder, which is not reiterable, witnesses not agreeing in time
and place could not prove, but in Adultery, <hi>haeresie simonie,</hi> and such reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Crimes, witnesses to divers Facts being in the same Crime are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
for which <hi>Clarus, Farnatius</hi> and <hi>Covaruvias</hi> were cited. It was answered,
to the first point that Subornation of Corruption of witnesses is inferred by
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:55692:233"/>
attempts, or endeavours to prompt the witnesses to Depone that they know
not, albeit they did it not, nor yet undertook it; and that taking of any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
not only inhabilitats the Witnesses, but makes the Takers and Givers false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
is the opinion of all Lawyers, neither may the Witnesses take the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
of their Travel and Attendance, till it be Decerned by a Judge; and
as to the matter of Corruption the Witnesses own Oath is sufficient, even by
Re-examination, because the Adducer can never quarrel the Oath of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
adduced by himself, by which he carries the Cause, but much more where
the Witnesses acknowledge, that at the first Examination they were not Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
if they were free of partial Counsel, and if that be omitted, or not
understood be them, they may be Interrogat specially thereupon again, as
was done in this Case. To the second point, albeit more Witnesses being
singular, but not agreeing to the same Fact, or some times one VVitness
may be receiveable to infer Tortour, or that the several VVitnesses agree not
as to all the same points, and circumstances, as if the VVitnesses look through
a rift or hole, albeit they cannot see all at the same instant, yet all of them
see the same individual Fact, or if one VVitness Depone in the case of
Murder, that he saw the Party accused with a bended Pistol, or drawn
Sword go in to a Room, but going out saw no further, and another hear
the Shot and the Stroaks, and saw the accused coming out alone, or
with a bloody Sword, and a third saw the slain lying Dead in a Room,
and no more then these, although they agree not as to the same points and
minuts of Time, yet all agree in one Fact, but the VVitnesses not agreeing
to one Fact, are all single VVitnesses, and are not <hi>Contestes,</hi> and so cannot
be Confronted, Confirm'd, or Redargued each by other, which is the great
ground of Faithfulness, and Trust of Testimonies; but if one person alone
can bear VVitness where he knowes none can gainsay him, it would prompt
him to Perjury, or Mischief, and here the two VVitnesses are only <hi>ex audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi>
seing neither of them knew <hi>Margaret Davidson</hi> but only by the Report of
<hi>Dougal,</hi> so that both did not positively know that the Person with whom they
found <hi>Iohn Maxwel</hi> was not his Lady, seing <hi>Clerk</hi> neither knew the Lady
nor <hi>Margaret Davidson.</hi> It was answered for the Lady, that whatever may
infer Subornation or Corruption, it cannot be proven by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
to derogate their former Depositions, unless it were proven by others
upon Reprobators, and as to the other point in <hi>facto reiterabili,</hi> to a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
effect, VVitnesses though not agreeing in the same Fact, yet agreeing in
divers Facts of the same Crime were sufficient.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that Subornation or Corruption of the Witnesses could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by their own Posterior Testimony, and found the Adultery sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proven by the Testimony of the Witnesses, and Assoilzied from the Reduction,
and found the Letters orderly proceeded, used against <hi>Milntoun</hi> for Removing.
But <hi>Milntoun</hi> gave in a new Bill, offering him to prove by other Witnesses,
the Subornation and Corruption of the Witnesses in the Divorce, being in effect a
Reason of Reprobator, which is very competent in his Reduction, and yet the
Lords refused the same <hi>in hoc statu Processus,</hi> not being Libelled or Insisted
in before, but superceeded Execution in the Removing, &amp; as to the House and Mains
Possest be <hi>Milntoun</hi> till <hi>Martimass,</hi> that in the mean time he might Insist in
his Reprobators, as he would be Served.</p>

It was alleadged for the Defender, that the Countess Seasing was null,
not being Registrate conform to the Act of Parliament; It was answered,
that nullity cannot be proponed, either be the Granter of the Infeftment, or
any Representing him, or by any person who is obliged to acknowledge
the Infeftments; but the Earl is such a Person, that albeit he Brooks by a
Disposition from his Father, yet his Infeftment containes this Express Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
that his Father at any time during his Life may Dispone the Lands,
or any Part thereof, and grant Infeftments, Tacks, or Annualrents thereof;
so that this being unquestionably an Infeftment, he cannot quarrel the same
upon the not Registration, but if his Father had granted an Obliegment to
Infeft, the Defender could not have opposed the same, much more the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment
being Expede. It was answered, that the Provision did not contain
an Obligation upon the Defender to Dispone, Ratifie, or do any Deed,
but left only a Power to his Father to Burden the Lands, which can only be
understood, being done <hi>legitimo modo,</hi> and therefore the Infeftment want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:55692:234"/>
that he and the Pursuer, and the Laird of <hi>Reiris</hi> having three

in his Infeftment: and albeit <hi>Earls-halls</hi> Clause be not so express, yet
it not being the common Clause in the <hi>Tenendas cum piscationibus,</hi> but
in the Dispositive Clause of this special Tenor, it must needs comprehend
Salmond Fishing, or otherwise it would have no Effect, <hi>verba autem inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretanda

Inhibitions can reach no further then to the Lands the Person Inhibit had the

she should Sell what thereafter he acquired, the User of the Inhibition

Inhibitions can never hinder persons, having Right of Reversion, to pay
the Sums, and the Wodsetter to Renunce, because Inhibitions only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain,

pay his Debt; or upon payment of the Wodset Sums, to Discharge the

might be compelled, and if this hold, no man might saflie pay an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Band, having Infeftment of Annualrent, without searching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistes,
which the most cautious man never did, and for this alleadged the
expresse Opinion of <hi>Craig,</hi> that Inhibitions hinder not Discharges of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Sums, or Renunciations of VVodsets. It was answered, that Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions
are personal Prohibitions, Restraining the Person Inhibit, and the
Leiges to Alienat, Buy, or Sell any Lands in prejudice of the User of the
Inhibition, and until he be satisfied of the Ground thereof. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
respecteth the Person Inhibit directly, and the Lands; but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
as they belong to him, so that there is no difference whether they
belonged to him before or after; for <hi>hoc ipso</hi> that they are his, they fall
under the restraint: and the alienation thereof, is to the prejudice of the
User of the Inhibition, because if they were not Sold, they might Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryze
the same, so that, albeit he be not in worse case then he was
the time of the Inhibition, yet he is in worse case then he would be, if
the Land had not been sold: And albeit upon uncertainty men will not
Registrat Inhibitions through all the Kingdom, that infers not but they
might, and that they would be effectual to Lands thereafter acquired in
these shires, neither is there any ground to except the Renuncing of
Wodsets, which are Alienations of the Wodset Lands, but the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

Hand, it is offered to be proven that it is the Hand-writing of <hi>Dury</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who insert the Date and Witnesses, which is more Solemn then any
other writer, especially seing the writer was not present, or witness,
but only drew the draught of the Bond; and albeit he mentions not
the inserting of the Marginal addition, but only the inserting of
Date and VVitnesses that has been, because of the ordinar Stile of Bonds,
whereof the Date and VVitnesses are filled in by another Hand, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ordinar for these to write Marginal additions; and as for the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or contrariety of the Margent to the Body, that is most ordinar, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where the body is but a draught drawen by another Hand, who
has erred in his intention in the Substitution; it was answered for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer,
that albeit the Marginal addition should be proven to be Holograph,
yet unless it were proven to have been truely written, and subscribed at
the Date of the Bond. It cannot prove that it is of the same Date, or of
any Date before the Defunct was on Death-bed, and so it is null, and
cannot prejudge the Pursuer as Heir, especially seing the Defunct hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then no Sons, might probably adject this in favours of his Daughters,
contrair his former Intention, which if it should take effect, would
ruine the Heir-male.</p>
               <p>The Lords having taken the Deposition of the Witnesses insert, and
both Deponing that they did not remember whether the Marginal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was upon the Bond when it was Subscribed or no, and that
it did appear by inspection, that the Marginal addition was by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Hand then that that wrote the body, and that it was not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
at the conclusion, where the Defunct exprest, that he himself
was Filler up of the Date and Witnesses, and nothing was addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to astruct that it was of a true Date before his taking Bed. Vpon all
these considerations joyntly, the Lords found that the Marginal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was not of the Date of the Bond, and that having no Date of it
self, it was not instructed to have been done before the Defunct was
on Death-bed, and so was null as to the Heir: but the Lords did not
find that these alleadgeances severally could have derogat to the Marginal
addition, but only that all joyntly was sufficient, the matter being also
accorded amongst the Parties.</p>

that the Lybel was not relevant, because it did not subsume that the
Rebel was showen to the Defender; <hi>2ly,</hi> The Defender was required
at an unlawful time, being betwixt eleven and twelve at night; <hi>3ly,</hi>
The Defender offered the concourse of the Town Officers; <hi>4ly,</hi> The
Army being come to <hi>Glasgow</hi> that night, the Provost was taken up at
the time he was required, with the ordering of their Quarters, which
being a publick Service of greater Importance: he offering of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers

damnage, he can pretend none, because the Rebel was Bankrupt,
and insolvent long before, and he was Incarcerat within some few
dayes, where he remained a long time, during which, the Pursuer might
have Arrested him; and the Defender yet offers to put him in Prison
in as good case as he then was. The Pursuer answered that his Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
was most Relevant, because the Letters being directed to Provost
and Bailies of Burghs; and if they be required, albeit the Rebel be not
in their sight, they must go with the User thereof, to any place within
their Jurisdiction, which they must do in their own persons, and it will
not be sufficient to send their Officers, and as to the time of requiring,
any time that men do use to go about their Affairs is sufficient, and the
Defender was required between seven and eight at night, and albeit it
had been later, that the Defender might be excusable not to come out
of his own House to search, yet here he was in the same house with the
Rebel, and in the next Room to him, and heard the noise of these that
deforced the Messenger, which was done by the Towns Officers; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any pretence of Ordering of Quarters, stop the Execution of the
Kings Letters, which might have been done with so little diversion, and
the Quarters might have been Ordered by the Baillies.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Libel Relevant, but found the Defenses joyntly also
Relevant, <hi>viz.</hi> The Ordering of the Quarters of the Army, the Ordering of the

there being a Marriage of a Landed Man, and the Copy of the Contract

the Husband having taken the Right of an Infeftment, for a sum, payable

his Heirs, he took a Ratification thereof, from the Pursuer which could
have no intent, if in case of failzie of Heirs of the Marriage, the half had
not been appointed to return to her Heirs. Likeas, it is offered to be proven
by Witnesses, that the Husband acknowledged that he had the Contract in

Tenors are only Sustained, when their Probation is partly by Writ, and
partly by Witnesses, neither is any other probability sufficient: and it is

Charged thereupon thereafter the same year, which did put them in <hi>mala

               <p>THe Minister of <hi>Dalrymple</hi> having Charged the Earl of <hi>Cassils</hi> for his

the Bolls in the Ministers Decreet, conform to <hi>Linlithgow</hi> Measure, which
was the common Measure of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Act of Parliament, and is by
Act of Parliament, the measure of Ministers Stipends. It was answered,
that the Ministers Decreet of Locality, was indefinit, and mentioned no
measure, the meaning thereof was sufficiently cleared, because it was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be proven by the Earls Oath, that he payed ever since the Decreet of
Locality, being 15 years, conform to the measure of <hi>Air,</hi> and that he
knew it was the common Custom of that Countrey, to pay all Ministers
with that measure. The Suspender answered, that his use of payment, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by mistake; or benevolence of more then what he was due, could not
oblige him to the future, especially where the Minister did not found upon
his <hi>decennalis &amp; triennalis possessio;</hi> but upon a Decreet of Locality, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
though the measure be indefinit, it cannot be understood to be any

400 pounds, which is the rate of four Chalders of Victual, at 100 pounds the
Chalder, as is ordinarly Rated by the Commission in that place of the Countrey,
they found the use of payment and common Custom of the Countrey, sufficient to

granter of this Gift, Charged to Infeft the Appryzer long before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;

that the Charge being equivalent to an Infeftment as to the time, and to the

anteriority of the Infeftment, and by drawing it back to the Charge,
doth prefer the Appryzer from the time of the Charge: It was alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Donatar, that albeit a Charge against the Superiour, be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent
to an Infeftment in some cases: Yet in other things it
is not equivalent, as it is not a Right sufficient for the Appryzer to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
Tennents; and therefore the Vassal is not denuded thereby, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Superiour could have no Casuality after such a Charge, because
the Appryzer not being Infeft, his Liferent could not fall. It was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Defender, that albeit this consequence should follow, it is the
Superiours own fault, that did not receive the Appryzer. It was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>non constat,</hi> it was his fault, for he might have just reason to Suspend;

<hi>Alexander Hume</hi> is Donatar to the Foresaulture; the case of <hi>Alexander

<hi>Alexander Hume</hi> had Disponed several Husband Lands to <hi>Iohn,</hi> reserving
his own Liferent of certain Husband Lands. The Father continued to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
the Lands Reserved; and the Son of the rest. The Question is
now concerning the Lands Reserved, whereanent the Competition is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Creditors Appryzers and the Donatar. It was alleadged for the
Donatar, that he ought to be preferred; because any Right the Creditors
had, is but an Appryzing, and a Charge without Infeftment; which
Charge, albeit it be equivalent to an Infeftment, in the Competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Con-compryzers: yet it is no way equivalent, as to the King; for
after the Charge, all Casualities of the Superiority, would fall to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
and so must the Casuality of Forefaulture, fall to the King. <hi>2ly,</hi>
Though the Appryzers had been Infeft, when they Charged their Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
would have been long after the committing of the Crime; and
there was nothing before the Crime, but the naked Appryzing, which was
no real Right; so that the Forefaulture, devolving the Fee to the King,
with the burden only of such real Rights, as the Superiour had consented
to before the Cryme, which cannot extend to this Appryzing, which is
no real Right, or to the Charge and Infeftment thereon; because after the
Crime. <hi>3ly,</hi> Albeit the Infeftment of the Son, who was Forefault, was
base, holden of the Father; yet it coming in the Person of the King, or
his Donatar, can no more be a base Right, but becomes publick, so soon
as it is devolved to the King, which was at the committing of the Crime,
before the Appryzers Infeftment, or Charge. It was answered for the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
that they ought to be preferred upon their legal Diligence, for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the lawful Debt, contracted before the Crime; because they

seing the Superiority being unquestionably in their Father, they might

Right being only base, never cled with Possession, their Appryzing against

Reservation, hindering the Natural Possession of the rest; and where the
rest are actually possest by another Party, neither can the Fathers Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
be the Sons; because it is ordinarly found, that Dispositions by a
Father to his eldest Son, and Infeftments thereon, reserving the Fathers
Liferent, are not thereby cled with Possession. And albeit in Reservations
in favours of Wives, the Husbands Possession be the Wifes Possession; yet
that is a special priviledge, <hi>favore matrimonij &amp; dotis,</hi> and is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
to any other. It was answered for the Donatar, that a Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in favours of a Father, in any gratuitous, and clandestine Infeftment
granted to the Son, does not validate the same: yet the Infeftment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a Cause onerous, <hi>viz.</hi> a Marriage, which is a solemn and publick
Act, the Infeftment following thereupon, is void of all suspition of Simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
and as an Infeftment to a Stranger, reserving the Disponers Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
would be valid by the Disponers Possession: So must a Sons upon
a Contract of Marriage; otherwise great prejudice will follow, Sons being
frequently Infeft in their Fathers whole Estate, reserving their Liferent of
a part, and ordinarly, but basely Infeft, to secure the Property, being
more desirous to Enter themselves as Heirs to their Fathers, after their
death, if no posterior prejudicial deeds be done, which is more honourable
for the Family, all the Infeftments would be overthrown, being upon Debts
contracted after the Infeftment.</p>

               <p>The Lords found that the Tutor behoved to have a competent time to uplift and

               <p>The Lords found that if the Pupils Sums were in the hands of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitors,
unquestionably <hi>Solvendo,</hi> the Tutor was not obliged to lift
the same, unlesse the condition of some of the Debitors, or Caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

to the Act of Parliament 1661. <hi>Watson</hi> pursues for Warrandice upon
that distresse. The Defender alleadged absolvitor, because the distresse is
by a subsequent Law, falling after the Disposition. It was answered: first,
That absolute Warrandice does even take place in the case of a subsequent
Law, at least in so far as the Pursuer suffers detriment; because if the
Lands had continued, the Defenders had been so burdened; and therefore
is lyable <hi>in quantum lucratus est. 2ldy,</hi> This is no supervenient Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Act of Parliament 1661 Is a Reviving of the Parliament 1649.
which being Rescinded in the said Parliament 1661. By a posterior Act
thereof, concerning Manses and Gleibs, is declared to be valid, as if it had
been made in the year 1649. It was answered to the first, that nothing
can infer Eviction, or Recourse, but that which had a Cause anterior to
the Warrandice, unlesse it had been otherwise exprest: Nor is it any
ground, that if the Disponer remained Heretor, he had been lyable, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all other supervenient Burdens would Return, not only upon the
Immediat, but upon all the Disponers; but all such accidental Superve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
are upon the Purchasers hazard, as well as the Advantages are
to his benefit. To the second, the time of this Disposition, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
1649 was Rescinded, and the new Act was not Enacted; Neither
by the new Act, is it declared to be effectual from the year 1649. As to
the Horse and Kines Grasse, but only as to the Manse. It was answered,
that was but a mistake of the Draught of the Act of Parliament, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Reason wherefore it should be drawn back as to Manses, more then to
the rest; but it was the meaning of the Act of Parliament, to Revive the
former Act in all points. It was answered that the meaning of Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
may not be extended contrair to the words, neither can any thing
be supplyed that is omitted in a Statutory Act.</p>
               <p>The Lords found no Recourse upon the Distress arysing from the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
1661. and that the drawing back thereof being expresly, as to Manses,
which is adjected as a limitation, could not be extended to the Ministers Grass,
which is statute in a different way in this, then in the Act of Parliament 1649.
From this the Heretors are only to pay twenty pounds of Money: and in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Lands were only to be designed; therefore found, the Distress that being by a

               <p>The Lords found Inhibitions to reach Lands Acquired after the Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but superceeded to give answer to that Point, whether the Inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were to be extended to take away Renunciations of Wodset Lands,
which being now Debated.</p>
               <p>It was alleadged that an Inhibition could not hinder the Granter of a
Wodset to pay his Debt, and accept of a Renunciation from the Person
Inhibit, because a Renunciation is but a Discharge, and Inhibitions were
never found to take away Discharges of Heretable Bonds, nor to hinder
any Party to pay their Debt; but on the contrair, It was an universal
Custom over all the Kingdom, that Debtors should pay their Debts, and
did accept Discharges, and Renunciations, without looking into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters,
which hath been most frequent, not only in Wodsets, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Infeftments of Annualrent upon Heretable Bonds, which no man ever
doubted to pay, till he searched the Registers of Inhibitions, <hi>et communis
consuetudo pro lege habetur;</hi> It was answered, <hi>first,</hi> That the Inhibition bears,
expresly a Prohibition to grant Renunciations, but no Prohibition to grant
Discharges, and as to the Custom, it cannot be showen that persons did
pay Wodsets, and take Renunciations from these that were Inhibit, much
lesse that the Lords by their Decisions did approve the same, which Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
can only make a Custom equivalent to Law; <hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit where Wodsets
were before the Inhibition, the Debtor might accept Renunciation, because
by the Reversion, the Wodsetter is obliged to grant Renunciation upon
payment, so that the granting of the Renunciation being upon an oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Anterior to the Inhibition, could not be prejudged by the Inhibition,
as is found in all cases, but here the Wodset was contracted after the Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>3dly,</hi> The Renunciation here granted, was voluntarly accepted,
and payment was voluntarly made, because there was a Clause of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
and Requisition in the Wodset, which was not used. It was
answered that the Stile of Inhibitions is no Rule, seing it prohibits the
Selling of Goods and Geir, to which no Inhibition is extended, and there
being no Law, nor any Dicision that an Inhibition should be extended against
a Renunciation of a Wodset, the common Opinion, and common Custom
of the Nation to the contrair is sufficient; neither is there any difference
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:55692:243"/>
in the Custom, whether the Wodset be contracted after the Inhibition, or
before; and if there were, there is much more reason that Wodsets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
before, should rather be subject to the Inhibition, then Wodsets
contracted after, by which the Creditor Inhibiter is in no worse condition
when they are Renunced, then he was the time of his Inhibition, neither
was the payment here made voluntar, albeit Requisition was not used, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there being an obligement to pay the delay upon the Requisition,
being only for a few days, no prudent Man would suffer himself to be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Requisition, and it is no more voluntar, then if a Creditor should
pay before the Registration of his Bond, because he could not be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before it were Registrat, and he charged; but seing Law and Custom ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
not Debtors to inquire for Inhibitions, they may pay what way they
please, and albeit there had been a Requisition, yea, and a Consignation,
unless the Debtor after Inhibition, had been obliged to call the Inhibiter,
it could operat nothing as to the Inhibiter. It was answered that there
would be a great Detriment to Creditors, if they cannot affect Wodse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Appryzed. It was answered they might be Renunced before the Term of
payment of the Creditors Debt, so that Appryzing could not proceed, and that
a Debtors whole Estate may consist in a Wodset. It was answered that that
case could seldom occur, and that there was neither Law nor Custom intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
upon that account.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Inhibition could not operat against the Renunciation of the

fourteen Aikers of Land presently possest by himself, and declares he has no
other then what he possest before the Tack, and during the time of the
Tack, now by the space of thirty years. The Pursuer answered that his
Tack gave him only Right to fourteen Aikers, so that the Pursuer, by the
general Clause, must have all the rest: It was answered that the Defender was
not obliged now to Dispute the extent or quantity of his Aikers, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict

to the Defender, and he offered him to prove; that there were six aikers
beside the fourteen aikers, severally kend and known, and possest by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

Goods as the King allowed his own Subjects to Export out of <hi>England,</hi> and
declared that there should be no question thereupon, nor upon any Goods, not
enumerat in an Act of Council produced all which are bellicus Instruments
and Furniture, and hath nothing of Victual; and albeit Hemp be Prohibit
by that Act, and commonly counted Counterband Goods, yet the quantity

they had in Counterband Goods that Voyage. <hi>4ly,</hi> These Strangers could
not be in <hi>culpa</hi> before the Indiction of the War could come to their Ears,
but the Indiction of the War, was by the Kings <hi>manifesto</hi> of the Date the
ninteen of <hi>September,</hi> 1666. and this Ship Loosed from <hi>Lubeck</hi> the 24 of
<hi>September,</hi> within five days after, and so could not possibly know the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and they Trading, <hi>bona fide,</hi> as they were formerly accustomed,
cannot be seased as injuring the King, in assisting his Enemies, and they
did, nor could not know they were such. It was answered for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
that he had walked exactly according to his Commission, bearing

Seasure in the return, it is not only warranted by the Commission, but
upon evident Reason, because the Kings Allies have free Trade, both
with Him, and his Enemies, so that they partake not with his Enemies
against Him, by furnishing them Instruments, or Furniture of War; and
any privat Party transgressing the same, might, <hi>de rigore juris,</hi> be seased

Admiral of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Passe, or passing from any Delinquents, can only
be Operative in <hi>England;</hi> and that which is produced, is only an Extract

the Dukes knowledge, much lesse his passing frae her carrying of Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

of the War, no respect ought to be had to the alleadgeance, because
the War was begun, and flagrant long before the Lousing of the Ship, and
there is no necessity of <hi>Manifesto's</hi> to indict War, but Acts of Hostility
and publick fame of a War, are sufficient to hinder Allies of either Parties,
or Neuters to assist against their friends: and here its offered to be proven,
that six Moneths before this Ship Loused, many Commissions were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the <hi>Danes,</hi> Prizes taken, and the Kings Subjects taken by the
<hi>Danes,</hi> and declared Pryze at <hi>Bergen,</hi> upon the account of the War,
which must be presumed to be known by the Pursuer: and the City of

and other Towns of Trade: and as to the Act of Council, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

a special Indulgence in Favours of <hi>England</hi> only, and could not be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

that there Was nothing alleadged to show by Law or custom, that Victual
is Counterband Goods, unlesse it were carried in to an Enemy for Reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Besieged place, but not when it is but in common Commerce, and
if the <hi>Lubeckers</hi> be hindred to Trade in Corn, or the like, being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Growth of their Country, their Trade is altogether marred, contrary
to the Kings Interest and Intention, who has written to the Emperour

had on a <hi>Dutch</hi> Flag, that she came hot by the Channel, but about the
Back side of <hi>England,</hi> and that the Company was afraid to meet with
<hi>Scotish</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Privateers; and having met with a ship in their Course,
asked for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, calling it their own Fleet, all which were strong
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:55692:247"/>
Evidences that the ship belonged to <hi>Holland.</hi> It was answered that albeit
the Pass mentioned not the particular Goods, which it could not do, the
ship being but to be Loaden, the Certificat did abundantly supply that,
expressing the Loading, as for the presumptions they are of no force, because
the Skipper, though a <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> yet was sworn a Citizen of <hi>Riga,</hi> and
might justly be more afraid of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> then of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
they might call the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, their own Fleet, as being of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
at last they produced a Letter of the Kings, bearing that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
knew by sufficient Information, that this was a ship belonging to
<hi>Sweden;</hi> and both by it, and by a former Letter, did peremptorly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Delivery thereof, and the Goods. It was answered the Kings
Letter was impetrat upon false Information; and if His Majesty had known
the true state of the Case as it now stands in the Evidence, He would
not have so Written; nor doth His Majesties Letter, granted <hi>inaudita par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>

               <p>The Lords found that the Testimonies of the Witnesses did not
prove, that the ship and goods belonged to any of His Majesties Enemies,

               <p>THis Cause being again Debated, it was alleadged that the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlocutor
having proceeded mainly upon His Majesties Letter, there
was no ground to proceed thereupon, because it was granted <hi>inaudita par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>
and Acts of Parliament being done by His Majesty, without consent of

And as to the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty, it can never be understood further,
then as to Counterband Goods, which are the Native Commodity of the
<hi>Swedish</hi> Dominions, for albeit some of these be dispensed to the <hi>Swedes,</hi>
because most of the Growth of their Countrey is such, yet it cannot be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Pass be sufficient, except as to such ships as are within <hi>Sweden,</hi> and
where the particular Goods, upon Oath are Attested, and expressed in
the Pass, neither of which is in this Case. It was answered that they opponed
the former Interlocutor, and that a solemn Treaty, with so considerable an
Allie as the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> is not to be Retrenched, nor Limited, but
by the exceptions contained in it self, and in it there is no such exception,
but generally the Pass, as is there qualified, excludes all search or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Men or Goods, which is also the Kings meaning, which appears ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
by the foresaid Letter, which albeit it could not Derogat from a privat

                  <hi>HEnderson</hi> insisted in the Cause mentioned, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 31. 1667. which
was again fully Debated above; and it was alleadged that the Writ
in question was a Testament, or at least <hi>donatio mortis causa,</hi> or at least a
Conditional Donation, to take effect only in case the Disponer died before
he returned, so that his simple returning, without any further, purified
the Condition, and made it null.</p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the Writ, found that albeit it was not
formal, yet it had the Essentials of a Disposition, and Donation, <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viros,</hi>
and that it was not null by the Disponers return, unlesse he had
revocked it; for they found that the words being, that he Nominat, and

to certain Tenements in particular, with power to him (in case the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poner

him Dona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ar, they found were Dispositive words, and Effectual, and the
adding of Heir, and Successor, could not Evocuat the same; and found
the Condition of his not returning, was not annext to the Dispositive words,
but to the Executive Clause of Entering by the Superior, and taking
Possession, which was cleared by the Posterior Reservation, to recal it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his return.</p>
               <p>It was further offered to be proven, that the Disponer not only return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but recalled the Disposition, in so far as he had it in his own hands,
and power after his return. It was answered that it was no way relevant,
unlesse the Delivery of it <hi>hoc intuitu</hi> were proven, for he might have had it
in his hands upon many other accounts. It was answered that the very
having of the Writ, did presume that it was Delivered, unlesse the other
Party would offer them to prove that it came in his hands <hi>alio no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which the Lords found Relevant.</p>
               <p>Thereafter it was alleadged, that as the Disponers having of it, presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Revocation, so the Acquirers having of it hereafter, presumed a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from that Revocation, and a Reviving of the Right, and now
it is in the Acquirers hands; as to this point the Parties did not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
but it occurred to the Lords that the Disponers having, might
be sufficient to infer Delivery, but would not infer that the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers
having thereafter, would presume passing from the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
because the Clause reserving to the Disponer a power to
Recal, made the naked Recovery of the Writ sufficient to him, and
did annul it, but it was more dubious, what was requisit to
revive it, whether naked Having, or expresse Delivery, <hi>hoc intuitu,</hi>

a Husband, who within this Moneth, was seen at <hi>Air,</hi> and offered to prove
by his Oath, that he had Ceded the Possession, being Warned, and gave
Warrand to the Defender to Enter, and therefore, he being <hi>Dominus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi>
his Wife and Bairns had no Interest to pursue, and though they had,
his Oath was sufficient to instruct the Lawfulness of the Defenders Possession,
and that the Wifes Oath in <hi>litem</hi> could not be taken, to Esteem her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands

Husband had been two years out of the Countrey, and having gone to Sea,
was commonly repute dead, and therefore the Wife being in Natural Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
might lawfully pursue this Action, neither was it relevant that the
Husband promised to quite the Possession, which being but an obligation,

that four Terms were payed by the Earl of <hi>Marishal</hi> Sheriff, which

not relevant, because the Sheriffs did ordinarly Lift a part of all the six Terms,

it out of his own Money, or out of the other two; and so when the King
Charges for the other two, the Sheriffs Discharges will Exclude him, so

of the Judges in his favours, and offered him to prove that the Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
was payed by the Principal Debtor, within these 40. years, and his
Discharge granted thereupon, which was sufficient document, and the
Pursuer not having been negligent, nor at all bound to pursue, or seek
the Cautioners, when he got Annualrent from the Principal, the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both stands entire. The Defender answered, that the Principal
and Cautioners being bound conjunctly and severally, albeit in one Writ,
yet the Obligations of each of them was a distinct Obligation, and as the
Cautioner might be Discharged, and yet the principal Obligation stand, so
the prescription is a legall Discharge, presuming the Creditor past from the
Cautioner, seing he never owned him for 40. years, which is most favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
on the part of Cautioners, who otherwise may remain under unknown
Obligations for an hundreth years. The Pursuer answered, that albeit
there might have been some appearance of reason, if the Persons obliged
had been all Co-principals, or bound by distinct Writs, yet whether Writ
and Obligation is one, and the Cautioners Obligation thereby but acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory,
and the Creditor no way negligent, there is no ground of such a
presumption, that the Creditor past from any Party obliged, and the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations

the common Style, and meaning of Obligations, whereby one Writ obliging

which she had no Right, either Principal, or in Warrandice of other Lands,
that her Consent should prejudge her, as to her Liferent lands, of which

the Lands wherein she was never Infeft, it is null, and can never oblige
her, being a Wife.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that this Warrandice did not oblige the Wife, and

               <p>It was further alleadged, that the said <hi>Margaret Allardes</hi> agreed with

as the Consenter had the time of the Consent, it is true, that a Disponer
with absolute Warrandice, if he acquire a Right, it accresces to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
but it is not so in a Consenter, whose warrandice is not found to
be Obligator, further then as to the Rights in the Consenters Person at

of the Disponer, of the Lands in question, whose Predecessor being bound

he did Deliver certain Bonds of Provision in favours of his other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

and nine thousand Merks of Tocher payed to the Father. The Son pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
a Reduction of the Bairns Infeftment, and Bonds, in so far as might
be prejudicial to the Disposition granted to him, upon this Reason, that the
Bonds were no delivered Evidents before his Disposition. It was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they were valide, though not Delivered, because the Fathers Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody
was the Childrens Custody, especially they being in his Family, both
at the time of the Subscribing of the Bonds, and of the making of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
and it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Father to his Children, though never Delivered during his Life, but found
amongst his Writs after his Death, were valide both to affect his Heirs, and
Executors. The Pursuer answered, that his Reason of Reduction stands
yet relevant, notwithstanding the answer, because, albeit it be true, that
Bonds, Dispositions, and Provisions in favours of Children are valide
when they are Delivered by the Parents in their Life, or if they have
remained uncancelled in their Hands till their Death, yet till Delivery,
or Death, they are still pendent Ambulatory Rights, and may always be
recalled at the pleasure of the Granter, and any Deed done by him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
recalling them, or clearly inferring his mind to recall them, doth
annul them before Delivery, <hi>ita est,</hi> the Pursuers Disposition bearing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Warrandice against all Deeds done, or to be done by the Father,
granter of these Bonds, doth evidently declare his mind, that his purpose
was not, that these Bonds should affect these Lands, otherwise he would
either reserve the Bonds, or a power to burden the Lands, and if this were
Sustained, no Contract of Marriage, Disponing the Fee to a Son, could be
secure, it being easie to grant such Bonds, and to keep them up
above the Sons Head, and therewith to affect the Fee; yea, it would
be sufficient against any Stranger, unlesse it were for an Onerous Cause.
<hi>2kly,</hi> There is not only a Revocation, but these Provisions were no Debt
of the Fathers, prior to the Sons Disposition, or Delivery, for albeit the
date be prior, yet the time of their becoming a Debt, is only Death, or
Delivery, and therefore, all Debt contracted, or Deeds done by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before his Death, or Delivery of the Bonds, are prior as to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation
thereof, to the Bonds, so that the Sons Disposition is truly
prior as to its Obligations, to these Bonds. The Defender answered to
the first, that albeit such Bonds be Revocable before Delivery, yet here
there is no expresse Revocation, but only presumption inserred, from the
Fathers giving a posterior Disposition, which is no sufficient ground, either
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rom the Disposition, or the Warrandice, for the Fathers mind might have
been, that he would endeavour (out of his Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erent, or Moveables) to
Portion his Children, and so would not absolutely Burden the Fee; but
yet in case he should Die, or not be able to do it, he would not Revock
the Bonds, even as to that Right, which is much rather to be presumed,
as being much more rational, and probable, seing there is not any Provision,
or power of Provision reserved in the Contract, neither is there any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:55692:257"/>
way alleadged for providing of three Children, but if this Sole
presumption be sufficient, though a Father should Dispone his whole Estate,
without any Reservation of Children, or to be so inconsiderat, as not to
except his Aliment, all prior Provisions for his Life-rent (undelivered)
should cease, and become ineffectual, contrair to that Natural obligation
of Parents to provide their Children, against which, no presumption can be
prevalent. As to the other ground, Provisions, though not Delivered,
can be in no worse case then Bonds delivered with a Condition, that the
Father might recall the same, which would be valid from their Date, if
they were never actually recalled, and so must Bonds of Provision be, at
least as to gratuitous Deeds after their Date, though before Delivery, as if
a Father should grant Bonds of Provision to many Children at once, and
should Deliver some of them before the rest, if he had not Means suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to pay all, the Bonds first Delivered, could not be thought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust
his whole Means, and exclude the other Bonds of Provision, but
all would come in <hi>pari passu,</hi> according to their Dates, except their Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

               <p>The Lords (notwithstanding of what was alleadged) found the Reason of
Reduction relevant, and that the undelivered Bonds of Provision, though
prior in Date, yet posterior in Delivery, could not affect the Fee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veening.</p>

declared Prize, conform to the Lord Admirals Commission, ordaining Ships
of Allies to be taken, having in Enemies Goods, or Counterband Goods,
or the return of Counterband Goods. <hi>Parkman</hi> raised a Reduction of
this Decreet, on these Reasons; <hi>first,</hi> That the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
not only being an Allie to the King, but having a Solemn Treaty with him;
in the second Article whereof it is specially agreed, that the Subjects of
<hi>Sweden</hi> having Passes from the Governour of the City, or Province where
they Louse, or from the Colledge of Trade, bearing that Faith had been
made, that the Ship, men and Goods did belong to the <hi>Swede,</hi> and none
other; and that they had therein no prohibit Goods, that such a Passe being
shown in any Ship, there should be no further search, or inquiry in the
Men or Goods, the like whereof is granted to the Kings Subjects, either
King trusting the Governours of the other in that matter; by which Treaty
also, Counterband Goods are determined, amongst which, Tar or Stock-fish
are no particulars, <hi>ita est, Parkman</hi> had a Passe when he Loused from
<hi>Sweden,</hi> conform to the Treaty, likeas there is a second Passe sent over-land
to him, when he Loused from <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> which being shown
to Captain <hi>Allan</hi> at the seasure, he ought not to have taken him, or enquired
any further, nor can he now make it appear that <hi>Parkman</hi> hath transgrest the
Treaty, and as to the three Men of his Company, one was hired in <hi>Denmark,</hi>
and two in <hi>Holland</hi> upon necessity, so many being wanting of his necessary
Company by Death, or Absence there, so that what he did of necessity,
and not to advance the Interest of the Kings Enemies, can be no Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
<hi>3dly,</hi> Whatever might have been alleadged against him, if he had
been taken with Enemies Goods Aboard, or with Counterband Goods,
which are such by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty, yet he was seased, having none of
the Goods Aboard, nor the product thereof, but of his Fraught, and
upon the accompt of his Owners in <hi>Sweden</hi> he could not be Pryze, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is nothing in the Treaty, bearing that Ships should be Pryze,
not having actually in them Enemies Goods, nor Counterband Goods,
but the product, or return thereof; neither doth it appear that he sold any
Tar in <hi>France,</hi> for the Entering of the Tar, or paying Custom, will not
necessarly Import it was sold, but his Factor might have unwarrantably put
up that Article, which being wholly inconsiderable he did not contravert,
and by the same papers taken Aboard, it did appear, that at his Lousing
from <hi>France,</hi> he had the same quantity of Tar, which was inconsiderable, and
necessar for the use of his Ship, being an old Ship, and two Barrels was
found Aboard when she was taken, and some part behoved to be allowed
for the use of the Ship, so that at most there could be but one or two small
Barrals of Tar sold, which is inconsiderable, and could be no ground

to the Treaty, and according thereto came from <hi>Sweden</hi> to <hi>Denmark,</hi> in which
Passage he was not challenged, but having engadged in <hi>Denmark</hi> to serve
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:55692:258"/>
the <hi>Danes,</hi> then the Kings Enemies, he did unquestionably carry <hi>merces

is Counterband, beside the six Barrels of Tar carried from <hi>Holland</hi> to
<hi>France,</hi> and Entered, and sold there, and the Stock-fish, and albeit Tar
be not enumerat as Counterband in the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty, yet it is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the general Clause of <hi>alia instrumenta bellica,</hi> for there is no more
eminent Instrument of War, not only for shipping, but for all Engines of
War, and suppose that (by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty) Tar were not Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terband,
yet that Treaty can be only extended to the Subjects of <hi>Sweden;</hi>
Trading to and from <hi>Sweden,</hi> but not to Warrand them to carry these things
(which <hi>de jure communi,</hi> are Counterband) from any other Countrey then
their own, to the Kings Enemies, so to partake with the Kings Enemies to
his Detriment. And as to the second Passe send to <hi>Holland,</hi> it is no ways
conform to the Treaty, but is most grosse and inconsistent, bearing not
only the Ship to belong to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> but also all the Goods input, or to
be input in her to belong to them, and to be free Goods, without expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
any particular: as to the return of Enemies Goods, or Counterband
Goods, that it is a ground of seasure, being the immediat return, and the
Captains Commission granted by the Admiral, bearing so much expresly,
and the Instructions given by the Council in a former War, <hi>anno</hi> 1624.
which were sufficient Warrand for the Captain to sease, and are founded
upon evident Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Kings Allies are Neuters, having as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
his Enemies with Counterband Goods, it is a Delinquence deserving that
the Delinquent should be seased as an Enemie at any time, and yet the
Kings Commission hath mitigat it, only to be in the return of that same
Voyage, wherein the Counterband Goods were carried, for if an Allies Ship
having Counterband Aboard, were taken in her Voyage to an Enemies
Port, she might more reasonably pretend that intention was alterable, and
no Crime until actually she had Disloaded in the Enemies Port, but could
have no pretence if she were waited till immediatly after she came out
of the Port, although then the Enemies Goods, or Counterband Goods
were not Aboard.</p>
               <p>The Lords upon a part of this Debate, having formerly written

their Treaty, might carry from other Countreys, that which was <hi>de jure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni</hi>
Counterband, albeit not Counterband by their Treaty, his Majesties
answer was negative, whereupon the Lords proceeded to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tar was Counterband, <hi>de jure communi,</hi> they found it was, but did
not find the Stock-fish Counterband, except in the case of a siege, to which
point Secretary <hi>Morish</hi> Letter was produced, in relation to the Custom of
<hi>England,</hi> and having also considered the Proclmation of War, in which
there is no mention of returns, but only a Warrand to sease Ships belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Enemies, having in them Enemies Goods, or Counterband Goods,
and having also considered the Admirals Commission, which extends only
to the return of Counterband Goods, and not to the return of Enemies
Goods; and it being offered to be proven positive, that by the Custom of
<hi>England,</hi> no seasure is sustained upon returns, but only when Enemies
Goods or Counterband are actually taken Aboard; they were unclear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seasure should be sustained in any other case upon returns, and
therefore ordered an other Letter to be written to the Secretary, to know
the Kings Mind, and the Custom of <hi>England</hi> in that point before answer,
and ordained the opinion of some Merchants to be taken, whether <hi>Parkmans</hi>
Ship Fraught in <hi>Norway</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> and Disloaden there, and thence
going to

                  <hi>France</hi> with Ballast, not upon the account of the former Fraught, but the

Pursuer produces no Infeftment of this Burgh, or Tenement
therein. The Pursuer answered, that he produced his Infeftment of the
Barony of <hi>Lochow,</hi> and offered him to prove, that this is part and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:55692:259"/>
of the Barony. The Defender answered, that this Burgh cannot be
carried as part and pertinent, but requires a special Infeftment. <hi>first,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by the late Marquess of <hi>Argyls</hi> Infeftment, in <hi>anno</hi> 1610. produced,
this Burgh is exprest, and not in the Pursuers Infeftment. <hi>2dly,</hi> Because
in the Pursuers Infeftment, there is exprest particulars of far lesse moment.
<hi>3dly,</hi> Because a Burgh of Barony is of that nature, that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed
without special Infeftment. The Pursuer opponed his Infeftment of
the Barony of <hi>Lochow,</hi> which is <hi>nomen universitatis,</hi> and comprehends all
parts of the Barony, although there were none exprest, and therefore the
expressing of this particular in a former Charter, or lesse particulars in
this Charter derogat nothing, it being in the Pursuers option to expresse
none, or any he pleases; and albeit in an Infeftment of an ordinary Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without Erection in a Barony, Milns, Fortalices, Salmond Fishings, and
Burghs of Barony cannot be conveyed under the name of part and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
yet they are all carried in <hi>baronia,</hi> without being exprest.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Defence in respect of the Reply, and found that this
being a Barony, might carry a Burgh of Barony, as part and pertinent, though
not exprest, albeit it was exprest in a former Infeftment, and lesser Rights
expressed in this Infeftment.</p>
               <p>The Defender further alleadged no Processe, because the Pursuers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment
is qualified, and restricted to so much of the Estate, as was
worth, and payed yearly fifteen thousand Pounds, and the superplus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Creditors, conform to the Kings Gift, likeas the King granted
a Commission to clear the Rental, and Set out the Lands to the Pursuer, and
to the Creditors, who accordingly did Establish a Rental, wherein there
is no mention of the Lands of <hi>Innerera,</hi> and therefore they cannot belong
to the Pursuer. It was answered for the Pursuer, that he oppones his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment,
which is of the whole Estate, and whatever Reservation be in
Favours of the Creditors, it is <hi>jus tertij</hi> to the Defender. It was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Defenders Advocats concurred for a number of the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
whom they named, and alleadged that they would not suffer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
to be Removed, seing they only can have Interest to these Lands in
question. The Pursuer answered, that the Creditors Concourse or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
was not Relevant, because they have no Real Right or Infeftment, but
only a personal Provision, that this Pursuer shall dispone, and Resigne
the superplus of the Estate in their Favours, or otherwise pay them eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years purchase therefore at his option, whensoever they shall insist
<hi>Via actionis,</hi> the Earl shall declare his option, but they having no Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot hinder the Donatar to Remove, Parties having no Right,
which is the Creditors advantage, and cannot be stopped by a Few of them,
likeas the whole Barony of <hi>Lochow</hi> is Set out by the said Commission, to
the Pursuer himself, conform to their Sentence produced.</p>
               <p>The Lords did also Repel this Defence, and found that the Provision in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of the Creditors, could not stop this Removing.</p>

the provisions in his Infeftment could never affect him, nor the Estate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was nothing in the provision, that the Estate should be lyable
to the Debts contracted by the Defunct thereafter, but only that he might
Dispone, or Wodset, or Redeem for an Angel, and it cannot be subsumed,
that the Letter produced doth import any of these, but at most a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

a Wodset before the Defenders Disposition of his proper Estate, yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to be also instructed, that it was payed before that Disposition, but
his Fathers Missive after his Disposition, could never instruct that it was
payed, or payed before, and yet the Defender offered to Renunce all Right
he had to the Wodset Lands, or to suffer an Certification, and Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to consent that the Lords would declare upon the Letter, that the Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set

have accepted, providing the Defender would give a Bond of Warrandice
for his Fathers Deed, and his own, which the Defender refused.</p>
               <p>The Lords proceeded to determine the Point <hi>in jure;</hi> and as to that
Point anent the provision, in the Defenders Infeftment, some were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that any Debt contracted by the Father, would affect the Estate,
others thought not, there being no provision to contract Debt, but to
Wodset or Dispone, which was not done, and all agreed, that the Case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new, and now very frequent, required a more accurat Debate; but the
Lords found that the Defenders Father, having by his Letter acknowledged
the Wodset, and the payment thereof, to which Wodset the Defender had
no Right, that any grant of Redemption by the Father (after his Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Wine, and having brought it home, the Ship was broken at <hi>Newburgh,</hi> and
Loadning was medled with by the Defenders, whereupon they are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

was no probation of any of their Intromissions, but upon the Testimony of

was answered to the first Reason, that the whole Intrometters were justly
Decerned <hi>in solidum. first,</hi> Because this was in it self a Spuilzie; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the Defender did not insist within three years, yet he ought not to be

prescription of the priviledge of Spuilzie is only in relation to violent profits,
and the Oath <hi>in litem,</hi> and these are only lost, if pursute be not within
three years, but the Parties being all lyable <hi>in solidum</hi> is not lost, for the
Intromission remaines still a wrongous Intromission, and is not in the same
case as a Vindication, and Restitution of Goods in the Defenders hands,
without Violence or Vice, and in many cases <hi>correi,</hi> are lyable <hi>in solidum,</hi>
as Tutors, or where the Intromission is joynt, or promiscuous, for it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
reason, if there were many vitious Intrometters, that the particular
Intromission of each of them behoved to be proven, which oft times is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
as in the same case, and likewise <hi>socij</hi> are lyable <hi>in solidum,</hi> and
here was a co-partnery betwixt these Parties. It was answered for <hi>Morison,</hi>
that there was three years elapsed since the Kings Restauration before any
pursute, and though that had not been, there is nothing that can stop that
short prescription, and therefore infancy or minority hinders not the course
thereof, and in this case the Decreet in question restricts to wrongous
Intromission. As to the second, all the priviledges of Spuilzie are lost by
the prescription; and it was never found at any time, that in wrongous
Intromission, the Parties were all lyable <hi>in solidum,</hi> especially where the
thing Intrometted with was divisible, as Wines; and as to the alleadged
co-partinery there was nothing Lybelled thereon.</p>
               <p>The Lords did not consider the poynt of co-partinery, but found that in

be burdened with the Land, or if it did relate to a stock of Money, the
ordinar Annualrent of the Money behoved to be free, but this Annualrent
relates to no stock, and its first Constitution is out of the Lands mentioned
in the Contract; so that albeit there had been no Infeftment, it must
bear proportionably with the Land, and albeit the Act of Parliament be
Rescinded, yet the common ground of Law and Equity, and the Custom
thereupon remains, neither doth the provision (to make the Land worth
so much of free Rent) infer, that therefore the Annualrent must be free,

               <p>THere was a Bond granted by <hi>Stirling</hi> of <hi>Coldoch,</hi> whereby he granted
him to have received from Umquhil <hi>Iohn Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Mary Stirling</hi>
his Spouse, the Sum of 1300. Merks, and obliged him to pay to the said
Husband and his Spouse, and longest liver of them two, and the Heirs
gotten between them, or their Assigneys, which failzying to the Heirs of the
last liver: the said <hi>Mary</hi> having survived, did uplift the Sum, and now
<hi>Iohn Iustice</hi> (as Heir of the Marriage to his Father) pursues his Mother
to make forthcoming the Sum, and imploy the same to her in Liferent, and
to him in Fee. It was alleadged for the Defender Absolvitor, because by
the conception of the Bond she is Feear, and so may dispose of the Money
at her pleasure. The Pursuer answered, that the conception of the Bond
did no wayes make the Wife Feear, but the Husband, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar
Interpretation of Law in Conjunct-fees betwixt Husband and Wife;
and as to the Clause, in relation to the longest liver, their Heirs and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeys,
the Fee could not be Constitute thereby, otherwise the Fee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to be pendent and uncertain, and in effect be in no Person so long as
they live together, but after the Death of either, the Fee should then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be Constitute in the Surviver, which is inconsistent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fee behoved to be Constitute by the first words, obliging to pay
the Sum to the Husband and Wife, the longest liver of them two, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Husband was Feear and might have disposed thereupon during his Life,
but without prejudice of his Wifes Liferent; there is no doubt but this Sum
might have been Arrested for his Debt, and it could not be then pretended that

                     </gap>u,</hi> the Wife by surviving might become the Feear. It was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Wife, that albeit Conjunct-fees between Man and Wife do ordinarly
Constitute the Husband Feear, yet there are many Cases in which such
Conjunct fees the Wife may be Feear, and here the termination being
upon the Surviver, makes her the Surviver sole Feear, although both were
Conjunct Feears before, and neither of them properly a Liferenter, till by
the event it did appear who should Survive, neither can any such subtilty
of the dependence, or uncertainty of the Fee, render the intention of the
Parties ineffectual.</p>
               <p>The Lords found, that by the foresaid Clause, the Husband was Feear, and the
Heirs of the Marriage, were Heirs of Provision to him, and that failzying the
Heirs of the Marriage, the Wifes Heirs were substitute as Heirs of Tailzie, and
therefore ordained the Sum to be so imployed, and secured, that if the Pursuer being
the only Heir of the Marriage should Die before he dispose thereupon, it should return
to the Heirs and Assigneys of the Mother.</p>

also Appryzed upon his anterior Annualrent. The Pursuer answered, that
the alleadgeance ought to be repelled, because the Right of his Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
Appryzing, and Reduction has been several years in the Person of
Major <hi>Biggar,</hi> who has been all that time in Possession of the Lands, and

them after they were Reduced. It was answered, that albeit his Rights
were Reduced, there was no Removing, or Action of Mails and Duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
against him upon the prevailing Right, and therefore his Possession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to be ascribed to his prior Possession, though Reduced. <hi>2dly,</hi>
He having now divers Rights in his Person, may ascribe his Possession
to any of them he pleases against this Pursuer, from whom he derived not
his Possession, nor the Cause thereof. <hi>3dly,</hi> It was answered, that the
Pursuer might acquire this Right, <hi>ad hunc effectum</hi> to purge it, and the Inhibition,

<hi>Biggar</hi> might have acquired this Right, to evacuat and purge the same, if
that had been declared in his acquisition thereof, or otherwise legally, yet
not having done it, he must be understood to bruik only by that
Right that was standing. <hi>2dly,</hi> If he should declare that he did

in which case he would only have given them a Discharge, but here
the Magistrats Contracts with the Creditor, and acquires the Assignation, <hi>ut

if the Father were Dead, it would make the Defender lyable as Heir, and

there is no difference whether the Superior were Charged during the Life

               <p>The Lords repelled the first Defense, and found there was no grond for a

               <p>The Pursuer answered to the second Defense, that it was not relevant
to exclude him, because <hi>Richard Irving</hi> having Dyed last, vest and seised in
the Lands, and <hi>Robert Irving</hi> never having been In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sisters, who were Heirs appearand, buth to <hi>Richard</hi> their Grand-sir, and
<hi>Robert</hi> their Brother, could not possibly obtain themselves Infeft as Heirs to
their Brother, becuse the Inquest could not find that <hi>Robert</hi> Dyed last, vest
and seised as of Fee, but <hi>Richard</hi> and any Appryzing against <hi>Robert</hi> (who
was never Infeft) evanished, seing no Infeftment was obtained upon the
Appryzing, nor no Charge used against the Supperior, during <hi>Roberts</hi> Life,
so that the Appryzer ought to have Charged <hi>de novo</hi> these Pursuers to Enter
Heir to <hi>Richard,</hi> and ought to have Appryzed from them, as lawfully Chaged,
and to have obtained Infeftment upon the Appryzing in their Life, and as
the Sisters would exclude the imperfect Diligence against the Brother, so much
more may Mr. <hi>George Iohnstoun,</hi> who is their singular Successor. It was
duplyed by the Defender, that Mr. <hi>George Iohnstoun,</hi> albeit he be singular
Successor, yet he is Infeft after Sir <hi>Charles Erskin;</hi> and therefore the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
now is only betwixt the Appryzer, having Charged the Brother in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
to Enter to these Lands to his Grand-sir, and these Sisters being Infeft
as Heirs to the same Grand-sir, and albeit they could only Infeft themselves
as Heirs to the Grand-sir, the Brother never having been Infeft, to the effect,
that they might either Reduce, or Redeem the Appryzing led against their
Brother, because the Charge to Enter Heir, did state their Brother Charged,
as if he had been actually Infeft, only in relation to, and in favours of the
Appryzer, who Charged him, yet as to that Appryzer, he is in the same
condition, as if <hi>Robert</hi> had been actually Infeft, and there is no Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
him to obtain Infeftment, or to Charge the Superior during the
Life of <hi>Robert,</hi> who is specially Charged; but as in other Appryzings, so
in this, he may Charge the Superior, or obtain Infeftment when ever he
pleases. It is true, that if a singular Successor had obtained Infeftment upon
the Resignation of <hi>Richards</hi> Heirs, Entered and Infeft before the Appryzer
had obtained Infeftment, the Appryzers delay might have prejudged him,
and preferred the first compleat Right, but the Heirs themselves could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
exclude him, though their Infeftment were prior.</p>

two grounds, <hi>first,</hi> upon concourse, because both these Privateers being in
view of the first Prize, did both make up to her; <hi>Coningsby</hi> being nearest,
and that when they came to near distance, within half a Mile, <hi>Coningsby</hi> fired
the first Gun, <hi>Mastertoun</hi> the second, and <hi>Coningsby</hi> the third; at the firing
of which the Prize streekt Sail, which signified her surrender without more
resistance; and albeit <hi>Mastertoun</hi> being to the Windward, came first Aboard,
yet it was without resistance, the Prize having rendered before, by streik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sail; <hi>Coningsby</hi> being within a small distance, came presently up, and
Demanded his share, according to the proportion of the Men and Guns
of both Friggats, being the ordinar Rule of division of Prizes, betwixt
concurring Friggars. <hi>2dly,</hi> Upon the ground of consortship, or society
made up betwixt the two Captains, after taking of the first Prize, and by
the same consortship, craved the share of a second Prize, taken that same
day, it having been agreed, that both should be sharers in all Prizes that
should be taken by either, till their Victuals were spent. The Defender,
<hi>Mastertoun</hi> and his Owners, alleadged Absolvitor, from both these grounds,
for as to the concourse, it is not relevant, unlesse the Pursuer had allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that he had a real influence upon the Capture, for as to any Guns he
shot, they were without a Miles distance, and <hi>Mastertouns</hi> Friggat being
much lighter and swifter, did Oversail <hi>Coningsby,</hi> and when the Prize
streikt Sail, <hi>Coningsby</hi> was a Mile behind, and at the same distance when
she was taken, and therefore was neither concurrent in the force, nor in
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:55692:266"/>
the fear, and as to the consortship, it was answered, <hi>first,</hi> that albeit there
was a communing of consortship, yet there was no concluded agreement,
for <hi>Coningsby</hi> claimed a share according to Men and Guns, which <hi>Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>
denyed, having far fewer Men and Guns, whereby he that took the
Prize would have had the smallest share, so that it evanished. <hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit
there had been a consortship made by the Captain, yet that could not
be effectual, until it had been concluded in Writ. <hi>3dly,</hi> It could not
be effectual in prejudice of the Owners; the Captain having no power to
make any such consortship, either by his office, or special Commission. The
Pursuer answered, that his alleadgeance upon concurrence was most rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
he being nearer when the Chase began, and within a small distance
when the Pryze streiked Sail, and was taken; and it cannot be doubted
but the Prize had terror of both, to the second, Masters of Ships by their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
may in many cases impignorat, or Sell the Ship, or Outreik, and
Captains of Privateers having Commission to make Prize, have <hi>eo ipso,</hi> the
power to use the most conducible means, and so to make consortship for
that end: and albeit the first Prize was taken before the consortship, yet the
Pursuer having upon his concourse demanded a proportion, conform to his
Men and Guns, and being far stronger nor <hi>Mastertoun,</hi> and able to
master him, and his Prize both, he might in such a case transact, and make
this Co-partinary, which was useful to his Owners, making them to have
the half of the first Prize, whereof they would not have fallen above a third or
fourth Part, so that it was <hi>utiliter gestum, et transactum in re dubia,</hi> and
whereas it is alleadged to have been but a communing, the contrair is evident,
by the putting in of <hi>Coningsbies</hi> Men both in <hi>Mastertouns</hi> Ship, and in
the Prize; neither is there any necessity of Writ in such Transactions made

to Subscribe a Disposition of the Lands, with common Pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in <hi>Borthwick</hi> Moor. The Suspender answered, that he was most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to extend the Minut, but would not insert that Clause, because the
Minut could not carry, nor import the same, bearing only a Disposition of
the Lands, with Parts, Pendicles, and Pertinents thereof, which he was
content should be insert in the extended Disposition, and it was only proper
after the Infeftment was perfected, that the Charger should make use of it,
so far as it could reach, which he was content should be reserved as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.

<hi>2dly,</hi> This Moor lyes discontiguous from the Lands of <hi>Halheriot,</hi> and my

the Right <hi>de jure,</hi> could carry, and there was no Reason to make him accept of
Lands with a Plea, and <hi>de jure</hi> Pendicles, and Pertinents, do well extend to
common Pasturage, when the said Pasturage is so Possessed, and it cannot
be contraverted, but the Heretors and Possessors of <hi>Halheriot,</hi> have been in
undoubted Possession of common Pasturage in this Moor, and that the
Rent payable therefore is upon consideration of the Pasturage, without
which, it could neither give the Rent it payes, nor the Price, so that
when my Lord Dispones the Lands, with the Pertinents, and at the time
of the Disposition; this Pasturage is unquestionably Possest as a Pertinent
of the Land; the extended Charter, and Disposition ought in all Reason
to comprehend it expresly: neither is there any difference whether the
Pasturage be of a Moor contiguous, or belonging to the whole Barony, seing
it cannot be Contraverted, but it was Possest as Pertinent of this Room
the time of the Bargain; and to clear that it was so Possest, the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
produced a Wodset, granted by the Lord <hi>Borthwick</hi> to himself of the
same Room, bearing expresly Pasturage in the common Moor of <hi>Borthwick.</hi>
The Suspender answered, that the Wodset made against the Charger, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
this Clause being express in the Wodset, he had not put it in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:55692:268"/>
which as <hi>jus nobilius</hi> absorbed the Wodset, and cannot be looked upon
as a Discharge of the Reversion only, because my Lord was Superior by
the Wodset, and by the Minut he is to Resign, likeas in the minut there
is a Disposition of the Teinds, which is not in the Wodset.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Minut ought to be extended, bearing expresly
the common Pasturage in the Moor of <hi>Borthwick,</hi> in respect the same

of Property therein, but that the property did yet remain in the King,
as a part of the Barony of <hi>Selkirk,</hi> being of the Kings annexed Property,

this Commonalty, yet preserves his Right, that the Town cannot alleadge a

<pb n="528" facs="tcp:55692:270"/>
unlesse the Possession had been seven, or more years after the Evicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for before the Eviction, there could be no Pursuit upon the Infeftment

Defender from her Possession. The Pursuer answered, there was no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarator

publick, holden of the Superior, and albeit posterior to the Infeftment of
Warrandice, yet is preferable, the Infeftment of Warrandice being base,
never cled with Possession. The Pursuer answered, that Infeftments in the

in the Case of <hi>Iohn Scot:</hi> and the said <hi>Margaret Allardice</hi> has not only
been in Possession of the principal Lands since her Husbands Death, but her
Husband was in full Possession of both, which is more then sufficient.
The Pursuer answered, that in <hi>Scots</hi> Case this was singular, that in <hi>Iohn
Scots</hi> Case, both the Principal and Warrandice Lands were granted in an

he obtained him to be Declared Pryze by the Admiral, upon this

to <hi>Holland,</hi> then in Enmity with the King, and from thence carried
ballast to <hi>France,</hi> and returning with a Loadning of Salt, was taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by the Captains Commission from the Admiral, he was warranted to
to take Ships carrying Counterband Goods, or to take the saids Ships in
their immediat return, after they have carried Counterband Goods to the
Kings Enemies, which hath always been the Custom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as appears
by Commissions granted by the Admiral, <hi>Anno</hi> 1627. of the same Tenor,
and by a Decreet of the Admiral at that time, finding the Lybel relevant,
bearing that a Ship was taken in her return, having taken in Counterband
to the Enemy in that Voyage, which is founded upon evident reason,
because that while Ships are going towards the Enemy, it is but an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Delinquence against the King, and assisting his Enemies, but when
they have actually gone in, and sold the Counterband, it is <hi>delictum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missum,</hi>
and though it might infer a quarrel against the Delinquent, when
ever he could be found, yet the Law of Nations, hath for the freedom of Trade,
abridged it to the immediat return of the same Voyage, because quarrels
would be multiplied, upon pretence of any former Voyage. <hi>Parkman</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:55692:271"/>
raised Reduction of the Admirals Decreet, insists on these grounds.
<hi>First,</hi> That by the Kings proclamation Denuncing the War, it is evident
that the King gives only Command to seise upon Ships having in them
Enemies Goods, or Counterband Goods, without any mention of seising
them in their return, which would destroy the freedom of all Trade, for
upon that pretence, every Ship that were met with at Sea might be brought
up, and therefore the Kings Proclamation did justly and humanly War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
the seisure of Ships, only when the Enemies Goods, or Counterband
Goods is found Aboard, in which case, for most part, the cause of sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is sensible to the Eye, wherewith there was also produced a Testificat
from Judge <hi>Ienkins,</hi> Judge of the Admirality Court of <hi>England,</hi> by the Kings
Warrand upon the Petition of the Kings Resident of <hi>Sweden,</hi> wherein he
having advised with the Kings Advocat general, who dayly attended that
Court, declareth that none of them remembers that in this War any Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were made Pryze in their return, with the product of Enemies Goods,
and that he knew no Law nor Custom for the same. <hi>2dly,</hi> There was
produced the Treaties betwixt the King and the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
bearing that the <hi>Swedes</hi> should be made Pryze, carrying Enemies Goods,
or Counterband Goods, <hi>si deprehendantur.</hi> It was also answered to the
Reasons of Adjudication, that the Stile of a Commission, not granted by
the King immediatly, but by the Admiral, could be no ground of Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of Friends and Allies, who were not obliged to know the same,
or what was the Tenor of the Admiral of <hi>Scotlands</hi> Commissions, but were
only obliged to take notice of the Law and Custom of Nations, and of the
Kings Proclamations of War: and as to the Admirals Commission, and
Decreet thereupon, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1627. It could not evidence the Custom of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> being but a Decreet in absence, and upon a Lybel, bearing
not only the carrying of Counterband, before in that Voyage, but having
actually Aboard Enemies Goods the time of the seisure, which Lybel is
found relevant by the Admiral, but it appears not that he would have
found it relevant alone, upon the product of Counterband, much lesse
that that was proven, and in Decreets in absence, the Lords themselves
suffers Decreets to pass with far less consideration, and ofttimes of course,
so that it were strange to fortifie the Admirals Decreets that are now
quarrelled after full hearing, upon an Decreet of the Admirals in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
It was answered for Captain <hi>Allan,</hi> that the Pursuer could not
enjoy the benefit of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty, because he had transgrest the
Treaty, and served the Kings Enemies: and as to the Testificat of Judge
<hi>Ienkins,</hi> or Custom of <hi>England,</hi> this being a distinct Kingdom, is not Ruled
by the Custom of <hi>England,</hi> and Judge <hi>Ienkins</hi> Testificat was impetrat by
the Pursuer, and not upon any Commission, or proposal made by the
Lords, and the case therein mentioned is only anent the seisures in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
with the product of Enemies Goods, and says only that they do not
remember that ever the Case was decided there, but says not that the
Courts of Admirality had found, that upon any Plea or Dispute, that
Ships could not be taken, unless they had Aboard Counterband, or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Goods.</p>
               <p>The Lords having formerly in this Cause desired to know the Kings
Pleasure, whether by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty, which maketh far fewer things
Counterband, then what are such by the Law of Nations, and by which Tar
is not Counterband, the <hi>Swedes</hi> might Loaden Tar in <hi>Norway,</hi> not being their

stand as the Rule, seing there is nothing in the Treaty to alter the same,
neither doth the Tenor of the Passe (not mentioning the Sailers) infer
any thing, because the Sailers can be known of what Nation they are, by

the Witnesses, because they were corrupted and suborned, both by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and getting of good Deed, and being prompted how to swear, as their
Oath on Re-examination bears. And because their Oath is not only suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

were <hi>alibi,</hi> at a great distance from the place, where the Witnesses De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned

to the principal points referred to Probation, against which no contrair
Testimonies (either of the same, or other Witnesses) can be admitted by
the Law of all Nations, otherwise Plea's should be infinit: for if the second
Witnesses might improve the Testimonies of the first, third Witnesses might
improve their's, and so without end: and the alleadgeances that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were <hi>alibi,</hi> are most irrelevant, and is ordinarly rejected, as being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair
and incompatible Probation, for this being a Crime unlawful at all times,
and places, albeit the Witnesses should have forgotten, or mistaken the time, if
they be positive in the Act <hi>non obest,</hi> and so proving <hi>alibi</hi> at that time, which is

improve, and convel the extrinsick points of the Testimonies, <hi>ad hunc effectum,</hi>
to render the Witnesses infamous, and their Testimonie invalide as to the whole,
which is the proper and only subject of Reprobators, the famine is not now
competent, unless first at the time of the taking of the Testimonies, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
had protested for Reprobators, and had not referred his objections against
the <hi>habilitie</hi> of the Witnesses, to their own Oaths, but had only interrogat them

as to the Interrogators of partial Counsel, and as to the reason of their

when all that is now alleadged (as to their corruption, arising from the
Re-examination) did appear to the Lords, and yet the Lords adhered to the
Decreet of Divorce, and first Testimonies.</p>
               <p>The Pursuer answered, that he did not intend to Convel principally the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick

corruption, and therewith also to prove their Testimonies were false, and
impossible; neither is it essential to protest at the taking of the Testimonies,

the extrinsick points, but on the contrair, the intent of Reprobators being,

that the Receiver thereof, may put in any Mans Name he will, and he may

               <p>CAptain <hi>Anderson</hi> having taken a Ship, whereof <hi>Peter Peterson</hi> was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and obtained the same declared Prize by the Admiral, upon two
grounds; one that the Ship was sailed, a great part of the company being
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> then the Kings enemies: The other, that albeit it was pretended
that the Ship belonged to <hi>Swedes,</hi> yet by several presumptions and evidences,
it appeared, that is was but a conveyance, and that the Ship truely belonged
to <hi>Hollanders:</hi> There is now a Reduction raised of the Decreet, and the first
ground thereupon Debated and Decided. It was alleadged for the Strangers,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:55692:278"/>
that they being <hi>Swedes,</hi> their case was only to be ruled by the Treaty betwixt
the King and the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> by which it is expresly provided, that
the Subjects of <hi>Sweden</hi> having such Passes, as are exprest in the Articles,
shall not be Seased, or brought up, and particularly <hi>in bona &amp; homines nullo
modo inquir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tur, viz.</hi> Where such a Pass is found aboard, and the said Pass
being here found aboard, the Ship was unwarrantably Seased, and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
declared Prize, upon pretence of being sailed with <hi>Hollanders;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that Article takes away all question about the men, and so gives li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> to make use of any Mariners they please. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the Reason of Adjudication was most just; and this Reason
of Reduction ought to be repelled, because the Kings Proclamation, denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the War, gives express warrand to sease all such Ships as had any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Hollanders</hi> therein, which must stand as the Rule, unless the <hi>Swedes</hi>
had by their Treaty, a particular exception, derogating from that Rule,
which they have not: but on the contrary, the Treaty contains an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
provision, that they may make use of a <hi>Hollands</hi> Master, and not
unless he became a Citizen of some City of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and be sworn Burgess
thereof: but upon the former ground, there needed no such Article for
Masters, and all might thereby be <hi>Hollanders.</hi> And as to the Article of the
Treaty, concerning no further inquiry, there is subjoyned, <hi>quod si gravis
aliqua suspitio subsit;</hi> in which case, notwithstanding of the Pass, Seasure
might be made; but here there was <hi>gravis suspitio,</hi> that the Ship or Goods
belonged to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the Master, and major part of the Company
being <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the Pass mentioning a Ship of an hundred Tuns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this Ship was two hundreth Tuns. It was answered for the Strangers,
that the Kings Proclamation could be no Rule to the Subjects of any other
free Prince; but the Law of Nations, or their own Treaties, behoved to be
the Rule: and by the Law of Nations, the King could not hinder his
Allies of any Commerce, or Trade with His Enemies, which they were
accustomed, or free to do before the War, except such Acts only, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they partaked with his Enemies, by furnishing provisions of War, or
Counterband Goods; and so the King by no Proclamation, could hinder
the <hi>Swedes</hi> to hire and make use of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which rather weakned, then
strengthned his Enemies: and in this case, the making use of <hi>Hollanders</hi> was
necessar, because other Sailers could not be had, when the Ship was bought;
and that Article of the Proclamation ought to be benignly interpret, that
when any Ship carries <hi>Hollenders</hi> as Passengers, the same should be Seased,
but not when these were Servants and Mariners to other Nations. It was
answered for the Captain, that the Kings Proclamation of the War, behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a Rule to the Kings Judges, and that it was most consonant to the
Law of Nations, and it was impossible without the same, to know what Ships
did truly belong to Allies; and that in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treaty with the
King, that priviledge was specially indulged to the <hi>Flandrians,</hi> not
to be quarrelled upon the account of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> because of the Identity of
their Language, which would have been unnecessar, if by the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
all might have so done.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Reason of the Reduction, and found that ground of
the Adjudication, that the Ship was Sailed, with a great part of the Company
being <hi>Hollanders,</hi> Relevant alone, and that the same was sufficiently proven by
the Testimony of the Steirsman, and another Witness of the Company, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Assoilzied from the Reduction.</p>

Duties, and the avail of the Marriage, and they now pursue relief against

alleadged, that the Libel was no ways Relevant, to infer warrandice

be, that he as Superiour, and so long as he remained Superiour, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

otherwise it behoved to have imported, that he should never sell the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority,

being nothing more frequent in Charters, than Clauses of absolute warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;
and yet none was ever overtaken thereby, after they ceased to be

because this being an Obligement, conceived in their favours by <hi>Barscub,</hi>
not qualified as Superiour, no Deed of <hi>Barscubs,</hi> without their consent, can
take it from them, unless <hi>Barscub,</hi> when he sold the Superiority, had taken

               <p>
                  <hi>MArgaret Alexander</hi> being Infeft in an annualrent out of the Lands of

whereof she was in Possession; but this posterior Infeftment
being Reduced upon an Inhibition prior thereto; she pursues poinding of
the Ground, of the Lands of <hi>Sauchie,</hi> upon the first Infeftment. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
for <hi>Clackmannan</hi> Absolvitor, because the Pursuers Right of Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alrent
is base, never cled with Possession, and now he is Infeft in the Lands,
either publickly, or by another Infeftment cled with Possession. The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
answered, that the Infeftment in the Lands of <hi>Sauchie</hi> was sufficiently
cled with Possession, in so far as the posterior Infeftment of Annualrent in
Corroboration thereof was cled with Possession, and as payment made by the
Heretor, by himself for his Tennents, or by Assignation to Mails and Duties of
other Lands in satisfaction of the Annualrent infers Possession; so payment made
by his Tennents, by the posterior Infeftment in Corroboration, can be no
worse then an Assignation to the Mails and Duties of these Lands; which
as it payes some Terms Annualrent of the first Infeftment, so it must cloath
it sufficiently with Possession. It was answered, that here being two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Infeftments at several times, albeit for the Annualrent of the same sum,
yet the Possession of the last cannot relate to the first.</p>
               <p>The Lord Repelled the Defense in respect of the Reply, and found that Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

               <p>CAptain <hi>Allan</hi> having taken <hi>Bartholomew Parkman,</hi> and obtained him to
be declared Prize. <hi>Parkman</hi> raises Reduction, and for fortification of
the Admirals Decreet of Adjudication, these Grounds were alleadged: <hi>First,</hi>
That by the Testimonies of the Steirsman and Company, it was proven that
three of the Company were the Kings Enemies; and so conform to the Kings
Declaration of War, Ordaining all Ships to be seazed wherein there were
any number of men belonging to the Kings Enemies: this Ship was Prize,
as was lately found in the case of the Ship called, <hi>The Castle of Riga.</hi> And
albeit by a former Interloquitor, the Lords had not found three men to be a
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:55692:281"/>
number sufficient for Confiscation: Yet it was not then considered; that the
whole Company consisted but of eight; so that near the third of the Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were the Kings Enemies, and one of them the Steirsman, which is a
considerable proportion. <hi>2dly,</hi> This Ship though pretended to belong to
the <hi>Swedes,</hi> yet she had served the Kings Enemies, the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
two years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty it is provided, <hi>quod naves nullo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do

this Ship carried Counterband-goods, <hi>viz.</hi> Tar, which was not the product
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but carried from <hi>Denmark</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> and that she was taken
in her return, having in a loadning of Salt from <hi>France;</hi> so that albeit the
Ship had been empty, she might have been taken Prize in that same Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
in which she did partake with the Kings Enemies: or being taken in
the same Voyage, in which she had carried <hi>bona hostium.</hi> And lastly, it was
also instructed, that the Cargo with which she was taken, was the product
of the Counterband-goods, and so in the same case as if the Counterband-goods
had been actually in her, the product being <hi>surrogatum quod sapit natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram

opponed the Lords Interlocutor, finding three Sailers no sufficient number
for Confiscation. And in the case of <hi>The Castle of Riga,</hi> the major part, at
least the half were the Kings Enemies. To the second Ground it was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Kings Allies making use of their Ships for Fraught, was no way
a lending of them to the Kings Enemies; and as for the remnant Goods, by
the Kings Declaration of War, there is only given Warrand to sease Ships,
having in them Counterband-goods, or Enemies Goods; and the <hi>Swedish</hi>

bears expresly <hi>si deprehenduntur;</hi> so that this Ship having in her when
she was taken, no Counterband nor Enemies Goods, is free. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the Kings Declaration, although it mention some cases of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
is not full or exclusive, but the Law of Nations must take place, or
the Custom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in cases not exprest in the Kings Declaration. And
as for the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty, it cannot be pleaded, unless <hi>Parkman</hi> had a Pass
from <hi>Sweden,</hi> in all points conform to the Treaty: but their Passes were
in several things disconform, as being granted when the Ship was in <hi>Holland,</hi>
and sent over Land. And as for the Custom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to take Ships
in the return of that Voyage, in which they carried Counterband, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
Goods; it appeareth by the Captains Commission, and former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. and by a Decreet declaring a Prize, wherein the
same ground was Libelled, that she was taken in the return of that same
Voyage, in which she had carried Counterband. And the Lords having
Written to my Lord Secretary, his Letter in return, bears, <hi>That the Lords
should decide according to the Law of</hi> Scotland. It was answered for the
Stranger, that the particular Custom of <hi>Scotland</hi> can be no Rule for the
<hi>Swedes;</hi> but only the Law and Custom of Nations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and that <hi>England,</hi>
nor no other Nation hath that Custom, to make Seasure, but in <hi>delicto,</hi>
otherwise all Trade and Commerce would be destroyed, unless Seasure were
only upon what were visibly Aboard, and not upon the pretence of what
had been Aboard: and albeit a Delinquence once committed by partaking
with the Kings Enemies, might endure for a longer time: Yet the Custom
of Nations, for the utility of Trade, hath Abridged it to actual Seasure,
<hi>in delicto,</hi> and accordingly Judge <hi>Ienkins,</hi> Judge of the Admirality in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
hath Attested, that during this War, after search of the Records, and
Conference with other Judges, he knows not of any Prize declared, but
when the Counterband goods, or Enemies Goods were taken actually in
them. And for the Decreet alleadged on, albeit that Ground be in the
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:55692:282"/>
Libel; yet other Grounds are also therein, and there is no Debate as to that
particular Point; neither doth the Probation mentioned in the Decreet
clear, that that Point was proven. And as to the Tenor of the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
albeit they might excuse the Captain from Fine, or Damnages; yet
Strangers did not, nor were not obliged to know the same: but the Law
and Custom of Nations, and the Kings publick Declaration of the War, and
their Treaties.</p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the Debate, and that the several Points were
of Importance and Preparatives, they resolved to take the Grounds joyntly, and
so found the Ship Prize, as having so considerable a proportion of her Company
the Kings Enemies. Some also were of the opinion, that she having been taken in
the return was sufficient, especially not having a sufficient <hi>Swedish</hi> Pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or whether the Product, or not Product thereof were sufficient Grounds
of Seasure, seing it did not so appear by the Custom of Nations, or the Kings

of the want of allowance is not, that the Appryzing shall be null;
but that posterior Appryzings first allowed, shall be preferred: but the <hi>Act</hi>

               <p>The Defenders further alleadged Absolvitor, because the Pursuer had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
a Disposition from Sir <hi>Iames Murray,</hi> the common Debitor of a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement

in not Infefting himself upon his Disposition, which he received
before <hi>Panmuire</hi>'s Appryzing. It was answered, that he could not compel
the Superiour to receive him, and that the Baillies of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> required by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
Sess, and Feu-duties to be payed before he were Infeft, which he was
not obliged to pay, seing by the Disposition he was to be free of all Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances.
It was answered, that the Baillies of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> refuse no body, as

of the common Debitors, neither did the Pursuer ever give back the

               <p>The Lords Sustained this Defense, and found the receiving, and retaining the

whereupon he was Infeft before the Pursuers Appryzing, and hath
been by vertue thereof in peaceable Possession these 16. years, and so hath
the benefit of a possessory Judgement, and a prior more valide Right. It was
answered that this voluntar Disposition was granted after the Denunciation
of the Pursuers Appryzing; after which, the common Debitor could not
prefer any other Creditor by his voluntar Deed; and so the Denunciation
making the matter litigious, any posterior Possession is Vitious, and cannot
give the benefit of a possessory Judgement; neither is the Disposition being
after the Denunciation a valide Right; but especially it being considered,
that the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> brings in this Pursuer with the other prior Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzers,

               <p>The Lords before answer, having ordained Witnesses to be Examined, and
their Testimonies being clear and pregnant, that the late Earl did imploy the

and the Fathers Liferent of 400. Merks reserved, so that the Annualrent of
this Bond would exhaust the remainder, and they would have nothing to

               <p>The Lords having considered the Contract and Alleadgances, thought that it
was not sufficient to annul the Bond, that it was after the Contract, and before

that <hi>Parliament</hi> was Rescinded, and the Charger had a Commission to uplift
all Maintainance in <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. from the Heretors, notwithstanding of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions

               <p>THe Lord <hi>Rentoun,</hi> Justice Clerk, having pursued <hi>Lamertoun,</hi> as Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
his Father, for the Pursuers Rents and Goods intrometted with
by the Defenders Father in <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. The Defender excepted upon the <hi>Act</hi>
of Pacification in <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. and upon the <hi>Act</hi> of Indemnity in <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. and
produced his Fathers Commission, by which he medled; so that having done
by publick Authority for the time, in relation to the War, and differences of
the time, he was secured by both these <hi>Acts.</hi> The Pursuer answered, that the
<hi>Act</hi> of Pacification, and that whole Parliament was Rescinded, and the <hi>Act</hi> of
Indemnity had an express exception of all that medled with publick Monies
of Fines, Forefaultors, or Sequestrat Estates, and had applyed the same to
their own use, and had not duly counted therefore: and the Pursuer insisted
for what the Defenders Father had applyed to his own use, or had not duly
counted for. The Defender Duplyed, that his Father had duly counted for
his whole Intromission, and had made Faith to the Committee of Estates parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
that he had truly given up his Charge without omission, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
was Discharged. The Pursuer answered, that he had instructed much
more Intromission, and was content to allow the particulars in the Compt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and craved the superplus, which he had now proven by Witnesses ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
before answer: and as for the Oath, it could only be understood as an
Oath of Credulity, like that of Executors Confirming Testaments, which doth
not exclude probation of Super-intromission: and there being two Compts
produced, the Charge of the last Compt is the rest of the former Compt, and
the Oath relates only to the last Compt.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Defense upon the Act of Pacification, which they found
was only unrescinded, in so far as it is contained in the late Act of Indemnity; and
Repelled the Defense upon the Act of Indemnity, in respect of the Exception; and
found that the Father had not Counted duly for his whole Intromission; and that
his Oath extended only to the last Compt: and having considered the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Witnesses, they made a difference betwixt what umquhil <hi>Lamertoun</hi>
applyed to his own use, and what Corns and Cattel were carried away by Souldiers,
by his direction to the Army, that he might be free of the latter, and lyable for the
former.</p>

               <head>Iohnstoun of Sheins contra Isobel Arnold, Iuly 22.
1668.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IAmes Arnold</hi> having granted a Bond of Provision to his Daughter <hi>Isobel,</hi>
became afterwards Debitor to <hi>Iohnstoun</hi> of <hi>Sheins,</hi> who Appryzed <hi>Arnold's</hi>
Estate, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1638. upon a Debt of his own, and as Assigney to another
Debt. Thereafter <hi>Isobel Arnold</hi> on her Bond of Provision Appryzes the
same Lands; <hi>Sheins</hi> conies in Possession of the most part, and <hi>Isobel</hi> in a
small part, till they both acquire the benefit of a Possessory Judgement,
whereupon there are mutual Reductions; <hi>Sheins</hi> Reason was, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Appryzing was long prior to the Defenders, and that the ground of
the Defenders Appryzing, was only a Bond of Provision by a Father to his
Daughter, which could never exclude the Fathers Creditors, especially if
that Debt was contracted before the Bond of Provision was granted, and
while it remained in the Fathers Custody, and so in his power to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
at his pleasure. <hi>Isobels</hi> Reason of Reduction was, that albeit <hi>Shein's</hi>
Appryzing was prior, yet there was no Infeftment thereon in <hi>Shein's</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
bearing to be on an Assignation to the Appryzing by <hi>Shein's</hi> to <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingtoun,</hi>
but any Infeftment produced is in <hi>Collingtouns</hi> Person, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be on an Assignation to the Appryzing by <hi>Sheins</hi> to <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingtoun,</hi>
which Assignation is not produced, and so <hi>Shein's</hi> Infeftment, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Collingtoun</hi> is null, because <hi>Collingtouns</hi> Right, from Umquhile
<hi>Shein's</hi> is wanting, which is the mid-cuppling. <hi>2dly, Shein's</hi> Appryzing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on two Sums, the one whereof was to the behove of a Cautioner, who
had payed the Debt, and taken the Assignation in <hi>Shein's</hi> Name to his own
behove; which Cautioner being conjunct Cautioner with <hi>Iames Arnold,</hi>
the common Author, and having a Clause of relief, neither he, nor <hi>Shein's</hi>
intrusted by him, could justly or validly Appryze <hi>Arnold</hi> the Cautioners
Lands for the whole Sum, but behoved to deduce the other Cautioners part,
and so the Appryzing is upon invalide grounds, and thereby is null, and
albeit prior to <hi>Isobel Arnold's</hi> Appryzing, yet she has the only valide Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing.
It was answered for <hi>Shein's</hi> that the first Reason was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
to the Pursuer, for it was <hi>jus tertij</hi> to her what progresse <hi>Collingtoun</hi>
had from Umquhile <hi>Shein's,</hi> seing she Derives no Right from him. <hi>2dly,</hi>
This <hi>Collingtoun</hi> by his Right granted to this <hi>Shein's,</hi> acknowledges that <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>origine</hi>
the Infeftment, in <hi>Collingtoun</hi> his Fathers person, was to <hi>Shein's</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove, which is a sufficient Adminicle in place of the Assignation; and to
the second Reason, albeit it were instructed it could not annul the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing
<hi>in totum,</hi> but restrict it to the Sum truly Due, especially seing
that <hi>Shein's</hi> was content to declare his Appryzing Redeemable by payment
of the Sums truly Resting, within such times as the Lords would appoint;
and albeit the Lords are strict in the Formalities of Appryzings when they
are expired, and carry the whole Estate, though improportional, yet dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the legal, they allow them in so far as they are due.</p>
               <p>The Lords found <hi>Isobel Arnolds</hi> first Reason Competent, and Relevant
to her, unlesse <hi>Collingtouns</hi> Assignation were produced, or the Tenor of
it proven; and found the second Reason Relevant, to restrict the Appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Sum truly due, in respect that <hi>Shein's</hi> did of Consent declare it,
yet Redeemable for the true Sums. But they found <hi>Shein's</hi> alleadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that the ground of <hi>Isobel Arnolds</hi> Appryzing was a Bond of Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
posterior in Date or Delivery to <hi>Shein's</hi> Debt, Relevant to prefer
him as a Conjunct Creditor for his true Debt, though the Assignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should not be produced, a new one from <hi>Collingtoun</hi> being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>

nor dwelt he in the Paroch, nor consented to a second Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,

Defenders, that they denyed Stenting of the Pursuer, for any Stock or
Trade, seing he was no Inhabitant; or that they Quartered on him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably,
but alleadged there was now no ground after so long a time,

that unless the Complaint were against the inhability of the Stenters, in due

that for the Towns Debts, that such as were contracted for the common
benefit of the Town, for getting their Erection, and Harbour; and for the
second Ministers Stipend, the half of which had been payed by the whole
Heretors, since the year 1613. and the other half since the year 1649.
that their new Kirk was Erected, should burden the Pursuer proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
according to his Land Rent. The Pursuer answered, that he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Inhabitant, was not concerned in the Erection or Harbour, nor in
the second Ministers Stipend, seing he payed his whole Teind to the first
Minister.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Pursuer lyable for the half of the Stipend, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

                  <hi>DVncan Campbel</hi> pursues the Laird of <hi>Glenorchy,</hi> for Ejecting him from
certain Lands, and especially, that his Brother, by his Direction, did

Land, Laboured by himself; and perswaded, and enticed his Tennents, to
receive Tacks from, and pay the Mails and Duties to him, and therefore
craves Re-possession, and Double Mail, as the violent Profits of the whole
Lands, during the Defenders Possession. The Defender alleadged Absolvitor,
because he had obtained Improbation against the Pursuer, of all his Rights of
these Lands, and others; and likewise Decreet of Removing. The Pursuer
answered, that the Defense ought to be Repelled, because the Improbation was
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:55692:285"/>
only by a Certification, when he was Prisoner in <hi>Irland,</hi> and the Defender by
Articles of Agreement produced, had acknowledged the Pursuers Right,
and obliged himself to Infest him in the Lands in question. <hi>2dly,</hi> Though the
Pursuer had but Possession without any Right, he might not be Ejected, but by
a Precept of Ejection from a Judge, which is not alleadged. The Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
answered, that these Articles of Agreement were never perfected, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and could only import a Personal Action against the Defender, for
extention, or implement, wherein, when the Pursuer insists he will get this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that he can have no benefit of the Articles, being mutual until he
perform his part thereof, which is not done.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Defence, and Duply, and Sustained the Ejection.</p>
               <p>The Defender alleadged, further, that that Member of the Libel, craving
violent profits for that part of the Land Possest by Tennents, because by the
Defenders perswasion, they became his Tennents, is not Relevant, because
Ejection is only competent to the natural Possess or upon violence, and
perswasion is no violence. The Pursuer answered, that the prevailing with the
Tennents, was consequent to the casting out of the Defender, out of his own
House, and natural Possession, and was as great a fault as Intrusion, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
thereto. The Defender answered, that the Law has allowed violent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
profits only in Ejection or Intrusion, which can be drawn to no other Case,
though it were as great, or an greater fault.</p>
               <p>The Lords sustained the Defence, and found violent profits only compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for that part, that the Pursuer Possest naturally; but if the whole
Lands had been an united Tenement, or Labouring, that the Pursuer had
been Ejected out of the principal messuage of the Barony, and the Ejecter
had thereby gotten Possession of the whole, it is like the Lords would
have sustained Ejection for the whole, but this was not Pleaded.</p>

It was alleadged there was no necessity of a Protestation, and if it were,
there was a Protestation at the Re-examination of the Witnesses, and also
before Sentence. It was answered, that a Protestation was most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,

               <p>
                  <hi>PAtrick Park</hi> pursues a Reduction of a Bond of 1200. Merks <hi>Scots,</hi>
upon these Reasons, <hi>First,</hi> Because albeit the Bond bears borrowed
Money, and be in the Name of <hi>Nicol Sommervel;</hi> yet he offers to prove by
<hi>Nicols</hi> Oath, that when he received the Bond, it was blank in the Creditors Name,
and offers to prove by Witnesses, that the true Cause thereof was, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sommervel, Nicols</hi> Brother, having win all the Pursuers Money he
had at the Cards, he being then distempered with Drink, caused him
Subscribe a blank Bond, for filling up what Sum he should win from
him, and that this Sum was filled up in this Bond, which he offers to
prove by the Oath of <hi>Nicols</hi> Brother that wan the Money, and the
other Witnesses insert, so that the Clause of the Bond being played Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
by the Act of Parliament 1621. the Winner can have no more
but 100. Merks thereof. <hi>2dly,</hi> Before <hi>Nicols</hi> Name was filled up, or
any Diligence or Intimation thereof: there was a Decreet Arbitral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Winner and the Pursuer, wherein all Sums were Discharged<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which Discharge being by the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dent, to whom the Bond was Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
before the filling up of <hi>Nicols</hi> Name, or Intimation thereof, which
is in effect an Assignation, excludes the Assigney. It was answered for
the Defender, that he opponed the Bond, bearing borrowed Money, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his own Name; and though he should acknowledge that the
Bond was blank in the Name, and that thereby his Name being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, he is in effect and Assigney: yet the Bond being his Writ
the Bond cannot be taken away, but by Writ or Oath of Party, and not
by his Cedents Oath, or Witnesses insert, unless it were to the Cedents
behove, or without a Cause Onerous, as the Lords have found by their
Interlocutor already. <hi>3dly,</hi> Albeit it were acknowledged to be played
Money, the Act of Parliament is in Desuetude, and it is now frequent
by Persons of all quality to play, and to pay a greater Sum then 100.
Merks. <hi>4thly.</hi> The Pursuer who loseth the Money, hath no Interest by
the Act of Parliament, because thereby he is appointed to pay the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but the superplus Money, more then 100. Merks, is appointed to
belong to the poor, and the Defender shall answer the poor, whenever
they shall pursue, but it is <hi>jus tertij</hi> to the loser, who cannot detain the
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:55692:287"/>
Money thereupon; but whatever was the cause, the Defender having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Bond for a Cause Onerous, and being ignorant that it was for
any other Cause but true borrowed Money, he must be in <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon this pretence, any Bond may be suspected, and the Cedent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he is Denuded by Witnesses, may take the same away.</p>
               <p>The Lord Advocat did also appear for the Poor, and claimed the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perplus
of the Money, more then 100. Merks, and alleadged that the Act of
Parliament did induce a <hi>vitium reale.</hi> which follows the Sum to all singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Successors; and that though ordinarly the Cedents Oath, or Witnesses
be not taken against Writ, yet where there is Fraud, Force, or Fault, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
are alwayes Receiveable, <hi>ex officio</hi> at least, and ought to be in this
Case, where there is such Evidence of Fraud, that it is acknowledged the
Bond was blank in the Creditors Name, when <hi>Nicol</hi> Received it, and the
filling up was betwixt two Brethren, and the Debitor dwelling in Town,
did not ask him what was the Cause of the Bond, and that an Act of
Parliament cannot fall in desuetude, by a contrait voluntar Custom never
allowed by the Lords, but being vitious against so good and so publick a Law.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Act of Parliament to stand in vigour, and
that the Loser was lyable upon the same grounds, and therefore ordained
the Sum to be Consigned in the Clerks Hands, and before answer, to whom
the Sum should be given up, ordained <hi>Nicols</hi> Oath to be taken when his
Name was filled up, and for what Cause.</p>

very well deny the Date of a Holograph Writ, otherwise the whole
benefit of the Law (in favours of Heirs not to be prejudged by Deeds
on Death-bed) may be evacuat by Antedated Holograph Writson Death-bed.
The Pursuer answered, that he was willing to sustain the Reason founded on
Death-bed, which was only competent by Reduction, and not by excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

where the value is only liquidat in case of deterioration, or in case of failzie,
the Borrower cannot free himself by offering the price, but the Lender
may call for the thing, although it were deteriorat, but here the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidation
of the price is only in case of deterioration, and the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is unquestionably in the Lender. To the second, it was denyed
that the Borrower had here undertaken the peril, for the words of the
Contract being (hurt, skaith, and damnage) in the proper and vulgar
use, do not signifie peril or hazard, but only deterioration, and have
this equipollent positive to Restore the Guns in as good case as they
Receive them, which would never import force or accident, and for the
expressing of that Clause, nothing is more ordinar then to express Clauses,
<hi>quae natura contractus insunt,</hi> and the adjection of this Clause may have
these uses, <hi>First,</hi> It liquidats the value, in case the Borrower <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ailzie,
without putting the Lender to prove the same. <hi>2dly,</hi> Whereas a simple
Loan might only have obliged the Borrower to diligence, so that
if without his fault in making the use, for which the thing was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
it had been deteriorat and lost, the Borrower would not have
been lyable, as he that Lends Cloaths to be worn, must not demand the
deterioration by that ordinar wearing without fault, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

foreseen to be possible, but that which cannot be foreseen to have a
sufficient, at least a very probable Cause, otherwise there should be
no <hi>casus fortuitus,</hi> but this case which happened had been most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous,
for any <hi>Scots-man</hi> to have supposed, as most probable, that
before breaking of the Army, or the <hi>English</hi> coming over <hi>Forth,</hi> the

were no wayes in <hi>culpa,</hi> or <hi>mora,</hi> but did more then they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
for they were obliged to Restore but upon demand, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
demand they endeavoured to have Restored, and then they bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Cannon within the Sea Mark in the night, and though
there was a Proclamation to give up all Armes under the pain of
Death, they did not discover their Cannon, albeit upon their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
otherwise, one of their Magistrats run the hazard of
his Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as for the Proclamation alleadged, it meets not this
case, their Cannon not having been taken off Ships, and if it was publick
the Pursuer behoved equally to know it, and should have made his address
for his own Cannon, neither would the Defenders have refused their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
if it had been useful, or desired. The Pursuer opponed his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

estimatum,</hi> to Transfer the peril on the borrower; and there is no Law
adduced to restrict it, not to take place in that which is estimat, only in the
case of Deterioration, &amp; <hi>ubi lex non distinguit nec nos:</hi> and as to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Clause, <hi>in dutiis interpretatio facienda est contra proferentem qui po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit
legem sibi opertius dixisse.</hi> So this Bond being the Defenders words,
blame himself if he made not that clear. The Defender answered, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that be one Rule of Interpretation, yet there are others stronger making
for him, <hi>viz. In dubiis respondendum pro reo, in dubiis pars mitior &amp; aequior
sequenda:</hi> Now it cannot be thought, that Parties would have been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
as to have demanded Restitution, if the Kingdom were lost, and
the Cannon taken after all Diligence done to keep them: but this is the

being Examined, he could not now demand a new Term, neither could
a clear Clause in a Bond be altered by Witnesses. The Pursuer answered,
that the Clause was at best but dubious; and so the meaning was not to

the Husband is, <hi>in quantum lucratus est,</hi> by his Intromission with the VVine,
and price thereof, and any thing that has been lost through his fault, is
alike as he had been Profiter in the whole. The Defender answered, that
he declyned not to be lyable, in so far as he was Profited, <hi>viz.</hi> for the price
of the VVine Vented during the Marriage, which he was content to refer
to the Pursuers Probation, how much was Vented then, but he could not
be lyable for what was Vented before the Marriage, though after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
much less for what remained unsold after the VVifes Death;
neither was he in any fault by not offering the VVine to the Pursuer, nor
might he lawfully do the same, because the Marriage Dissolving within
year and day, the propertie of the whole VVines returned to the VVifes
Executors, and nearest of Kin; and the Husband had no interest therein,
as he would have had if the Marriage had continued year and day; neither
had the Merchant any right to the Wines, (the property whereof was in the
Wife and her Executors) but had only a personal Obligation for the price;
and therefore he could not deliver the Wine, nor medle therewith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vitious Intromission, so that he did the most exact Diligence by Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taring,
and Delivering the Keys to the Magistrates; so that there being ten
piece of Wine then in the Celler, the Defender could only be lyable for so
much of two Piece as the Pursuer should prove sold during the Marriage.
The Pursuer answered, that the Defender having once intrometted and
medled with this parcel of Wine, he is in so far <hi>lucratus,</hi> and he can no more
sever some Punsheons unspent from the rest, nor one part of a Punsheon
Vented from the remainder: so that he can offer nothing back of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,

Pursuers Wine, because the Pursuer offered to prove, that this Deceast
Wife bought other Wine from other persons at that time; and it were against
Law and Reason, to put the Merchand (who is a stranger) to prove what
was Vented during the Marriage, and how much of the Pursuers Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
after the Marriage, for that was the Defenders part to enquire, and
not the Pursuers part who is a stranger.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Defender not lyable for that part of the Wine Vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the Marriage, nor yet for what remained unspent after the Wifes
death, seing he Inventared, and abstained: but they found the Husband
obliged to prove both wat was spent before the Marriage, and what of this
Wine remained after the Marriage: If the Pursuer proved there was other
Wines in the Celler, and so found the Defender lyable fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Lords, making mention that the Father being Infeft
in an Annualrent, effeirand to the principal sum, due to him by
the Lord <hi>Balcombie,</hi> they did thereafter obtain Decreet for the
principal sum, and thereupon Appryzed the Property, wherein they stand
Infeft, holden of the King: in which Appryzing there is a Reservation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
but prejudice of the Infeftment of Annualrent, and now being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to be Infeft in the Annualrent, as Heirs to their Father, and that
themselves were Superiours by the Infeftment on the Appryzing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it not proper for them to Infeft themselves, did therefore desire the
Lords to grant VVarrand to direct Precepts forth of the Chancellary,
for the King to Infeft them.</p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the case, and argued the matter amongst
themselves, whether it were more secure and legal, that they should be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft
by the King upon their Supplication; or that they as having Right to
the Property by their Infeftment on the Appryzing, should grant Precepts
for Infefting themselves in the Annualrent, as Heirs to the Annualrenter:
or whether their Infeftment in the Superiority would consolidat the Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alrent
without Infeftment: The difficulty against the Kings Infefting of
them was, that the King Infefts none but these that holds immediatly of
Him, or upon the disobedience of the immediat Superiour, <hi>supplendo
vices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which it was answered, that the King may supply the place of the
immediat Superiour, either when he will not, or cannot Infeft his Vassal,
and the Petitioners conceive that in this case they cannot: and both being
extraordinary Remeeds, the Lords may do the same, and have done it in
former Cases. The difficulty as to Infefting themselves was, that the Right
of Property, and <hi>jus nobilius,</hi> did extinguish the Right of Annualrent; and
yet the Right of Property may be Reduced, and then they would be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitat
to Defend themselves by the Annualrent; and therefore it is not an
absolute Extinction, but <hi>in tali casu;</hi> and therefore they have reserved the
same in the Appryzing. The difficulty as to the third way was, that if the
Right of Superiority should be Reduced, they should be without Infeftment
at all.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that they might either Infeft themselves by their own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
or might get Precepts from the King, as was desired, <hi>periculo petentium,</hi>

the Defenders Father Tutor, unless the Testament whereby he was nominat

Tutor, yet by the Writs produced, it is evident that he was but one of
more Tutors; and therefore no Process against him, till they be all called.
The Pursuer answered, that the acknowledgement to have been Tutor was
sufficient against him, who Subscribed the same: and that there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to call all the rest, seing the whole Tutors were lyable <hi>in solidum,</hi>
and as ordinarly parties bound conjunctly and severally, may be conveened

Merks to her future Spouse, and in the same Contract he acknowledgeth the

with consent of the said <hi>Anna,</hi> Discharges the said Mr. <hi>Robert</hi> by a Contract
of the same Date, betwixt <hi>Iohn Scot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert,</hi> relating the Contract
of Marriage, but acknowledges there was no Sums payed for the Discharge
contained in the said Contract, but that the Security contained in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
was granted therefore; and therefore he gives a new Heretable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> the Marriage Dissolves within year and day, by the
Death of the said <hi>Anna,</hi> without Children; she in her Testament names the said
<hi>Iohn Scot</hi> her Husband, her Executor and universal Legator. <hi>George Scot</hi> as
Representing his Father, pursues <hi>Aitoun</hi> of <hi>Inchderne,</hi> as Representing his
Father, for the Sum contained in the Contract, who alleadged Absolvitor,
because the Pursuers, and his Fathers Right flowing from the Marriage, and
it Dissolving within year and day, his Right ceaseth, and farther alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that all things were now in the same condition as before the Marriage, so
that the Contract of Marriage was void, and the Discharge granted in the
first Security was void; and the first Security being Heretable, belongs
to <hi>Anna's</hi> Executors, from whom the Defender has Right by Assignation.
The Pursuer answered, that the Defense is no wayes Relevant; because
though the Marriage Dissolved within year and day, and that thereby the
Tocher and Jointure became void; yet what was Acted in Relation to Mr.
<hi>Robert Aitoun,</hi> who was a third Party, <hi>viz.</hi> the Discharge and Renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the first Security stands valid as to him: for if the Lands burdened
had been sold to any other, that burden being once Discharged and Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
could never affect them, so that whatever is in a Contract Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
Extrinsick and relating to third Parties is valid, and the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Money contained in the Contract, is at least <hi>acceptilatio,</hi> which
extinguisheth the first Security in the same way, as if real payment had been
made: in place of which payment standeth the new Security granted to
the Husband, so that now there is neither <hi>Debitum</hi> nor <hi>Creditum</hi> betwixt
<hi>Anna Aitoun</hi> and umquhil Mr. <hi>Robert Aitoun,</hi> or their Representatives:
but by the Dissolution of the Marriage, the Husband and his Heirs becomes
lyable to pay the Tocher, but not to the Wifes Heirs, but to her Executors,
for the Tocher being payed or satisfied, and the old Security taken away,
the Husbands obligement to pay, is clearly moveable, and so belongs to the
Pursuer as Executor, and universal Legator to his Wife, and not to the Wifes
Heirs, or the Defender who has Right from them. The Defender answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Tocher never having been uplifted, but remaining in the same
Debitors hands as before the Marriage, <hi>omnia redeunt in pristinum statum,</hi> and
the Discharge granted to the Debitor in Contemplation of the Marriage, is
also void; so that if the Husband had Died and the Wife Survived, if she
had pursued Mr. <hi>Robert Aitoun</hi> upon the first Security, and if he had Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Discharge contained in the Contract of Marriage, he would
have been Excluded by this Reply, that that Discharge being granted in
Contemplation of the Marriage, is now void by the Dissolution thereof
within year and day; especially seing the Debt yet remains in the Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:55692:291"/>
hand. <hi>2dly.</hi> The Defender alleadged that the Discharge, though it
were valide, was not <hi>habilis modus,</hi> to extinguish the first Security, being
a real Right. <hi>3dly,</hi> That the new Security granted to the Husband being
Heretable, and the Husbands therein ceasing, it accresceth to the Wife, as
if it had been granted to her, and so can only belong to the Defender, as
having Right from her Heirs, and not to the Pursuer, as being her Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
The Pursuer answered that the first Security was totally extinct by
Acceptilation, and by the Discharge thereof granted to the Debitor in the
Contract of Marriage; and though the Wife had Survived and pursued the
Debitor, and he had excepted upon the Discharge, her Reply upon the
Dissolution of the Marriage would not have been Sustained to annul the
Discharge; because whatever might have been done, if the Debitor could
pretend no Damnage or Interest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet where the Debitor had granted a
new Security to the Husband, which could never be taken away without
the Discharge, and Renunciation of the Husbands Heirs, the Debitor could
never be Decerned to pay the Wife, so long as the Security to the Husband
stood: which Security could never accresce to the Wife, at least could
never so accresce, as to make it an Heretable Security to the Wife, but
she could only have Right of Repetition against the Husband: And the
question being here concerning the changing of the condition of a Sum
from Heretable to Moveable, as a Requisition or Charge during the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
would have made the Sum Moveable, <hi>multo magis,</hi> an Innovation
and Acceptilation by a Discharge and new Security: And whereas it was
alleadged that the Discharge was not <hi>habilis modus.</hi> It was answered that
this Sum not being secured by an Infeftment of Annualrent or Wodset, but
only by a Provision, burdening another Infeftment of Property with the
Sum, there needed no Resignation but the Discharge and Renunciation is
sufficient.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the first Security to be wholly taken away by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
contained in the Contract of Marriage, which they found valid as
being granted to a third Party, notwithstanding of the Dissolution of the
Marriage; and therefore found it to belong to the Husband, as having
Right to the new Security, and as Executor to his Wife, and not to the
Defender as having Right from the Heirs.</p>

appointed to pay all the Debts without any exception of this or any other,
and the Testator had a plentiful Estate, it can no ways be thought that
both the Legacy and this Sum in question, was too great a Portion to his
second Son; as for the Annualrent, the Father being Tutor, and lawful
Administrator to his Son, ought to have imployed it profitably, and no
doubt did, being a most provident man. It was answered, that the Son
never having insisted for this Sum, nor having ever demanded Annualrent
during his Fathers Life. It is an evidence he acquiesced to his Fathers
Provision, and cannot seek Annualrent against his Fathers Executors, his
Father having Alimented him, neither is he lyable for that rigor that other

to <hi>Frazer</hi> of <hi>Staniwood</hi> upon Trust, he ought to have procured the
same, to have been Established in his Person, as coming in the place of
<hi>Andrew Frazer,</hi> to whose behove the Trust was, which would for ever
have Excluded <hi>Craigivars</hi> Appryzing, being long posterior to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Commission contained in the Minute; so that it was his own fault, that
he suffered another to Appryze: neither could the Inhibition have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
him, though prior to the Minut, in respect it was upon a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
upon which, no Decreet in favours of the Inhibiter, could ever
follow, the Cause being Extinct by Transaction and Decreet Arbitral; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any Process Extant, neither is the Decreet Arbitral equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to an Assignation and Precept, because it doth not Decern <hi>Andrew
Frazer</hi> to Assign the Sum due by the Defender, nor doth it declare that that
Sum shall belong to him, but only Decerns <hi>Andrew Frazer</hi> to pay out of
<hi>Keiths</hi> Sum, or any other; so that thereupon no Action could have been
effectual against <hi>Keith,</hi> to pay the Sum, but only against <hi>Frazer</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The Defender answered, that albeit no Sentence of a Judge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
upon the Dependence, the Sentence of the Arbiters being <hi>in eadem
causa,</hi> was equivalent: and whereas it is alleadged, that the Defender
had a Commission to perfect his own Security by the price left in his hand.
It was answered, that the Commission being for his own behove, and for
his own Security, he might make use of it, or not make use of it as he
pleased: especially seing the Disponer was obliged to perfect the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Security. <hi>2dly,</hi> In the Minute there was no Procuratory of Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
neither were the old Evidents Delivered to the Defender; so that
he could neither obtain <hi>Frazer</hi> to be Infeft, much less himself upon <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi>
Resignation, wanting a Procuratory. The Pursuer answered, that the
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:55692:292"/>
Commission being a Mandat accepted by the Defender, did <hi>ex natura man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dati,</hi>
bind the Accepter to do Diligence; neither is it to his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove,
but was also to the Disponers behove, that his obligements might
be fulfilled, and his price not stopped: and although the Minute want
a Procuratory of Resignation, that is no way Relevant: for if the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
had required a Procuratory of Resignation from the Disponer, or had
required the Writs to instruct the Service, being in the Disponers hand,
and had been refused of either, he had been in no fault: but without any
Diligence, to suffer another Appryzing to be led ten years after his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and now having taken Right to the Appryzing himself, he cannot
therewith Exhaust the price, especially against this singular Successor, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acquired <hi>bona fide,</hi> after a Decreet of Suspension <hi>in foro contradictorio,</hi>
when the Defender had Right to the said third Appryzing, and alleadged
nothing thereupon. The Defender answered, that he cannot be Excluded
from his Defense by the Decreet of Suspension, as being competent and
omitted the time of that Decreet, because (Competent) is only Relevant
against Decreets in ordinary Actions: but neither in Reason nor Custom
is the same Relevant against Decreets of Suspension, there being this evident
difference, that in Decreets of Suspension the Reasons must be instantly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified:
but in ordinary Actions, there are Terms assigned for proving
Defenses, and so it hath ever been practised by the Lords. The Pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
answered, albeit it was anciently the Custom to admit Competent, and
omitted only against Decreets upon ordinary Actions: Yet by an <hi>Act</hi> of
<hi>Sederunt</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. or 1649. the same was extended to Decreets of
Suspension; and albeit through neglect of the Clerks, the <hi>Act</hi> hath not
been Booked: The Session being interrupted by the War shortly thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ensuing, yet it is notorly known, and was in practice <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. when
the Decreet was obtained against this Defender, whereupon the Appryzing
proceeds, and that practice was both just and necessar; for if Decreets might
be Suspended as oft as the Suspender can produce another Writ, the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Sentences should be made Insignificant; for the ground of Excluding
things Competent, and omitted, is not only that publick Sentences upon
compearance, are as valid as Transactions, which upon no pretence can be
Rescinded, that Pleas be not perpetual: but also because they are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>dolo &amp; animo protrahendi litem,</hi> which is ever presumed, unless another
Cause be assigned, wherefore they were omitted as, <hi>noviter veniens ad noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi>
which is Sustained, even as to Decreets in ordinar Actions: and if in
no case competent and omitted be allowed in Suspensions, we shall have no
more Decreets in ordinar Actions; but the Defenders will still be absent, and
will Suspend as oft as they can find different Grounds, as if of one Sum, one
have twenty or thirty several Receipts, he will raise as many subsequent
Suspensions, which will at least serve for as many Sessions; and though it
should be alleadged <hi>quod dolo omisit,</hi> it would not be Relevant: so that
if the Suspender can purge his Fraud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either as not knowing of the Writ,
whereon he hath again Suspended, or as not then having it presently in his
power to instruct it, would be sufficient, which clears the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Decreets of Suspension, and other Decreets, to operat no further
than that in Suspensions, the Fraud is purged, by showing that the
Writ was not <hi>ad manum,</hi> which is not so in ordinar Actions, where
Terms would have been assigned to get the Writ: and albeit the
Lords might by modifying great Expences bar the multitudes of Suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they could hardly do it justly, if of the Law it were no fault;
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:55692:293"/>
and it is known, the Lords are neither in use of, nor have time for such
modifications.</p>
               <p>The Lords superceeded to give answer as to this Point, till the Compt
proceeded as to the Particulars, but the Lords had no respect to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgance
upon the Inhibition, seing no Decreet followed, nor upon the
Decreet Arbitral, which they found not Equivalent to an Assignation or
Precept: but the Lords found the Commission contained in the minute,
not to oblige the Defender, as to any Diligence; and therefore found,
that as to that Point, he might acquire the third Appryzing, which would
have excluded him, albeit he might have prevented it by Diligence.</p>

not proceed to obtain Possession by vertue thereof, but <hi>brevi manu</hi> Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Brown;</hi> whereupon <hi>Brown</hi> obtained a Decreet of Re-possession: now
the said <hi>Margaret Adinstoun</hi> having assigned the Decreet of Removing to
Mr. <hi>Robert Swintown,</hi> he Charges <hi>Iohn Brown</hi> to Remove, who Suspends
on this Reason, that he having obtained Decreet of Re-possession, after
the Decreet of Removing, upon the Husbands violence, cannot now be
Removed, without a new Warning. The Charger answered, that the
Decreet of Re-possession, bearing to be ay and while this Suspender was
legally Removed, and that in respect he had been put out Summarly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
not by the preceeding Decreet of Removing; which having now taken
effect, he being in Possession, the Charger may very well Insist, that he
may now legally Remove, by vertue of the Decreet of Removing.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled this Reason, in respect of the answer, and found
no need of a new Warning.</p>
               <p>The Suspender further alleadged that he cannot Remove, because he bruiks
by vertue of a Tack granted by <hi>Margaret Adinstoun</hi> and her second Husband.
The Charger answered: <hi>First,</hi> That the Tack being only for four years
specially, and an obligement not to Remove the Tennent while the
four hundred Merks were payed, which is not a Tack, but a
personal obligement, which cannot defend the Suspender against Mr. <hi>Robert
Swintoun,</hi> the singular Successor. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Tack is null, being Subscribed
but by one Nottar. The Suspender answered, that a Right of Liferent not
being Transmissible by Infeftment, but only by Assignation, the Assigney is
in no better case nor the Cedent, except as to the Probation by the Cedents
Oath. <hi>3dly,</hi> The Tack is Ratified judicially by the Wife, in the Court of
<hi>Northberwick,</hi> which is more nor the concourse of any Nottar. <hi>4ly,</hi> If need
beis, it's offered to be proven by the Wifes Oath, that the Subscription was
truly done by the Nottar, at her command. The Charger answered, that
the judicial Ratification cannot supply the other Nottar; because the same
Nottar, who is Nottar in the Tack, as also Nottar in the judicial Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which is but done in a Baron Court: So it is but <hi>assertio ejusdem

               <p>The Lords found the Tack valid against the Wife, Subscriber thereof,
and her assigney, ay and while the sum thereof were payed: but found the
Tack was null, as being but by one Nottar, notwithstanding of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Ratification being by the same Nottar; and found that the Cedents
Oath could not be taken in prejudice of the Assigney, to astruct the verity
of the Subscription, unless the Assignation had been gratuitous, or the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had been litigious before the same: In which case they found that there
was no place to Resile after the Subscription of the first Nottar, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and warrand of the Subscription being proven by the said <hi>Margarets</hi>
Oath.</p>
               <p>The Suspender further alleadged, that he could not Remove, because the
Liferenter being year and day at the Horn, he had a Gift of her Liferent Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat,
and thereby had right to possess her Liferent-Land. The Charger
answered <hi>non relevat,</hi> because the Gift was not declared: <hi>2dly,</hi> It could
not be declared, because it proceeded upon a Horning, against a VVife
cled with a Husband, who being <hi>sub potestate viri,</hi> cannot be Contumacious,
or Denunced Rebel thereupon. The Suspender answered, that he needed
no Declarator himself, being in possession of the only Right, to which the
Declarator could reach. <hi>3dly,</hi> The Horning, albeit against a VVife, was
valid unless it had been upon a Debt contracted during the Marriage; but
this Horning proceeding upon a Decreet against a VVife as Executrix and
vitious Intromissatrix with her Husbands Goods, a Horning upon her own
Fact or Fault was alwayes effectual.</p>
               <p>The Lords would not sustain the Gift without a Declarator, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
any Extract at the Chargers Instance, till a day, betwixt and which
he might insist in his Declarator, and superceeded till that time to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,

Relict has no share of such Sums, if they were due to the Defunct; and
therefore <hi>a pari,</hi> she cannot be burdened with such Sums, being due by the

Debt of Captain <hi>Newmans,</hi> and many other Debts, and for satisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Dispones these Lands to Mr. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Reserving the Disponers and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Liferent, containing a Reversion upon ten merks, and containing a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
that it should be leisom to <hi>Craigmiller,</hi> during his Life, and after his
Decease to Mr. <hi>Iohn</hi> to pay any of the Creditors contained in the Disposition
they pleased, without contributing the price proportionally to the rest of
the Creditors: and also produces a Renunciation by <hi>Craigmiller,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he Renunces the Reversion and the Liferents in favours of Mr. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and
also his own power of preference of the Creditors, and Mr. <hi>Iohn</hi> his Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the Disposition, whereupon he alleadged that he ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Mails and Duties, because he stands publickly Infeft, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the said Disposition, before any Infeftment in the Person of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer.
It was answered for the Pursuer, that the Infeftment produced can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Exclude him, because it is expresly granted for satisfying of the Sum,
whereupon his Infeftment proceeds. It was answered for Mr. <hi>Iohn Prestoun</hi>
that he having a power to prefer any Creditor he pleased, he payed other
Creditors to the value of the Estate, whereby <hi>Newman</hi> is excluded. It was
answered for <hi>Newman,</hi> that this Disposition was fraudulent and fimulat, in
prejudice of lawful Creditors, whereof he has Reduction upon the <hi>Act</hi> of
<hi>Parliament</hi> 1621. as being granted by a Brother to another, with a power of
preference of Creditors at the Purchasers option: which Clause is altogether
null; especially as to the preferences done, since lawful Diligence was used by
this Pursuer, by Horning, Inhibition, Arrestment, and Appryzing: and as
no Debitor can so prefer himself, so neither can he give such a power to any
other: and therefore the Pursuer ought to be preferred to all the Creditors,
conform to his Diligence. It was answered for Mr. <hi>Iohn Prestoun,</hi> that there
being no Diligences done before the Disposition by any Creditor, <hi>Craigmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
might Dispone, being for an onerous Cause, as he pleased, and might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
one Creditor to another. <hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit this power of preference were
not simply to be allowed after Diligence done by Creditors to prefer others
to them: Yet it ought to be Sustained, in so far as <hi>Craigmiller</hi> might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
have done, <hi>viz.</hi> to prefer Mr. <hi>Iohn</hi> for the Sums due to himself, and
for his relief of such Sums as he was Cautioner in. The Pursuer answered,
that such a Disposition was not made, nor doth this Disposition any way
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:55692:296"/>
relate to Mr. <hi>Iohns</hi> Sum, and his Relief, but generally and equally to all,
and there is no difference but the unwarrantable power of preference, which
can have no effect after Diligence done.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the power of preference not to be Sustained as to any
other Debts, then to such as were due to Mr. <hi>Iohn</hi> himself, and for which
he was Cautioner before the Disposition; and found as to these, that the
power of preference was lawful and valide, and was equivalent to this Clause,

               <p>
                  <hi>ALexander M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>kenzie</hi> having Right to two Compryzings of the Lands of
<hi>Auchinleck,</hi> one in <hi>Anno</hi> 1644. and another in <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. which
being alleadged to have been satisfied within the Legals, and the matter
referred to an Auditor who reported these Points to the Lords. <hi>First,</hi>
Whether the Appryzer should Compt for the Mails and Duties, so as
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:55692:296"/>
to impute the same to both Appryzings, as to years after the second Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing,
or to impute them wholly to the first Appryzing during its
Legal, and then to the second Appryzing during its Legal. It was alleadged
for the Appryzer, that he having two Titles in his Person, it was free for
him to impute his Possession to either of them, and yet he was so favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
as not to crave his option, but to impute proportionally to both,
albeit in Law, when Receipts are not specially as to one Cause, <hi>electio est
Debitoris. 2dly,</hi> When any payment is made by a Debitor to his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
indefinitly, it is still imputed to the Annualrents in the first place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can satisfy any Stock, so that any satisfaction gotten by him, must
first be imputed to the Annualrent of both the Sums, and then to the Stock
of the first. It was alleadged for <hi>Auchinleck,</hi> that the Intromission could
only be attribute to the first Appryzing. <hi>First,</hi> Because by that Right the
Appryzer entered in Possession, and cannot invert his Possession to a third
Parties prejudice. <hi>2dly,</hi> The first Appryzing <hi>est potior jure;</hi> for if the
two Appryzings were in different Persons, he that had the second, could
never attain Possession against the first. <hi>3dly, In dubio solutio est imputan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
in duriorem sortem,</hi> and therefore to the first Appryzing, for if impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
be made to both, the first Appryzing will not be satisfied within
the Legal, and the Debitors Right will be taken away, which is most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable.
<hi>4thly,</hi> The Appryzer as he did not Possess by the second Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing,
so he could not, because the first Appryzing carries the Right of
Property, and the second carries only the Right of Reversion.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Possession was only to be attribute to the first Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing,
and not to the second, while the first were satisfied.</p>
               <p>The next point was, that it was alleadged the Appryzer had sold a part of
the Lands within the Legal, and therefore the worth of these Lands ought to be
allowed in satisfaction of the Sums. It was answered, that the Appryzer could
not Dispone the Lands simply, but only his Right of Appryzing, which
would still be Redeemable from his Assigney, as well as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that he was not Comptable for the whole value
of the Lands Disponed, but for what Sums he actually Received for the
Lands Disponed, to be proven <hi>scripto vel juramento.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next point was, as to the prices of the Victual, whether the Feers,
or greatest prices were due.</p>
               <p>The Lords allowed the Debitor to prove the greatest Prices, and also
to produce the Feers, reserving to themselves the modification; Next as to the
Rental, the Appryzer desired a joynt Probation, especially it being in the
<hi>Highlands,</hi> where the Witnesses are suspect.</p>
               <p>The Lords would not grant a joynt Probation, but ordained the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<hi>First,</hi> that the Tack is null, being Set for more nor three years,
without consent of the Patron, contrair to the Act of Parliament, 1594.
The Pursuer answered, that the alleadgeance was <hi>justertij</hi> to the Defender,
and was only competent to the Pursuer, or some deriving Right from him,
for the Defender being lyable for his whole Teind, had no Interest to
quarrel the Pursuers Tack. <hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit the consent of the Patron be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar,

consent, in so far as within a few dayes after the granting of the Tack, he
accepted an Assignation thereof himself, and did obtain a Decreet of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
of the same. The Defender answered, that the Patrons consent
being a solemnity requisit in Law, behoved to be in the Tack it self, and not
being then adhibit, the Tack of it self was null <hi>ab initi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> and a subsequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
not by subscription, but by acceptance, or homologation, was not sufficient,
and the Defender had good interest to propone the nullity, not being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>super jure tertij,</hi> but simply <hi>exclusive juris agentis,</hi> as wanting the essential
solemnities, and also because the Defender has payed the Minister the accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
Teind-duty for all years bygone, and having his Discharge of the
whole Teind-duty due by him <hi>eatenus</hi> he is in the Ministers place.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Defender to have sufficient interest to alleadge
the nullity upon the Discharges, but found the Patrons acceptance of a
Right to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ack, a sufficient consent to validat the same, and that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
no consent expresly by subscription of the Tack.</p>
               <p>The Defender further alleadged Absolvitor, because this Tack never having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Possession, nor no action following thereupon, for more then 40. years it is
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:55692:297"/>
prescribed and void, and so likewise is the Decreet of prorogation, being
more then 40. years since. The Pursuer answered, that the Defender hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Right to his Teinds, had no interest to quarrel his Right. <hi>2dly,</hi>
That a Tack being but a Right to an annual Prestation, it is all one, as if a
Right had been granted to every year a part, in which case 39. years
would be entire, and the Pursuer insists for no further. The Defender
answered, that prescription being a total extinction of the Right, and not
a transmission thereof, by vertue of an other Right; It is not <hi>jus tertij</hi>
to the Defender to alleadge the same, and to exclude any from troubling
him, upon a null and prescribed Right, and he is lyable only to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
to whom he has made payment, and obtained his Discharge for by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones,
and for time coming; likeas it is better to be in the hand of an

                  </gap>n in the hand of a powerful secular Person. To
the second, that there is not here granted distinct Tacks, of several years,
but one individual Tack for many years, all which years are expired; but
it subsists only by the prorogation: and albeit it be true, that if the Tack had
been once cled with Possession, and so become a real Right, the Defender
would only have been fred of the Duties before fourty years, but the
very Tack it self being never cled with Possession, is singly expired
and void.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Defense Relevant, and competent to the Defender,
to Liberat him of all bygones payed to the Minister, but not to exclude
the Pursuer for time coming, in respect, that by the Decreet of Provision,
and prorogation of the Tack, the benefice is no more a Parsonage, but the
Minister is a Stipendiary, and is in Possession by vertue of a Modified Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
the Right of the Teinds remaining by the Tack, and prorogation forsaid
in the Tacksman, and in his Successors.</p>
               <p>But because the Pursuer alleadged Minority and Lesion, the Defender
proponed a third Defense, <hi>viz.</hi> That he had made payment <hi>bona fide</hi> to
the Minister, and had received a Discharge for his whole Teind duty, and
could be lyable for no further, for bygones, till his use of payment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by Citation, or Inhibition. The Pursuer answered, that any pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Defender made, was but an inconsiderable Duty allocat out of
his Teinds, by vertue of the samine Decreet of modification, and locality;
and albeit the Minister had Discharged his whole Teind, yet as to the
superplus, which is the Tacksmans part, the Discharge was meerly gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
and was not upon payment made, and the Pursuer was willing to
allow what he truely payed; the Defender answered, that in all Benefices
and Tacks, use of payment importing a verbal Tack, is sufficient <hi>per taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
relocationem,</hi> till it be interrupted, so that if the Minister had granted a
Tack in Writ but for one year, and the Defender had continued in

what they now pay.</p>

of <hi>Knok-hill,</hi> his Son, had a Son, and four Daughters, his Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his appearand Heir, and being Addebted a Sum to Mr. <hi>Iames Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
he Charged him to enter Heir in special to <hi>Richard</hi> his Grand-father,
and Apprized the Lands from him, whereunto Sir <hi>Charles Erskin</hi> has now
Right; the said Son being now Dead, and never Infeft, Mr. <hi>George Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoun</hi>
takes Right from the four Female Grand-children, and Serves them
Heirs to their Grand-father, but before they were Infeft, there was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment,
or Charge upon the Apprizing, at the instance of Mr. <hi>Iames Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
and in a former competition, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was preferred upon Mr.
<hi>Iames Alexanders</hi> Right, as denuding the Male Grand-child, appearand
Heir for the time, in the same manner as if he had been Infeft; now Mr.
<hi>George Iohnstoun</hi> upon the Femals Right, raises a Declarator, to hear and
see it found and declared, that Mr. <hi>Iames Alexanders</hi> Apprizing was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and extinct by Intromission, before the legal was expired. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
that the Pursuers, as Heirs Served, and entered to <hi>Richard</hi> their
Grand-father, had no interest to Redeem the Apprizing, led against <hi>Robert</hi>
their Brother, unless they were also entered Heirs to their Brother, which
<hi>Robert,</hi> if he were alive, might Redeem the Apprizing against himself, so that
the legal Reversion being in his Person, cannot belong to his Grand-fathers
Heirs, but to his own Heirs, and as he, or his Heirs could only Redeem, so
can they only declare the Apprizing to be satisfied by Intromission, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the Reversion belong to two, both to the Heirs of <hi>Robert,</hi> who
was Charged to enter Heir, and to the Heirs of the Grand-father, who
Died last Infeft. It was answered, that <hi>Robert</hi> never having in his Person
any real Right, as never being Infeft, albeit <hi>fictione juris,</hi> the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
gives the Creditors like Right upon his disobedience to enter, being
Charged, as if he had entered, yet that is a meer passive Title, and could
give no active Title to <hi>Robert,</hi> or any representing him, either to Redeem,
or to call the Apprizer to an accompt, till they were entered Heirs to the
person last Infeft; for albeit the Creditor Apprizer has a real Right, yet
the disobedient appearand Heir has none; and albeit the Lords might suffer the
disobedient appearand Heir, or his Heirs to Redeem the Apprizing, because
the Apprizer had no interest to oppose the same, being satisfied, much less
can the Apprizer now oppose the Pursuers, who being Infeft as Heirs to
<hi>Richard,</hi> have the real Right of Fee in their Person, and consequently the
Right of the Reversion of the Apprizing led against <hi>Richards</hi> appearand Heir,
which being a minor Right, is implyed, and included in the Property.</p>
               <p>Which the Lords Sustained, and found that the Heirs of the person last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft,
being Infeft, might Redeem, or declare against an Apprizer, who Appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from an appearand Heir, lawfully Charged, albeit they were not of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearand
Heir.</p>

<pb n="585" facs="tcp:55692:298"/>
Ground could not be Adjudged, but the profits behoved to belong to the
Superior, and his Donator. It was answered, that the Superior, or Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
had no Interest by the Rebellion of <hi>James Masson,</hi> because before the
Rebellion, <hi>James Masson</hi> was Denuded in favours of his Son, and he Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as Vassal, so that the Vassal for the time, not having fallen in Rebellion,
the Superior can have no Liferent Escheat. The Superior answered, that
the Creditors of <hi>Masson</hi> having been once Vassal, and as Vassal constituting
their Annualrents, they could not object upon the Right of his Son, unless
they had derived Right from his Son. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Superior is also Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and hath Reduced the Sons Right as fraudulent, in prejudice of him, a
lawful Creditor. It was answered, that the Superiors Right, as a Creditor
upon the Reduction, doth not simply annul the Sons Fee, neither doth it
at all restore the Father again, because it being but a Reduction to a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
effect, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Creditor may affect the Lands, by Apprizing upon
his Debt, anterior to the Sons Infeftment, notwithstanding of his Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Sons Fee stands, but burdened with that Apprizing, so that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
neither ground, the Superior can have the Right of a Liferent Escheat,
of him who once was his Vassal, but was Denuded before Rebellion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
which is most competent to the Pursuers, as well as if the Superior had been
Denuded, and another Superior Infeft, if he or his Donator had been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing

that he had no Interest as Superior, being Denuded.</p>

that till the samine were proven, they were not obliged to take Terms to

these, <hi>Iordanhil</hi> and <hi>Kilburny,</hi> their Issue, all which failling his own Heirs,
and Assigneys whatsomever. In which Disposition there is a Clause, that
the said <hi>Margaret,</hi> and the Heirs of Tailzie, should not alter the Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie,
nor Dispone, or burden the Lands' or contract Debts, whereby they
might be Apprized, and carried from the Heirs of Tailzie; otherwise the
Contraveeners should lose their Right <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and there should be place to
the next Heir of Tailzie: but there is a Clause subjoined, that the said
<hi>Margaret,</hi> and the Heirs of Tailzie might Sell, Dispone, and Wodset the
Lands of Easter <hi>Greinock,</hi> and <hi>Carsburn,</hi> and might burden the same with
Sums of Money, for paying, and satisfying of the Defuncts Debts. The said
<hi>Margaret Crawford</hi> having Married the Earl of <hi>Crawfords</hi> Son <hi>Patrick;</hi> they
did Sell the Lands of Easter <hi>Crawford,</hi> and <hi>Carsburn,</hi> to Sir <hi>Iohn Schaw</hi> of

the Lands of Easter <hi>Greinock,</hi> and <hi>Carsburn.</hi> The Heirs of Tailzie
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
not, but <hi>Greinock</hi> compeared, and was admitted for his Interest, which
was, that the Processe being for his security, he might propone all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenses,
which he thought competent to the Heirs of Tailzie, and allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that the Libel was no ways Relevant, bearing a power to Sell simply,
but that it ought to have been conform to the Clause in the Disposition, <hi>viz.</hi>
to Sell, Wodset, or Burden, for payment of the Defuncts Debts, which
did necessarly import, that no further could be Sold, then what was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to pay the Debt, and therefore no Processe, till the Libel were so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and the Debts produced. The Pursuer answered, that he opponed
the Clause, having two Members, one bearing with full power to Dispone
the Lands of Easter <hi>Grienock,</hi> and <hi>Carsburn,</hi> and the other bearing to affect
the same with Sums, for paying of the Defuncts Debts; which payment
of the Defuncts Debts, was but the end, motive, and consideration for which
the power was granted, but was no restriction, quality, or limitation of the
power. <hi>2dly,</hi> It did only relate to the second Member of the Clause, and
not to the first Member, which bore with full power to Sell, and Wodset,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which full power, is directly opposit to a limited power. <hi>3dly,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the Pursuer were obliged to instruct the Debt, and apply the price for
satisfying thereof, yet the Clause doth not limit him to Sell only so much as
will be equivalent to the Debt, but he satisfying the Debt, more or lesse, hath
acted conform to the Clause, which uses to be so exprest in Clauses of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that the Heirs of Tailzie may Dispone so much as will be sufficient for
payment of the Debt, which not being exprest, these restrictive Clauses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against common Law, are <hi>strictissimi juris,</hi> and not to be extended beyond
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:55692:299"/>
what the words expresly bears. <hi>4thly,</hi> Albeit the Pursuer were obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
that there were Debt, which might be a price, yet he were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to instruct that they would be equivalent to this price, but to such a
price as were not a third part within the ordinar Rate, in which latitude,
every Seller hath power, and the alienation cannot be quarrelled; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that price would be more then the Debt, yet these Lands being two
intire Tenements, which none would Buy by Parcels, the Pursuer could
only be comptable to the Heirs of Tailzie for the superplus. The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
answered, that he opponed the Clause, being one and copulative; and
that these Lands being put <hi>per expressum</hi> in the Clause, <hi>de non alienando,</hi> It
could not be thought that the immediat following Clause, would give the
Lady as much power, as to these Lands, as if they had not been in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Clause, but the intent to satisfie the Defuncts Debt, being the last words
in the Clause, is relative to the whole Clause, and natively resolves into
an Restriction, or Quality, not bearing that they night be the more able to
pay the Debts, but for payment and satisfaction of the Debts.</p>
               <p>The Lords considering that Heirs of Tailzie were absent, and that as to
them, the Interlocutor would be in absence, found it most just, and safe for
both Parties to declare conform to the Clause, that the Alienation was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide
for satisfying the Defuncts Debts, and found not that the Debts behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be equivalent to this price.</p>

               <head>The Creditors of John Pollock contra James Pollock his Son, January 21. 1669.</head>
               <p>THe Creditors of <hi>John Pollock</hi> having Adjudged his Tenement for their
Debt, and <hi>James Pollock</hi> having gotten a Bond of 5000. Merks from
his Father, payable after his Fathers death, which was granted after he was
Married, he did also Apprize thereupon within year and day of the Adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The Adjudgers raise a Reduction of this Bond, and the Apprizing
following thereupon, upon these Reasons; <hi>First,</hi> Because the Bond was
granted for Love and Favour, and albeit it bear borrowed Money, yet the
said <hi>Iames</hi> has acknowledged by his Oath, that it was for Love and Favour,
and so being granted betwixt most conjunct Persons, after the contracting
of their Debts, it is null by the Act of Parliament, 1621. The Defender
alleadged that the Reason was not Relevant as to such Debts as were not
constitute by Writ, anterior to the Defenders Bond; and as to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
by Probation of Witnesses, for proving Bargains, Merchant Compts, and
Furnishing, wherein the Probation, and Decreet are both after the Bond,
they cannot be said to be anterior Debts, because they are not constitute till
Sentence; and albeit the Sentence bear the Debt to have been contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before this Bond, yet that cannot make them anterior Debts, because
Writ cannot be taken away by Witnesses, proving an anterior Debt, which
would be as effectual against the Writ, as if the payment thereof had been
proven by Witnesses, and the time of Bargaining, or Furnishing, being a
point in the Memory, and not falling under the Sense, no body would be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
who had Writ, but that Bargains, and Furniture might be proven ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
thereto. The Pursuer answered, that his Reason was most Relevant, and
the constitution of the Debt is not by the Decreet, or Probation, but by
the Bargain, and Receipt of the Goods, or Furniture, after which no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
Deed of the Debitor, can prejudge the Creditors Furnishers; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
in many cases Witnesses prove not, and Witnesses are not admitted to
prove, where Writ may, and uses to be interposed, yet where the Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is competent, the Debt is as well proven thereby, for the time of contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:55692:300"/>
as it is by Writ, neither doth that ground, that Writ cannot be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by Witnesses, any way hinder, for the meaning hereof, is only that the
Payment, or Discharge of that Writ, must be proven by Writ, and it were
a far greater inconvenience, if after Bargain, and Furniture, any Writ
granted by the Debitor, though without an Onerous Cause, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
these Creditors.</p>
               <p>The Lords Sustained the Reason, and Repelled the Defense, and found
Debts constitute by Witnesses to be effectual, from the time of contracting,
and not from the time of Probation, or Sentence, to take away any posterior
Deed of the Debitor, done without a Cause Onerous.</p>
               <p>The Pursuer insisted in a second Reason of Reduction, that albeit these
Debts were posterior to this Bond, yet the samine ought to be Reduced,
as being a fraudulent conveyance betwixt the Father and the Son, kept up,
and latent in some of their Hands, without any thing following thereupon,
to make it known and publick, so that the Creditors having <hi>bona fide</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
with the Father, having a visible Estate, were deceived and defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this latent Bond, if it were preferred to them. <hi>2dly,</hi> This Bond
bears only to be payable after the Fathers Death, and so is but <hi>donatio mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
causa,</hi> and but a Legacy; or if it be <hi>inter vivos,</hi> it is much more frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent
and latent. <hi>3dly,</hi> Bonds of Provision, for Love and Favour grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to children, are accompted but as their <hi>legitime,</hi> still Revockable by the
Father, and all Debts contracted by him are preferable to them. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
answered, that there was neither Law, Reason, nor Custom to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuat,
or exclude Bonds of Provision, granted by Parents <hi>ex pietate paterna,</hi>
to their Children, upon accompt of their Fathers posterior Debt, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if the Bonds were Delivered, for there is no ground for any such thing by
the Act of Parliament, 1621. which relates only to Deeds done after the
Debt contracted, neither is there any sufficient ground of fraud, that the
Bonds were not made publick or known, there being no obligement upon
Parties to publish the same, and Creditors have less means to know the
Debts of other anterior Creditors, then of Children, having a just ground
to suspect that they may be provided, and to enquire after the same, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth the delay of the Term of payment import, either fraud, or that
the Bonds were <hi>donationes mortis causa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords would not Sustatin the Reasons of Reduction upon the Act
of Parliament, 1621. or upon the general ground, that posterior Debts were
preferable to all Bonds of Provision, but ordained the Pursuer to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
upon the particular ground of fraud in the Case in question.</p>

1669.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Iames Drummond</hi> being Donator to the Escheat of the Laird of
<hi>Glenegies,</hi> pursues Exhibition and Delivery of a Bond granted by
<hi>George Mushet</hi> to <hi>Iames Henderson,</hi> containing 2000. merks prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
and by him Assigned to umquhil <hi>Glenegies,</hi> and thereby
falling under his Escheat, and the Bond being produced by <hi>Ardoch,</hi> the
Donator craves the same to be Delivered to <hi>Ardoch.</hi> It was answered by
<hi>Ardoch,</hi> that the Bond ought not to be Delivered to the Donator, because
it cannot belong to him, in respect that <hi>Mushet,</hi> who by the Assignation
became Debitor to <hi>Glenegies,</hi> had two Bonds granted by him to <hi>Glenegies,</hi>
containing 3000. merks, wherein <hi>Ardoch</hi> is Cautioner, whereby this Bond
of 2000. merks, due to <hi>Glenegies,</hi> was compensed long before <hi>Glenegies</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
It was answered for the Pursuer. that Compensation is not Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
unless it had been actuallie proponed in Judgement, or Extrajudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
stated, by the Parties offering and accepting the Compensation. <hi>2dly,</hi>
That the alleadgance is no wayes Relevant against the Donator, who has
Right to the Debts due by the Rebel. <hi>3dly, Ardoch</hi> had no Interest to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
the Compensation, which could only be proponed by <hi>Mushet</hi> the
Creditor, and not by <hi>Ardoch</hi> who is Cautioner to him. The Defender an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that Compensation is Competent <hi>ipso jure,</hi> from the time that the
sums be mutuallie due by the Debitor and Creditor, in the same way as if
they had granted mutual Discharges each to other; and therefore when an
Assigney Pursueth or Chargeth, Compensation is always Sustained against
him upon Debts due by the Cedent before the Assignation, albeit the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
was not actually stated before the same; neither is the Donator
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:55692:301"/>
here in better case then an Assigney, so that when he pursues <hi>Mushet</hi> Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to the Rebel, <hi>Mushet</hi> may alleadge Compensation upon the like Debt
due to him by the Rebel before the Rebellion, and the Defender hath good
Interest to propone the Compensation, because he is Cautioner to <hi>Glenegies</hi>
for <hi>Mushet,</hi> and if <hi>Mushet</hi> be forced to pay the Donator, without allowing
Compensation, <hi>Ardoch</hi> will be necessitat to pay <hi>Mushet,</hi> to whom he is Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
and therefore hath good Interest to propone that by the concourse of
the two Debts, they are both extinct, and he is not obliged to Deliver up
to the Donator the Bond Constituting <hi>Mushets</hi> Debt.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Alleadgance proponed for <hi>Ardoch</hi> Relevant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent,

Lands he is singular Successor to Sir <hi>Robert Farquhar,</hi> of another part, he
has a Disposition from his Father, for Sums of Money particularly exprest
in the Disposition. It was answered to the first, That the Exemption is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in favours of singular Successors, who had bought Lands the time of the
<hi>Act, ita est,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Farquhars</hi> Disposition is after the Act: neither
doth it appear that a competent price was payed therefore, and as for his
Fathers Disposition, though prior to the Act, yet the Narrative thereof, betwixt
Father and Son, will not instruct the Debts, unless it be otherways instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor can it be made appear to be a just price.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Exemption could not extend to singular Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors,
acquiring after the Act, for if at that time the Lands were in the hands
of him who was Heretor in <hi>Anno</hi> 1640, or his Heirs, nothing <hi>ex post facto</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>ALexander Chisholme</hi> having apprized certain Lands from the Heirs of Sir
<hi>Alexander Frazer</hi> of <hi>Brae,</hi> and thereupon insisting for Mails and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Compearance is made for the Lady <hi>Brae,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames</hi> his Relict, who
being provided by her Contract of Marriage to certain Lands, with an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligement
that they should be worth 2400. merks yearly, here Husband did
thereafter, during the Marriage, grant her a Tack of the whole remanent
Lands he had then, with a general Assignation and Disposition <hi>omnium bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi>
the Tack bears to be for <hi>Love and Favour,</hi> and that the Lady may
be in the better capacity to aliment his Children, and bears 20. pound of
Tack Duty, in case there be Children, and a Duty equivalent to the Rent
of the Land if there be none, the entry to the Tack is at the next Term
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:55692:302"/>
after the granting thereof, and not at the Husbands Death. Upon this it
was alleadged for the Lady, that she ought to be preferred to the Mails
and Duties of the Lands in question, by her Tack cled with Possession by
her Husbands Possession before contracting of thir Creditors Debt, which
must be understood her Possession <hi>stante matrimonio,</hi> and by her own Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
after her Husbands Death, before <hi>Chisholms</hi> Apprizing or Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It was alleadged for <hi>Chisholme,</hi> that the alleadgance founded upon
the Tack, ought to be Repelled. <hi>First,</hi> Because it is a Donation betwixt
Man and Wife, null of it self, <hi>nisi morte confirmetur,</hi> and so is still ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory,
and in the Husbands power, during his Life, and is in the same
case as Bonds of Provision granted to Children, and keeped by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which being still in his power, any Debt Contracted after would be
preferable thereto: So here this Tack being in the Husbands power, the
Contracting of a Debt thereafter is preferable thereto, and is an Implicit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
thereof. <hi>2dly.</hi> This Tack being a most fraudulent, latent and
clandestine Deed betwixt Man and Wife, whereupon nothing followed in
her Husbands Life, the Creditors having no way to know any such thing,
and having Contracted <hi>bona fide,</hi> are Insnared and Defrauded thereby; and
the Lords having Declared, that in regard they had Reponed the Lady a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a former Decreet: She should now Dispute her Right of the Tack,
as in a Reduction, against which, this would be an unquestionable Reason,
that it is a latent, fraudulent Contrivance, containing a Disposition <hi>omnium
bonorum.</hi> It was answered for the Lady to the <hi>first,</hi> That Donations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Man and Wife, are not by Our Law and Custom null, but are valid,
<hi>a principio,</hi> unless they be actually Revocked: and albeit Implicit Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
has been Sustained by Dispositions, or Infeftments of the same Lands
to others, yet never by a Personal Bond or Contracting of a Debt, poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior.
To the second, The Ladies Right can never be Interpret <hi>in fraudem
creditorum,</hi> there being no Creditors the time of the granting thereof, and
the Husband being free, and Incapacitat by no Law, an Infeftment of the
remainder of his Estate to her, so Cautioned as this is, is both legal and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable:
and albeit in the same, there be a Disposition <hi>omnium bonorum,</hi>
which cannot reach to Goods acquired after the Debts, yet the Tack is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
<hi>&amp; utile per inutile non vitiatur. 3dly,</hi> Albeit this Tack bear to be a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and for Love and Favour; yet it is neither Fraudulent nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vockable,
because it is <hi>donatio remuneratoria,</hi> granted by the Husband, who
was obliged to make up the Joynture Lands, contained in the Contract of
Marriage, to 2400. merks, of which they came short of four at the beginning,
and other four have been Evicted. It was answered for <hi>Chisholme</hi> the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
that this alleadgance was no ways Competent against him, who is a
Creditor, contracting <hi>bona fide;</hi> but the Lady ought to pursue her Son,
as Representing his Father, for fulfilling her Contract, or at least till that
be declared against the Heir, who is the only competent Party, the Creditor
must Possess conform to his Right. <hi>2dly,</hi> Whatever was the Husbands Oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Husband hath not granted this Tack in Remuneration or Satisfaction
thereof, but expresly for Love and Favour, without mention of any other Cause.
It was answered, that the expressing of Love and Favour, which may relate
to the general Disposition, cannot exclude other Causes; and albeit it make
the Tack a Donation, yet it is well consistent to be a Remuneratory Donation,
which is not Revockable.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Alleadgance Relevant, that this was a Remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Donation, and that there was also much wanting of the Contract of
Marriage, and found it competent against this Apprizer, and superceeded

to give answer to the other Points, that if it were not proven Remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
whether it could be Reduced as latent and fraudulent, at the Instance
of posterior Creditors, or as being in the Husbands power, was indirectly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocked,
by Contracting of the posterior Debt, having no more Estate to

that Annual of Annual was a most Usurary Paction, rejected by all Law,

otherwise by the like Paction, the Annual of that Annual might bear An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual,

ever been allowed, and though that be done after the Annualrent is become

               <p>
                  <hi>John Bosewel</hi> being appointed Commissar of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> by the King, and
before the Restitution of Bishops, after their Restitution, the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
named <hi>Lindsay</hi> of <hi>Wormistoun</hi> Commissar, and agreed him and <hi>Iohn Bose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
on these Terms, that <hi>Iohn</hi> should have the half of the profit of the place,
whereupon <hi>Wormistoun</hi> grants a Bond to <hi>Iohn Bosewel,</hi> to Compt and Reckon
for the Profits of the half, and to pay the same to <hi>Iohn Bosewel</hi> termly, and
quarterly, and if any question should arise betwixt them in the Accompt,
that he should submit himself to the Arch-bishops determination, and acquiesce
therein. <hi>Iohn Bosewel</hi> Charges upon his Bond. <hi>Wormistoun</hi> Suspends. It
was alleadged for <hi>Wormistoun,</hi> that his Bond did contain a Submission to the
Arch-bishop, who is thereby the only Judge Constitute in these Accompts.
It was answered, that this Bond was only Subscribed by <hi>Wormistoun</hi> himself,
and a Submission must be Subscribed by both Parties, and that it behoved
to be understood to last but for a year, and not to import a Liferent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
neither could it be exclusive of the Lords to decline their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Suspender answered, that this Submission being a provision in the
Bond Charged on: Which Bond being accepted by the Charger, his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
makes his consent to the Submission, in the same way as if he had
Subscribed the same: And there is no Law to exclude a Submission for
two years, or a Lifetime, more then for one; and it is not a declining of
the Lords Jurisdiction, it being most ordinarly sustained, no Process, because
there is a Submission standing.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that there is here a Submission, not ending by a year,
and accepted by the Charger, and that thereby the Arch-bishop in the first
place, ought to give his Sentence, which if he refused, or if it was ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quous,
the Lords would cognosce thereupon, as in the case of other Arbiters,
and Assigned therefore to the Arch-bishop, the first of <hi>Iune</hi> to determine thereupon.</p>

her to Sell, is only for satisfying <hi>Kilburnies</hi> Debt, due the time of
his Death, which cannot extend to Annualrents, due after his Death, and
that these Annualrents were truly payed by the Lady, and so could not
come in as a Debt upon the Estate. <hi>2dly.</hi> The Moveable Debts ought to
be satisfied by the Executory, which must first be Exhausted, the Lady
her self being Executrix, and so cannot burden the Heirs of Tailzie, or the
Estate; for if they, had been Distrest, they could have craved
payment from her, <hi>quoad vires inventarij,</hi> so that the principal Sums not
extending to 40000. Pounds, and the Lands being Bought by <hi>Greinock,</hi> at
the Rental of 4000. Merks, and 20000. Merks being gotten more for
the Lands then the Debt, the power of Selling granted to the Lady in the
Disposition, can never extend to so vast a difference, albeit a small diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the price would not be noticed: and lastly it was offered to find
a Party, who would take a Wodset of the Lands, in satisfaction of all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functs
Debts, so that the Lady cannot, in prejudice of the Heirs of Tailzie
Sell, where Wodsetting may do the turn, and the Wodset should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

that the matter was not intire, because the Lands were actually Sold to <hi>Grein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ock,</hi>
he offered to Consent, and Renunce his Bargain. It was answered, that
this Clause <hi>de non alienando,</hi> being against the nature of Property, was odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and not to be extended, and the faculty of Selling, or affecting, being
suitable to the nature of Property was favourable, and not to be restricted
further then the Defuncts own Words, and Termes, who having given full
power to his Daughter to Sell, or affect the Lands named, for payment
of his Debts, and not having said (to Sell, or burden so much of the Land
as were equivalent to the Debt; neither having said so much of the Debt,
as exceeded his Moveables, or his Moveables being first exhausted) it is most
rational, and to be presumed to be his meaning, that as to his Moveables
he did not burden her at all; and that this part of his Lands he set apart for his
Debt, for he understood his Debt to be about the value of it, otherwise he
could have set apart less Land, or could have more limited the Faculty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Disposing; but the principal Sums of this Debt being 40000. Pounds, and
the Rental not being pretended to have been above 4000. Merks, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
would amount to the value of the Land at 15. years Purchase, and
there being unquestionably a latitude to the Feear to Sell at such a Price,
as in discretion he thought fit, though he had sold at twelve years purchase,
or not under the lowest Rate of Land; neither could the Buyer be quarrelled,
nor the Seller, as incurring the Clause irritant, and therefore the Lady hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sold at a far greater Rate then the ordinar, <hi>Greinock</hi> and the Town
of <hi>Glasgow</hi> being both dealling for the Land, they to make a Harbour
there, and he not to suffer them, in prejudice of his Town, and Harbour in
Greinock, there is no reason to exclude the Lady from the benefit of her
Bargain, or to necessitat her to quite the same, and give only a Wodset,
seing the Clause gives her power both to Sell, and Affect, and does not
limit her to either of them.</p>

in the same way as if <hi>Miln-burn</hi> had Resigned in the Dukes Hands,

an Appryzer fell, unless he had been actually Infeft, and it would be
of very great disadvantage to Creditors, if the naked Charge should make
their VVaird to fall, which they may pass from at their pleasure, therefore
seing the Appryzer could not be Vassal, the former Vassal behoved to

of Appryzers, whom the Superior may not prefer, but according to their

nothing upon the Appryzing to force him to give Infeftment to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzer,
until conform to the Act of Parliament, a years Rent of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzed

Infeft. <hi>2dly,</hi> Our Statute hath provided contrair to the Common Feudal

being mutual Obligations between the Superior and the Appryzer, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Superior should Receive the Appryzer,

to do it at the Bar, <hi>unde purgatur mora,</hi> and the Superior must Receive him
in obedience to the Charge, which must be drawen back to the Charge,

                  </gap>ers, that is to say the Charge order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceeded, neither can there be any fault in the Appryzer, that he did
not then offer a years Duty when he Charged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because it was not liquid nor
constant what the years Duty was, and therefore he was only obliged to do
it after the liquidation, and modification of the Lords; and lastly he having
proceeded as all other Appyzers have done by perpetual Custom, he was in
<hi>bona fide</hi> to acquiesce. It was answered for the Donator, that this former
ground holds still good, that the Casualties of his Superiority cannot be lost
to him, without his Delay or Fault; and the Case is no way here as in
mutual Obligations, but as in a Conditional Obligation, for the Statute ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
the Superior to Receive the Appryzer, he paying a years Rent, which
being <hi>per ablativum absolute positum,</hi> is ever interpret as Condition, as if it
had said, the Superior shall Receive him if he pay a years Rent; but by the
Statue there is no obligation put upon the Appryzer to pay the years Rent,
for the payment is in Condition and not in Obligation, and the Appryzer
may ever forbear to seek the Infeftment, and yet will obtain Malls and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and so will Possess, and exclude the Superior, both from the Casuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Superiority, and his years Rent, therefore by the Statute there
is only a Conditional Obligation upon the Superior, to Receive the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzer
upon payment of a years Rent; now the nature of all Conditional
Obligations is, that <hi>pendente conditione &amp; ante purificationem nulla obligatio,</hi> so
that till that time whatever occurs is freely the Superiors: And albeit the
Lords will now, upon offer of a Charter, and the years Duty, give a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
the ordinar Stile whereof, is finding the Letters orderly proceeded,
without putting the Appryzer to a new Charge, yet they do not thereby

<pb n="601" facs="tcp:55692:306"/>
that now it becomes orderly by the offer, and therefore hath only effect

and further alleadged that it was lately found, that a Liferent Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat
falling after a Charge, did not exclude the Appryzer, and there can
be no Reason, but the same should be in a Waird. It was answered, that
no such Practique was produced, nor acknowledged, and that in a Liferent

to do it to his Daughter: And albeit it might be interpret Fraud, if nothing
were left to the Daughters of the second Marriage, yet where they have a
special Provision, and something also of the Conquest, with this burden,
their Father could not be found thereby to Defraud them, or to

               <p>The Lords found the matter of fact, and circumstances, alleadged Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

no interest, unless the Heir were Entered, or they had appryzed, or had a

Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> obtained a second Decreet against some Wodsetters, whose
Rights were posterior to the Annualrent, for the years 1658, 1659, and 1660.

Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> having granted <hi>Iohn Stewart</hi> a Bond to warrand him anent the
year 1657. and that he had given no Discharges that might exclude him.
The Tennents of <hi>Lintoun</hi> Suspends the Charge for the year 1657. upon that
Reason, that Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> had Discharged the Annualrent for the years 1658,
1659, 1660. and all preceeding whereunto he had right: Whereupon <hi>Iohn
Stewart</hi> Charged M. <hi>Patrick</hi> upon his Bond of Warrandice, who Suspended

Discharge, he had no right to the year 1657. which he had received from
<hi>John Stewart,</hi> and given him Warrand, and his Letters to Poind for

                  <hi>John Watson</hi> being Curator to <hi>Margaret Trinch,</hi> and having Contracted
her in Marriage with his own Sister Son, there is a Disposition granted
by her to the said <hi>Iohn Watson,</hi> of all her Means, and in the Contract, he
Contracts with her 1000. pounds, whereunto the Heirs of the Marriage are

before the Marriage, and <hi>David Trinch</hi> Stationer being Served Heir to her,
raises Reduction of the Disposition, and Substitution in the Contract of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
upon two Reasons. <hi>First,</hi> That albeit the Disposition contain Sums
of Money, yet being of the same date with the Contract of Marriage, in
which <hi>Iohn Watson</hi> Contracts 1000. pound with the said <hi>Margaret Trinch,</hi>
which unquestionably has been all that has been gotten for the Disposition,
the said Disposition is a part of the Agreement, in relation to the Marriage,
and must be understood, as granted in Contemplation of the Marriage, as
if it had been Contracted in the Contract of Marriage; so that the Marriage
not having followed, the Disposition is void, as being <hi>causa data causanon

of a weak capacity, Stupide and halfe Deaf, and upon such unequal Terms,
her Means being worth 3000. pounds, as appears by a Decreet obtained at
her Instance, and all she got being but 1000. pounds, to return to <hi>Watson,</hi>
in case there were no Children, and nothing secured on the Husbands part.
The Defender answered to the first, that albeit the Disposition was of the
same date with the Contract of Marriage, it did not conclude, that it was
in Contemplation of the Marriage, and might be, and truly was an absolute
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:55692:310"/>
Bargain. As to the Reason of Circumvention, it is not Relevant, although
the Terms had been as unequal as they are alleadged, for the said <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet
Trench,</hi> might freely <hi>Dispose</hi> of her own, at her pleasure, and leave it
to <hi>Iohn VVatson,</hi> who was her Mothers Brother, if she had no Children,
especially seing <hi>David Trinch,</hi> the nearest on the Fathers side, is but her
Goodsires Brothers Oy, and never took notice of her, whereas <hi>Iohn Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
Alimented her from her Infancy, and obtained Decreets for her Means,
and never received a Groat thereof; neither was there any inequality betwixt
the 1000. pound, and her means, for which, albeit there be a Decreet in
absence of a greater sum; yet there are unquestionable Defalcations, which
being Deduced with her Aliment, there will not be 1000. pounds free.</p>
               <p>The Lords conceiving the Matter to be very unwarrantable on the Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

his Minor were given up, did reduce both the Disposition and Substitution, not
only as done in Contemplation of Marriage, but as being presumed fraudulent

<hi>2dlie,</hi> There is nothing more ordinar, then to take off Ware from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
by Taylors and Servants, who cannot be thought to have the Ware
of their own, but that they must take them off from some Merchant, and
therefore payment should not be made to such Persons, till they produce the
Merchants Accompt, and his Discharge, or if it be, and if these Persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed
pay not the Merchant, as in this case, the loss must not be to the
Merchant, but to these who payed to the interposed Persons, upon their

The Lords found that these Articles in the Accompt, in relation to the
Petticoat and the 114. pounds, which were known by the Defender or his
Lady, to be taken off in their Name, and put in <hi>Andrew Bruce,</hi> his Book,
were due by them, and that though the same had been paid to <hi>Margaret Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar,</hi>
it was upon the Defenders peril, if she paid not the Merchant: They
did also find that the Goods being acknowledged to be converted to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
use, they were lyable to the Pursuer, in so far as they proved not
they paid <hi>Margaret Sinclar,</hi> and found the same probable by <hi>Margarets</hi> Writ,
or by Witnesses: but found not that Ground Relevant, that <hi>Margaret
Sinclar</hi> was intrusted generally to take off Ware; or that the Grounds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
did instruct a particular Warrand to take off from the Pursuer; and
therefore did not find the payment made to <hi>Margaret Sinclar,</hi> which she
failed to pay the Merchant, to be upon the Defenders peril, except as to

               <p>THe Countess of <hi>Dundee</hi> being possest in an Annualrent out of the
Maines of <hi>Dudhop, Anno</hi> 1650. and having consented to the Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of other Creditors in the said Mains, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1659. she is provided
to ten Chalder of Victual out of the said Mains, and to certain other Lands,
and the provision bears expresly in satisfaction of the Contract of Marriage,
and any prior Infeftments, whereupon she pursues a poinding of the Ground.
Compearance is made for Mr. <hi>Iames Birsbin,</hi> who produces an Infeftment
of an Annualrent, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. and offers to prove Possession conform,
prior to the Ladies Infeftment in <hi>Anno</hi> 1659, whereupon she how pursues,
and which Infeftment she has accepted in satisfaction of all that can befall to
her by her Husbands Death. The Pursuer answered, that she was infest
in an Annualrent out of the Mains in <hi>Anno</hi> 1650. which doth exclude <hi>Birs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,</hi>
unless he had attained Possession before that time; and albeit this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1659. being in satisfaction <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet that Right whereby she
accepts the same, is not in favours of <hi>Birsbin,</hi> but of other Rights to
whom the Lady consented, and not to <hi>Birsbins</hi> to which she never consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therefore it must be limited to be only in so far as concerns these
Rights related therein. <hi>Birsbin</hi> answered, that be the Motive or Narrative
what it would, my Lady having simply and absolutely accepted this Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in satisfaction of her former Infeftments, the former Infeftments were
thereby extinct in the same way, as if she had Renunced them simply to
my Lord, whence there is <hi>jus acquisitum</hi> to <hi>Birsbin,</hi> deriving Right from
my Lord.</p>

words were absolute, and so did extend to <hi>Birsbin.</hi> It was also alleadged,
that this last security in so far as it bears to be in satisfaction of all others,
the acceptance thereof was a Donation betwixt Man and Wife Revockable,
and my Lady did now recal it. It was answered, my Lady had Homologat
the same after my Lords Death, by pursuing now thereupon, in which it
occurred to the Lords, whether my Lady might recal any part of this last
provision, and make use of it in so far as it quadrat with the former
Infeftments, or whether she might recal it after she had made use of it
after her Husbands Death, which not being Debated fully, the Lords did
not decide therein.</p>

which Decreet the Strangers Suspend, and raised Reduction upon these
Reasons, that this Ship and Goods belonged to one <hi>Clepan</hi> in <hi>Bruges,</hi> the
King of <hi>Spains</hi> Subject, and was declared Prize upon no other ground, but
because she carried Tow and Hards, which are not Counterband, but are
necessary in some quantity in every Ship for Calsing; and by the Treaty
betwixt the King, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> there is an express Article,
that though Counterband be deprehended in <hi>Spainish</hi> Ships, only the
Counterband shall be Prize, and not the Ship and Goods. It was
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:55692:315"/>
answered, that this alleadgeance was competent, and Omitted before
the Admiral. It was answered, that these cases with Strangers are
to be Ruled by the Law of Nations, and not by peculiar Statutes
and Customs.</p>
               <p>The Lords reponed the Strangers to their Defenses, as in the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and also allowed the Privateer to insist on any grounds for making
of the Ship Prize, which he did not formerly insist on, whereupon the Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer
insisted upon two grounds. <hi>First,</hi> Because by the Law of Nations,
and the Kings Proclamation of War, Allies and Neuters must not make use
of the Kings Enemies to sail their Ships, and therefore the Proclamation of
War bears expresly, that all Ships shall be seised, bearing any number of
Men of the Kings Enemies, and this Ship had the major part of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> then the Kings Enemies, as is evident by their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
taken before the Admiral. <hi>2dly,</hi> This Ship was not only sailed
by <hi>Hollanders,</hi> but the Ship, or major part thereof, and the Loadning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and any pretext that the same belonged to the King
of <hi>Spains</hi> Subjects is a meer Contrivance, it being most ordinar the time
of the War for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to Trade under the name and covert of the <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,</hi>
the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Subjects, which appears in this Case by many evidences.
<hi>First,</hi> Both the Merchant and major part of the sailers, by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
are <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and they have adduced nothing to be a sufficient
probation that the whole ship and Goods belonged to <hi>Clepan</hi> in <hi>Bruges;</hi> but
on the contrair the Skippers first Testimonie at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> bears, that this
Ship and Goods belongs to <hi>Clepan</hi> and <hi>Revier,</hi> which <hi>Revier</hi> being taken
Aboard, acknowledges that he was born in <hi>Holland,</hi> but says that two or
three years before the seisure he dwelt in <hi>Gent,</hi> and <hi>Brussels,</hi> under the King
of <hi>Spain;</hi> and having a Diligence granted to prove his Domicil the time
of the War, and Capture, all that he proves, is that in <hi>March</hi> 1667. he
hired a House in <hi>Brussels,</hi> and began to set up there, and that sometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had lived with his Mother in <hi>Gent,</hi> but proves not how long, or
that it was his constant Domicil, for that was an ordinar contrivance for
<hi>Hollanders</hi> to hire Houses in the <hi>Spainish</hi> Netherlands, and to pretend to
be Subjects there, but they being <hi>Hollanders</hi> at the beginning of the War,
concurring, and contributing to the War, albeit they had truely removed <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
belli,</hi> they continued to be the Kings Enemies; much less can their taking a
House else where, sufficiently prove that they totally deserted the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and concurred not with them in the War, it being easie to have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micils
in diverse places. <hi>2dly,</hi> The contrivance is yet more evident, in that
the Goods were Shipped by <hi>Rivier</hi> at <hi>Fleck</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and sailing from
thence to <hi>Copperwil</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> and was taken, having no Pass from the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> for this Voyage, but had a pretended Pass from the Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> which albeit it bears relation to the same Ship called <hi>Charles</hi> the second,
yet by the Testimonies of the Witnesses, it is evident to have been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two years before this Ship was Built, which is an evident cheat; and for
the Pass from the Governour of the Netherlands, it bears but to last for a
year, and was expired before this Voyage; and as for the Pass from the
Chamber of Commerce, it was granted for a former Voyage, from <hi>Ostend</hi>
to <hi>France,</hi> which is clear by the Testimonies, which bear also that there
could be no Pass gotten for this Voyage, because this Ship was lying in <hi>Fleck,</hi>
and not in the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Ports, and so the Loading could not be their
lying, and wanted Oath taken thereupon that it belonged not to the Kings
Enemies, as is requisite in such Cases. It was answered for the Strangers,
to the first ground of Adjudication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was no way sufficient. <hi>First,</hi>
                  <pb n="619" facs="tcp:55692:315"/>
Because the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being an Allie by a perpetual League, his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
were not to be regulat by the Kings Proclamations, but by the solemn
Treaties betwixt both Kings, which setting down the causes of Seisure, must
necessarly import that seisure should be for no other cause then is therein
exprest. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Articles bear expresly, that any of the <hi>Spainish</hi> Subjects
having a Pass conform to the <hi>formula</hi> set down in the Articles, should be
no further troubled, which <hi>formula</hi> requires nothing as to what Countrey the
Sailers are of, and therefore there can be no seisure upon the account of the
Sailers; for albeit by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty, the <hi>Swedes</hi> are allowed to have a

answered for the Privateer, that the Strangers could not pretend Right to
the <hi>Spainish</hi> Treaty, seing they wanted a Pass conform thereto, and that it
could not be inferred <hi>negative</hi> from the <hi>Spainish</hi> Treaty, that seisures should
only be for the Causes therein exprest, there being no such Article in the
Treaty, and the Law of Nations, and the Kings Proclamation being the

                  </gap>er seasure of the Ship and Goods, which is valide,
though a Priviledge derogator to the Law of Nations, but speakes nothing
whether the carrying of Enemies Goods shall make the Ship Prize, so that
that Priviledge, not being granted by the Articles, the Law of Nations
takes place, and the Ship may be declared Prize; likeas in the case of <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails</hi>
Ship Decided in the last Session, all that is there alieadged, being here
alleadged, <hi>Overvail</hi> not instructing any <hi>Flandrian</hi> Concession to sail with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi>
his Ship was Declared Prize upon that same very ground, and the
Testimony of the Skipper at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> is most unsuspect, it being taken
before the Skipper was otherwise prompted to Depone, neither had the
Clerk any interest, but the most that can be pretended is that he had
relation to some of the Owners, which signifies nothing, and the Skipper
by his Office, being the person Commissionat by the Owners, who by his
Office, may Sell or Burden the Ship, without a special Commission, his
Oath makes a full probation against the Owners who Intrusted him, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
here where the Merchant, and most part of the Company by their

own confession are <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which proves sufficiently for the Privateer,
unless they instruct that the Ship and Goods belonged to free men, and them
only, which they have not done evidently and surely, by all that they have
produced, but the Skipper (who is the main Man to be trusted) is contrary,
therefore it may be, and is presumed to be a Contrivance, to carry on the

to the Donator, not only for the first Wodset, which was constitute

the Liferent Escheat of <hi>Graham;</hi> the granter of the Wodset, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as if he had given the Wodsetter a Gift thereof, and so no Gift, no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Gift, unlesse the Wodsetter could alleadge a Deed Denuding the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
anterior to the Pursuers Gift; but here the Superiors Consent is not

the Gift which is the <hi>habilis modus,</hi> must be preferred unto the Superiors
Consent to the Wodset, which is but indirect, and consequential to infer
the Right, as Liferent, at least both must be conjoined, and have
equal Right, as done <hi>simul &amp; semel.</hi> It was answered for the Wodsetter,
that the Superiors Gift must not be preferred to the Consent, though of

himself to his Annualrent, and be countable to him for the superplus,

must either quite his Possession, or restrict conform to the Act betwixt
Debitor and Creditor. The Wodsetter answered, that his second Wodset
bearing, not only a Ratification of the first Wodset in all points, but a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the same Lands, falls not within that Clause of the said Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which Regulates only Wodsets prior to that Act; and the new
Disposition makes the old Wodset as extinct and innovat. The Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
answered, that there being <hi>a jus quaesitum,</hi> conform to the Act, as to
the former Wodset, the posterior Ratification cannot derogat therefrom, or
take it away, unless it had been exprest, and <hi>in meritis causa,</hi> it was alleadged that

               <head>Pearson of Balmadies contra The Town of Montross. Iune 23. 1669.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>PEarson</hi> of <hi>Balmadies</hi> being Collector of two of ten, and the sixteen pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
imposed by Parliament <hi>anno</hi> 1633. and the Magistrates of the Town
of <hi>Montross,</hi> having Written a Letter to him, promising Compt and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>anno</hi> 1637. Some few dayes after the Letter, he made Compt with
<hi>Orbistoun,</hi> general Collector, and Charged himself with the whole Taxation
of <hi>Montross,</hi> as received. And in <hi>anno</hi> 1654. obtains a Decreet against the
then Magistrates, holding them as confest upon the quantities of Taxation
of their Burgh. They now Suspend on this Reason, that the Decreet was
in absence, and the Magistrates only holden as confest, and they are now
content to Depone, that they never had any Stent Roll of the said Taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and by the Chargers Compt produced, he acknowledges the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Montross</hi> received. And further alleadges, that there being neither
Warrand from King nor Parliament, there should be no Charge or Pursuit
Sustained for these old Taxations, especially of Mony, where the most
part of the Monyed Persons lyable then, are now insolvent; and the Town
cannot get their Relief. But as for the Land Taxation, the King has given
Warrand to lift it, and it is still secure, being <hi>debitum fundi.</hi> The Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
answered, that he being neighbour to the Town, did upon their desire,
delay to distress them, and held Compt for them, as appears by their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
produced: and therefore it will not infer that Charges may be used up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Act of Parliament only, unless Parties had given Writ therefore, and
the Magistrates were obliged by the Act of Parliament, to have uplifted the
Taxation <hi>debito tempore,</hi> and payed it to the Collectors; and it must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
they did so, or if they did not, it was their fault, in the Discussing
of this Cause. It occurred to the Lords, that this Taxation not being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon the Towns Common-good, but upon the Inhabitants severally,
for their Mony, and that the Magistrates were not countable to the Town
for the Taxation of Mony, nor were they lyable for their Magistrates, who
had not this power of Collection by their Office, but by the Commission of
Parliament therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="623" facs="tcp:55692:317"/>
The Lords found the Town and present Magistrates not lyable, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the Pursuer to insist aganist the then Magistrates, their Heirs and

                  <hi>RObert Fairie</hi> having Charged <hi>Iames Inglis</hi> younger of <hi>Mordistoun</hi> for
1000. merks due by Bond, he did Suspend and raised Reduction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Minority, Lesion and Circumvention, <hi>Litiscontestation</hi> was made upon
the Reason of Minority, and the Term was Circumduced; and he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.

upon Circumvention, and qualified it thus, That albeit the Bond
bear, borrowed Money, yet he offers to prove by <hi>Fairies</hi> Oath, that the
true Cause was the Boot between a Horse and a Mare interchanged betwixt
the Parties: and albeit the Suspender gave as good as he got, yet he was
induced to give this Bond of 1000. merks to Boot, so that he is lesed <hi>ultra di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midium

the Bargain, and restore either Party, <hi>actione redibitoria &amp; quanti minoris:</hi>
and next in so gross inequality, <hi>ex re praesumitur dolus.</hi> The Charger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the Reason is no way Relevant, because our Law and Custom
acknowledges not that Ground of the Civil Law, of annulling Bargains,
made without Cheat or Fraud upon the inequality of the Price; neither
can there be any Fraud inferred, upon the account of the Price of an
Horse, which is not <hi>quantitas</hi> but <hi>corpus,</hi> and has not a common Rate, but
is regulat <hi>secundum praetium affectionis,</hi> and now the Horse and the Mare not
being to be shown in the condition they were in; the Suspender cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
the Bargain. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Reason ought to be Repelled, because by a
Ticket apart with the same Date of the Bond, the Suspender declares up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Soul and Conscience, that he should never Impugn the Bond; and
thereafter by his second Bond produced, he Ratifies the same, and passes
from any Revocation thereof, or quarrel against the same. The Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
answered, that he was content to refer to the Chargers own Oath,
whether in the Chargers own esteem of the Rate, the Suspender was not
lesed above the half: and as for the two Tickets, the first was obtained
when he was Minor, and both <hi>laborant eodem vitio,</hi> the inequality still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

sum of 20000. should not be payable till five years after her Fathers Death,
and after her own Marriage. The said <hi>Jean</hi> Assigns this Bond to her Brother
Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and he Charges Sir <hi>William,</hi> who, and some of the other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
Suspends on these Reasons: <hi>First,</hi> That by the Conception of the
Bond, it was clear the principal Sum was not payable till <hi>Jeans</hi> Marriage,
and she being Dead unmarried, is not now payable at all, whereupon the
Charger insisted for the bygone Annualrents, and for granting an Infeftment
of annualrent to him as Assigney, conform to the Bond: The Suspenders
Reasons against the annualrent, were <hi>first,</hi> That this being an annualrent
accessory to a principal Sum, <hi>ablato principali tollitur accessorium,</hi> so that the
principal Sum being now not due to any by <hi>Ieans</hi> Death, Dying unmarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the annualrent also must cease from her Death. <hi>2dly,</hi> The annualrent
is conceived payable to <hi>Iean</hi> and her Heirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but no mention of Assigneys.
<hi>3dly,</hi> Albeit ordinarly in such Obligations or Infeftments following thereon,
the first Person is Feear, and the Substitutes are but Heirs, who cannot come
against the Feears Deed by Assignation, or otherwayes; yet where the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
is gratuitous, and proceeds not upon sums of Mony belonging to the
Creditor: but upon the free Gift of a Parent bestowing the Sum, there the
Substitution implys a Substitution and Obligation upon the first Person, and
the Heirs of their Body, to do no voluntar Deed to evacuat the Substitution;
so that albeit a Creditor or Successor, for a Cause onerous, might exclude
the Substitutes; yet another Heir appointed by the first person or a Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
or gratuitous Assigney cannot evacuat the Tailzie, and exclude the
Substitutes, because in such Contracts, <hi>uberrima fidei,</hi> the mind of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
who Gifted, and freely granted the sum, is chiefly to be considered:
so that it cannot be thought to be old <hi>Gairntillies</hi> mind, that his Daughter
might Change the Substitution, and elude the Conditions of the Bond, for
the Suspending of the Requisition of the principal Sum, till <hi>Iean</hi> were
married, must import that his meaning was, to give her the Annualrent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
till that time, and the principal Sum to be a Tocher if she married, which
was to no purpose, if the Annualrent remained perpetual; for then the
Heretor would certainly Redeem to purge his Land, as he had done, and
the Sums Consigned would belong to the Assigney, and the Clause Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the payment thereof, if <hi>Iean</hi> married not, signified nothing, <hi>sed ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba
sumenda sunt cum effectu;</hi> and the meaning of the Parties, and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Condition Suspensive must be preserved. The Charger answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he opponed the Bond, wherein, without all question <hi>Jean</hi> was Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:55692:318"/>
and the Substitutes being the Heirs of Tailzie, cannot quarrel her Deed,
but are bound as Representing her to fulfil the same; and albeit <hi>Ieans</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeys
be not exprest, yet they are ever included, where they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
excluded; neither is this Annualrent stated as a meer accessory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Requisition of the principal Sum may be Discharged, or may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the Suspensive Clause ineffectual, as now it does; and yet the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligement
or Infeftment of Annualrent remains a perpetual Right, though
Redeemable at the Debitors option; neither is there by Law or Custom
any difference or exception, whether the Annualrent be gratuitous, or for
a Cause onerous: and for the meaning of the Father, procurer of the Bond,
it must be understood as it is exprest, only to exclude the lifting of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Sum by <hi>Iean,</hi> upon the Clause of Requisition, if she were not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:
and if his mind had been otherways, it had been easie to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
a restrictive Clause, or in stead of the Substitution, to have set down
a Provision, that if <hi>Iean</hi> died unmarried, the annualrent should belong to
her Brothers and Sisters nominat: but this being an ordinar single Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
hath neither expresly nor implicitely any Condition or Obligation
upon the Feear, not to Dispone.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Reasons of Suspension, and found <hi>Iean</hi> to be Feear
of the Annualrent, and that she might assign the same, and that the Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes

that the rest should be conveyed to the Creditors, and the Creditors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
claiming the Property of the Vassals, as falling within the Forefaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
His Majesty Wrot a Letter, Declaring that it was not His meaning by
the Gift, that the Creditors should have any more Lands conveyed to them
then the remainder of the Property belonging to the late Marquess, over

the Earl and his Successors, by which His Majesties Mind and Pleasure is

had flowing from the House of <hi>Argile,</hi> but there could be no Certification,
as to what they had not, in respect of the Troubles, especially no Certifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for want of Confirmation of the Vassals Rights by the King, because
several of the Vassals continued Loyal to His Majesty, during all the Troubles,
and some of them losed their lives in His Service, opposing the said late Marquess
himself: So that it can never be thought to be His Majesties purpose or
pleasure, so to restore this Earl the Marquess Heir appearand, as thereby to
Forefault the Vassals, who adhered to His Majesty, and who durst not in
time of these Troubles have fought Confirmations, His Majesties Exchequer
being then in the manadgement of these who were in opposition to Him. It
was answered for the Pursuer to the first, that neither by the Pursuers Gift from
His Majesty, nor by the foresaid Letter, there is nothing granted to the Vassals
in opposition to the Earls Right, but in opposition to the Creditors, that
they should have no hand in the Vassals Estates. Likeas, His Majesty by
His last Ratification and Charter under the Great Seal produced, hath most
distinctly and clearly exprest His meaning and pleasure, that by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Gift or Letter, His Majesty did only Exclude the Creditors from the
Estates of the Vassals, but thereby Declares, that not only the Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Casualities thereof should belong to the Earl, but the Property of

of Law, for that effect. It was answered for the Vassals, that if their
true condition and adherence to His Majesty, had been understood His
Majesty would not so have Declared, and that <hi>post jus quaesitum</hi> to them by
the Kings Gift and Letter, no posterior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Declaration impetrat from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
should prejudge them, at the least, they humbly craved that the Lords
according to their former Interlocutor, would Represent the Case to His
Majesty, that His Pleasure might be known, and that His Majesty might
interpose with my Lord <hi>Argile,</hi> not to insist against the Vassals, who had
been Loyal. It was answered for the Earl, that he had given no just grounds
to his Vassals to expect, that though they were in his power, that he would
destroy them, and annul their Rights: and seing His Majesty had fully
and absolutely entrusted them to him, they ought to have rested upon His
Kindness and Generosity, and not to have made all this Clamour, where
they have no Legal Defense, it being no strange nor new thing, for
the King to give Gifts of Forefaulture without any Reservation of Vassals,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:55692:320"/>
who had no Confirmation from the King, yea many times without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Forefault Persons Debt, and His Majesty has lately so done
to the Marquess of <hi>Huntly,</hi> to whom he gave the Estate of <hi>Huntly,</hi> without
Reservation, either to Vassals or Creditors, and that upon the Forfaulture
of the Marquess of <hi>Argile,</hi> who had Right to, and was in Possession of the
Estate of <hi>Huntly</hi> for vast sums of Mony, and the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> has the Gift
of the remainder of his Fathers Estate, with the burden of more

the Vassals might plead in Point of Favour: yet they do not pretend to a
Defense in Law. And the Lords being Judges of the Law, ought not to
stop the Course thereof, upon the Insinuations of any Party; otherwayes
they may deny the Course of Law to any of the Leidges, when they please,

which they designed to them, and to take <hi>Lovat,</hi> being then in Bed, and the
Messenger offered to go with them, and enter first, yet the Bailies did not obey,

lyes on <hi>Otterburn</hi> side, and that his Infeftment produced granted by
<hi>Young</hi> to <hi>Young,</hi> bears expresly <hi>Greenlaw.</hi> It was alleadged for <hi>More,
First,</hi> that <hi>Grubbet</hi> cannot pretend <hi>Greenlaw</hi> to be Part and Pertinent of
<hi>Otterburn,</hi> because by his own Infeftments produced, granted by the <hi>Young's,</hi>
and accepted by him, <hi>Greenlaw</hi> is not exprest as Part and Pertinent of
<hi>Otterburn,</hi> albeit <hi>Raschbog</hi> tho lesse considerable then it, be exprest, and on the
contrair, it is declared that the <hi>Young's</hi> were kindly Tennents of <hi>Greenlaw,</hi>
and Disponed their kindness thereof; aud offers to prove that the <hi>Young's</hi>
were in constant custom of Service to Sir <hi>Iohn Ker</hi> in Armes and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
whenever they were required, and that most of the Lands on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

because it was holden blench of Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> and if need be's, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to prove by Witnesses, that when the said <hi>Young's</hi> came not to the said Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they were poinded therefore. <hi>2dly, More</hi> offered to prove that <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law</hi>
is a distinct Tenement, both from <hi>Otterburn</hi> and <hi>Morbatle,</hi> and hath
past as a distinct Tenement since the year 1636. and hath a known March
between it and <hi>Otterburn, viz.</hi> a Know. <hi>3dly,</hi> For <hi>Grubbets</hi> pretence of
bruiking <hi>Greenlaw</hi> as Part and Pertinent of <hi>Otterburn</hi> for 40. years, so that
he might claim it by Prescription, the alleadgeance ought to be Repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
first because Prescription cannot proceed without an Infeftmen, and it
cannot be ascribed to the <hi>Young's</hi> Infeftment, wherein they acknowledge
that they were kindly Tennents of <hi>Greenlaw,</hi> after which no course of time
can ever prescribe a Right to <hi>Greenlaw,</hi> as part and Pertinent of <hi>Otterburn</hi> by
that Charter, and therefore any Possession that is thereof is without Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>2dly,</hi> There is not fourty years Possession, abating <hi>Mores</hi> Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>3dly,</hi> There are interruptions, and therefore if <hi>Greenlaw</hi> be either a
distinct Tenement, or part of <hi>Morbatle,</hi> it belongs to <hi>More.</hi> It was answered
for <hi>Grubbet,</hi> that he and his Authors Possessing <hi>Greenlaw</hi> these 40 years past,
as part of <hi>Otterburn</hi> gives him sufficient Right thereunto, notwithstanding of
any acknowledgement in the Charter, or without the Charter before that
time, for Prescription may change Part and Pertinents, so that which was
once not acknowledged to be a part by Possession, 40 years thereafter may
become a part, and that acknowledgement never being made use of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
and the Charter in which it is, is a sufficient Title, both for what was
parts the time of the Charter, and what becomes thereafter parts by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
<hi>2dly,</hi> The acknowledgement of a Party having Right is of no
effect, when by demonstration of the Right it self the contrair appears,
as here, therebeing an anterior Right of Property of the <hi>Young's</hi> produced
before that acknowledgement. <hi>3dly,</hi> The ackowledgement is not, that they
were only kindly Tennents, otherwise it is very well consistent with the
Property, that they being first kindly Tennents, and that kindliness being
thought more favourable to maintain Possession in these places, then any
Heretable Right, they might very well Dispone <hi>Otterburn,</hi> whereof <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law</hi>
is a part, and might also Dispone their kindness of <hi>Greenlaw</hi> they had
before the Right of Property; neither doth it infer, because <hi>Raschbog</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:55692:321"/>
as Pertinent of <hi>Otterburn,</hi> which hath been upon account that <hi>Rasch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bog</hi>
was then unclear, that therefore <hi>Greenlaw</hi> is no Part thereof, or else it
could have no more parts but <hi>Raschhog,</hi> there being no more exprest; and
as for the alleadged Services done by the <hi>Young's</hi> to Sir <hi>Iohn Ker,</hi> they
cannot infer that the <hi>Young's</hi> were then Tennents of <hi>Greenlaw,</hi> because such
Services being only general, and no particular Services accustomed by Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
they might have been performed to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> as Superior, or as out of
kindness to a great Man in the Countrey, and its offered to be proven (if
need be's) that hundreds granted such Services, who were not Tennents,
so that unless there were a Tack, Inrolments of Court, or Executions of
Poinding produced to instruct Services as a Tack-duty on <hi>Greenlaw,</hi> it is Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relevant.</p>
               <p>The Lords by a former Interlocutor had found that by the acknowlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Young's</hi> Charter, or any thing therein was not sufficient to exclude
<hi>Greenlaw</hi> from being Part and Pertinent of <hi>Otterburn,</hi> but they found that
is <hi>More</hi> would alleadge a Tack, or Inrolment of Court, to the <hi>Young's</hi> of
Services for <hi>Greenlaw,</hi> it were sufficient, or otherwise if he would alleadge
constant Service of the <hi>Young's,</hi> by Riding <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Poinded by him, when they were absent, they found the same with
the acknowledgement in <hi>Grubbets</hi> Right to exclude <hi>Grubbet</hi> from <hi>Greenlaw,</hi>
and if these were not alleadged, they ordained Witnesses to be Examined upon
the ground <hi>hinc inde</hi> before answer, upon these points, whether <hi>Greenlaw</hi>
was known to be a distinct Tennement, both from <hi>Otterburn</hi> and <hi>Marbotle,</hi>
or whether it was known to be Part and Pertinent of either, and what
were the Marches and Meithes thereof, and what Services were done by the

               <p>Which the Lords granted, the Fame, and suspition of the Forgery being

so great, though ordinarly they do not Examine Witnesses upon the

the Lords proceeded to Examine the Tutor, who stifly stood to the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Dispositions, as being truly Subscribed by him, but differed in
the Date, and in the persons who were Witnesses to the Subscription: The
Captains Son in law being also Examined, whether or not the Captain had
employed him to corrupt the Witnesses, and if he had written any Letter
to him, to that purpose produced a Letter, mentioning some things by word
which he should diligently go about, and being asked who the Bearer was,
Deponed that he was <hi>Robert Ogilvy</hi> the Tutors Servant, who being in the

and repeat the Reasons by way of Defense, alleadging that the Tutor
nor his Cautioner were not obliged for the Annualrents due by the Marquess
of <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> and Earl of <hi>Buccleugh,</hi> because they were in responsal Hands,
and the Pupil had no Damnage, for it was free for the Tutor to uplift
the Annualrents of Pupils Money, when secure, at any time during the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillarity,
but here they offer to prove the Tutor Died <hi>durante tutela,</hi> and
so was not lyable when he Died, to uplift these secure Annualrents, or
to have employed them. The Pursuer answered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Lords had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:55692:322"/>
found at the same Pursuers Instance against <hi>Iohn Boyd,</hi> that the Tutor
was lyable for Annualrent, not only <hi>pro intromissis,</hi> but <hi>pro omissis,</hi> and for
the Annualrent of the Pupils Annuals <hi>a finita tutela,</hi> which is finished, either
by ending the Pupillarity, or the Death or Removal of the Tutor. It was
answered, that the Lords Interlocutor was only in the case that the Tuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
had been finished in the ordinar way by the Age of the Pupil, for that
way of ending thereof, could only been foreknowen by the Tutor, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the same he might lift the Pupils Annuals, and give them out on An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrent,
but he could not foresee his own Death, but might justly think
he had time before the expiring of his Tutory, to lift and employ, and so
the Tutor not having failed in his Duty, his Cautioner is free. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>First,</hi> That by the Lords dayly Practique Tutors are lyable for the
Annualrents of Rents, of and within a year after the Rents are due, and
there being so much parity of Reason in Annualrents, it cannot be thought
just that the Tutor was not obliged to lift them till the end of his Tutory,
for albeit he might have keeped them in his Hands unemployed, and only
to leave them employed at the ish of his Tutory, yet he was obliged to uplift
them, and if by any accident, as being preveened by Death, he did not employ
them, that accident should be on his peril, not the innocent Pupils.
<hi>2dly,</hi> If need beis, the Pursuer offers to prove the Annualrents
were uplifted by the Tutor, and so these that Represent him, and his
Cautioners, are lyable for Annualrent therefore, at least from the Death
of the Tutor.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Tutor was neither obliged to lift, nor give
out on Annual the Annualrents of his Pupil, if the Debitors were Responsal,
but only once betwixt and the end of the Pupillarity; and if he Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
betwixt and the end of the Tutory, he was free both of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
and Annualrents thereof, but if he did actually uplift the Annalrents,
they found that it was sufficient to employ them any time before the Tutory
ended, and found that his Heir was lyable for Annualrent, not from the
Tutors Death, but from the end of the Pupillarity, and that he could be
no further lyable then the Tutor, if he had lived, in respect that subsequent
Tutors were obliged to lift these Annualrents from the former Tutors Heirs,
and employ them.</p>

in <hi>Air,</hi> and being Infeft therein; <hi>Garners</hi> Wife and Bairns raise a
Reduction, and alleadge that the Apprizers Right is null, as to the Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>Air,</hi> because <hi>Iohn Garner</hi> had never Right thereto, but the Right
was Originally granted to young <hi>Iohn Garner</hi> the Pursuer, by his Mother
Brother. The Defender answered. that the said Right must be affected
with his Apprizing, as if it had been in the Fathers Person, because young
<hi>Garner</hi> was then an Infant in his Fathers Family; and albeit the Right be
granted by his Uncle, yet it is necessarly inferred to be Acquired by the
Fathers Means, because it bears not for Love and Favour, but for Sums
of Money, and the Uncle had Bairns of his own. It was answered, that
albeit the Right had been Acquired by the Fathers Means, yet its anterior
to the Apprizing, and Sums on which it proceeds, whereupon nothing
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:55692:323"/>
can be taken away but what is posterior thereto, albeit there were a Declarator

to these Tenements.</p>

                  <hi>2dly,</hi> The Pursuer alleadges the Apprizing (as to <hi>Lady-kirk</hi>) must
be Reduced, because the Pursuers produce a prior Infeftment granted by
<hi>Iohn Garner</hi> to his Wife in Liferent, and his Bairns in Fee. it was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the said Infeftment was base, never cled with Possession. The

of Possession was as lawful Administrator to the Pursuers Bairns,
and if need be's its offered to be proven he had a Factory from them.
The Defender answered, that a Fathers Possession being continued, was
never found to validate a base Infeftment granted to his Children, albeit his
Liferent were expresly Reserved, but its ever accounted a latent fraudulent
Deed, and a Factory can be of no more force then a Reservation, otherwise
it were impossible to obviat fraudulent conveyances betwixt Fathers and
Children. The Pursuer answered, that albeit such Reservations are not
valide in Rights freely granted by Fathers, yet it meets not this case, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where there was an anterior Onerous Cause, <hi>Iohn Garner</hi> being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by his Contract of Marriage, that what Lands he should Acquire, should
be to his Wife in Liferent, and to the Bairns of the Marriage.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Bairns Infeftment granted by their Father, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he had Possest by a Factory from them, was not cled with Possession,
or sufficient to exclude a posterior publick Infeftment, and that the Clause
in the Contract was but to substitute the Children Heirs to their Father in
the Conquest.</p>
               <p>Here it was not alleadged that the Factory was made publick by Process

is equiparat to the Tack it self, which requires no other solemnity, as
an obligement to grant an Assignation, is equivalent to an Assignation, and
that there is here a Cause Onerous of the Universities Obligement, because
the Tack bears expresly 300. Merks of <hi>grassum,</hi> and that the former
Tack-duty was only ten Merks, which by this Tack is made 50. Merks,

and there is now Reduction intented of the Decreet of Adjudication,
in fortification whereof the Privateer Insists upon two grounds. <hi>First,</hi>
That this Ship belongs to the Kings Enemies, with a considerable part of the
Loadning, <hi>viz.</hi> 1500. Dails as is acknowledged by the Skippers Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>2dly,</hi> Whereas she pretends to have been bound for <hi>London</hi> upon
the Kings Proclamation, giving liberty to all his Subjects to import Timber
from <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> by the Ships and Mariners in these Countreys,
though then in Enimity, yet the said Proclamation requires that all such
Ships shall find Caution at the Custom-house to return straight to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
without going aside into an Enemies Countrey, and requires the
Lord Admirals Pass; but this Ship at the time of the Adjudication did
not pretend to the Duke of <hi>York's</hi> Pass, but only to the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's</hi>
Pass as Admiral of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereas the Proclamation warrands
only the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to give such Passes, neither doth he produce now
any Pass from the Duke, or any extract of a Pass from him. It was answered for
the Strangers, and for <hi>Iohn Dyson</hi> Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> that they having Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
conform to the Kings Proclamation for importing Timber, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found Caution and obtained a Pass conform to the Proclamation the
Ship and Loadning cannot be made Prize, upon the Skippers Oath, that
they had Aboard 1500. Dails belonging to him and the Company. <hi>First,</hi>
Because the Skipper is <hi>testis singularis. 2dly,</hi> By the constant Custom Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
have Portage Dails allowed. <hi>3dly,</hi> The number of the Dails is insert
but with Figures, and might easily have been altered after the Testimony,
from 500. by adding one, and from 150. by adding a Cipher, neither
of which would have been sufficient to infer Confiscation. <hi>4thly, Iohn
Dyson</hi> Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> having <hi>bona fide</hi> Contracted with the Stranger
for importing 6000. Dails, albeit the Skipper had foisted in some more, it
cannot infer a Confiscation of a Loadning belonging to him the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
Contracting <hi>bona fide,</hi> whatever it may infer as to the Strangers Ship
and his own Dails. As to the second point anent the wanting the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi>
Pass, there is produced a Testificat of the Dukes Secretaries, and the Ship hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been Bought from the Privateer by Captain <hi>Lye,</hi> who carried her to
<hi>London,</hi> the Duke gives her a Pass to return from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Norway,</hi>
bearing that he had given her a former Pass to come into <hi>England;</hi> there
is also produced His Majesties Letter, that he is sufficiently informed that
this Ship is Authorized by a sufficient Pass, and therefore ordering her to be
Restored with Testificats from the Customers, that Caution was found
there, and the Testimony of the Skipper and a Sea-man taken at <hi>London,</hi>
bearing that Captain <hi>Lye</hi> having Bought the Ship from a Privateer, desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Skipper (then in Prison) to show him the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Pass,
which when he shew'd him, he pulled it out of his Hand to secure the
Ship; against all which it was objected, that all these were impetrat after
the Ship was declared Prize, and that it is the more suspitious, that at the
time of the Adjudication there was not so much as mention made of the
Duke of <hi>York's</hi> Pass, though the Duk of <hi>Richmonds</hi> Pass was rejected, as
not sufficient without the Duke of <hi>Yorks,</hi> and that as yet there is no Extract,
of the Pass out of any Record; and as for his Majesties Letter it hath been
impetrat <hi>suppressa veritate,</hi> and cannot take away a Parties privat Right, but
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:55692:324"/>
is <hi>salvo jure,</hi> as are all Acts of Parliament done by His Majesty, and three
Estates <hi>incitata parte,</hi> much more such a Letter, as the Lords found in the
case of the Castle of <hi>Riga,</hi> and though there had been a Pass from the
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> it is likely not to have been of this Date but for a former
Voyage.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the alleadgeance for the Privateer, that there was 1500.
Dails Aboard belonging to the Kings Enemies Relevant to Confiscat the

               <p>THe Duke of <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> as Collector-general of the Taxations, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Charged the Feuars of the Kings Property for payment of this
current Taxation, several of them Suspended upon this Reason, that by
the Act of Convention there is abatement given of a third part to such
Shires as in the West and South, in regard their Retours are higher then the
rest of the Countrey, and yet these of the Kings Property are Charged for
the whole. It was answered, that that abatement cannot extend to the
Feuars of the Property, because in all former Taxations they were distinct
both from the Temporality and Spirituality, and therefore though by the
Act of Convention, the Temporality of these Shires be eased, it will not
extend to the Property, especially seing the Reason of the Act cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to them, for the Feuars of the Property did bear no Taxation till the
year 1592. and then there was a Commission granted for Retouring them,
and that Complaint of the high Retours of the Shires being then known,
these of the Property would doubtless endeavour to have easie Retours.
It was answered, that the Act of Convention expresly Regulating the Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
both as to the Spirituality and Temporality, it cannot be thought but
that these Members did comprehend the whole, and seing the Property can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be of the Spirituality, it must be of the Temporality, which hath the
abatement as to these Shires without exception, and albeit the Property
was lately Retoured, yet there being no Rule to estimate a Merk-land, or
Pound-lands Retour by, or how many Pounds of real Rent makes a Pound
of Retour, there could be no other Rule, but to make the Retour of the
Property proportional to the remainant Lands lying in that Shire, so that
where the other Lands are generally highly Retoured, it is evidently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
that the Property was so Retoured, and seing the Property did of old
pay no Taxation, it were strange now to make it bear more then the other
Temporal Lands about it.</p>

Minority and Lesion. It was alleadged for the Defender; <hi>First,</hi> No
Process, because prescription is past since the Right was granted by <hi>Isobel Keith,</hi>
which cannot be interrupted by the Reduction in <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. because it is
evident by inspection of the Reduction that it is but filled up of late and that
the Executions there of are new, so that it signifies no more nor blank Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or a blank Summonds till the Reasons be filled up and insisted in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which prescription was compleat. <hi>2dly.</hi> Absolvitor, because the Right
granted by <hi>Isobel Keith</hi> to her Husbands Brother, was to the Husbands
behove: Likeas there was a blank Bond granted by the Brother to the
Husband so declaring, and there being no other Contract of Marriage,
this Disposition must be understood as granted to the Husband in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the Marriage, and being but the Right of 10000. Merks,
which was but a competent Tocher, it was no Lesion to Dispone the same to
the Husband, or any to his behove, and offered to prove by the Brothers
Oath that there was such a back Bond, and that yet there is a back Bond by
him to whom the Brother Disponed. The Pursuer answered to the first,
that interruption is sufficient by any Act whereby the Party having Right,
may follow the same, so that Summonds (albeit not legally Execute)
would yet make an interruption, though no Sentence could follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
and a Summonds being blank, must be presumed as comprehending
all the Grounds and Reasons that might have been filled up therein, but
here the Lybelling of the Interest, which is not with new Ink, bears expresly
that the Pursuer as Heir to his Sister has good interest to Revock and
Reduce Deeds done by her to her prejudice, which doth imply the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Minority and Lesion. To the second, albeit the Disposition by the
Wife had been to the Husband, yet it is simply Reduceable upon
Minority, there being no remuneratory Obligation upon the part of the
Husband providing her to a Jointure, in which case if the Provision had
been suitable, there would have been no Lesion, and if not suitable, the
Lords might Reduce it in part, or Rectifie it if done in the Wifes Life,
but here she having nothing from the Husband, and being Dead she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now receive a Jointure, and so the Right is Reduceable in <hi>totum,</hi>
especially seing the said <hi>Iohn Forbes</hi> did violently carry away the said <hi>Iso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
Keith,</hi> and Married her without her Friends Consents, and must be
presumed by the same means to have purchased the same Disposition from
her without any remuneratory Provision to her. <hi>2dly,</hi> There is not, nor
cannot be known any such back Bond, and it were absurd that the
Husbands Brothers Oath alone should prove the same in favours of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Defender answered, that albeit there was no Jointure provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet the Law provides a Terce, which ofttimes is better nor the
Jointure. The Pursuer likewise answered, that the Law did provide the
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:55692:325"/>
                  <hi>jus mariti,</hi> and the courtesie, so that either Party ought either to acquiesce
in the provision of Law, or the Provision of Parties must be mutual.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the first Defense, especially in respect of the manner
of Libelling the Title, and found not the Executions of the first Summonds
to appear new, and therefore Sustained them, unless the Defender
would improve the same; they found also that alleadgeance, that the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
was to the Husbands behove, was not to be Sustained, especially seing
no back Bonds were produced, or offered to be proven, and that the
manner of Probation offered was no way sufficient, that there was no
Provision for the Wife.</p>

<hi>Blackwood</hi> who is Heir of Provision to the Major as procreat by <hi>Marion
Weir Blackwoods</hi> Daughter with <hi>William Lowry,</hi> hath no other Right but
as Heir of Provision to the Major, and yet he hath taken Infeftment
holding of the King; likeas the said <hi>William Lowry</hi> his Father as lawful
Administrator, and taking burden for him, has obliged himself by his Bond,
that so soon as the Marquess should obtain a Right to the Superiority, he
should take his Infeftment from him Waird, and by the Act of Parliament
1661. Ratifying the Act of Annexation 1633. It is expresly provided, that any

so that Major <hi>Ballantine</hi> having consented, by taking Infeftment in
manner foresaid, he and his Successors must continue the Dukes Vassals.
The Defender alleadged Absolvitor, because any Right the Duke has, or
the Marquesse had to the Superiority is absolutely null by the saids Acts
of Parliaments, annexing the Superiority of Kirk Lands to the Crown, so
that unless there had been a Dissolution in Parliament, no Right of these
Superiorities is valide, but null, and the exception of the said Act 1661.
is only in the case of the Vassals consenting to a Right of Superiority, <hi>Ita
est</hi> there can be no Right but <hi>legitimo modo</hi> by Dissolution. The Pursuer
answered; <hi>First,</hi> That albeit the King, or his Officers might quarrel his
Right as not proceeding upon Dissolution, or any other having their Right
upon Dissolution, yet the Defender cannot, especially seing he hath Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologat
the Pursuers Right, his Predecessors to whom he is Heir, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken Infeftment thereupon; likeas the Pursuer has satisfyed the Kings
Interest, by giving Bond to the Kings Advocat to hold the Lands Waird
of the King in the same way as the Defender would, therefore the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat
hath declared he will not concern himself. <hi>2dly,</hi> the Pursuer having
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:55692:326"/>
obtained a new Right of the King since the Act of Parliament 1661. the
same must be valide to him as to these Vassals who have, or shall consent,
because the exception of the Act expresly bears, that such a consent is
equivalent, as if the Vassal had Resigned in the Kings Hands in favour,
and for new Infeftment to the interposed Superior, and had then taken
a subaltern Right of him, against which there can be no pretence, so that
(by a Right in the exception) it cannot be meaned a perfect Right proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Dissolution, because that would be valide without the Vassals
consent, but that the Vassals consent being equivalent to a Resignation,
makes the Right valide without Dissolution.</p>
               <p>Which the Lords found Relevant, the Duke proving a sufficient consent,
but it was not Decided whether Major <hi>Ballantines</hi> taking Infeftment would

the Daughters, by which the Estate of <hi>Culgrain,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Archibalds</hi> Estate
are both settled in the Person of his Son, and the Overseers are obliged to
cause the Minors, and their Curators become obliged to relieve Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi>
of 17000. Merks. Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> Charges <hi>Fulwood</hi> upon the Contract, who Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
alleadging that the Clause can only import that he is lyable for his
own part, but not in solidum, seing the Clause bears not the Overseers to be
bound conjunctly and severally. It was answered, that the obligement is not
for payment of a Sum, which is divisible, but for doing a Fact which is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Minors being become bound to relieve, which is all one as if the
Overseers had been obliged to cause the Minors Subscribe a Bond of releif,
which could not divide, but would have obliged every one of them in soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,
It was answered, that the result of the obligation being releif of Sums
which are divisible, the obligation at least the Damnadge and Interest suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in place thereof ought to be devisible, for the obligation being <hi>factum
alienum</hi> imprestable to the Overseer, and the third Overseers that refuses to concur

In which Disposition there being not only a Procuratory of Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

the Disposition granted by umquhile <hi>Towy</hi> to the Pursuer his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was granted on Death-bed, at the least it was retained by the Defunct,
and never delivered till he was on Death-bed, and thereby it is null, and
cannot infer Recognition, because the Law upon just consideration that
Parties are presumed to be weak in their Minds, and easily wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after contracting of the Disease of which they Died, has incapacitat
them then to Dispone their Heretage, or to take it any way from their

on Death-bed, Recognition cannot be incurred, because it is not the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
but the Seising that alienats the Fee, and infers Recognition. The
Pursuer answered; <hi>First,</hi> That Death bed is only introduced in favours
of Heirs against other Persons getting Right but hath no effect against the
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:55692:327"/>
Superi or, who is not to consider whether the Vassal was sick or whole, but
whether he hath indeavoured to withdraw himself, and his Heirs in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture

way of exception, but by way of Reduction. <hi>3dlie,</hi> The Disposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in favours of the Disponers only Daughter, reserving his Liferent, albeit
it wants a Clause dispensing with the Delivery, it being Subscribed in

be's offers to prove that it was Delivered in <hi>leige poustie</hi> to the Lord <hi>Frazer</hi>
for the Pursuers use, so that albeit Seising had been taken when the Disponer
was on Death bed, Recognition must be incurred, because the Vassal should
not have granted a Precept of Seising, and Delivered the same without
Reservation, and the having of the Precept of Seising being always accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a sufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Warrand for taking of Seising, and that the Warrand was
given at the Delivery of the Precept, albeit the Seising was taken when the
Disponer was on Death-bed, yet the Warrand was granted when he was
in <hi>leige poustie,</hi> by the Precept, which bears in it self to be an irrevockable
Power and Warrand to take Seising, so that the Vassal had in his <hi>leige poustie</hi>
done <hi>quantum in se fuit,</hi> to alienat this Waird Fee.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that if the Disposition containing the Precept, was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

would infer Recognition, though the Seising were taken after his Sickness,
and found that if the Disposition and Seising were on Death-bed, it would
exclude Recognition by way of exception, Recognition not being a Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory,

whereby for the Encouragement of them that Inclose it, it is provided that
whatever part of the Park or inclosure falls upon the March, that part shall
be Built upon the equal Charges of both the Heretors. The Defender
alleadged Absolvitor, because the March betwixt the Earl of <hi>Crawfoord</hi> and

but of dry Marches, otherwise though there were a Water intersected, the

the exercise of all Crafts-men, so that these Websters Living within the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony

being general, and that it was a standing Law unrepelled, and that the
obligations of the Weavers Living there to pay a Duty for their Liberty of
Weaving, did preserve the Act in vigour, at least as to this Burgh. The
Defenders answered, that these Weavers being in no Incorporation, the Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets

the Heirs of Line being absolutely excluded by the first Disposition, they

of the Infeftment granted to the Son, as being posterior to his Debt, and

a <hi>Declarator,</hi> that the Infeftment granted by <hi>Masson</hi> to his Son (then an

as a fraudulent Deed by the Father in favours of his Son, the Father being then

Lands, and built thereupon, and gave an Infeftment of Annualrent to the

                  </hi> that
the Sons Right being publick, and Registrat in the publick Registers, prior
to the Pursuers Annualrent for the Bonds whereupon the same proceeds, it
doth fully exclude them from Poinding of that Ground. The Merchants
repeat their Declarator by way of reply: To which it was answered, that
whatsoever may be said of Latent and Clandestine Rights betwixt Fathers
and Children, and other confident Persons, yet there is no Law hindering a
Father to give an publick Infeftment to his Son, unlesse it be in prejudice of the
Creditors, to whom he was due Sums at that time, which being a valide
pubick Right, no Deed or pretence of fraud of the Father thereafter can
prejudge the Son in his Right, who being an Infant was not capable to be
partaker of fraud, neither can fraud be presumed as to Creditors, who are
but to Contract thereafter, nor can a publick Right Registrat, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Seising, which all the World may, and all Concerned ought to know,
be esteemed a contrivance or fradulent Right, and as to any Commerce
betwixt these Merchants and the Father, which began before the Sons Right, no
respect can be had thereto, because the Pursuers Bonds are lately for a Sum
of Money, and must import that the former Debts by Traffick were past
from or Discharged, and if need beis offered to prove that they were actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Discharged. <hi>2dly,</hi> The making up a Debt to be prior to take away
the Sons Infeftment, can only be probably by Writ or Oath of Party, and not
by Witnesses, who cannot prove above 100. Pounds. <hi>3dly,</hi> Though the
cause of the Bond were proven to be a Correspondence and Traffick begun
before the Sons Infeftment, it is no ways relevant against any Provisions gotten
after the Infeftment, for such can have effect but from their own Date,
and the effect is cut off as to what is posterior to this publick Infeftment,
seing the Merchants did either follow <hi>Massons</hi> Faith upon their hazards, or
else they should have had a Procurator here, and taken advice how they
might have been secured of <hi>Massons</hi> Estate by the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who
would have taken notice by the Registers, that <hi>Masson</hi> was denuded by a
publick Infeftment, which nothing he could do thereafter could prejudge,
and would have certified the Merchants thereof, and their failing therein is on
their own peril, and albeit their payment and acting <hi>bona fide</hi> is sometimes
good, though made to these who had not a valide, but a colourable Right
by these who knew not a better Right, and might have been compelled to
pay upon the colourable Right, yet other Deeds, though <hi>bona fide</hi> done,
are upon the peril of the Actor. To which it was answered, that by the
common Law and Custom of this Nation all fraudulent Deeds are Reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and there can be no Deed more fraudulent then this of a Father to his
own Infant Son, for whom he is legal Administrator, and must accept the
Right he gives himself, and so colludes with himself to make a snare to
intrap Merchants and Strangers in the midst of a course of Trade with them,
which is a common ground of Law, whether the Debt be prior or posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to the Sons Infeftment, and albeit the Merchants Bond be posterior, yet
seing it bears to be for Ware, Witnesses according to the ordinar custom,
are Receiveable for astructing the Writ, to prove what the Ware was, and
when Received, which will not be prejudged, though there had been a
Discharge of the Ware granted the time of the Bond, unlesse there had been
a real and true payment of the Money, for there being nothing then payed,
this Bond ceases not to have a true anterior Cause, as if it had been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:55692:329"/>
on Death-bed upon a Discharge then given, it would be valide, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon an anterior Cause before the Sicknesse, neither is there any difference
to be made of the Parts of the Traffick after the Sons Infeftment, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Correspondence began before, and is once continued as a constant
Correspondence and Traffick, it must all be drawn back to its beginning, as
if the Merchants on both sides had Contracted when they began their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence,

Confirms himself Executor Creditor to Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and alleadges that
he ought to be preferred, because the Assignation made to <hi>Iohn Hume</hi>
was an uncompleat Right, wanting Intimation, so that the Sum remained
<hi>in bonis</hi> of Mr. <hi>Thomas Ridpeth,</hi> and that he had followed the only legal way
to affect it, by Confirming himself Executor Creditor to Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and
albeit the Assigney may force any other Executor to pay to him, yet not
an Executor Creditor, who is Executor to his own behove for satisfying his

a special Assignation, albeit it cannot have Execution by Horning, yet it
is the undoubted ground of an Action, even after the Defuncts Death,
against the Debitor, and no Executor Creditor can have Right

               <p>THe Duke of <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> insisted in his Declarator against the Laird
of <hi>Blackwood,</hi> for declaring that he had Right to his Superiority by
the Act of Parliament 1661. bearing, <hi>That whosoever should get Right from
the King to the Superiority of the annexed Kirk Lands, the same should be valide as

<hi>Ballantine,</hi> to whom <hi>Blackwood</hi> is Heir, had taken an Infeftment of the
Estate of <hi>Blackwood,</hi> from the Marquess of <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> upon <hi>Blackwoods</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,
and upon the Resignation of two Apprizers, in <hi>Anno</hi> 164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Marquesse then having a Right to the Superiority, granted by the King
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. Which albeit it was not then valide, because the Lands
were then annexed to the Crown, by the Act of Parliament 1633. and
were not Dissolved; yet the Major having taken Infeftment as to his part,
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:55692:330"/>
his Heirs could not quarrel the Superiority, though the King might; and
now the King and Parliament by the Act 1661. having declared such
Rights of Superiority valide as to these Vassals who had, or should Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and the Duke having gotten a new Right of the Superiority since
the Act, the former Consent is valide; Likeas <hi>William Lowry Blackwoods</hi>
Father and Tutor gave a Bond, that so soon as the Duke should obtain the
Superiority, the Son should become Vassal. The Defender alleadged that
his Fathers Bond was only effectual against his Father, but not against
himself, and his Father never being Feear of the Estate, his Bond could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be a Consent of the Vassal, neither can the Consent of any Tutor, or
lawful Administrator be sufficient to give such a Consent, which is not an Act
of Office or Administration; and as to the Infeftment taken by Major <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantine,
First,</hi> The simple taking of Infeftmen from a Lord of Erection by
the Vassals of Kirk-lands, cannot import their passing from the King, and
the benefit of the Act of Annexation, so that they may not return to the
King thereafter, neither can it be such a Consent as it is meant in this
Act of Parliament, otherwise the King and the Leidges should both losse the
benefit of the Annexation, seing most part of the Vassals have continued to
take Infeftment of the Lords of Erection, through ignorance or inadvertance,
finding their Infeftments flowing from the Lords of Erection, and in respect
that the Lords of Erection have still Right to the Feu-duties till they be
Redeemed, which being a common Error that they may safely so do till
the Redemption, and yet may still take Infeftment from the King when
they please, it were a very evil consequence, if thereupon they should not only
lose the benefit to be Vassals to the King, but by disclamation lose the Property.
<hi>2dly,</hi> As to this case it cannot be presumed, but Major <hi>Ballantine</hi> is in the same
case with other Vassals of Kirk-lands, and also in this much better case, that
he is in a manifest and palpable Error, in so far as the Disposition that he
takes from the Apprizers, bears expresly that the Apprizers are informed
that the Marquess of <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> was Superior, and their Procuratory bears
warrand, either to Resign in the Kings hands, or the Marquess hands,
or in the hands of any other lawful Superior, and <hi>Blackwoods</hi> Procurato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in
the Contract of Marriage, bears warrand to Resign in the hands of the
King, the Marquess of <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> or the Earl of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> who had Right
of Erection before the Marquess or any other lawful Superior, so that by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
in the Marquess hand, it is evident that the Resigner and the Major
believed that the Marquess was Superior, whereas he was not, any Right
he then had being absolutely null by the Act of Annexation, 1633. and the
King was the only Superior; yea, by the taking of that Infeftment he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
disclamation, unless it were excused by his error, but the Consent
requisit here must be such, as the Party knowing the King was his Superior,
did choose to interject another Superior, and become his perpetual Vassal.
It was answered for the Pursuer, that the acceptance of the Infeftment as
it is now stated can be no Error, because it is evidenced by the Apprizers
Rights now produced, that they hold of the King, and were Infeft by him,
and yet the Major took the Infeftment upon their Resignation in the Dukes
hands; likeas the Rights produced relate to the Right of Annexation, which
being a most publick Law, and recent at that time, cannot be thought but
to be known to any at that time, <hi>&amp; ignorantia juris neminem excusat.</hi> It
was answered, that the Error was the greater that the Apprizers Infeftment
was holden of the King, seing in their Disposition and Procuratory they
mention they were informed the Marquess was Superior, and therefore the
Procuratory is to Resign in the hands of the King, the Marquess or any
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:55692:330"/>
other lawful Superior, and the other Procuratory is in the like Terms, so
that the Accepter of the Writs did not intend, nor do any new or free Deed
in favours of the Marquess, but did only that Deed that they supposed was
necessar, and so did not by this Infeftment make the Marquess Superior,
as that his Right should be valide by their Consent, but did take the Right
from the Marquess, as being Superior before they took it, which was an pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
Error, so prejudicial to them that it might infer disclamation, if it
were not excusable upon Error, and if it had been intended that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
minded to make the Marquess his Superior, where he was not, there is
no doubt but it would have been exprest in the Right it self, being so
great a deference to the Marquess, and would not have been past over in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Form; neither can it be thought that this was procured by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
upon accompt and favouring the Major, the Infeftment being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Lady Marquess, as her sons Commissioner, he being then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and having no great influence then being the time of the Troubles of the
Countrey. It was answered, that the other Vassals of that Barony did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarly
Accept the Marquess as their Superior, and gave Bonds for that
purpose, which are produced, and it is most like that <hi>Blackwood</hi> hath given
Bond, which hath been lost or given up to him upon taking this Infeftment,
which is an implement thereof.</p>
               <p>The Lords did not see that the single taking of the Infeftment from a Lord
of the Erection, did import his Consent to become Vassal thereby for ever,
or that he might not thereafter return to the King, neither did they find such
a Consent as is meant in the Act of Parliament, but considering the whole
Circumstances of this Case, and especially the Fathers clear Bond, who procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and settled the Controverted Right of this Estate for his Son, then an
Infant, they found there was no Error, but a choise of the Marquess to be
Superior in place of the King, and therefore declared.</p>

               <p>It was alleadged for Captain <hi>Barclay,</hi> that the saids VVitnesses could

by the Decreet of Certification, which now is Extracted, and albeit
the Lords did before Examine Captain <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Steel,</hi> yet the Process
was then depending, and the Certification not Extracted. <hi>2dly,</hi> It was
alleadged that <hi>Rosse</hi> and <hi>Fergusson</hi> were not <hi>habile</hi> VVitnesses, having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:55692:331"/>
most partial upon the Pursuers part, having stayed a long time

had declared what they would depone, but that they had set the samine
under their hands, and that by their said Subscription they acknowledged
themselves accessory to the Forgery, and so by their confession they are <hi>socij
criminis,</hi> and being culpable of so great a Crime are infamous, and their
Testimonies can make no Faith against any but themselves. It was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Pursuer, that Improbations (even civilly intented) are not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
determined by the Certification, which is of its own nature but an Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
Sentence, and if the Pursuer should notwithstanding thereof find out, and
produce the Principal Writ, he might proceed to the Improving thereof,
it being very well consistent, that it might be holden, and repute false by
the Certification, and might also be proven to be false; and though the
Pursuer could not produce the Writ, yet the Process is not wholly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the Certification, but it may be justly desired that all evidences
of the Forgery that were possible, without production of the Writ,
might be taken to remain <hi>in retentis,</hi> in case the Principal should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be found, for there might be clandestine Assignations of the
Writs made by <hi>Barclay,</hi> and Intimat at the Pursuers Dwelling-house, or
Forged and Antedated Intimations made up, so that the Certification would
not be effectual against the Assigney's, and though Parties should not insist,
the Kings Advocat who is also Pursuer of the Process might insist, that
the VVitnesses might be Examined, for detecting of the Forgery; and there
could be no case more favourable then this, wherein Captain <hi>Barclay</hi> had
Judicially produced the VVrits, and now wilfully refuses to produce the
same, and if Forgers shall escape, and be in no more hazard, but suffer
Certification, though they have burnt, or wilfully keep up the VVrits, it
will be an open Door to encourage all Forgerers, neither have the VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
betrayed their Testimonies, albeit being Examined by the Lord <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
a Nobleman in the Countrey, one of them did Subscribe, who had
just ground to think that it was no voluntar Deed, but that the Lord
<hi>Fivy</hi> might have sufficient Authority for that effect; but whatever objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were against VVitnesses, they are ever Received in Improbations, and
the Lords at Advising of the Cause do consider what their Testimonies may work,
at which time only it will be proper to object.</p>

up to Subscribe VVitness to a VVrit, but told him not about what it was,
nor did not let him hear nor see what was written therein, but rolled it up,
and presented only to him the white paper, near about the end of the VVrit,
and desired him to Subscribe VVitness, and he saying that he could not
be VVitness, because he saw no body Subscribe, the Captain answered,
that that was nothing to him, and that he should stand betwixt him and
all danger, and that he would be loath to bid him do any thing would
do him harm, whereupon he did Subscribe as VVitness, and saw not the
Tutor Subscribe at all, nor saw not his Name put to the VVrit at that
time, and that this was not at the Barns of <hi>Towy,</hi> the time of the Lairds
Death, as the Date of the Paper bears, but at <hi>Achready</hi> five weeks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

               <head>The Creditors of Cowper and Balmerino contra My Lady Cowper.
November 25. 1669.</head>
               <p>THe Deceast Lord <hi>Cowper</hi> having made a Disposition of his whole Estate
in Fee to his Lady, and thereby having excluded the Lord <hi>Balmeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
his appearand Heir therein, <hi>Balmerino</hi> being unwillingly to Enter Heir
to <hi>Cowper,</hi> before he knew whether the Disposition would stand or not,
moves some of <hi>Cowpers</hi> Creditors, and some of his own Creditors having
Charged him to Enter Heir to <hi>Cowper,</hi> to insist in the Reduction of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
made to the Lady, as being done by <hi>Cowper, in lecto agritudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
It was alleadged for the Lady no Process, at the Creditors of <hi>Cowpers</hi>
Instance: <hi>First,</hi> Because they insist only upon Personal Bonds, granted
by the Lord <hi>Cowper,</hi> and have no real Right to the Land, and so cannot
Reduce a real Right, but upon a real Right: So till they have Apprized
the Lands they have no Interest. <hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit <hi>Cowpers</hi> Creditors might Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Disposition, as betwixt conjunct Persons, without an onerous
Cause, yet not upon the Reason, <hi>ex lecto,</hi> because that is a priviledge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
competent to Heirs, but not to Creditors, as they are Creditors,
unless by real Diligences, they state themselves in place of the Heir, and so
make use of his Right and Priviledge. It was answered for the Pursuers,
that in that they were Creditors, they had sufficient interest to crave it to
be declared, that the Estate of <hi>Cowper</hi> should be Affected with Apprizings
upon <hi>Cowpers</hi> Debts due to them, notwithstanding this Disposition, which
is all the Effect of this Reduction; and as they may, without any real Right,
Reduce, or Declare as aforesaid upon the Act of Parliament 1621. against
fraudulent Dispositions, so they may declare that any Disposition done on
Death-bed, as it could not prejudge the Heir, so it cannot prejudge the
Creditors of the Defunct, or his appearand Heir, but that they may affect
the said Estate, with their Legal Diligences. It was answered for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
that she repeats the former Defense. And further alleadges, that
she is content to take off the interest of <hi>Cowpers</hi> own Creditors, and to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that the Disposition shall be burdened with their Debts: but adhered
to her Defense against <hi>Balmerino</hi>'s Creditors, who, though they produce an
Apprizing, yet it is posterior to the Summons, and their Personal Debts
can be no sufficient Title, nor is there any produced. It was answered for
<hi>Cowpers</hi> Creditors, that the Declarator in their favours was no way suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
nor would not give them a real Right, nor prevent the Diligence
of other Creditors. <hi>2dly,</hi> If they had a good interest to Reduce, and thereupon
to Apprize, no offer could take away that interest but payment.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Creditors had sufficient Interest upon their Personal
Bonds to insist upon the Reduction, <hi>ex capite lecti;</hi> but they found that a real
Security given to <hi>Cowpers</hi> Creditors, equivalent to an Apprizing, and Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was sufficient to exclude their Interest.</p>

and <hi>Gourmyre,</hi> and in a Miln, and having left two Daughters Heirs
portioners, the younger having Married <hi>Monteith</hi> of <hi>Carrubber</hi> being
dead, her Son and Heir raised a Brief of Division against the eldest Sister,
whereupon Division was made in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> The Rent of the Miln
being Rated at a 100. pound the Chalder, being more than the Rent of the
Land, the whole Land was set on the one part, and the Miln on the other,
and because the Mansion-House belonged to the eldest Sister, the Land
was Adjudged to her, and the Miln Adjudged to the other, and the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
of the Rent of the Miln allowed, in satisfaction of the youngest Sisters
Interest in the House. <hi>Carrubber</hi> raises Reduction of this Division, upon these
Reasons: <hi>First,</hi> That the Lands ought to have been divided in two shares,
and the House likewise, having convenient Rooms and Lodgings for both
Families, in which they have Dwelt these 20. years, and not to have Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
the Miln only to him, stating the Victual, being only Meal, at a
100. pound the Chalder, far above the just value; and stating the Miln-Rent
equivalent to the Land-Rent, which is subject to many more Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Expenses in upholding the Miln, and difficulties in recovering
the Rent; and in the common estimation, is not accounted equivalent to
Land Rent; so that he is enormly les'd, and offered a 1000 merks to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi>
the eldest Daughter, to exchange shares, albeit the Rent of either
share be but about three Chalders of Victual. The Defender answered,
that the Reasons of Reduction were no way Relevant, because all Divisions
ought to proceed, as is most convenient for either Party, and where least
is left undivided<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Division it self cannot have a precise Rule, but
is <hi>in arbitrio</hi> of the Inquest, who were knowing Gentlemen of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and upon Oath; so that unless the Lesion were <hi>ultra dimidium justi
valoris,</hi> it cannot be recalled, seing an Inquest has the irrecoverable deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Life and Death, which is of far greater moment than this, and
this Division proceeded upon <hi>Carrubbers</hi> own Process, and the Inquest was
called by himself. And albeit it be true, that if the Division could have
been made, by giving both a share of the Lands, and a share of the Milns,
if there had been more Milns, it might have been more equal; but here, if
the Land had been Divided, the Miln behoved to have remained for ever
Common, and so the Division not be compleat. Likeas, the Miln lies at
a distance from the Land, and near to <hi>Carrubbers</hi> own Land, and is not a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Rent, arising from free Multures, but has the whole Barrony of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phichen</hi>
astricted by Infeftment; and the Defender is willing to give 2500.
merks for each Chalder of the Miln Rent, which is the ordinary rate of
Land Rent; and the reason why there was no Cavel, or Lot, was
because the eldest Sister falling the Mansion House by Law, she behoved to
have the Land therewith.</p>
               <p>The Lords Sustained the Reasons, and Ordained a new Commission for a
new Division; here the Lords would not consider the Points severally, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Mansion House ought to have been Adjudged to the eldest Sister,
and a Recompence to the second: Or whether such a House, being no
Tower nor Fortalice, but which would be comprehended as a Pertinent of
the Land, gave no preference; so that Lots ought to have been cast upon
the Division: Or whether the House could be divided, <hi>per contignaliones:</hi>
Or whether the Miln, though it had been truly Rated, could have been put
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:55692:333"/>

<hi>First,</hi> That the Doctors Gift is simulat to the Rebels behove, and
so accresced to the Pursuer, which appears from these Evidences; <hi>First,</hi>
That the Doctor is the Rebels own Son. <hi>2dly,</hi> That it is <hi>retenta possessione,</hi>
the Doctor having suffered his Father to possess for many years. <hi>3dly,</hi> It
was offered to be proven, <hi>per membra curiae</hi> of the Exchequer, that the Gift

to be proven by the Doctors, and his Fathers Oath <hi>conjunctim,</hi> that he
had given a Back-bond, declaring the Gift to be to his Fathers behove.
It was answered for the Doctor, to the first, that the Grounds of Simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were no way Relevant; for albeit he was the Rebels Son, yet he
had means of his own, and was not in his Family; and albeit he were not
eager, to put his Father out of Possession of his House and Lands: yet his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of Possession is not Relevant, unless it had been to his death, or for a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
time: but any delay that was, is because it is but of late, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
hath obtained special Declarator, till which, he was not in capacity
to discontinue his Fathers Possession: Neither can Members of Court be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

that he being satisfied of the Debts due to him, and the Expences thereof,
there should be place for the Rebels Creditors, and did make Faith at the

being by Law become void, and the Superiours Right of Recognition revived,
the Vassal did not after that time crave the Superiours Confirmation as
Heir: so he Laird of <hi>Geight</hi> having never sought Confirmation from the King
since His Restauration; it is no less contempt, than if since the Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration
he had Alienat, especially seing the King refuses Confirmation to
none who demand it. It was answered for the Purchasers, that the Vassal
being Denuded in their favour, according to the Law standing for the time,
his fault cannot lose their Right; for though he should collude against them,
yet that ought not to prejudge them, and there being no obliegment upon
the Vassal to seek a Confirmation, to the behove of the Purchasers, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be prejudged, for not obtaining the same. The Pursuer answered, that
the Purchasers might have craved the Kings Confirmation of their Right,

both for themselves, and in name of <hi>Geight</hi> the immediat Vassal, which <hi>Geight</hi>

Heirs not being exprest, this Substitution cannot extend to them, because,
though ordinarly Heirs are comprehended, though not exprest, <hi>qui acquirit

whereby it may be rationally conjectured, the mind of the Defunct was, that he

Heirs have never place. It was answered, that Institutions and Substituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Institute succeed, the Substitute has never place as Heir to the Institute,
but the Institutes Heirs whatsomever, which failing, the Institute is there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret

and comprehended, because in Tailzies and Provisions, there uses
never to be an Institution or Substitution of a single person, without the Heirs
of their Body. And though there be some singular Cases, in which Heirs
not being exprest, are not comprehended, this is none of them. It was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

so cannot demand the Provision made to the other Bairns, for if there had

and the Pursuers can be in no better Case than he. It was answered, that
in Contracts of Marriage, the meaning of the Parties is chiefly to be respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which has been, that in case there were an Heir-male, or Son of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
this Sum should belong to the remanent Bairns, and therefore it is
conceived under the name of Heir in the singular number, and being introduced
in favours of the Daughters, it ought not to be interpret against them, but that
they may renunce to be Heirs, and be satisfied with this Provision only;
otherwise they may be absolutely excluded, the Fathers Estate being appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

taken before warning time, or after, seing the Law gives <hi>locum penitentiae,</hi> or
some small time, which must take place in either case. <hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit the
Charger had not been obliged to accept the over-giving, yet <hi>de facto,</hi> she
has accepted it, because it is offered to be proven, that she set the House
to another, and took Earnest thereupon, which did import that she quite
the first Bargain, seing at once she could not set it to two. <hi>3dly,</hi> Albeit
offer was made of the Keys at the Term, yet it is offered to be proven,
that the House was not void, but that the former Tennents Goods remained
therein.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the first Reason of Suspension, upon the over-giving
but found that Member Relevant, that the House being given over, the
same was set to another, and earnest taken therupon; but found that Point,

               <p>MR. <hi>Laurence Charters,</hi> as Executor Confirmed to Mr. <hi>Iohn Charters</hi>
Minister of <hi>Currie</hi> his Father pursues the Parochioners for 1000.
Pound for the Melioration of the Manse of <hi>Currie,</hi> conform to the <hi>Act</hi> of
<hi>Parliament,</hi> 1661. which is drawn back to the Rescinded <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
1649. It was alleadged by the Parochioners, Absolvitor. <hi>First,</hi> Because
the Meliorations of the Manse were long before any of these <hi>Acts,</hi> which do
only relate to Meliorations to be made thereafter; and for any thing done
before <hi>adificium solo cedit,</hi> and it must be presumed to be done by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

expect satisfaction. <hi>2dly,</hi> Several of the Defenders are singular Successors, and
so are not lyable for Reparations done before they were Heretors. The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
answered, that albeit these Reparations were done before the year 1649.
yet there being subsequent <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> obliging the Heretors to make
the Manses worth 1000. pounds, if these former Reparations had not been
made, the Heretors of this Paroch would have been necessitate to make up the
same, and so <hi>in quantum sunt lucrati tenentur. 2dly,</hi> The saids <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
contained two Points, one is, that whereas the intrant Minister payed
to his Predecessor 500. merks for the Manse, and his Executors were to
receive the same from his Successor; the saids <hi>Acts</hi> ordained the Heretors
to free the Successor, as to which the present Heretors can have no pretence,

the intrusted Persons, long after the Pursuers Inhibition and Appryzing, the
same ought to be Reduced. It was alleadged for the Creditors Defenders,
that the reason, as it is qualified, is no ways Relevant against them. <hi>First,</hi>
Because the Disposition granted to <hi>Dunlap</hi> and <hi>Pitcon,</hi> being of the whole
Lands, and they Infest accordingly, being long before the Pursuers Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Appryzing; and the said Disposition and Infeftment, being to the

posterior, <hi>nihil referi:</hi> And whereas it is alleadged, that their Names and
Sums are filled up in the blank, after the Inhibition and Appryzing with
another hand, and so must be presumed of another date. It is answered,
that the Subscription at the Foot and Body of a Writ, did necessarly infer,
that the whole blanks were then filled up, unless the contrary be proven,
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:55692:336"/>
neither uses the Names of fillers up of blanks to be exprest, and it cannot
be presumed, that any man in prudence would subscribe a blank Writ, till
the blanks were first filled up. <hi>2dly,</hi> Though it could be proven that the
blank was filled up after the Inhibition, yet the general Terms of the Clause
being insert, <hi>a principio,</hi> with the same hand, <hi>viz.</hi> for satisfaction of the said

no other. The Pursuer answered, that there being here pregnant Evidences
of Fraud, by interposing intrusted persons, and preferring of some Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to others by the Debitor, who was <hi>Insolvent,</hi> and had no more Estate,
in that case the filling up of the blanks must be presumed fraudulent and

otherwise it opens a Door to all <hi>Insolvent</hi> Persons in this manner, to

unless it had been in favours of the Disponers Creditors generally, or

the Inhibition they, have no place: And as for any verbal Communing or
Agreement, it cannot be effectual, until it be redacted into Write, which
was not till after the Inhibition.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the blank being filled up with another hand, and
so substantial a Clause, and the Writer not being exprest at the foot, that it
was to be presumed, to be posterior to the Inhibition, unless the Creditors
prove by the Witnesses insert, or others above exception, that it was truly

thereupon by the Captain, but had given them back to him.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter, the Pursuer craved, that now, seing there was
sufficient Probation of the Forgery of the Writs, and that the Lords had
produced before them a just double of the Disposition, presented to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
that therefore the Lords would proceed to improve the same, and
to declare that the same were false, and Forged by the Captain, and that
they would remit him to the Justice General, according to the ordinary Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
in Improbations. It was answered for the Defender, that the Lords could
not proceed to improve the Writs, because the Writs were not produced,
and never any Writ in <hi>Scotland</hi> was improven, but when the principal Writ
it self was produced; neither can it otherwise be, for Improbation before
the Lords, being <hi>ad effectum civilem,</hi> to take away the Writ, and Right
therein, the same behoved alwayes to proceed upon a particular and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Writ, which therefore behoved to be produced before the Lords and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
for suppose it could be prove that a Write of such a date, and such
a Tenor, was Fabricat, and Forged at such a time and place, which might
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er a Crime against the Forgers; yet it could not take away all right by
such a Writ, because there might be several Writs of the same Date; and
the making up and improving of a false Writ of such a Date, could not
take away the true Writ of the same Date, unless the principal Writ it self
had been produced, that the Judges and Witnesses might know that that was
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:55692:338"/>
the very Writ in question. And therefore our Custom hath settled and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon this Remeid, by allowing a Certification, that if the Writs called
for to be Improven, were not produced, they should be holden and repute
as false and feinzied, and should make no Faith: but did not find them
proven to be Forged and Feinzied: but only to make no Faith, as if they
had been fenzied, which in this Process has been done, and the Lords have
neither Law nor Custom to do any further. <hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit the Witnesses
have by their own Testimonies declared themselves to be Forgers of false
Writs, their Testimonies cannot prove that Captain <hi>Barclay</hi> was either Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
or accessory to their Forgery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they are <hi>socij criminis,</hi> and
have by their Testimony made themselves infamous, as Falsers; and so there
is no Faith to be given to their Testimonies, against any other but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
Besides, they have given partial Counsel to the Pursuer, and
have betrayed their Testimonies, by voluntarly coming to them, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they would Depone; and therefore the Lords can neither Improve
the Writs, nor Remit Captain <hi>Barclay</hi> to the Justice, as a Falser. The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
answered, that albeit the ordinar Course in Improbations, be only
Certification, when the Writs are not produced: yet there is nothing to
hinder the Lords to use extraordinary Remeids, in extraordinary Cases; and
there can be no Case more extraordinar than this, where there is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Tract of Forgery, for taking away a considerable Estate of sixscore
Chalders of Victual Improven by the very Witnesses insert, and that the
Writs have not been produced. It is the Defenders own fault, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to be false, wilfully Abstracts the same, and it will be a very great
incouragement to Forgery, if the Forger knew that all his hazard will be,
to suffer Certification, if his Forgery take not; Neither were ever Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in Improbation of Writs, exclude in the Civil Process, as being <hi>socij
criminis:</hi> But if they acknowledge the Forgery thereof, they were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
though they themselves were accessory to the Forgery, otherwise
if Witnesses can be induced to Subscribe as Witnesses to a forged Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there were no possibility of Remeid, seing it cannot be thought,
they would suffer any other to be present, or that the Forger himself would
consess.</p>
               <p>The Lords refused to proceed to Improve the Writs, not being produced,
or to Remit the Parties to the Justice: But they did Declare, that by the
Processes, they found <hi>Steil, Ross,</hi> and <hi>Ferguson,</hi> the Witnesses to be guilty
of Forgery, by their own Confession; and that they found Captain <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi>
had made use of the VVrits, acknowledged to have been Forged, and
therefore ordained these of their number, that were upon the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,

Censure they saw just to be Inflicted: and it was the privat opinion of most
of the Lords, that at least the Witnesses, and <hi>Barclay</hi> himself should be banished:
But they found it not proper for them to express their opinion; or prelimit
the Council. But withal, the Lords found the Probation adduced, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to Declare Captain <hi>Barclay</hi> and the VVitnesses infamous, and did Declare
them such accordingly.</p>

had uplifted the like Sum of his from Mr. <hi>Roger Mowat,</hi> and that my Lord
<hi>Kinghorn</hi> being Debitor to <hi>Keith</hi> in considerable Sums of Money, payed to

might lawfully have filled up the Sum in the Bond, for Repayment of <hi>Pittar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
whose Money he had uplifted, and any Friend of his had done my Lord
<hi>Kinghorn</hi> no wrong, seing thereby he would be exonered of the like Sum

Oath in Process Depones that he heard that umquhil <hi>Alexander Keith,</hi> on
his Death-bed Declared, that <hi>Kinghorn</hi> was Debitor to him in nine thousand
merks: and therefore he thought it no fault to fill up the blank in this Bond.
It was answered for <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> that albeit umquhil <hi>Alexander Keith</hi> was
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:55692:340"/>
trusted by the umquhil Earl of <hi>Kinghorn</hi> with this blank Bond, that Trust
being meerly personal to him. It was a most unwarrantable trinkating for
any other after his Death, to fill up the Bond, especially seing neither by
Testament, nor any other Writ umquhil <hi>Alexander Keith,</hi> who only was
intrusted, and who lived many years after, and was no ways surprised with
Death, did signifie that the Money was borrowed from <hi>Pittarro,</hi> or taken
from any of his Creditors and applyed to <hi>Kinghorn</hi>'s use, and the hear-say

its known that hardly the half will be recovered, whereby <hi>Cheisly</hi>

nothing, but less than nothing, by being obliged to make up the half, though
so much were not recovered of the whole. <hi>2dly,</hi> All the pretence of the Plea
against <hi>Glasgow</hi> could never amount to 3850. <hi>Merks,</hi> yet the Bond is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

ever keep the Process and Assignation, and did transact the Plea, or a great
part thereof with the Magistrats of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and got payment. In this pursuit there
was no Compearance for <hi>Cheisly,</hi> but it was alleadged for <hi>David Thomson,</hi>
that whatever had past betwixt <hi>Cheisly</hi> and <hi>Scot,</hi> no ground of Circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<hi>particeps fraudis, Cheislies</hi> Fraud or Circumvention cannot prejudge
him, for albeit Extortion <hi>vi majori</hi> be <hi>vitium reale,</hi> that follows the

               <p>It was answered for <hi>Scot,</hi> that albeit it be true that an Assigney for an

consequently by no Circumvention probable by his Oath; yet in Personal
Rights an Assigney is in no better case then the Cedent, <hi>nisi quoad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
probandi,</hi> but what is relevant against the Cedent, and competent to be
proven, either by Writ or Witnesses is competent against the Assigney, so
that the Circumvention against <hi>Cheisly</hi> being inferred by pregnant Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
and Witnesses, and not by his Oath, it must be effectual against
<hi>Thomson,</hi> whose Name being filled up by <hi>Cheisly,</hi> is in effect <hi>Cheislies</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signey,
for so all blank Bonds are commonly found by the Lords to have the
same effect with an Assignation. <hi>2dly,</hi> Assignies without an Onerous Cause,
even as to the Oath of the Cedent, or any other consideration are in no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
case nor the Cedent; but here there is no Onerous Cause appears,
for which <hi>Cheisly</hi> transmits this Right to <hi>Thomson,</hi> for the Bond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that for Sums of Money due by <hi>Cheisly</hi> to <hi>Thomson,</hi> or any other Cause One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
on <hi>Thomsons</hi> part, that <hi>Scot</hi> should be obliged at <hi>Cheislies</hi> desire to
pay <hi>Thomson,</hi> but only that because <hi>Cheisly</hi> had Assigned a Process to <hi>Scot,</hi>
therefore <hi>Scot</hi> becomes obliged to pay to <hi>Thomson. 3dly,</hi> As there is no
Cause Onerous instructed on <hi>Thomsons</hi> part, so his own Oath <hi>de calumnia</hi>
being taken, renders the matter most suspitious, by which he acknowledges
he got the Bond from <hi>Cheisly,</hi> and that <hi>Cheisly</hi> was not then his Debitor for
so great a Sum as in the Bond, but that by payments made to him, and
for him, thereafter he became his Debitor in an equivalent Sum, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones
that he hath nothing to instruct the Debt, nor no Note thereof in
his Compt Book, though he be an exact Merchant and Factor, so that there
is no Evidence or Adminicle of an Onerous Cause instructed. And lastly,
Albeit Parties getting blank Bonds bearing borrowed Money from the blank
Person, whosoevers Name is filled up, the Bond then bears the Sums bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from him whose Name is filled up, and cannot be taken away but by
his Writ or his Oath, but this Bond bears only a Process Assigned by <hi>Cheisly,</hi>
and no borrowed Money, or other Cause by <hi>Thomson,</hi> and <hi>Thomson</hi> living
in the same Town with <hi>Scot</hi> whom he knew, and is commonly known to
be a simple Person, and <hi>Cheisly</hi> a subdolous, he ought before accepting of
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:55692:341"/>
the Bond to have acquainted <hi>Scot</hi> of the filling up of his Name, and if
he had any thing to say, and cannot now pretend that he acted <hi>bona

               </p>
               <p>The Lords found that having considered the Tenor of the Bond, and
<hi>Thomsons</hi> Oath, <hi>Thomson</hi> was in the same condition as to the relevancy
and probation of the Reasons of Circumvention against <hi>Cheisly,</hi> and
therefore found the Libel Relevant against them both to annul the

Fault, that he had put in to <hi>Dundee,</hi> and so he and the Owners were
found lyable for the damnage and interest of the Merchants, and that the
Merchants should be only obliged to take back that Part of the Victual
that was unspoiled, and the Owners should be lyable for the Price of the
whole as it would have given at <hi>Leith,</hi> if the Skipper had keeped his
Course, deducing the Price of the sufficient Victual as it now gives, and
a Commission being granted to certain Persons in <hi>Dundee</hi> to visit the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,

be lyable for the damnage that was done before the Advertisement given to
the Merchant, or for the damnage that ensued thereafter, because the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

would have been very litle, and so the question was, whether the Owners

have offered it to the Merchant, or if the offer in general to the Merchant
to receive the Victual was sufficient, though he did not desire them to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat

               <p>The Lords found that seing the damnage had fallen after, and through

separat the wet from the dry, and to have used diligence to prevent fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

whether the Skipper and Owners were obliged to take the spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

or if the Merchant was obliged to take it, and the Owners to make

enter him in the Possession at Whitsunday 1656. The Earl having Sold
the Lands to Sir <hi>Iohn Drummond,</hi> whose entry was to be at Whitsunday
1668. and having used an order of Redemption in the Earls Name, because
the Reversion did not extend to the Earls Assignies, and having obtained
Declarator, Decerning <hi>Achtertire</hi> to denude himself of the Lands, who in
obedience of the Decreet grants a Renunciation, Reserving to himself the
Mails and Duties for the Cropt and year 1667. <hi>Achtertire</hi> insists for
the Duties of the Cropt 1667. which are payable at Martimess
1667. The way of payment of the Rent of those Lands, and many
others being, that the Tennent enters at Whitsunday, and payes his Rent at
Martimess thereafter for the whole year; and if he remove at the next
Whitsunday, he payes no Rent at that Term, but leaves his Corns Sowen by
him upon the Ground, which he Shears after his removal. Whereupon it
was alleadged by Sir <hi>Iohn Drummond,</hi> that this way of payment being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
Duty, whereby the Tennent payes at Martimess before he Sowes
the Cropt, for the Cropt of the year of God subsequent to the Martimess,
that therefore Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> entering at Whitsunday 1668. and having Right to
the <hi>Duties</hi> due for the Cropt and year 1668. he has Right to the <hi>Duties</hi>
due at Martimess 1667. because that Duty albeit not payable in the year
1668. yet is payable for the Cropt 1668. seing the Tennent if he were
removing at Whitsunday 1668. would for the payment made at Martimess
1667. carry free with him without any payment, the whole Corns of the
Cropt 1668. so that if Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> should enter to the void Possession of the Land
at Whitsunday 1668. he should have no benefit of the Cropt 1668. but
only of the Cropt 1669. It was answered for <hi>Achtertire,</hi> that he has the
only Right to the Rent payable at Martimess 1667. and Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> can have
no Right thereto, because his entry being but at Whitsunday 1668. he can
have no Interest in the Cropt then Sown, and standing on the Ground,
unto which no Buyer did ever pretend, but the Seller if he be in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Possession, takes always with him his own growing Cropt, even after
the Buyers enters into Possession, and so do all outgoing Tennents, and
so did <hi>Achtertire</hi> at his entry, which being at Whitsunday 1656. he lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Duties due at Martimess thereafter, but lifted not the Martimess
Duty of the Cropt 1655. payable before his Wodset, and therefore now
he must lift the Rent due at Martimess 1657. or otherwise he wants a years
Annualrent; and if Sir <hi>Iohn Drummond</hi> should lift a years Rent due at
Martimess 1667. and an other years Rent due at Martimess 1668. he should
have two full years Rent of the Land within half a year of his entry,
which was at Whitsunday 1668. and which can never be understood, except
it had been clearly so expressed by the Parties, neither is there here any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forehand Duty, then what ordinarly Tennents paying Silver Rent, and
not Inlayed or Rentalled Victual entering at Whitsunday do, for they pay the
one half of there Rent at Martimess thereafter, and the next half at the
Whitsunday following that Martimess, and for his years Rent they must
have a years Cropt both of Grass and Corn, and all the difference here, is
that the Rent due for the Possession from Whitsunday 1667. to Whitsun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:55692:343"/>
1668. is payable together at Martimess 1667. in the middle of

that <hi>George Stuart</hi> having in his Person the Apprizing, and finding
<hi>Helen Kinaird (Cons</hi> Relick) in Possession of a great part of the Lands by
Liferent infeftment, and a Liferent and two ninteen years Tacks, which
would have excluded him; he purchased Right and Assignation thereto from
the Relick, and continued her Possession thereby, and did ascrive his Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
to the Liferenters Right, and not to the Apprizing, so that his intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
being by another, and more valide Title, could not be ascrived to
the Apprizing to extinguish it. The Pursuer answered, that the Defense ought
to be Repelled, because he had obtained Certification against the Defenders of
all Rights not produced, and albeit the Liferenters Seising be produced yet
the Warrand thereof (the Charter or Precept) was not produced, so that it
is now declared as false and feinzied, and the Seising being only the Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Nottar without a Warrand, is no Title to which the Intromission can
be ascrived, and therefore it must be ascrived wholly to the Apprizing.

and alleadges, that albeit the Certification could take away <hi>George Stuarts</hi> Right,
in so far as concerns <hi>Marjory Iameson,</hi> or her Authors, yet that being no annulling
of their Right, by being Transmitted in favours of the Pursuer, but only as being

Right, and to ascribe <hi>George</hi> his Possession to the Liferent, Infeftment,
whereof he now produces the Charter. The Pursuer answered, that he was
not obliged to take notice of <hi>Andrew Alexander<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

deduced against <hi>Neilson,</hi> after <hi>Neilson</hi> was Denuded by the Appryzing
led against him by <hi>George Stuart,</hi> and Infeftment thereon, so that the Pursuer
having prevailed against <hi>George Stuarts</hi> Right, which is the only valide Right,
and did exclude <hi>Andrew Alexander</hi> by the Rule <hi>vinco vincentem, &amp;c.</hi> and if this
were otherwise Sustained, no Improbation could be effectual, unless all
the invalid and imperfect Rights were particularly improven, which cannot
be known, and was never done. <hi>3dly,</hi> Certification being Extracted
against <hi>George Stuart</hi> himself, all Subaltern Rights flowing from him, fall
in consequence, and so <hi>Andrew Alexanders</hi> Right, which is but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat
and latent. The Defender answered, that albeit <hi>Andrew Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
was not called, or Certification taken against him, as a party ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar,
yet before Conclusion of the Cause, he has a good interest to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
his Appryzing, and to alleadge that the Certification against <hi>George
Stuart</hi> his Author, who neglected to produce the Liferenters Charter, could
not prejudge him, as deriving Right from <hi>George Stuart,</hi> as a singular
Successor; much less could the neglect or Collusion of <hi>Marjorie Iameson</hi>
prejudge any other but her self: and therefore craved, that if the Lords
would Sustain the Certification of the Liferent Charter against <hi>Marjorie Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meson,</hi>
that it should be without prejudice to <hi>Andrew Alexander,</hi> as to his
Right of the said Liferent, or to <hi>George Stuarts</hi> Right of the Liferent in
so far as the same is Derived to <hi>Andrew Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords adhered to the Certification in so far as concerned <hi>Marjory Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meson,</hi>
reserving <hi>Andrew Alexanders</hi> Right and his Authors, in so far as
concerned <hi>Andrew Alexander</hi> as accords.</p>
               <p>This Cause being again Called the 9. of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Defenders ascribed
their Possession to the Liferent, and two nineteen years Tacks, against
which there was no Certification. The Pursuer answered, <hi>First,</hi> That
the Liferenter having bruiked by a Liferent Infeftment, and having ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her Possession to it, it being improven, she could not ascribe her Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session

of the Legal: but if the Defender will grant the Lands Redeemable,
the Pursuer is content, that the Intromission be ascribed to the Liferent Right

not by what Title he Possessed, yet his intromission must be ascribed <hi>poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

juri,</hi> to that Right which was preferable, and so to the Liferent, which
would undoubtedly exclude his Appryzing: and therefore he acquired
Right from the Liferenter, being then in Possession, and it is unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that any party who hath many Titles, though they first make use of
one, if that be Reduced, they may make use of the rest, and so the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
in respect the Liferent Infeftment is improven, makes use of the
Tacks. The Pursuer further alleadged, that the Tacks comprehended Lands
not contained in the Contract of Marriage; and as to there, it was a voluntar
Deed granted by a Husband to his Wife, <hi>stante matrimonio,</hi> and Revock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>George Stuarts</hi> Appryzing, which is a legal Disposition in the same
way, as if the Husband had Disponed to <hi>George:</hi> Likeas the Doctors Debt
was anterior to these Tacks, so that <hi>George Stuart</hi> in so far cannot cloath
himself with these defective Rights, against which his Appryzing would have
prevailed. As to the superplus The Defender answered, that albeit the superplus
were <hi>donatio,</hi> and that the Husband might recal it indirectly by a subsequent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
it was never found that an Appryzing was such a Revocation.
and albeit the Doctor might Reduce the Tacks, as to the superplus, being
without an onerous Cause, after his Debt, yet that Reduction cannot take
effect <hi>ante litem mot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the bygone Fruits, or which is equivalent to impute them in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Defenders Intromission might be imputed to the
Liferent Tacks, and not to the Appryzing, but as to the Superplus they
were not clear, even to impute that in the Appryzing, upon the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
alleadged by the Defenders, but as to that, the hour prevented

bear only to four thousand merks of Tocher, and an obligement,
that upon payment of the Tocher, the Husband should Imploy the same,

alleadged that her Infeftment behoved to be restricted to the Annualrent
of eight thousand merks: And she having alleadged that her Contract was
Vitiat after the Marriage, and did bear seven thousand merks of Tocher,
and an Annualrent thereof, and of other seven for Joynture, the seven was
made four, but that not being then instructed, the said <hi>Margaret</hi> was only
preferred as to the Annualrent of eight thousand merks, but prejudice to
her to prove any further, to have been in her Contract, and that the same
was Vitiat. She now pursues a Declarator against the Creditors, that her
Contract was altered, and Vitiat after the Marriage, and that she ought
to have a Poinding of the Ground, for two hundreth and ten merks yearly,
the times bygone, wherein her Infeftment of seven hundreth merks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:55692:345"/>
the Annualrent of eight thousand merks, and which she yet wanted,
and for the whole seven hundreth merks in time coming, whereupon Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
were adduced, for proving of the Vitiation, which they did prove. And
it was now alleadged by the Creditors, that although the Contract was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
yet she could have no more in their prejudice, but the annualrent
of eight thousand merks, because the Contract was altered before it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat;
and her Infeftment bears expresly for Implement of her Contract
Registrat, which must import, that it was an Implement of the Contract
as it was altered after the Registration, and not as it was before the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
seing it does not mention the particular Sum, either of eight, or
fourteen thousand merks; and the seven hundreth merks, is but fifty merks
more than the Annualrent of eight thousand merks, at the time of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment.
<hi>2dly,</hi> The Contract was altered by consent of the Father and the

                  </gap>ring to the
Tocher, upon payment thereof, <hi>Ita est,</hi> the Tocher was never payed, and
so she can only claim the Annualrent of seven thousand merks, which the
Husband should have added to the Tocher. And albeit ordinarly such
Clauses prejudge not the Wife, where the Tocher is not payed through
the Husbands neglect, who is obliged to do Diligence for his Wife. Yet
here it is offered to be proven, that the Relicts Father was insolvent the
time of the Contract, and still thereafter; so that no Diligence could have
recovered it. It was answered for the Relict to the first, that albeit her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment
relate to the Contract which was Registrat, yet not to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
as it was Registrat, and the Husband having so great Trust, the Wife
was not obliged to look to the Register or Extract, which was in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Husbands Custody; and by the Testimonies of the Witnesses it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that they have Colluded to abate both the Tocher and Joyntour,
without her Consent. To the <hi>second,</hi> The Father and Husband not being
sole Contracters, but the Wife, they could not after the Contract and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
without her consent, alter her Right. To the <hi>third,</hi> The Creditors
lending their Money, <hi>bona fide,,</hi> cannot prejudge the Relicts Right; for
<hi>bona fides</hi> operats only in payment made, and other necessary Deeds, but not
in voluntary Acts, as lending of Mony, wherein the Lender must follow the
Faith and Condition of the Borrower, whose Rights, though never so clear
in any Record, yet if thereafter they be improven or Reduced, the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<hi>bona fides,</hi> avails nothing, and though the Relict made use of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
Vitiat, yet it was with Reclamation against the Vitiation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Decreet, the same is reserved, which is the Ground of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarator.
To the <hi>fourth,</hi> The Relict craves not the Repetition of the Fruits
uplifted by the Creditors, but only that the Ground may be Poynded for
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:55692:346"/>
what she wants of bygones. To the <hi>last,</hi> By no Practice was ever a Wife
prejudged, by not payment of the Tocher; and albeit the Fathers being
<hi>Insolvent,</hi> might have been a Ground to the Husband to refuse to Infeft his
Wife, in any more than the Annualrent of 7000. merks, till the Tocher
were payed: Yet where he has actually Infeft her in more, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Contracting of the Creditors Debt, her Infeftment must stand valid, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was less than what was her Right.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Vitiation of the Contract to have been after the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and Sustained the Declarator, and ordained the Ground to be Poynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for what she wanted of her Infeftment of 700. merks for bygones, and

for keeping the Prisoner some dayes out of the Tolbooth, seing he did not

keep a Prisoner in a private House, yet the doing thereof, if the Rebel
escape not, makes them not lyable to the Debt, but especially where the

for refusing to accept the Prisoner, yet having accepted him, and
suffered him to escape, they are lyable as having acknowledged themselves
to be lyable; and if they had refused the Prisoner, the Pursuer would have
Imprisoned him in another uncontroverted Burgh. To the second Defense
it was answered, that Magistrates are lyable for the Debt of Rebels offered
to them, if they do not put them in Prison, or if they suffer them to come out
of Prison without Warrand, and the Pursuer needs not Dispute that the Prisoner
went out by the Magistrates fault, and their Contumacy is sufficient in not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Letters, by putting him in their publick Prison, but keeping him so
long in a private House. To the <hi>third</hi> Defense the Pursuer offered him to
prove, that the Prison was insufficient, and that thereby the Rebel did
escape.</p>
               <p>The Lords found, that seing the Defenders did receive the Rebel upon
the Caption, they could not now Dispute, whether they were lyable to
receive or not, as being the head Burgh of the <hi>Steuartrie,</hi> and therefore the
Lords did not Determine that Point. Likewise, the Lords found that the
keeping of the Rebel ten days before he was Imprisoned, there being Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

for the Pursuer, that the arrestment stood valid, and was not improven but
approven as to the Substantials requisite thereto, for the Messenger and one
of the two living Witnesses do agree, that the arrestment was made by the
Caption at the Tolbooth Door, in presence of the Jaylour, and though it
was not so formally done, by Commanding the Jaylour, yet it was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
that the Prisoner was Commanded in the Jaylours presence, which is
sufficient, albeit not so formal, in making the Jaylour Witness, neither
can respect be had to the Jaylours Oath, denying that he was Witness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
confessing he was Jaylour, he is a Party lyable for suffering the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel

because the priviledge excluding Deeds on Death-bed is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by Law in favours of Heirs only, that the Defunct may not prejudge

that whatsoever might be alleadged, if the Disposition had been to
a Stranger, of that interpretation of the words, yet this Disposition being
granted to the Disponers own eldest Son and appearand Heir, it must be
understood only of such Deeds as might be done against an Heir, and here
the Creditors do also concur, who in place of the Heir might pursue the
Reduction, and against whom the Personal objection of acceptance cannot be
alleadged. The Pursuer answered, that the Defender was not appearand
Heir, because it is notourly known that his Father begot him in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
upon the Wife of Sir <hi>Alexander Hume,</hi> for which Adultery she was
Divorced from her Husband, and albeit he did co-habit with her thereafter
as his Wife, that cannot infer (as in other cases) that she was his Wife,
because Marriage cannot consist betwixt the Adulterer and the Adulteress,

is the eldest Son, and appearand Heir, in whose favour the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision

Heir, yet here having accepted a Disposition of the whole Estate, Burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this Provision, his acceptance excludes him, who is thereby bound,
and cannot pretend to any priviledge of an Heir; for albeit <hi>re integra</hi> he
might Renunce the Disposition; and return to bruik as Heir, now he
cannot, having bruiked by the Disposition; and for the Creditors concourse
they are not Pursuers, and they may insist in any Action competent to them
by Law, but cannot oppose this Personal obligement, whereby the Defender
by the acceptance of the Disposition in these terms, is become obliged to pay
the Pursuer the Sum in the Reservation.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Defense, and found that the Reservation in the

bears that the second Bond of Corroboration was Delivered, but bears not
that the first was Delivered, neither bears it the obligement to Deliver
the same; the Translation also bears Warrandice from <hi>Eathies</hi> own Deed.
The said <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Children having pursued <hi>Morphie</hi> upon the said
second Bond of Corroboration, he was Assoilzied, because he had no super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
in his hand. She now pursues the Earl of <hi>Northesk</hi> as Heir to his
Father, to Deliver the first Bond of Corroboration transferred by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whereby <hi>Morphie</hi> was bound to pay the Debt simply, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of his own Debt, or otherways that <hi>Northesk</hi> should pay the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and Interest, which is the Debt it self. The Defender alleadged Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvitor,
because by the Transaction his Father was not obliged to Deliver
the first Bond of Corroboration: Likeas the Translation bears the second
Bond of Corroboration Delivered, so that the Pursuer has aequiesced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and albeit the Stile of the Translation bears for Sums of Money, yet it
is clear thereby that it is but a retrocession of the Pursuers to their own
Right, which they themselves had Assigned, which doth presume that <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi>
was but intrusted, and seing he has reponed them in better condition
than they were by the second Bond of Corroboration, he cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to Deliver the first Bond which <hi>Morphie</hi> freely granted as a favour to
<hi>Eathie,</hi> unless it did appear such a Bond was, and that <hi>Eathie</hi> had fraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
put it away, whereanent he is content to Depone, so that the transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the first Bond must only import, if any such Bond was the time of the
Translation, which would not oblige <hi>Eathie</hi> to Deliver it, unless he had it, much
less to pay the Sum <hi>pro damno &amp; interesse. 2dly, Eathie</hi> having accepted
the second Bond of Corroboration, with a limitation of preferring himself,
it qualifies the first Bond of Corroboration, so that though the Pursuer had
it, it could operate nothing more nor the second, and so he has no Damnage.
The Pursuer answered, that <hi>Eathie</hi> having transferred the first Bond of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration
granted to himself, <hi>hoc ipso,</hi> he is obliged to Deliver the same,
though the Translation expresly bear not an obligement to Deliver <hi>quod inest,</hi>
neither can <hi>Eathie</hi> pretend that there was not such a Bond of Corroboration,
seing the Translation acknowledges that it was granted to himself, neither
doth it appear that the Translation was in Trust, seing it bears expresly that
it is granted for Sums of Money; and although it had been in Trust, <hi>Eathie</hi>
having acknowledged that <hi>Morphie</hi> granted a Bond of Corroboration to pay
the Sum simply; it was contrare to his Trust either to give back that Bond,
or to qualifie it. <hi>2dly,</hi> The second Bond of Corroboration cannot restrict the
first, because it bears expresly in Corroboration thereof, and but derogation
thereto.</p>
               <p>The Lords Sustained the Summons, and Repelled the Desenses, and found
that the Translation in terms as aforesaid did import an obligement to Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the first Bond of Corroboration, or otherwise to pay the Debt, as Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and Interest, seing <hi>Morphie</hi> was Assoilzied from the second Bond of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration.</p>

it was in the same case he Received it; as for the taking out of Breevs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it signified the Doctors purpose to have been Heir, yet behaviour must

as having no other Title or intent but as Heir; and as for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
it is a null Act, operative of nothing, but for Reduction which was not

               <p>THere being an Apprizing of the Lands of <hi>Garleith,</hi> belonging to <hi>Iohn
Kennedy,</hi> at the Instance of <hi>Edward Wallace;</hi> the said <hi>Edward</hi> by his
Back-bond declared that the Apprizing was to the behove of <hi>William Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi>
of <hi>Burnbank</hi> his Brother, and obliges him to denude himself thereof
in his favours: Thereafter the said <hi>Edward</hi> Assigns the Comprizing, and
Dispones the Lands to <hi>Adam Cunningham,</hi> who stands Infeft, and in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
for the Interest of this Apprizing, It was alleadged that <hi>Edward Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi>
the Apprizer, having by his Back-bond declared, that the Apprizing
was to <hi>William</hi> his Brothers behove, conform to his Back-bond produced,
the said <hi>William</hi> was satisfied by Payment or Intromission, so that the
Apprizing is extinct. It was answered for <hi>Cunningham,</hi> that the allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
is not Relevant against him, who stands Infeft as a singular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
so that his real Right cannot be taken away by any Personal
Back-bond granted by his Author, whereby he was not denuded, for
though his Author had granted Assignation to the Apprizing, if it had
not been Intimat, a posterior Assignation Intimat much more a Disposition
and Infeftment would be preferred thereto, for albeit satisfaction of an
Apprizing, by Intromission with the Mails and Duties be sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish,
even against a singular Successor, though there was no Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made, which the Lords had extended to any payment made by the
Debitor, yet this was never extended to any Personal Declaration of Trust,
or obligement to denude, which cannot be valide against a singular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.
It was answered for <hi>Kennedy,</hi> that Apprizings and Infeftments
thereon, do differ from other Infeftments, in this, that they
require no Resignation or Re-seising to extinguish them, but whatever
may take away a Personal Right, either by Intromission, Payment, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
will take them away even by exception; and what is Relevant
against the Author, is Relevant against the singular Successor, except as to
the manner of Probation, that it cannot be Proven by the Authors Oath,
but by Writ or Witnesses; neither is there any odds as to this, whether there
be Infeftment on the Apprizing or not, so then if <hi>Cunningham</hi> were but
Assigney to the Decreet of Apprizing, it would be Relevant against him,
that before his Assignation his Cedent had declared that the Apprizing was
to the behove of another, to whom the Debitor had made payment; which
Declaration being instructed by Writ anterior to the Assignation, is valide
against <hi>Cunningham</hi> the Assigney, and whether he be Infeft on his Assignation
and Disposition of the Apprizing or not, as to this Point, Law and Custom
makes no difference, neither doth the case quadrat with an Assignation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intimat,
compeating with a posterior Assignation intimat, which might be
preferred; but if the Debitor made payment to the Assigney, though he
had not intimat it, it would extinguish the Apprizing, and no posterior As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,
though intimat, would make the Debitor pay again, and in this
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:55692:352"/>
case there is a real Declaration of Trust, which is most ordinar, when Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
having small sums<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> assign them all to one who Compryzeth for all, and
by several Back-bonds, Declares that the Appryzing is to the behove of

therein, and have sought no further, and if this Back-bond were not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
against singular Successors, the Appryzer might at any time thereafter
Dispone, and clearly exclude them.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Back-bond was Relevant against singular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and that payment made to him, to whose behove the appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Iuly 13. 1670.</head>
               <p>THe Laird of <hi>Soutray</hi> having granted a Writ in favours of his Eldest

Disponing his Lands of <hi>Soutray,</hi> and his whole Moveables to the said Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

of the nullity of the Writ. <hi>First,</hi> In so far as being a Testament, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a Disposition of the Lands. <hi>2dly,</hi> In so far as the Eldest Daughter
is nominate Executrix, and universal Legatrix, because by ocular inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that part of the Writ was blank, and is filled up with another hand,
which is offered to be proven to have been done since the Defuncts Death,
so that the Executor and Legator not being filled up by the Defunct in his
own time, and these being the Essentials of the Testament wanting, the
whole Falls, even as to the Disposition of the Moveables. The Defender
answered, that the Testament was valide, albeit the Name of the Legator
and universal Executor, were filled up after the Defuncts Death; yet it is
offered to be proven, that the Defunct when he subscribed the Testament,
did nominat his Eldest Daughter, as Executrix and Legatrix, and
gave warrand to the Nottar to fill up the Name, which though he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then, and has done it since, it ought not to prejudge her. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that our Law allows of no Nuncupative Testaments, or nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Executors of Legators, unless the Testament be perfected in Writ,
and therefore if the Executor or Legator be not filled up by the Defunct, the
Testament is not perfeited in Writ, albeit the Defunct has Subscribed the
same, as he might have done in a blank Paper, and given warrand to the
Nottar to fill up his Testament upon such Terms, which could not subsist,
though the Nottar and Witnesses should astruct the same, as not being done,

               </p>
               <p>The Lords found the Testament null as to the nomination of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

the Disposition of the Moveables, with the burden of the ten thousand
merks; and found that the want of the nomination of the Executor or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Legator, did not hinder, but that the Defunct might in any way
Dispone his Moveables in Testament, or on Death-bed, which would stand
valide as a Legacy, which by our Law might consist without nomination of
Executors but would extend to that part of the Moveables only, the Defunct
might Legat.</p>

diverted the same to water their Ground, whereby so much thereof is drunk
up by the Ground, that there remains not Water sufficient for his Miln.</p>
               <p>In this Process the Lords having before answer allowed Witnesses to be
adduced on either part. It was proven that <hi>Bandoch</hi> was in Possession of
the Miln, with the free use of the Burn these threescore years, and that it
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:55692:353"/>
was commonly known, that he and his Predecessors had been in immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

now they do. It was also proven that the Tennents of <hi>Martoun</hi> have been
in use to water their Ground this 34, or 35. years, whereupon it occurred
to the Lords to consider, whether the watering of the Ground being the
most natural and ordinar effect of Burns and Waters, the building of a
Miln beneath, could hinder that liberty, or at least, if 34. years Possession
were not sufficient to continue the watering.</p>
               <p>The Lords did not consider what effect the building of a Miln, with a

that the ancient and immemorial Possession of this Miln, and full injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Water was as much proven, as could be known to preceed the
34. years, during which, the diversions upon the Lands of <hi>Martoun</hi> was
proven, they found that the Miln and her priviledge being once so Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
no less then 40. years peaceable Possession of diverting the Water for
watering, was sufficient, that being the only legal Term, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

and Decreets from the Heirs of Line, and having entred to the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
without any Porcess of Removing, or Mails and Duties against the
Tennents, but the former Possessors leaving the Possession, the Earl en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
without opposition, and might ascribe his Possession to either of
these Rights he pleased, and does most rationally ascribe the same to the
first, especially seing he had both the Rights from the same Party, and was
not introduced to the Possession by them, more upon the one Right than
upon the other. It was answered for the Pursuer, that albeit Parties may
make use of any Right they have to Defend their Possession, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terverting
the same, yet that must always be where the posterior Right doth
not derogat from the former, either as to Right or Possession. But here the
second Contract and Decreet is inconsistent with, and derogatory to the
former; for the Earl having power to enter by the first, till he were pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of one thousand pound Sterling, resting of four, <hi>fructibus non computan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis

enter in Possession by that Right, or the former Heretors, to relinquish the
Possession to him upon that Right, which then had <hi>paratam executionem,</hi> and
could then instantly have forced them to quite the Possession; but that was
only the last Contract, and last Decreet, whereupon the late Earl had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

Possession: But as for the first Contract and Decreet of Possession, it

Right from the Heirs of Line by Assignation himself, being only Heir-male.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Possession was only to be ascribed to the last

could have no effect against the Defenders, because it was only obtained against

they can import no Homologation, because the Article anent the Teind

Reduce the same by Calling only <hi>Wolmets</hi> Heir, who had not only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,

seing they had no Right to the Teinds the Defender answered, that the

Right to the Teind, because it Liquidats the Teind, and Liberats the Stock
of any further, and so hath the Liferenter for the Liferent Right, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and that the Denunciation was made accordingly, for the Parties to
appear at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> yet there was neither Law nor Custom for such a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
and Parties are not obliged to attend but at the head Burgh of
the Shire, or <hi>in communia patria,</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh. 3dly,</hi> The Pursuer has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
an Appryzing, though posterior, yet preferable, because solemn and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
according to the Custom then being. It was answered, that albeit
the Custom under the Usurper might excuse the want of Denunciations at
the head Burghs of Regalities, which were then supprest, where they were
used at the head Burgh of the Shire according to the Custom then, and so
validats such Appryzings; yet this Defender having according to the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Law of the Land, Denunced at the head Burgh of the Regality, the
contrair unwarrantable Custom cannot annul his Appryzing, proceeding
according to Law. And as to the Dispensation at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> which was nearer
the Lands then <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> whatsoever might have been said to the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of granting such a Dispensation, yet being granted, it is valide, and
was then frequent to grant such Dispensations.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Pursuers Apprizing being according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar
Custom for the time, at the head Burgh of the Shire upon Denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it was more solemn and preferable, as to the manner of Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,
than that which was upon Denunciation at the head Burgh of the
Regality, at that time. But the Lords did not determine, whether such an
Appryzing would have been valide, if there had not been a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall

the Magistrates of <hi>Pearth</hi> for payment of the Debt, who alleadged ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvitor:
<hi>First,</hi> Because their Tolbooth was sufficient, and the Rebel had
escaped <hi>vi majori,</hi> having broken the Stone, in which the Bolt of the Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booth
Door entered, and forced the Lock in the time of Sermon, and that
immediately after the Rebel escaped out of the Town, and was met with
Friends that were trysted there at the time of his escape. <hi>2dly,</hi> They had
laid out all wayes thereafter to search for him, and had at last found him
in the Tolbooth of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for the same Debt, where he yet was in as
good condition, as when he first escaped. The Pursuer answered, that
the Rebel had escaped by the fault or neglect of the Jaylour, for whom
the Town was answerable, in so far as they had given him the liberty of all
the Rooms in the Tolbooth, and that when he escaped, he was left in the
outmost Room, and his Brother Son was permitted to abide within with
him, and the Catband on the outside of the Tolbooth Door was not put
on and Locked, which would have so secured the Door, that nothing the
Prisoner could have done within, could have opened the same; and that
the Tolbooth Lock had a double and single Cast, and when it was Lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only with the single Cast, the Bolt might be thrust back, but when
with the double Cast, it had a strong Backsprent, and could not be thrust
back: and that at the time of the escape, the Lock had but the single
Cast, so that the edge of the Stone being broken off, there was access to press
back the Bolt. To the second it was answered, that the Rebel having es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
through the Town or their Servants neglect, <hi>jus erat acquisitum</hi> to
the Pursuer, making them lyable, which could not be taken off by any
Incarceration thereafter, unless the Magistrates had followed him in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Act of escape, and recovered him; but now they have six Moneths
after his escape put him, not in the Tolbooth of <hi>Pearth,</hi> but in the Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booth

               </p>
               <p>The Lords being unwilling to give either Party the choose of Witnesses
for Probation, had before answer, appointed either Party to adduce Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
anent the condition of the Tolbooth, and the manner of the Rebels
escape, which being now advised.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that by the most pregnent Probation, it was proven
that the Catband used sometimes to be on in the day time, and sometimes
not, and that Prisoners for Debt had the liberty in the Day time of all the
Rooms of the Tolbooth, the Probation was very contrair, as to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Stone wherein the Bolt entered, but it seemed access could not
be had to the Bolt without some breach of the Stone. It was also proven
the Catband was not then on, and that the Bolt when it got the double Cast,
could not be prest back, and could when it got the single Cast; and therefore
the Lords found that the Magistrates proved not their first Exception, that
the Rebel had escaped <hi>vi majori,</hi> without their fault or negligence, and
found the second Exception of puting him again in Prison, not Relevant.</p>

Citation before the Bailzies of <hi>Edinburhg</hi> in one day, where <hi>Cornelius</hi> alleadged

his Arrestment was four days posterior, yet it ought to be preferred,
because the Term of payment of <hi>Cornelius</hi> Debt was not come whereas <hi>Charles</hi>
his Term being past, he has <hi>paratam executionem,</hi> this being ready to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
by the Bailzies. <hi>Cornelius</hi> raises Advocation, and the Cause being
Advocat, the same Debate was repeated before the Lords, and <hi>Cornelius</hi>
added that now the Term of payment of his Sum was past, and alleadged
that albeit his Term were not come, his first Arrestment is preferable, though
the Decreet thereupon could only be to pay after the Term were past, and
now his Term being also past before Sentence there needs no such limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It was answered, that it is not the Arrestment that constitutes the
Right, but the Sentence making forthcoming, and though ordinarly the first
Arrestment is preferred, yet oftimes posterior Arrestments are preferred
upon more timous or more orderly Diligence, and the Diligence done, by
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:55692:357"/>
                  <hi>Charters</hi> is done more orderly, because it was after the Term, for if it were
Sustained, that Arrestments made before the Term of payment, should
be preferred to these made after the Term, Creditors who has ready Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
should be postponed to others, whose Debts were payable after a
Liferent of 20. years time, but as the second Arrester may Poind his Debitors
Goods, though Arrested formerly by another, so may he crave Sentence to
make forthcoming to take present effect by Poinding, and cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by an other Creditor, upon pretence of a prior Arrestment, which
cannot receive present Execution; and albeit the prior Arresters Term be
now come, yet he ought not to be preferred, because he procured Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Cause, without any just Reason, either of Incompetency or Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
only to procure delay till his Term were past, and therefore the
Cause being now Advocat of consent, the Sentence must now be of the same
manner, as it would have been before the Bailzies when the Cause was Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,
at which time <hi>Cornelius</hi> Term of payment was not come.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the unwarrantable delay by the Advocation should
not prejudge <hi>Charters,</hi> and that the case should be considered as it was the
time that the Advocation was raised, and preferred <hi>Charles Charters</hi> upon

being now finished by her Marriage; In which Accompt the Mother
gave up in defalcation the third of all moveable Sums, as Ships, Merchant

can have no part of the moveable Sums, or moveable Goods, because by
the contract of Marriage produced, she is provided to the Annualrent of
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:55692:359"/>
5000. Merks which was her own Tocher, and ten thousand Pounds more
of her Husbands, which is her Husbands, and was the whole Fortune he
then had; and as to the Conquest, it is provided that all Sums of Money,
Lands, Annualrents, Tacks and others whatsomever Conquest during the
Marriage, shall be taken to the Husband in Liferent, and to the Bairns in
Fee; and because the Wife is provided to be a Bairn in her Fathers House,
what shall come that way is provided to be taken to the Husband and Wife,
the longest Liver of them two, and the Bairns of the Marriage, so that all
the Sums, and Moveables in question, being Conquest during the Marriage,
they are by the Contract destinate to the Husband in Liferent, and the
Bairns in Fee, and which Provision is a Debt upon the Husband, his Heirs
and Executors, so that the Wife can have no third thereof. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
answered, <hi>First,</hi> That her Right of the third of the Moveables being
Constitute by the Law, cannot be taken away, but by an expresse clear Deed
Renuncing the same, or accepting such Provisions in satisfaction thereof,
which being a Clause now ordinarly adjected in Contracts, and not put in
this Contract, albeit in the same the Wifes Tocher bears in full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Clause can never be so interpret as to exclude her third, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Contract of Marriage being so favourable, that words are always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therein according to the meaning of Parties, and here the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Parties may be cleared, by this, that the Defunct who was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
intelligent Man, did declare that he would leave to his Wife so much of
his Moveables in full satisfaction of her third, so that he thought she was
not excluded, and if need beis the Parties alive, Writters and Witnesses in
the Contract may be yet Examined to clear the meaning of the Clause.
<hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit the Clause could not exclude her from a third of Money,
which is expresse therein, yet not from a third of Moveable Goods and Geir,
which is not exprest, and albeit the Clause bears, (and others) it can only
be understood of Rights due by a stated Security, and the intent of the
Clause has only been to substitute the Bairns of this Marriage, Heirs of the
Conquest, and to exclude the Bairns of any other Marriage, but did neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Father, but that he might dispone on his Moveables, albeit the Clause
expresseth him but Liferenter thereof; neither does it exclude the Mother
from the third thereof: And there was adduced a Decision in the Case of
the Lady <hi>Oxenfoord,</hi> wherein, albeit by her Contract of Marriage she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
certain Lands in full satisfaction of her Terce, and third of all Lands,
Annualrents and others, yet that was not found to exclude her from a third
of Moveables, but only from a Terce, or third of Heretable Rights. It was
answered for the Children, that their Mother having consented by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of Marriage, that all Conquest during the Marriage should be provided
to their Father in Liferent, and to them in Fee, she had excluded her self as
clearly, and effectually, as if she had Renunced her third thereof, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of her Jointer in full satisfaction; neither is there a necessity that
these words must always be used, nor is this alleadged as a consequential Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,
but as an expresse Obligation, or Destination of the Husband
consented to by the Wife, which must have its native effect, and so the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
must be Feears of the whole Conquest, and therefore the Wife cannot
be Feear of a third of it, and albeit moveable Geir be not exprest, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
(others) must necessarily comprehend them, being of the same nature
with Sums which are exprest, and may be Moveable, and of less importance
then they, and the case wholly differs from that of the Lady <hi>Oxenfoord,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
nothing but Heretable Rights are exprest, and it is an unaccustomed Clause
amongst Persons of that quality to exclude Ladies from a third of Moveables;
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:55692:359"/>
but here Sums are exprest, and it is most ordinar for Merchants to exclude
their <hi>Wives</hi> from their Merchant Goods, which is the greatest part of their
Estate, as to the meaning of the Parties, clear Clauses cannot be enervat
upon that ground, and as for any thing exprest by the Husband, It was
on Death-bed in a great Fever whereof he Died, and no Testament
followed.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the foresaid Clause in the Contract did exclude
the Relict from a Terce of Moveable Sums, or Moveable Goods during
the Marriage, which could be understood, to be meaned to be put upon
Security at any time, but that it did not exclude her from a third of the
Houshold Plenishing.</p>

and yet he got only fourty thousand Merks for all. The Defender allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Absolvitor, because the Pursuer was satisfied of all his bygone An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrents,
in so far as he having Apprized for five years Annualrents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the Apprizing, which was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1655. he had entered in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
by vertue of the said Apprizing of the whole Lands of <hi>Achinher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,</hi>
and so is Comptable therefore according to the Rental, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he cease to Possesse the same, which will fully satisfie all his bygones,
so that he will have no Lesion <hi>2dly,</hi> He had not only in his Person
the said Apprizing, but the Infeftment of Annualrent, upon which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preferred in a double Poinding, and excluding other Parties having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
real Rights, he is thereby obliged to do Diligence, and be Comptable
not only for what he intrometted with, but for what he ought to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trometted
with. The Pursuer answered, that he was content to Compt for
what he had Intrometted with, but upon neither ground was he obliged to
Compt for any further, especially as to his Apprizing, albeit Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
had oblidged him to Compt for the whole Rental, till the Apprizing
were satisfied, yet he could not be Comptable but for his Intromission after

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for then he had no title in his Person, and it is clear that any
Intrometter without a title is only lyable for his Intromission, and all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
having Interest might have hindred him to have Intrometted after he
was satisfied; and albeit a Tennent or Factor, after the expiring of the

they have a title <hi>per tacitam relocationem,</hi> or <hi>tacitam commissionem;</hi> but after
the extinction of the Apprizing then no title remains, and neither is he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as an Annualrenter, even though he did exclude others to do any Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
because all the effect of an Annualrent can only be to distresse the
Ground, or Poind the Tennents for as much of their Rent as is equivalent
to the current Annualrents, after which any other Party having Right

as to any bygone Rents, but only in timecoming, and for his current
Annualrents, and the bygones are appointed to be brought in Accompt,
which was never determined. The Defender answered, that it were against
all Reason that an Apprizer after he is satisfied, should be in better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:55692:360"/>
then before he is satisfied, and so as long as he meddles, he must Compt
by the Rental, and it is his proper part, who knows when he is satisfied,
to relinquish the Possession, which other Parties cannot know, till by a
long Process of Compt and Reckoning it be determined, and it were most
absurd that in the mean time he should continue in Possession, and though
the Rents did in a great part perish, he should not be Comptable therefore,
but only for what he actually lifted.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Pursuer as Apprizer Comptable according to the
Rental, not only for Intromission, but Omission, both till the Apprizing be
satisfied, and thereafter for all years of which he lifted any part, but found
not the Annualrenter lyable for Diligence, albeit he did exclude others, but
the Case came not to be Determined if the Annualrenter had by a Personal
Action insisted for more years Annualrent past, to be preferred to the whole
Rents, till these bygones were satisfied, that not being the case here in
question.</p>
               <p>In this Cause it had been formerly alleadged that the Pursuer after his
Majority, had Received a part of the price of the Lands, in so far as having
in his Minority granted a Commission to Mr. <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> one of his Curators,
to uplift all Sums due to him, and he having uplifted a part of the price of
the Land from the Defender, and bonds for the rest; the Pursuer after his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority,
had by his Discharge produced, Received from his Curator and Factor
the said Money and Bonds, and Discharged him thereof, and acknowledged
that he and the remainent Curators had acted faithfully in all their Intromissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereby the Pursuer hath approven, and Homologat the Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Land, made by him and his Curators, which he now quarrels. The
Pursuer answered, <hi>First,</hi> That the Defense is not Relevant, for Homologa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being a presumed or conjectured Consent, not by Word or Writ, but
by Deeds done, which import the adhering to the Disposition quarrelled, it
cannot be inferred by any Deeds, but such as can have no other intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
consistent with the Rejecting, or disapproving the Disposition, but here
the Receiving of the Money and Bonds from the Factor hath a consistency
and congruity with this Reduction, for the Pursuer knowing that he could not
be restored against his Disposition, unless he did restore what was Received by
his Warrand, might justly take up the same from his Factor, that he might
be in capacity to Consign the same at the Bar, as if a Minor having Bought
Lands to his Lesion, and having Wodset a part of the same, he might after his
Majority Redeem the Lands Wodset by himself, which although it behoved to
proceed upon the Disposition as his Title, yet it being a Deed necessar to purge
the Wodset, and repone the Disponer to his own Land free thereof, it would
never importan Homologation, or if he had in his Minority excambed Lands,
and Wodset a part of the Lands he acquired thereby, the Redeeming or
purging of the Wodset after his Majority would import no Homologation,
so neither can any Deed import Homologation, which upon any account can
be consistent with the annulling of the Right quarrelled upon Minority. <hi>2dly,</hi>

Yea, though these were expresly mentioned in his Discharge; and his
Reduction were reserved, it would be <hi>protestatio contraria facto,</hi> and would
not free him: so neither can the Reservation in this accompt, though it
were repeated in the Discharge, be sufficient; especially seing he might have

<hi>Iohn Maxwel</hi> having gone out of the Countrey, the Lady pursues a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce

return to the Lady from him upon the Divorce, craves to be admitted in

of Divorce pronunced: whereupon <hi>Milntoun</hi> raises Reduction of the
Commissars Decreet upon iniquity, because he was unjustly excluded from
Defending, and if he had been admitted, he would have proponed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
Interrogators to the Witnesses which were omitted, and would have
proponed Objections against their Hability, which would have excluded
them from being Witnesses.</p>
               <p>In this Process the Lords Ordained the Witnesses to be Re-examined
upon all such pertinent Interrogators as <hi>Miltoun</hi> should propose, and they being
Re-examined, did acknowledge that the Lady prompted them how to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone,
as to their knowledge of <hi>Margaret Davidson,</hi> and gave them Tokens
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:55692:361"/>
of her by her Cloaths and Stature, and that she promised them a good Deed
to Depone.</p>
               <p>In which Process the Lords found that the Witnesses upon Re-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after Sentence, could not by their posterior Deposition, Derogat from
the first Deposition, and therefore Assoilzied from the Reduction, reserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and allowing to <hi>Milntoun</hi> his Action of Reprobator, wherein he now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
on these Grounds, <hi>First,</hi> That the Witnesses, <hi>Paterson</hi> and <hi>Clerk</hi> who
only proved, were <hi>viles personae,</hi> having no means worth the Kings Unlaw.
<hi>2dly,</hi> That they were Persons infamous, and of very evil Repute, and in
their Examination before, they had prevaricat and contradicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<hi>3dly,</hi> That the Lady had Suborned and Corrupted the Witnesses,
by Prompting and Instructing them how to Depone. <hi>4thly,</hi> That she had
Corrupted the Witnesses before their Testimonies before the Commissars,
by giving some of them twenty Dollers to bear Witness, which is far above
their ordinar allowance of Witnesses for their Charges. It was answered for the
Defender, <hi>First,</hi> no Objection was now competent against the Hability or Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of the Witnesses, because Objections were given in against them by
the Pursuer, and they have Deponed thereanent, so that albeit Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
be competent, where the Pursuer cannot instantly verifie his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against the Witnesses, and protests for Reprobator; yet if either he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to protest, or refer his Objections to the Witnesses Oaths, he can
never be heard by way of Reprobator against them: And here this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
neither Protested for Reprobators at the first, nor at the Re-examination,
but upon his own desire, they were purged, and did Depone anent these
Objections. <hi>2dly,</hi> Having made use of the Witnesses upon the said Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
he has approven them, and cannot quarrel their Testimonies. And
as to the particular Objection of their poverty, they have already Depon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they are worth the Kings Unlaw, and it being a Negative, which
is not presumed that persons are so poor, it cannot be proven by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and though it could, and were a sufficient Objection ordinarly, yet
in a Crime of this Nature, which is so Clandestine, Objections of Poverty
would not be sufficient, and as to that Member of the Reprobator, that they are
persons of evil Fame, it is not Relevant, unless they were infamous, <hi>infamia
juris,</hi> either by such Deeds, as the Law Declares to infer Infamy, or by a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Judge, declaring them infamous. As to that Member of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probator
upon Subornation, it is not Relevant, unless it were Libelled, that
the Witnesses undertook so to Depone, or that they had Deponed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
for the Witnesses might be far above exception, as no offer of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornation
could Canvel the Faith of their Testimony, and so infer a blemish
upon them. And it was answered to all the Members of the Reprobator that
they are not proven by Witnesses, but by Oath of Party, otherwayes such
Processes could never end, for if Witnesses were Receiveable to prove the
Inhability or Corruption of the first Witnesses in the principal Cause, then
the Testimonies of the Witnesses in the Reprobator might be Canvelled
by Witnesses in a second Reprobator, against the Witnesses in the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probator,
and so Reprobator upon Reprobator without end. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
for the Pursuer to the first, that he cannot be excluded from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probators
against the Commissars Decreet, though he protested not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in respect it is evident by the Decreet, that he was not admitted
to compear, but he did Protest in the Reduction before the Lords, who
have expresly allowed him his Reprobators, neither doth the taking of the
Oaths of the Witnesses <hi>de initialibus testimoniorum,</hi> exclude Reprobators, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:55692:362"/>
the Party desire them to be Re-examined upon Oath thereupon, for
that Oath is not an Oath upon the Parties Reference, as stating the sole
Probation thereupon, but it is a judicial Oath, <hi>&amp; partis judicis,</hi> for the
Judge may, and ought so to Examine the Witnesses, whether the Party
require or not, so that the Party refers not these Points to the Witnesses,
but requires it of the Judges as a part of his Office. And as to these
Points, every Witness is <hi>testis singularis,</hi> for he Depones only his own Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and so there is no Probation thereby, except in so far as may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate
against the Witnesse himself, so that contrary Probation may well be
admitted against such an Oath, as well as against Executors upon Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intromission,
Tutors or Curators upon negligence or Malversation: and
if it were otherwise, Reprobators could be Sustained in no case against De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creets
of the Lords, because of Course, they take the Parties Oath to purge
themselves of partial Counsel, and of Corruption by promise, or receiving
of good Deed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither doth the Pursuers making use of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of thir Witnesses in their Re-examination, import his Approbation
of their Hability and Integrity, for Parties may give Interrogators to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
not adduced by themselves. To the second, this Process being of so
great importance, all lawful Objections against the Witnesses are compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and there is none more ordinar than that they are <hi>pauperes,</hi> not worth
the Kings Unlaw, and so lyable to great Temptation of Corruption. And
as to the attempt of Suborning, or Brybing the Witnesses, it is most Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
and express in Law <hi>l. 33. ff. de re judicata,</hi> bearing <hi>testibus pecunia cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptis

annullable, which is confirmed <hi>toto titulo Codicis si ex falsis instrumentis,</hi> and

And to the last alleadgeance against the Probation by Witnesses, that it
would infer an endless course of Reprobators: It was answered, that by
the same Reason, Reductions might be taken away; because the Decreet
Reductive might be Reduced, and that Decreet by another Reduction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end: But Reprobators have every where been Sustained, and no such
inconvenience ever found; neither can it be imagined, that every Pursuer
of a Reprobator will prevail, which this infinite progress must suppose, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it may infer, that Witnesses in Reprobators ought to be more unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,
than the Witnesses called in question thereby.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that Reprobators were competent, albeit the Witnesses upon
Oath Deponed upon their own Hability, at the desire of the Party: and
albeit the Party Protested not for Reprobators, seing he was not admitted
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:55692:362"/>
to compear, and found that Member of the Reprobators upon the poverty
not Relevant in this Clandestine Crime: neither that Member upon their
alleadged Infamy, unless it were alleadged that they were infamous, <hi>infamia
juris,</hi> by any Deed which the Law expresly declares to infer Infamy, or
were declared infamous <hi>sententia judicis:</hi> and found that Member of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probators
upon instructing or prompting the Witnesses Relevant, without
necessity to alleadge the Witnesses undertaking or Deponing conform, and
that <hi>in odium corrumpenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> without inferring any blemish upon the Witnesses
so prompted, who consented not, or swore falsly: and found that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Relevant of Corrupting the Witnesses, by giving or promising of good
Deed, more than might be suitable to the Witnesses for their Charges: but
as to the manner of Probation by Oath or Witnesses, The Lords super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

of Portions to the other Children, albeit a part of the Lands were

answered for the eldest Daughter, that in latter Wills, the mind of the
Defunct is chiefly regarded, not only as to what is exprest, but to what is
implyed or presumed, and here it is evident, that the mind of the Defunct
was, that his two younger Daughters should only have ten thousand merks
in satisfaction to all Rights of Lands or Moveables: Now seing they have
gotten two third parts of the Land, which is much better than ten thousand
merks. It cannot be thought to be his meaning to give them any share of
his Moveables also, but that the half thereof, which was at his disposal, should
belong to the eldest Daughter without burden.</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>Robert Drummond</hi> of <hi>Meidhope</hi> having Disponed his Lands of <hi>Scotstoun</hi>
to Sir <hi>Iohn Drummond,</hi> for love and favour, and for better incouraging
Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> to pay his Debt, as the Disposition bears, and under Reversion
of a Rosenoble to Sir <hi>Robert</hi> in his own Life. Mr. <hi>John Drummond</hi> Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi>
appearand Heir, grants a Bond to <hi>Lowrie</hi> of <hi>Blackwood,</hi> whereupon
he Adjudges the Land from the appearand Heir, and pursues a Reduction
of the Disposition, as done on Death-bed. In which Pursuit Witnesses
were appointed to be Examined, <hi>hinc inde,</hi> concerning Sir <hi>Roberts</hi> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when he made the Disposition, and thereafter till his Death; the sum
of the Probation was, that before the Disposition Sir <hi>Robert</hi> had contracted an
Apoplexie, whereby he remained senseless for a time, but by Cure there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a Palsie in his Tongue, and a Vertigo in his Head, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till his Death, and about a year after that the sickness affected his Brain,
so that he lost the remembrance of Names of things, and most of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
Depones, that he was not found thereafter in his Judgement, but
that he keeped on his Cloathes, and was not affixed to his Bed, and went
frequently and walked in his Garden, and to the Court-hill, half a pair
of Butts off; and one of the Witnesses Deponed, that he came to his
House alone, a quarter of a mile off: but that he went never to the
Kirk nor Mercat, nor any publick place: Whereupon it was alleadged
for the Defender, that the Defunct continued in health at and after the
Disposition, and that his going so frequently abroad, was equivalent to his
going to Kirk and Mercat, which was sufficient to eleid the Reason of Death-bed,
and that the Palsie being but in his Tongue, albeit he misnamed things,
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:55692:364"/>
it did not import his being on Death-bed, especially seing he Disponed
for payment of his Debt, equivalent to the worth of the Land, his Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
being to a Friend of his Name, who Relieved him of his Debt, his
Heir not being his Son, nor Descendent, and uncapable to Relieve him of
his Debt. It was answered, that the contracting of his sickness being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proven to be before this Disposition, and the continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to affect his Brain, in that case nothing could purge the same, but his
going to Kirk and Mercat, which were the acts required in Law, and could
not be supplied by his going privatly abroad, and not to any popular pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
meeting; and as to his Debts they could not validat the Disposition by
exception, though the Defender might by way of action affect therewith the
Estate, or Burden the Heir, on whose Bond it was adjudged, especially
seing the Disposition buir for Love and Favour, and Redeemable for a
Rose-noble.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Reason of Death-bed sufficiently proven, and that
his private going abroad (though unsupported) was not equivalent to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad to Kirk and Mercat, or publick meeting, where the Disease con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to affect the Brain; But they found the paying of Debts equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

               <p>SIr <hi>Archibald Campbel</hi> being Debitor to <hi>Adam Wat</hi> in a Sum of Money,

the Receipt of fourty thousand Pound from Sir <hi>Archibald,</hi> and is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged

Children behind her, <hi>Thomas Moodie</hi> did restore the Sums, and there is
a Discharge granted by Sir <hi>Archibald</hi> and his Spouse, and Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi>
bearing them to have Received the Sums, and to have Discharged the same;
Whereupon Mr. <hi>Iohn Wat</hi> as Heir to <hi>Adam,</hi> pursues Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> to pay
him the Sum due to his Father, upon this ground, that he having Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fourty thousand Pounds of his Fathers Means, after Contracting of the
Debt, ought to make so much of it forthcoming as will pay the Pursuer;
which Action was founded upon the Act of Parliament, 1621. whereby all
Deeds done by Debitors in prejudice of their Creditors, without a Cause
Onerous are declared null, and all Parties that by vertue thereof Intromets,
are declared lyable to restore to the Creditors. It was answered for the
Defender; <hi>First,</hi> That the Libel was not Relevant, there being no part of
the Act of Parliament 1621. that Incapacitats Debitors to Gift or Dispone
Sums of Money, or Moveables, especially if the Disponer at that time be
not insolvent, but have a sufficient Estate for satisfying his Debt; and it is
offered to be proven, that Sir <hi>Archibald</hi> had at the time of this Contract a
sufficient Estate for all his Debt, in the hands of the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> and
<hi>Glenorchie;</hi> and albeit by the superveening Forefaulture, <hi>Argiles</hi> Debt be
insufficient, it was a good Debt the time of the Contract, so that there can
be no ground to make a Child lyable to Restore a Portion given by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who was solvent. <hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit the Defender could be lyable, if it
were clear that he had the Sum foresaid by his Father yet remaining to the
fore, yet if it had been lost or spent before the Intenting of this Cause,
he or any subsequent Estate acquired <hi>aliunde</hi> is not lyable, <hi>ita est</hi> anything
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:55692:365"/>
he has is a Wodset of fourty thousand Merks on <hi>Kilpont,</hi> and the two To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
he had <hi>viz.</hi> twenty thousand Merks from <hi>Thomas Moodie,</hi> and
ten thousand Merks of Legacy, and twelve thousand Merk of Tocher with
Sir <hi>William Gray's</hi> Daughter, was sufficient to acquire the Right of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi>
without any thing from his Father. <hi>3dly,</hi> The Discharge produced
cannot instruct that Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> Received the Money, because it bears
indefinitly that payment was made to Sir <hi>Archibald</hi> and his Spouse, and to
Mr. <hi>Archibald,</hi> and all of them do Discharge. The Pursuer answered, that
the Libel was very Relevant, for whatsoever might be alleadged of Bairns
Portions by a solvent Father, yet this being so considerable a Fortune pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
to the only Son, and appearand Heir, if it did not make him lyable
to satisfie the Fathers Debt <hi>pro tanto,</hi> it were a patent way to defraud all
Creditors and elude the Act of Parliament, for the Father might Sell his
Estate, and provide the Moneys in this manner; and as to the Discharge,
albeit it be indefinite, yet it must be presumed that Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Sums, because they belong to him in Fee by the Contract of
Marriage.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Libel Relevant, and that the Discharge produced
did presume that Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> the Feear did Receive the Money, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Locked; the Person Incarcerat having gotten secretly conveyed in

the Magistrats done their duty and diligence, for they ought to have had
Chains, and Cat-bands upon the utter-sides of the Doors, with Locks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
unto which the Incarcerat Person could not reach; and it was alike how
many Doors they had upon the Tolbooth, with their Locks inward, for the

Captions, and let all Persons for Debt free. It was answered for the Town,
that the having of Cat-bands without, Closed and Locked, was not the custom
of their Tolbooth, who past all memory did never Lock the outward Chains
but upon Malefactors, and such is the custom of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and other

of any Debt due by writ, nor take the same away; and as to the
pretences adduced by the Defender, they import nothing, for the delay of

is required to all prescriptions of Land a Title in Writ, preceeding the 40.
years Possession, which Title is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stinguished in two cases; <hi>First,</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Rights acquired <hi>titulo singlari,</hi> whereunto is required not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Seising, but a Charter, which although they may be excluded by an
anterior or better Right, yet if Possession hath been had thereafter, for the
space of fourty years uninterrupted, it becomes an unquestionable Right,
and all other Rights are excluded. But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> A greater favour is
showen as to the Title of prescription of Lands belonging to any Party <hi>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
universali</hi> as Heirs to their Predecessors, in which their is no Charter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
but Seisings one or moe continued, and standing together for the
space of fourty years, either proceeding upon Retours, or upon Precepts
of <hi>clare constat,</hi> so that the Seising in question proceeding upon a Precept
of <hi>clare constat</hi> cannot be a sufficient Title for prescription, unless the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>which is the Warrand thereof were produced. <hi>2dly,</hi>
The said provision of the Act requires that the Seising one or moe must
stand, and be continued for the space of fourty years, which cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
in this case, because by the Defenders production it is clear that
the said <hi>Alexander M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>naughtan,</hi> to whom the Seising was granted, Lived
not for fourty years after the Seising, so that unless his Heir had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and had Possest by vertue of the Heirs Seising to perfyt the fourty years,
the Defense of prescription is not Relevantly alleadged. The Defender
answered, that his Defense of prescription stands Relevant upon this one
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:55692:366"/>
Seising only; and he oppones the foresaid Clause in the Act of Parliament
where an Heirs Title of prescription, is a Seising proceeding upon a Retour or
Precept of <hi>clare constat,</hi> and does not mention that the Seising and Precept
shall be a sufficient Title, as it does in the case of Lands acquired, where
it expresly requireth both a Charter and Seising, and it had been as easie
in this Clause to have required a Seising, and Retour or Precept, whereas
it doth only require a Seising on a Retour or Precept, so that the Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
relating the Retour or Precept is sufficient, and by long course of
time sufficiently instructs the being of the Retour or Precept. As to the
second answer, the meaning of the Act of Parliament by a Seising one or
moe standing together, is that the said Seising be not Reduced, for our
Law doth ordinarly oppose standing and falling by Reduction, so that albeit
the Party Seised Died within fourty years after the Seising, his appearand
Heir continued his Possession, and being one Person in Law with him, did
Possess by his Seising, and if it were otherewise understood, many absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
would follow; for if a Person were Infeft as Heir, and did Possess thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nine years, thereafter Dying, then if his Heir were not Infeft within the year,
he should have no Title of prescription, though within the fourty year six
Heirs consequently were Infeft, all their six Seisings with thirty nine years
Possession, though their appearand Heir should continue an hundreth years
thereafter in Possession, would not induce pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cription, yea, taking the
Act Literally, it can never have effect, unless the Heir Infeft Live and
Possess after his Infeftment fourty years, which is very rare, for if there be
more Heirs that Succeed, there must be still an intervale betwixt the Death of
the one, and the Seising of the other, and so the Seisings could not be
said to be continued, but discontinued or interrupted, for Possession is
not continued, if the Possessor cease to Possess one year, so that prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being of common Interest and Advantage to the Leiges, the same ought
to be ampliate in the interpretation thereof, and not straitned. The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
answered, that he opponed the clear words of the Act of Parliament,
which does not only require fourty years continual Possession, but also that
it be by Seisings sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ding, continuing together fourty years, and that upon
very solide Reason, for if both Charter and Seising be required for a Title
to prescription in Rights acquired: It cannot be imagined that an single
Seising should be sufficient in Rights devolved by Succession, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
any thing in place of the Charter, so that if neither the Precept nor
Retour be required, nor yet the continuance of the Seising, either stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Person of the first Heir, or renewed in the Persons of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
Heirs, which certainly is of purpose put to astruct the Right in place
of a Charter, or other Adminicle of the Seising, and therefore the standing
of the Seisings is not here opposed to their being Reduced, but their falling
by the Death of the Person Infeft, whereby according to the ordinar
Terms of Law, the Fee falleth in Waird or Nonentry in the hands of the
Superior; neither can a subsequent Heir Possess by the Seising of a prior
Heir, because Seisings are not given to Heirs, but to the individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Seised; but Charters and other Rights given to Parties and their Heirs
may be a Title to their Heirs to Possess, but not a naked Seising; and as to
the inconvenience, it would be far greater if one single Seising were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and would open the Door to all Forgery, after Parties and Witnesses
are Dead, but if more Seisings be required, if the first Person Die, it is
much more difficult to Forge diverse Seisings, by diverse Nottars, and diverse
Witnesses, which may be redargued by the Hand-writ of some of the Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
or survivance of some of the Witnesses; and what is alleadged upon
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:55692:367"/>
a Seising continuing thirty nine years, or of six subsequent Seisings within
that time is easily retorted by consideration of one Seising, whereby the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Infeft Lived and Bruiked but a year, whethet that would be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Title for prescription, or if six consequent Seisings proceeding upon
Charters and thirty nine years Possession, yea, or a hundred years Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all which would make no Title of prescription, unless a Charter were
also produced, as is clear by the Act, so we are not to consider equivalencies,
but in a Statute must take it as it is made, and not make it; and as for the
inconvenience alleadged that there must necessarly be intervales, it imports
not, for the continuance of Seisings is not required to be so exact as the
continuance of Possession, but subsequent Heirs being Infeft, albeit there be
an intervale, their Seising as in many other cases will be drawn back to the
Death of their Predecessor, if there be no <hi>medium impedimentum</hi> by any
Process intented in the <hi>interim;</hi> so that at least there must be a Seising
standing when the Possession begane, and a Seising standing when the first
fourty years is compleat, but here there was no Seising renewed, though

It was answered for the Executrix, that the alleadgeance of Homologation

yet he hath done no Diligence upon his Arrestment; whereas the Justice
Clerk hath obtained Decreet, and as Donator to the Liferent Escheat,
he is preferable for years after the Rebellion, because the Liferent
Escheat falling before any Infeftment, or Charge on the Appryzing,
which was not used within year and day, the Liferent excludes the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzer.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Appryzing preferable to the posterior Arrestment,
though no legal Diligence was done thereon for the space of nine years
thereafter, in respect the Appryzing being a Judicial Assignation, required
no Intimation, and being prior, it is preferable: and they did not respect
that single Practique, the constant Custom since being contrary: But found
the Liferent Escheat preferable to the anterior Appryzing, being without
Infeftment or Charge, as to the years after the Rebellion, and preferred the
Appryzer as to years preceeding.</p>

               <p>The Lords restricted the Letters to Re-possession and ordinar profits

having obtained Certification in the Improbation, at Chancellour <hi>Hays</hi>

               <p>The Pursuer Replyed, <hi>First,</hi> That the Decreet of Certification produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was not Relevant, because it was not a Certification in an Improbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was not concluded by the Summons, as they are exprest in the
Decreet, which bear, That the Writs called for, should be cancelled,
and declared null, but bears not that the same should make no Faith,
or should be declared as False, Forged or Feinzied. <hi>2dly,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hay</hi> the
Defenders Author, by accepting of the Feu-duty for a Term after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
did pass therefrom, and did acknowledge and Homologate the Pursuers
Right, and did acknowledge the Liferenters Right, by Excambion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
The Defender answered, that he opponed his Decreet of Certifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Decernator whereof, is expresly in the Terms of an Improbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And likewise the beginning of the Libel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being both at the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

<pb n="730" facs="tcp:55692:371"/>
insisted for improving the Writs called for, so that the Repetition of the
Conclusion of the Libel, hath been only through Inadvertence, not fully set
down. And as to the Discharge of the Feu-duty, <hi>First,</hi> It is Vitiat in the Date.
<hi>2dly,</hi> It wants Writer and Witnesses, and albeit it were Holograph, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
instruct the true Date, and it can never import a passing from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
further, then for the Term Discharged, especially seing it was
granted by Doctor <hi>Hay,</hi> who was singular Successor to the Chancellour,
and perhaps knew not of the Improbation. The Pursuer answered, that
the Certification being granted in absence, the Obtainer thereof might
frame it as he pleased; but it cannot be supposed to be truly better then
as it stands: and though Improbations being in absence, are very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to, yet they are odious Rights and very Reduceable upon any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or Informality, seing it is formality that gives them all their strength.
And as to the Discharge, the Date of it hath been altered at the Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Subscribers hand, as appears by comparing the Date and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
<hi>2dly,</hi> In the very Body of the Discharge, no ways altered, it
bears to Discharge the year 1624. after the Certification, and the Discharge
as it stands, is in the ordinar way as Discharges uses to be given to Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents

a case so favourable for the Pursuer who has a clear Right, and should
not be eleided by this dubious Certification, which must be restricted to a
Certification in a Reduction, which is only Reducing the Rights till they be
produced, and so falls, they being now produced.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Defense upon the Certification, in respect

being to find out the Person of the Witness, that he might be adduced in the

               <head>Sir, Francis Scot of Thirlstoun contra Lord Drumlanrig.
Iune 10. 1671.</head>
               <p>SIr <hi>Francis Scot</hi> having obtained Decreet of Adjudication of the Lands
of <hi>Brankinside</hi> and others, and having Charged the Lord <hi>Drumlanrig</hi>
to receive and Infeft him. He Suspends on this Reason, that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to satisfie the Sums contained in the Adjudication, upon Assignation
made to him thereto, and so was not obliged to receive the Charger. It
was answered, that albeit King <hi>Iames</hi> the third, his Act of Parliament anent
Appryzings, doth provide, that for a years Rent, Superiours shall receive
Appryzers, or otherways shall take the Land to themselves and pay the
Sums; yet that gives not the Superiour an option, but bears failzying of
paying a years Rent, the Superiour may satisfie the Sums, and take the
Land in his own hands, but where that was offered, it was never by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
or Practique allowed, that the Superiour should exclude an Appryzer, but
whatever were in the case of Appryzings, that power was never granted to
Superiours in Adjudications, whereupon they were still obliged to receive
Adjudgers without a years Rent, until the late Act of Parliament, and the
said old Statute giving an option to the Superiour, is not to be extended
to Adjudications; nor was it ever by any subsequent Law, or Consuetude
extended thereto. It was answered that by the ancient Feudal Law, a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
could not have been compelled to receive a stranger Vassal, albeit
a Creditor, yet the Statute of King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> did remeid this in favours
of Creditors, and obliged Superiours either to receive Appryzers for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a years Rent, or else to pay the Sum Apprysed for; but long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that time, there was no mention of Adjudications, which were a Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords, that where the appearand Heir being Charged, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunce,
the Creditor should not be frustrate, but might obtain Adjudication
of the Lands, <hi>contra haereditatem jacentem,</hi> which except as to that point of
Form, is the same with an Appryzing, under another Title: and albeit as
to the years Entry, the Lords would not extend the same to an Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
It was upon this special Reason, that in the Act of Parliament 1621.
anent Appryzings, the same is declared Redeemable upon the Sums Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzed
for, and a years Rent for the Entry; yet in the very next Act in the
same Parliament anent Adjudications, the years Entry is left out, which was
thought by the Lords to be done by the Parliament of purpose, and so not
to be extended by the Lords: But otherways the same Reason was for the
Entry in Adjudications as in Appryzings, which the Parliament has now
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:55692:372"/>
found by their late Act; and therefore the matter of the Entry is not to be
drawn in consequence to the Superiours option.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Superiour had his option, and might refuse to
receive the Adjudger, offering to satisfie the Sums in his Adjudication,
upon Assignation made to him thereof, and declared that the same should
be Redeemable from the Superiour upon the like Sums without any thing
for a years Entry; and that in all things else, the Superiour and Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal

him to go to the River by Boat, and over to <hi>Fife</hi> another Shire; and
ordinarly to go to the Street, and to Taverns without necessar Affairs. The
Defenders answered, that the Prisoner returned still to the Prison every
night, and went always abroad with a Guard, and his going to the Water
was because of his Indisposition, and for his Health, that if he touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other side in <hi>Fife,</hi> he did return that same night to Prison: and
that his going to the Kirk with a Keeper, can be no Relevant Ground; and
even the going out upon other occasions with a Keeper, though not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessar, cannot make the Magistrates lyable, it being the constant
Custom of all Burghs so to do, and that a Prisoner being under a Guard,
is in Prison, albeit not in the Tolbooth. The Pursuers answered, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
of Burghs were but publick Servants in Keeping of Prisoners, and
were obliged to give punctual Obedience to the Letters of Caption, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to keep the Rebel in sure Firmance within their Tolbooth, which is
founded on very good Reason, that the Prisoner may be necessitate, <hi>squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore
carceris,</hi> to do all Deeds in his power to satisfie his Debt, which would
be eluded, if the Magistrates at their pleasure might let them go out with a
Guard, and would but turn to a Confynement, or intertainment and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to an Officer for a Guard: and even though there were necessar
Causes of the Prisoners coming out, the Magistrate is not Judge thereof, nor
has any power of it, but the Party ought to apply themselves to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
or Session, and obtain their Warrand, which will not be granted even
by them, but upon instruction of a necessar Cause, upon Oath of Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
or others. The Defenders answered, that Incarceration was a civil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Law, and no punishment, and that it were against all humanity,
to put Prisoners for civil Debt in that condition, that the Magistrates could
not let them out for a little, even for the safety of their Life, in extremity
of sickness, which oftimes would not admit of delay, till application were
made to the Council or Session. <hi>2dly,</hi> Whatsoever may be found just by
the Lords in time coming, yet the constant and universal Custom of this
and all other Burghs, to let Prisoners go out with a Guard when they saw
convenient cause, did introduce a priviledge to Burghs, or put the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
in <hi>bona fide,</hi> to Act as all their Predecessors had been accustomed
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:55692:372"/>
to do, without any question or Decision in the contrair, and alleadged
a late Practique in the case of the Town of <hi>Culross,</hi> who suffering a Prisoner
that was a poor man, to go out to an Hospital, where he got Bread, and
thence he immediatly returned to Prison, and to go and see his nearest Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that was a dying in the Town, or to their Burial, was not found lyable
for the Debt.</p>
               <p>The Lords considering the ordinary Custom of Burghs, found that as to
the time past they would not find them lyable for suffering Prisoners to go
out with a Guard for any necessar cause, and found the Defense Relevant,
that this Prisoner was let go out with a Guard for his health, or to the Kirk
on the Sabbath, but found that Member of the Condescendence Relevant,
that he went out to the Street and Taverns without a necessar Cause, though
with a Guard, Relevant to infer the Debt: But found that in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they would have no regard to that unwarrantable Custome; but that
Magistrates of Burghs should only have power to let Prisoners come out
of the Tolbooth under a Guard in the extream hazard of their Life by

It was Replyed that the Disposition being between most conjunct

was not Infeft, but upon the very same day that the Disposition was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Right by progress comes in the Person of <hi>Iames Menzies,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
<hi>Roberts</hi> Brother. The Pursuer insisted for the Duties of the Land,
over and above the fourscore pounds, during the Life of old <hi>Iames Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies,</hi>
and over and above the Tack-duty of five merks after his Death: For
which the Defender alleadged Absolvitor, because he produces a Decreet
at his instance against <hi>Creightoun</hi> the Tacks-man, Decerning him to Remove,
because he was then resting several Terms Rent, and failed to pay the same,
and to find Caution to pay the same in time coming. The Pursuer answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the said Decreet was in absence, and was null, because the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
Libelled upon his own Infeftment, and upon a Tack set to <hi>Creigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>
the Tacks-man by himself, and there was no such Tack produced by
him, or could be produced, because the Tack, albeit it bear to be set by
<hi>Iames Menzies,</hi> yet it was only set by <hi>James Menzies</hi> his Father, and not
by himself.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Decreet null by Exception.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Defender alleadged that the Decreet at least, was a colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Title, and he possessed by it <hi>bona fide</hi> till it was found null, <hi>&amp; bonae fidei
possessor facit fructus consumptos suos.</hi> It was answered, that a Title that needs
Reduction, may be the Ground for Possession <hi>bona fide:</hi> but this is absoltely
null by Exception. <hi>2dly,</hi> The obtainer of the Decreet was <hi>in pessima fide,</hi> because
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:55692:374"/>
imediatly after the obtaining it, it was Suspended, and the Tacks-man was
able to instruct that there was no Duties resting at that time, and though
Protestations were obtained, yet the Suspension was never Discust against the
Tacks-man.</p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled this Defense also.</p>
               <p>The Defender further alleadged, that albeit he would make no opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the first Tack, yet the second Tack could have no effect against
him, because, before it was cled with Possession, <hi>Robert Menzies</hi> setter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
was denuded in favours of <hi>Birthwood,</hi> from whom the Defender has Right,
and it is unquestionable, that a Tack not attaining Possession, is no real Right,
and that a singular Successor, Infeft before Possession on it, will exclude
it. <hi>2dly,</hi> As the Tack was not cled with Possession, so <hi>Robert</hi> who set it
had no real Right in his Person when he set it, but only the Decreet Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral.
The Pursuer answered to the first, that he opponed his new Tack,
which contained not only a Ratification of the old Tack, but a new Tack
<hi>de presenti,</hi> for five merk, and so was like a Charter by a Superiour
with a <hi>novo damus,</hi> whereby the Tacks-man might ascribe his Possession to
any of the Tacks he pleased; and if this Tack had born expresly, a Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Fathers Liferent for eighty pounds yearly, it would have
been unquestionably a valide Tack from the Date, and Payment to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Reservation, would be by vertue of the new Tack, as well as
of the old: So likewise the Tacks-man might Renunce the old Tack, and
retain the new; or if the new Tack had been taken without mention of
the Old, the same would have been cled with Possession, albeit it could not
effectually exclude the payment of fourscore pounds to the Father, during his
life, as having a better Right by the Reservation. As to the second Alleadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
albeit <hi>Robert</hi> who set the Tack, was not Infeft when he set it; yet
<hi>Robert</hi> being thereafter Infeft, his Right accresced to the Tacks-man in the
same manner, as if he had been Infeft before, <hi>fictione juris.</hi> It was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the first, that the new Tack did not bear a Reservation of the old,
but the Tacks-man having two Tacks in his Person at once, although he
might quite either of them, or declare to which of them he ascribed his Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
before the interest of any other Party: yet not having so done,
he must be holden to Possess by the first, because he continued to pay
the Tack-duty of the first, and never payed the Tack-duty of the second
till the Setter was Denuded. To this it was answered, that the payment
to the Liferenter, who had a better Right, did not import the Possessing
by the first Tack, and the Tacks-man needed not declare his option till he
was put to it, but Law presumes that he Possessed by that Right, which was
most convenient for him.</p>
               <p>As to this Point the Lords found that the Tacks-man might ascribe his
Possession to either of the Tacks he pleased, both of them being set for a
distinct Tack-duty, and that <hi>agibatur</hi> by the second Tack, that the Fathers
Liferent should be Reserved.</p>
               <p>As to the other Point, The Defender alleadged that the Infeftment of
<hi>Robert</hi> who set the Tack, could not accresce to the Tacks-man; because
the same day <hi>Robert</hi> was Infeft, he was Denuded in favours of <hi>Birthwood,</hi>
and he Infeft; so that it must be presumed, that he was only Infeft to that
effect, that <hi>Birthwoods</hi> Right might be valide. <hi>2dly,</hi> It was offered to be
proven, that <hi>Birthwood</hi> procured <hi>Roberts</hi> Infeftment by his own Means, and
so it cannot accresce to any other in his prejudice. It was answered, that
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:55692:375"/>
whoever procured the Infeftment of the Common Author, the fiction of
Law did draw it back to all the Deeds done by that Author, that might arise
from that Infeftment, which cannot be divided or altered, by the Acting or
Declaration of either, or both Parties.</p>
               <p>Which the Lords found Relevant, and found the Infeftment did accresce
to the Tacks-man in the first place, whose Tack was prior with absolute
Warrandice.</p>

<hi>Balmerino:</hi> Who having Suspended on this Ground, that the Annualrent
being out of two Tenements, whereof he had but the one, he could be only
lyable but for the one half.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the Annualrenter might Distress any of the Tenements

               <p>Whereupon <hi>Balmerino</hi> now pursues <hi>Little Prestoun</hi> to Repay him the half

they being now in different Heretors hands, behoved to infer a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional
Relief, as is ordinar in all Annualrents, Constitute upon any Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony
or Tenement, which thereafter comes to be divided. The Defender
alleadged Absolvitor, because he had bruiked his Tenement much more
then fourty years before this Pursuit, free of any such Annualrent; and
therefore had prescribed the freedom thereof. The Pursuer answered, that
Prescription was hindered by the Annualrenters Possession, in getting his
Annualrent, which though it had been but by a Personal Obligement, it
would have preserved his Right intire to all effects in the same manner, as
payment by a principal Debitor hinders the Cautioners Bond to Prescribe,
though he were free thereof for fourty years. It was answered, that albeit
there might be ground for the Reply, where the Annualrent is Constitute
out of one Barony or Tenement, whereon Infeftment may reach the whole,
yet it cannot hold in this case, where the Annualrent is Constitute upon
two distinct Tenements; and where there behoved Seasing to be taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both of them, and if omitted upon one, that would be free.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that payment of the Annualrent out of any of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements,

so in real Rights, for if any person have many Rights to Lands, and doth
thereafter accept a Disposition of a part of the Lands in satisfaction of all
his interest, that does not Renunce his former Rights to that Land, but he
may defend himself with them all. So here accepting of Lands in satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of a Terce, does not Renunce the Terce, as to the Lands accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>2dly,</hi> Albeit this Clause could import the Renuncing of all Terce,
that can never be extended to the benefite of the Superiour, nor can
it be understood the Contracters mind, to exclude the Wife from the
Terce, to make it accresce to the Superiour, in both their prejudices,
because the Husband by the Warrandice, must make out the Joynture.
<hi>3dly,</hi> Albeit the Renunciation could be profitable to the Superiour, yet
it being by this Clause in the Contract, the Superiour cannot question the
Ladies Infeftment, which is the cause of the Renunciation, but must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the whole Clause, <hi>nam qui approbat non reprobat.</hi> It was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the common Sense of this Clause of acceptance does still import
a full Renunciation, neither can the intention, or meaning of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
import any thing, unlesse they had acted accordingly; for it had
been easie for them to have said, but prejudice of the Terce, as to thir
Lands; so that the Terce being Renunced, the Renunciation is profitable
to all Parties having Interest, because the Right thereby Renunced is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
extinct: Neither needs the Superiour approve the Infeftment Un-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
by making use of the Renunciation, for as there could be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for that upon the naked Clause, without any Infeftment, so the
meaning can only be, that if the Clause had been perfected by a valide
Infeftment, he could not have quarrelled it.</p>
               <p>The Lords preferred the Superiour, and found the acceptance a full
Renunciation of the Terce, both as to the Lands accepted, and others.</p>

recommended the same to his Son, now Justice Clerk; he gave a Bond to
the said <hi>Helen</hi> of two thousand Merks, payable upon Requisition of fourty
days; the said <hi>Helen</hi> pursued Registration of the Bond, wherein it being
alleadged that any Requisition made was past from, by acceptance of Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alrent
for Terms after.</p>
               <p>The Lords Assoilzied from that Charge, until Requisition were made,
and new Requisition being made since, before the Extracting the Absolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
The Lords Sustained the same. It was further alleadged Absolvitor,
because the Bonds granted by the Father was done on Death-bed, and
the Bond granted by the Defender his Son was in his Minority, and he
had Reduction depending upon the saids two Reasons. The Pursuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that the Defender had Homologat the Bond in question by a poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Contract, whereby he had appointed a yearly payment to his Mother,
in satisfaction of this and the other Portions. The Defender duplyed, that
that Contract was no Homologation, being Subscribed by him when he
was Minor, having Curators, without their Consent, and so is null by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
The Pursuer triplyed, that the Defender had Homologat the said
Contract and Bond in question by these Deeds. <hi>First,</hi> That after Majority
he had payed Annualrent. <hi>2dly,</hi> That he had pursued Exhibition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistration
of the said Contract, and thereupon had obtained the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat,
and the Decreet Decerns Letters to be Direct at his Instance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
It was answered, that the payment of the Annualrent, albeit voluntar,
though it may exclude repetition of it self, it cannot infer Homologation of
the whole Bond, especially the payment being made by a Brother to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent
Sister. <hi>3dly,</hi> Payment of Annualrent cannot Homologat a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
which is null by exception. <hi>4thly,</hi> Any payment that was made, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Decreet of Registration, and so necessar; and as to the Exhibition,
the pursuing for a Delivery of a Writ doth not import the approbation of
the contents of it, but only a calling for it, because the Writ belongs to
the Subscriber thereof, though he may quarrel the obligement therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and albeit the Writ was ordained to be Registrat, yet there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Charge nor Execution used thereupon.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the payment of the Annualrent in manner foresaid not
to import Homologation, but they found that a Writ Subscribed by a Minor
without Consent of his Curators, as it might be Ratified, so it might be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologat,
and that it was <hi>de facto</hi> Homologat by this Decreet of Registra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
containing neither Reservation nor Protestation for quarrelling the
Writ Registrat. It was further alleadged, that the new Requisition was
null, bearing to proceed on a Procutry, and not bearing the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
produced. It was answered, the Procutry was not called for,
and that the having of the Writs, which the Requisition mentioned, did
import a Power to Require. <hi>2dly,</hi> This is a Dilator after a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptor.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the alleadgeance upon the nullity of the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition

certain of his Creditors, that he might not be necessitate to enter Heir, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the event of this Plea, pursues a Reduction of the said Disposition, as
being on Death-bed. The Defender alleadged, <hi>First,</hi> That the Reason
of Reduction, as it is Libelled, is not Relevant, that the Defunct contracted a
deadly Disease before the making of the Disposition, and that he Died of the
said Disease, which is not Relevant, unless the particular Disease were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
upon, otherwise it will remain conjectural and unsure, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
cannot distinctly Depone whether he was sick or not, specially he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an oldMan, so that they could not distinguish betwixt sicknesse and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
through old age. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Reason is not Relevant, unless the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
were alleadged to be <hi>morbus sonticus,</hi> that might affect the Mind, and
infer a weaknesse, which is different from Fatuity or Insensibility. <hi>3dly,</hi>
The Defender alleadged Absolvitor, because he offered him to prove that
the Defunct was in Health the time of the Disposition, at least in as good
Health as he had been for several years or moneths before, when he did
go ordinarly abroad to Kirk and Mercat, about all his Affairs, at least if
he had any indisposition, it was not <hi>impedimentum rebus agendis,</hi> because it is
offered to be proven that he constantly put on his Cloaths, and walked up
and down his House, convoyed Strangers to their Chambers freely without
being helped or supported, and in the same manner went down with others
to their Horse to the Green, made several Accompts and Bargains, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Played at Cards, all which must necessarly infer his Health, unless
a circumstantial Disease were condescended upon and proven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> The
Defender offered to prove that after the Disposition, the Defunct went
to Kirk and Mercat, at least to one or other of them, which the Law hath
allowed as unquestionable evidences of Recovery of Health, and which
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:55692:377"/>
therefore is Relevant, though Sicknesse was specially proven to have been
Contracted before, and condescends that the Disposition being Dated the
eight of <hi>December</hi> 1668. upon the <hi>Thursday</hi> immediatly after, the Defunct went
to the Mercat of <hi>Couper,</hi> it being the Mercat day, and upon the Sabbath
thereafter heard Sermon in the Kirk of <hi>Couper.</hi> The Pursuer answered, that
this Reason of Reduction is most Relevant, and in the same Terms, that the
Reason of Death-bed has alwayes been Libelled; neither was it ever found
necessar to condescend upon <hi>morbus sonticus,</hi> but as <hi>Craig</hi> expresses it <hi>sufficit si
morbus precedat &amp; mors sequatur,</hi> before the Defunct go abroad, yet <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batis
extremis presumuntur media,</hi> it is still presumed that so long as the Defunct
after the Disease remained within Doors, that the Disease continued, and
that <hi>presumptione juris &amp; de jure,</hi> neither doth it admit a contrare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
by alleadging that the Party convalesced <hi>medio tempore,</hi> otherwise
then by his going out to publick Meetings at Kirk and Mercat, nor is there
any necessity to condescend on the kinds of Diseases, which even Physitians
themselves, and the most skilful can hardly determine. And as to the first
Defense, offering to prove that the Defunct was in Health, it is contrare to the
Libel, and no ways competent, for in the case of contrare alleadgeances,
the Pursuer offering to prove Sickness, and the Defender offering to prove
Health at the same time, the Pursuer as being in the Libel must be preferred,
especially considering that where such Deeds are procured through impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
from Sick and Weak Persons, who would do any thing to get leave
to Die in peace, the Contrivers by the same facility may debar the accesse
of any, but such as they have confidence in, and who have cuncurred with them in
the Contrivance, so that the Disponers Sicknesse is <hi>difficillimae probationis,</hi> yet
<hi>quaelibet probatio sufficit,</hi> as in this case within a day or two of the Disposition, my
Lord was put to violent nature to attempt to go to the Mercat, and three days
after to the Kirk, in both which attempts he failed, which doth sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
presume that he was Sick before, and was not able to cover his Sicknesse
for a little time to attain the Evidences that Law requires to infer Health,
but if a contrare probation should be Sustained, or preferred as more pregnant,
and which would be by familiar Persons in the House, and concurrers in the
Contrivance, this ancient and excellent Law would easily be elided, and
as to the evidences of Health they are no way Relevant, neither are any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
acts, but the Law hath justly determined that the Disponer must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
publickly in the solemnest Meetings, that thereby it may be known
that he is able to abide the Air, and that matters of this importance be not
probable by two picked out prepared Witnesses, but that the samine be
cleared by the whole Witnesses of a Kirk or Mercat, which cannot all be
Brybed, and no few Witnesses dare adventure to Depone against that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
knowledge, so that no private or domestick acts in or about the House
can be equivalent to coming to Kirk and Mercat. And as to the second
Defense, that the Defunct came out to Kirk and Mercat, it ought to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
because the pursuer offers to prove that he was supported. The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
answered, that the Reply was not Relevant, unlesse it were condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>quomodo</hi> supported, and that it was by upholding the Defunct under
the Oxter, or by the Elbow, but it is not Relevant to alleadge that the
Defunct took any of the Company by the hand, or that they took him
by the hand, especially if it was in rugged or uneven places, in respect of the
Defuncts age, and that it is offered to be proven that he was ordinarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to take these who walked with him by the hand in such places,
and for this there was alleadged a Practique lately done by the Lords betwixt
<hi>Pargilleis</hi> and <hi>Pargilleis,</hi> whereby a Disposition by <hi>Pargilleis</hi> was Sustained,
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:55692:378"/>
because he came to the Mercat of <hi>Calder,</hi> albeit he was helped to and
from his Horse, and up and down the Stairs, and that he was not able to tell
Money, and was never at the Kirk thereafter: and likewise a Practique in
<hi>Anno</hi> 1647. was alleadged, whereby <hi>Graham</hi> Merchant in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made a Disposition to his Wifes Daughter, the same was Sustained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he Lived a long time and did his Affairs in the House, and wrote the
Disposition, being two or three sheet of Paper, all with his own hand, which
is found sufficient though he did not go out to Kirk or Mercat. The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer
answered, that the Reply was most Relevant, even though the support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were only by the hand, for albeit where there were reiterat acts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad without design, such circumstances would not be noticed, yet
where the going abroad was so near to the Disposition, and evidently done
to validate the same, it hath been <hi>ultimus conatus naturae,</hi> and hath not been
of custom, but of necessity, so that when such an attempt is made of design,
if the Disponer have not so much strength as to walk without the help of any
hand, it infers clearly the weaknesse and continuance of the Disease. The
Defender repeated his alleadgeance, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d offered to prove that not only the
Defunct went out to Kirk or Mercat, but that he went freely by his own
strength, no Body touching him.</p>
               <p>The Lords being desirous that neither Party should have the sole proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by picking out such Witnesses as made most for them, but that all the
Witnesses might be adduced, did before answer appoint either Party to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Witnesses to instruct the Defuncts condition the time of the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and thereafter, and anent the manner of his going abroad, and there
being a great multitude of Witnesses adduced by either Party, the Lords con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the Relevancy and Probation both together, by which the Lords found
that the Reason of Reduction was relevantly Lybelled, and that it was sufficiently
proven, that the Defunct had contracted the Disease whereof the Died before the
Disposition; and as to the Defense and Reply the Witnesses proved all clearly, that
he was supported to the Kirk, and from it, and that he fell a swoond in his return,
but the Lords found it not necessare that the Defunct should both go to Kirk
and Mercat unsupported, but that either was sufficient, but that where
both was attempted shortly after, and upon design, the manifest failing in the
attempt in going to the Kirk, did much weaken the prior attempt in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Mercat: As to which the Lords did consider that the going free
to the Mercat behoved to include the free going to the Mercat place, and
returning back from the same, not being supported in any place of the way,
so that albeit many Witnesses Deponed the Defunct walked freely, none
being by him in some parts of the way coming and going, there was no
number of Witnesses that proved his walking freely all the way coming
and going, even while he was within the Town, but that many Witnesses
proved that he was supported, some in the whole way, and some as to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places, some by the Oxter, some by the Elbow, and most by the
hand.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Lords found the Reply Relevant of supporting even by the
hand, in any place of the way within the Town, whether Even or Rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and found the same sufficiently proven, and therefore Reduced the
Disposition, albeit the Defuncts custom to take those who walked with him
by the hand was also proven, whereunto they had no regard, this going
to Mercat being so soon after the Disposition, and so evidently of design
to validat it, and the Defunct never having gone out after, except to the
Kirk when he was supported, and fell a swoond; and as to the Practique,
that in <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. was not produced, but it was in consideration of a
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:55692:378"/>
Sum left to the Church by that Disposition, and was generally cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
by all Persons, yet <hi>una hirundo, &amp;c.</hi> And as for <hi>Pargilleis</hi> Case,
the Lords perused the whole Debate and Testimonies, and found that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilleis</hi>
Lived near a Mile from <hi>Calder,</hi> and that being an old Guttish Man
he was accustomed to be helped to and from his Horse, and that he Rode
to the Town, but that he Lighted then and walked freely through the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,
and up a Brae to my Lord <hi>Tarphichans</hi> House, and returned again to
his Horse without any help, either by the hand or otherwise, and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not that he was helped up and down Stairs, or to and from his Horse,
which the Law doth not require, but only the going freely from the
Entry of the Town to the Mercat place, and back again unsupported.</p>
               <p>The Lords did also find none of the private acts alleadged upon Relevant
to prove Health, or equivalent to going to Kirk or Mercat, and that there
was no necessity to condescend on particular Diseases.</p>

in the Pass, and other Goods, <hi>viz.</hi> 15. Hogs-heads of Wine, and a quantity
of Wine and Brandy wine, and Paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the Ship in question was not

in the Pass, albeit none of these saids points be Material<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor did infer
that the Ship, or Loading, or any part thereof did belong to the Kings Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but did belong to the <hi>Swedes</hi> his Allies and Confederats, so that
albeit they had had no Pass, or an unformal Pass, their Goods could not
be taken from them, there being no Article in the Treaty declaring, that
the not having a full and formal Pass should make such Ships Prize, but only
that the having thereof should keep them from all question or inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The Defender alleadged Absolvitor, because the Decreet of Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was justly and Warrantably given, for Contrivances the time of the
War being most ordinar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Dutch</hi> did frequently palliat their Trading un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretence of the Kings Allies; and in this Case it is evident, that the
time of the Pass this Ship was in <hi>Holland,</hi> of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Build belonging to
an <hi>Hollander</hi> Residing there, and no pretence of Buying the same by a <hi>Swede</hi>
for a long time after, as appears by the vendition produced, which does
not bear that the Ship was sold to any <hi>Swede,</hi> or for their use, but to a
<hi>Swedish</hi> Factor in <hi>Holland,</hi> without mentioning to whose use, and so is justly
suspect to have been for an other <hi>Dutchmans</hi> use, especially being found
Navigable with three <hi>Dutchmen</hi> in the Company, and no <hi>Swede</hi> hath ever
yet declared upon Oath that this Ship and Goods belonged to them, for
by a Certificat of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Chamber of Commerce produced, that two

                  <hi>Swedes</hi> did declare that they intended to Buy a Ship in <hi>Holland,</hi> called the

the blew <hi>Lilly</hi> belongs to themselves and no other, and by the vendition the
Name of the Ship was not the blew <hi>Lilly,</hi> so that all hath been but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
and that there is nothing produced that necessarly evinces that
the Ship and Goods belonged to the <hi>Swedes</hi> only, and seing the Pass is so
palpably false in all the substantial points required by the Treaty, and by the
Oath of the Pursuer himself, he cannot cloath himself with the Treaty, which
he hath so grossly transgressed, nor hath he adduced sufficient proof that
the Ship and Goods belonged to the <hi>Swedes.</hi> And whereas it is alleadged,
that the being Sailed with <hi>Hollanders</hi> is no ground of Seisure by the Treaty, the
same is opponed, which in the next Article to that alleadged upon for not
enquiring in the Men and Goods, bears that Seisure shall not be made where
such a Pass is <hi>nisi gravis suspitio subsit,</hi> and there could be no better ground
of suspition, then that the Master when he was taken acknowledged the

a Decreet though pronunced, not being conditional to a day, but being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,

the Process is <hi>in statu quo prius.</hi> It was answered, that the stop doth
not recal the Decreet, but only hinders the Extract thereof till the Supplicant

be of very evil consequence if stopped Decreets were recalled, for then not
only wakening would be necessar, but in case the Parties should Die, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance

               <head>Laird of Balfour contra Mr. William Dowglasse. Iuly 4. 1671.</head>
               <p>THe Earl of <hi>Airlies</hi> Estate being Apprized by Mr. <hi>William Dowglasse</hi>
since 1652. after the Legal was expired Mr. <hi>William</hi> was Infeft, and
after his Infeftment, the Laird of <hi>Balfour</hi> Apprized the same Land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
pursues the Tennents for Mails and Duties. It was alleadged for the
first Apprizer that he must be preferred; <hi>First,</hi> Because he has the only
Right, having an Apprizing expired, and Infeftment thereon, before
the Pursuers Apprizing was Led, so that <hi>eo momento</hi> that he was Infeft upon
his expired Apprizing, the common Debitor was fully Denuded, and there
was no Right of Reversion, or any other in his Person that could be Appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereafter. It was answered, that by the Act of Parliament 1661. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Debitor and Creditor: It is provided that all Apprizings Led with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
year and day of the first effectual Apprizing shall come in therewith <hi>pari
passu,</hi> and therefore the Pursuer having Apprized within year and day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the first Apprizers Apprizing became effectual by Infeftment, he must
come in with him <hi>pari passu</hi> by the said Act, which makes no difference of
expired, or unexpired Apprizings, and by that same Act the Debitor is
not so Denuded by the expiring of the Legal and Infeftment, but that year
and day is still allowed to subsequent Apprizers, which in effect is a prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Legal as to Concreditors. It was answered, that the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is opponed, bearing that Apprizings before, or within year and day
after the first effective Apprizing shall come in <hi>pari passu,</hi> as if one Apprizing
had been Led for all, which necessarly imports the calculation of the year
to be from the date of the first effective Comprizing and not from the date
of the Infeftment or Diligence, for the coming in as if one Apprizing had been
for all, must relate to the Decreet of Apprizing, which as it is clear by the
Letter of the Statute, so also by the Narrative and Motive thereof, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Creditors did not know the condition of their Debitors Estate, which
might be Apprized before they could do Diligence, whereas before they had
only the benefit of Reversion, for remeed whereof the Parliament brings in
all Apprizings that are before, or within a year, after the first effectual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing,
which before would have carried the sole Propert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and <hi>factione
juris,</hi> states all these Apprizings as Led in one day, so that the remeed is
sufficient, by having a full year after the date of the Apprizing, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory
Statutes are to be strictly Interpret, and if the date of the Diligence
be the Rule, an Apprizing after twenty year might be brought to admit a
new one deduced after all that time, and not only so, but the Mails and
Duties would belong proportionally to the last Apprizer for twenty years
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:55692:380"/>
before it was Led. It was answered, that the year indulged by this Act
of Parliament to Concreditors, must be from the time the Apprizing is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
for the words of the Statute bears, all Apprizings before, or within
a year after the first effectual Comprizing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that the year must not run
from its being an Apprizing, but from its being an effectual Comprizing,
and so from the Infeftment or Diligence, neither is the inconvenience shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
otherwise, for the only way then known for publication of real Rights
was the Register of Seisings, and not the Register of the Allowance of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizings,
which is only made necessar by an Act since, and it is very easie
to make simulate executions of Apprizings, by taking away the Copies of
Denunciation of the Ground, and Citation at the dwelling House of the
Debitor, but if once a Seising be in the Register, all provident men take
notice thereof, and albeit a Charge be sufficient in stead of a Seising which
is not Registrat, yet the ordinar way of compleating Apprizings, which the
Law notices is Infeftment, and seing Apprizings are now rigorous Rights,
carrying any Estate without consideration of the value, Acts Correctory of
them ought to be extended <hi>ex aequo,</hi> and the more wayes Concreditors have
for getting notice of the Apprizing of their Debitors Estate the better, neither
are the evil consequences upon the other hand of any moment, it being the first
Apprizers fault (if not his fraud) that he obtains not Infeftment, or does
Diligence therefore, for he may of purpose lye dormant, not only till year
and day run, but untill the Legal expire, and thereby cut off the Diligences
of all other Creditors, as in this very case the irredeemable Right of an Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
shall be carried for 1500. pounds, and all the other Creditors excluded,
so that the Apprizing is so far from making the case better, that it makes
it much worse, as latent and fraudulent, for it cannot be imagined that
if the second Apprizer had known that the first Apprizing was Led, but
that he would have used Diligence within the year, at least within
the Legal, for so soon as he saw a Seising in the Register, he did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
Apprize.</p>
               <p>The Lords preferred the first Apprizer, and excluded the second,
and found that the year is to be reckoned from the date of the first effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Apprizing, and not from the Diligence, whereby it becomes effectual.
In this Process the Lords Sustained this Reply, that the first Apprizing
was to the behove of the common Debitor, or his eldest Son, and that they
would purge the same by payment of what Sums were truly payed for it
to the Apprizer, according to the said Act of Parliament 1661. without
any Reduction or Declarator.</p>

the lifting of the Money, neither yet a resolutive Clause in case the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer

for the Term of payment being her age of ten years, she might then lift

Clause cannot be interpreted as a naked Substitution, but as a condition of
the Bond, equivalent to that which is frequent in Provisions of Children,
and Contracts of Marriage, that in case the Party had no Children, the sum
should return, which was always interpret more than a single Substitution,

It was answered, that the first Citation made, was null, being at

they having the Oxen in question, in their peaceable Possession four Months,
they ought not to have been disturbed in their Peaceable Possession, in this

though he had had a Right or Warrand from the Appryzer, yet during

the Appryzers were satisfied by intromission, and what is wanting, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer

and what is wanting, the Pursuer will pay. The Defender answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that behaving as Heir, being an odious, universal, passive Title, any
colourable Ground is sufficient to restrict it to the value intrometted with.
And as to the offer to satisfie the Defender of the Appryzing, to which he
has Right. It is not competent, <hi>hoc ordine;</hi> for by the Act it is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced

<pb n="752" facs="tcp:55692:382"/>
of that part of the Act, bears it expresly to be in favours of Creditors, and
though the subsumption is only applyed to Appryzers, yet it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive,

and ought not to be prejudged.</p>
               <p>The Lords Sustained the Appryzing, and found the Requisition now

of the Succession is to the Mothers Heirs, yea, and to her Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
which necessarly imports, that she had power to Dispone. And it is
a general Rule in Succession of Conjunct-Feears, that that Person is Feear
upon whose Heirs the last Termination of the Tailzie or Provision ended,
especially in this Case, where the Right of the Tenement flowes from the
Womans Father. So that if there were any doubtfulness, it must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
that the Fathers meaning was to give the Fee to his Daughter,
having no other Children: Neither is this Land Disponed <hi>nomine dotis:</hi>
And the Defender stands Infeft by Precept of Favour, as Heir to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and thereby bruiks <hi>bona fide,</hi> and her Infeftment must Defend her till
it be Reduced. The Pursuer answered, that by the provision, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was Feear, and the Wife was only Liferenter, because though the
last Termination doth ordinarly rule the Fee: yet this is as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Rule, that in Conjunct Provisions, <hi>potior est conditio masculi,</hi> and
though the Termination be upon the Wifes Heirs whatsomever, yet they
are but Heirs of Provision to the Husband, and he might have Disponed,
and his Creditors may affect the Land, which holds in all Cases, except the
Lands had been Disponed by the Wife her self, without a Cause onerous.
But here the Husband is first named, and it is but a small parcel of Land,
beside which, there is no other Tocher; So that though it be not Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned,
<hi>nomine dotis,</hi> Yet being Disponed (for the which Causes) it is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
and in the same Contract, the Husband is obliged to provide all
Lands that he shall Acquire, or succeed to, to himself and his Wife, the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
liver of them two in Conjunct-fee or Liferent, and to the Heirs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, Which failzying, the one half to the Husbands Heirs, and
the other half to the Wifes Heirs and their Assigneys, and it cannot be
imagined, that the meaning of these Clauses was, that the Fee of the Mans
Conquest and Succession, should not be all Constitute in himself, but
that the Wife should be Feear of the half. And in like manner, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
meaning is clear, because the Clause bears not only in Contemplation
of the Marriage, but for sums of Money received by the Father, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
left blank in the Contract, yet it cannot be thought, that in such a
Narrative, he intended to make his Daughter Feear. And as for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of her Assigneys, it is only <hi>ex stilo,</hi> for Assigneys is ever added af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the last Termination of Heirs, and does always relate to all the Feears,
and would extend to the Heirs of the Marriage, their Assigneys as well, as
to the Wifes Heirs failing them. Likeas, Assigneys isin the same way adject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Clause of Conquest, wherein there is no ground to imagine that
the Wife is Feear: and both bears the Husband and Wife to be Infeft in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct-fee,

               <p>The Lords found that by this Provision, and Infeftment thereon, the
Husband was Feear, and the Wife only Liferenter, and found no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Discust upon the 31. day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1671. and only the manner of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Corruption of Witnesses, by prompting them how to Depone, or
by promising, or giving them Bribes, or any good Deed to Depone, more than
their ordinar Charges, remained undiscust. It was alleadged, that such Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

Witnesses adduced, or by the Oath of the Adducer: Neither in that case,
if the Witnesses adduced be above all exception, can Witnesses be adduced
against them, but only their own Oath, or Oath of the Party: So that
any Party that quarrels VVitnesses by Reprobators, ought to do the same
after they are adduced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and before Sentence; but if Sentence be once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunced,
and Extracted, it is <hi>res judicata, quaepro veritate habetur:</hi> And

the same can only be probable by the Oath of the Adducer: And nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Oath of the VVitnesses adduced, who cannot annull their own
Testimony, <hi>post jus quaesitum parti,</hi> nor by other VVitnesses: and if it were
otherwise, the greatest inconveniencies would follow: for then the Sentence
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:55692:384"/>
and Securities of the people, founded thereon, might for fourty years space
be quarrelled upon pretence of corruption, and singular Successors acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Termination of Process; for as the first Sentence may be Canvelled by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probators
against the Testimonies, whereupon it proceeded: so may the
second be Canvelled in the same manner by a second Reprobator, and so
without end. And seing the Law of this Kingdom hath been so jealous
of Probation by Witnesses, that it hath not allowed sums above 100. pounds
to be proven thereby: So Witnesses should not be admitted in Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
especially after Sentence. It was answered, that Reprobators being a
necessar remeed against the Partiality and Corruption of Witnesses: and
the question being only, the manner of Probation, by the Law of God and
all Nations, Witnesses are the general mean of Probation, and so ought to
take place in all Cases, where Law or Custom hath not restricted the same,
and it cannot be pretended, that ever there was one Decision of the Lords
finding Reprobators only probable <hi>scripto vel juramento:</hi> And it being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that Witnesses are competent, <hi>ante sententiam,</hi> there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Law nor Reason to refuse the same, <hi>post sententiam,</hi> especially with
us, where the Names of the Witnesses are never known till they be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
neither is their Testimonies published, or ever known before Sentence:
So that the other Party can have no interest to quarrel their Testimonies,
or know them before Sentence, and so Reprobators shall never be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
unless proven by the Oath of the Party, that hath Corrupted them,
which is as good as absolutely to refuse Reprobators; for it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that a Party will Corrupt Witnesses, and not resolve to deny it upon
Oath. And as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Author may be as hazardous to them as Witnesses: and if the acquirer
of the Sentence be denuded, if in that Case, even their Oath be not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
it is easie to Evacuat all Reprobators. And as for the inconvenience
of perpetuating Processes, that holds, whether Witnesses be receivable in
Reprobators before Sentence or after, and if admitting of Witnesses be so
qualified, that it be only when the Witnesses in the first Sentence, are
not above Exception, and the Witnesses in the Reprobators above all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,

only after Sentence, and with a liberty to the Obtainer of the
Sentence, to astruct the same by other Witnesses, or Evidences, as in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations;
for Reprobator is a kind of Improbation, there can be no
hazard of multiplying Reprobators, but this inconvenience, if it were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant,
would not only take away all Reprobators, but all Reductions,
for the Decreet Reductive may be quarrelled by a second Reduction, and
that by a third, and so without end. But the inconvenience on the other
hand is far greater, that all Parties will be sure to Corrupt VVitnesses,
if they do but resolve not to confess it, and VVitnesses will be easie to
be Corrupted, being secured against all Redargution: And whereas it
is pretended, that Witnesses with us prove not above 100. pounds, that is

Pursuer Replyed, that his tacite Relocation was interrupted by Inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

at the instance of the Earl of <hi>Hume,</hi> who was never in Possession of his
Teinds, whose Right he neither knew, nor was obliged to know, and the
Earl ought to have used Declarator against the Defender, and the Parson
of <hi>Fogo</hi> his Author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was the only habile way, and not the Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Lords Sustained the Processe upon the Inhibition, and restricted

possessory Judgement, because his Possession was not peaceable, in so far
as it was within the thirteen years, it was interrupted by the Pursuers
Inhibitions. The Defender answered, that he offered to prove thirteen
years Possession, at least seven years peaceable Possession, before any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
which is sufficient; for as thirteen years Possession makes a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
Title, <hi>decennalis &amp; triennalis possessor non tenetur docere de titulo:</hi>
yet where the Defender produces a Title, <hi>viz.</hi> a Presentation as Parson, he
is in the common Case of a possessory Judgement upon seven years Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Pursuer further Replyed, that albeit the seven years were peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and sufficient for a possessory Judgement; yet the Defender cannot
maintain his Possession by tacite Relocation, for he having no positive
Right in his Person, his Tack being Expired, he can only maintain his
Possession upon his Authors Right, as Parson, and so can be in no better
Case than his Author, who if he were compearing, not pleading the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of a possessory Judgement, he would be excluded by this Reply, that
he had acknowledged the Earls Right, and taken Assignation from him to
the Tack-duty, due by the Defender, which, though it would not be
sufficient after the Defenders Tack, to exclude the same, if it were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
yet it is sufficient against his tacite Relocation, which can only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
while his Author hath Right and Possession, and being but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
continuation of the Right, it is easily taken away by any Deed
of the Author. It was answered, that tacite Relocation being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:55692:385"/>
by Law, was as strong as a Prorogation, and continuation of
the Tack, which could not be prejudged by any posterior Deed of the

                  <hi>ANdrew Harlaw</hi> having obtained Decreet against <hi>Agnes Hume,</hi> as Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrix
to her Husband: She Suspends and raises Reduction on this
Reason, that the inferiour Judge did wrong in Decerning her, being only
Executrix Creditrix, as being lyable for the whole Inventar, because by
the Law and Custom of this Kingdom, Executors Creditors, who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
only for obtaining payment of their Debt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are lyable for no more
but what they intromet with above the Debt due to them, and are not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for further Diligence as other Executors: Yea it was found upon the
11. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1629. observed by <hi>Dury,</hi> that an Executor having no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
was not lyable for Diligence, but only to Assign in the Case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Nivin</hi> and <hi>Hodge.</hi> It was answered, that Executors Creditors are
lyable for intromission and omission as other Executors, because they accept
an Office, and exclude others who would be lyable for Diligence, and they
have no more advantage, but that they are preferred to others as being Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
and may pay themselves in the first place, and it would be of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
consequence, if their negligence should cause the interest of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
though Orphants, as well as Creditors to perish; and therefore the
Lords did justly in <hi>Anno</hi> 1667. in the Case betwixt <hi>Bisket</hi> and <hi>Greig,</hi> find
an Executor Creditor lyable for the whole Inventar, both for Intromissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Omission. It was answered, that it hath always been heretofore
holden, that Executors Creditors were not in the case of other Executors
as to Diligence, and that the ordinar Remeed was, that Creditors might
pursue the Executor Creditor, and thereupon would obtain Assignations to
any Debts in the Inventar they pleased, except such as had been uplifted
by the Executor, for their own payment; upon which Assignations they
did always pursue for themselves, so that there was neither Exclusion nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
to the Creditors, but on the contrair, they got Assignations, without
being at the trouble to Confirm: So that this Confirmation being many years
ago, it were against all Reason to make the Executors Creditors further ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than they were then esteemed to be, which might also be drawn back
against all Executors Creditors, which are very many.</p>
               <p>The Lords having considered the Decision betwixt <hi>Bisket</hi> and <hi>Greig,</hi> that
it was upon a recent Confirmation, and in favours of a Wife for her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
out of whose hands the Executor had recovered the Goods, though
she was a priviledged Creditor: They found that this Executor Creditor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long before Confirmed, was not lyable for Diligence, but only for Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and resolved to take it into consideration, whether Executors Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
in time coming, should be lyable for Diligence, and to consider the
inconvenience on both parts, and to make an Act of Sederunt thereanent.</p>

to them, from these appointed by their Fathers Testament, and this Earl of
<hi>Roxburgh</hi> being Heir of Tailzie to him, did in his Contract of Marriage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Pursuers Infeftment of this Annualrent, and did many years satisfie
and take Discharges of the same; and now she pursues the Earl, as contraverting
the payment for some years bygone, and in time coming during her Life.
The Defender alleadged absolvitor, because the Pursuer being competently
provided by her Contract of Marriage, this additional Provision was a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
betwixt Man and Wife, and so by the Law is Revockable at any time
during the Husbands Life, even upon Death-bed, or by his Testament, not
only by a direct Revocation, but by any thing that might import a change
of his mind, and accordingly he hath Revocked the same by his Testament
produced, adding only 5000. pounds to his Ladies Provision by her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and albeit thereafter the late Earl did Ratifie and acknowledge this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Provision, yet therein they were <hi>errore lapsi,</hi> not having known of
this Testament of the Lord <hi>Ker,</hi> at least not having understood that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
a Revocation of this Provision, and therefore may justly now Reclaim
against it. The Pursuer answered, that this Testament imported no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
which it did not mention, neither is the addition of 5000. pounds
therein an indirect Revocation, which must ever be by an inconsistent
Deed, but both these conditions are consistent, albeit that by the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it be <hi>modo inhabili,</hi> and it is very like that the Testator, being taken
with a great Fever, did not remember of this Provision, or added the other
5000. pounds on this consideration, that the former Provision was only to
take effect, after the Earl of <hi>Roxburghs</hi> Death; so that the Lord <hi>Kers</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
might probably be to add 5000. pounds during his Fathers Lifetime.
<hi>2dly,</hi> Though the Testament could import a Revocation, yet the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it self being Conditional, only to stand in case his Father returned
not to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and made use of the other Testament of the same date, all
the Tenor of it, and this restricting Clause, is affected with the same Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so that if the Testator had said that he had restricted his Ladies addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Provision to 5000. pounds in case his Father returned not, but in that
case left her to his Fathers provisions, it would be truly a conditional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
which Condition is purified by the Fathers Return, and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lady by his Ratification of this Bond of Provision, nor can it be
justly alleadged, that both this and that Earl were <hi>errore lapsi,</hi> seing the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
is produced by the Earl himself, and was never in the Ladies hands,
and doubtless it hath been advised by the late Earl ere he Ratified, who
was a most provident man, and his Ratification is dated at the <hi>Canongate,

<hi>errore lapsus,</hi> should be Relevant upon the ignorance, or mistake of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of a Writ; Ratifications should be of no effect, but any ground that might
defend the Ratifier before the Ratification, might annul the same upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

by the Death of the late Laird, and Minority of this Laird,
pursues the Tennents for Mails and Duties. Compearance is made
for the appearand Heir, as having Right by Disposition from his

alleadged that there could be no Waird, because <hi>Kirkonnel</hi> the Kings Vassal
was Denuded before his Death, and his Mother as Appryzer was Infeft. It
was answered <hi>first,</hi> That this Apprizing was upon a Bond granted by the
Defunct to his own Mother, for the behove of his Son, and appearand
Heir, without any onerous Cause, and so was null and simulat, and a fraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Contrivance, in prejudice of the King as Superiour, of his Casuality
of Waird, and that it was found in the Case of the Lord <hi>Colvil,</hi> that a Vassal hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
married his appearand Heir <hi>in lecto,</hi> It was found a Fraudulent precipitation
in defraud of the Waird. It was answered, that the alleadgeance was not Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
because there was nothing to hinder the Defunct to have Resigned in
favours of his appearand Heir, without any Cause onerous, or to grant
him a Bond that he might be Infeft upon Appryzing, or to grant such a
Bond to any Person to the Heirs behove, he being in <hi>leige poustie,</hi> and there
can be no presumption of Fraud, seing he might have obtained his Son In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft
directly, which the King refuses in no case, when the Granter is in <hi>leige
poustie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords Repelled the Alleadgeance for the Donator, and Sustained
the Appryzing.</p>
               <p>The Donator further alleadged, that by the Act of Parliament 1661. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Debitor and Creditor, It is provided, that the Debitor may cause the
Appryzer Restrict himself to as much as will pay his Annualrent, and the
Debitor may bruik the rest during the Legal; and now the Donator is in
place of the Debitor, so that what superplus there is more than will pay the
Appryzers Annualrent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must belong to the Donator. It was answered, that
this Clause is peculiar, and personal to Debitors, and cannot be extended
to Donators, who are not mentioned therein; because Debitors when they
crave Restriction, they are presumed as provident men, to uplift the rest
for satisfying the Appryzing, or their other Debts, or for their Subsistence,
and so being introduced wholly in their favours, it cannot be extended in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of the Donator to their prejudice: For if the Appryzer Possess all, the
superplus will satisfie the Appryzing; whereas, if the Donator uplift the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perplus,
the Debitor will be hudgely prejudged, neither the Appryzing, nor
any other Debt of his being satisfied thereby, nor his Heir intertained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="762" facs="tcp:55692:387"/>
The Lords found that this Clause could not be extended to a Donator,
and that there could not be a Waird, both by the Decease of the Appryzer
and Debitor.</p>
               <p>The Donator further alleadged, that the Appryzing was satisfied by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromission
within the Legal, which did extinguish the Appryzing, as to all
Effects and Purposes, as if it had never been, and all Parties return to their
Rights, as they were before the Appryzing; and so consequently the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
and his Donator has the Ward Duties, during the appearand Heirs
minority, after the Appryzing is extinct; for the Appryzing being but a
Collateral Security, like an Infeftment for Relief, it is <hi>jus resolubile,</hi> and doth
not fully Divest the Debitor, who needs not be Re-seased, as he would be
in the case of a Wodset holden publick, but the Debitors own Infeftment
Revives and stands valide, and the appearand Heir must be Infeft as Heir
to the Defunct, which cannot be till he be <hi>legitimae aetatis,</hi> after the Ward.
It was answered, that the Alleadgeance is not Relevant, unless the Appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had been satisfied in the Defuncts Life, for then his Infeftment would
have Revived: But if any thing remained due, the appearand Heir hath
the Right of Reversion as appearand Heir, and Intromission thereafter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Revive the Defuncts Infeftment.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that so soon as the Appryzing was extinct, whether
before the Defuncts Death or after, the Ward took effect, and the Donator
had Right.</p>

cause onerous, there is no ground for that Act to hinder any Debitor,
though Bankrupt, to prefer one Creditor to another, for if he had had
the Money, he might have payed any he pleased, and the Cause is both
just and necessary, because he might have been compelled by Law to have
done the same, and there was nothing to hinder the Creditor, but that as
he might have first Appryzed, so he might have taken the first Disposition
from his Debitor. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Pursuers Debt was for a Bargain of Victual

Iuly 21. 1671.</head>
               <p>IN this pursuit related the <hi>11th,</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> instant: It was further alleadged
for the Defender, that the Pursuer cannot purge his Appryzing, as now
being in the Person of the appearand Heir, by the Act of Parliament 1661
betwixt Debitor and Creditor, by payment of what truely the appearand
Heir payed, because the express Provision in that Act is, that where ever
the appearand Heir of the Debitor shall acquire Right to expired Appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
hereafter, which cannot extend to this case, because the Right to this
Apprizing was acquired before that Act, and because it was not an expired
Appryzing, but the Legal then running. It was answered, that albeit
the Disposition of the Appryzing granted to the appearand Heir, was
prior to the Act, yet the Right was purchased posterior to the Act, for
the Disposition could not give Right, but only the Infeftment following
thereupon; for if after that Disposition, any other had been Infeft upon
Appryzing or Disposition by the Defenders Author, that posterior Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would carry the Right, so that the Author cannot be said to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested,
or the appearand Heir invested, or stated in the Right, till his
Infeftment, which is after the Act of Parliament. To the <hi>second,</hi> The
Pursuer answered, that the Defenders Appryzing, albeit it was Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
when he acquired Right thereto; yet it becoming now irredeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in his Person; it cannot be denyed but he has acquired Right to an
irredeemable Appryzing, albeit it was not irredeemable when he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the Right, yet he hath acquired Right to that Appryzing, that
now is irredeemable; for the Extinction of the legal Reversion, <hi>cursu
temporis,</hi> is a Right accrescing to him, and acquired by him, and no
Heretage to him: and seing the Words of the Act are capable of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
there can be no doubt of the Legislators mind, or that it
should be thus interpret; because otherwayes that excellent Provision
would be evacuate, for the appearand Heir would alwayes acquire Right
to an Appryzing before the Legal were expyred, though he should pay
the Appryzer the full sum, and would make no use of it till the Legal
were Expyred, and thereby carry the Right of the whole Estate, though
it were of twenty times more value: But the only Motive of that
Act of Parliament being, that albeit the Law gives Appryzers the Right
of all that they Appryze at random, if they be not Redeemed within
the Legal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the Appryzer is ashamed to take so great Legal advantage;
and therefore ordinarly compones with the appearand Heir, who being
favourable, makes no Bonds to bruik the whole Estate of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
excluding all his other Creditors: and therefore this Remeed is
introduced, which will be evacuate, if the Act of Parliament be not
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:55692:388"/>
thus interpret, and that interpretation should be ever followed, which is
according to Equity, and whereby the Statute may stand, and not be
eluded. The Defender answered, that this Statute being Correctory
of the Common Law, is strictly to be interpret, and not to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and the Acquisition of Rights being ever interpret from the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and not from the Infeftment thereon, <hi>multo magis,</hi> should it
be so interpret in this case, And as to that part thereof anent the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyring
of the Appryzing, the Pursuers Interpretation is not only constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but inconsistent with Justice, for <hi>ubi subest Remedium ordinarium
non est recurrendum ad medium extraordinarium,</hi> for if the appearand Heir
acquire Right to an Appryzing unexpyred, the Reason and Motive of the
Statute ceases, for both the Debitor and Con-creditors may Redeem from
the appearand Heir, and can pretend no necessity of extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meed,
especially if the appearand Heirs Right be not latent, but publick
by Infeftment.</p>
               <p>The Lords found that the appearand Heirs Right being only become
Real by Infeftment after the Act of Parliament, that it was then to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to be acquired, when the Author was Denuded and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
Heir Invested, so that no posterior Right from his Author could Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him: And found also, that albeit the appearand Heirs Right were
during the Legal, yet if it stood in his Person till the Legal were expyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the same fell within the Act of Parliament, and found it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable
by what the appearand Heir truly payed within ten years, to
be counted from the Date of the acquiring of the Right, conform to the
words of the Act, and not from the time the Appryzing became expyred

that the Prescription was interrupted, in so far as a part of the Principal
Sum was payed within the years of Prescription. It was answered for
the Defender, that the payment being mode to the Daughters of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Sum, it could have no effect as to the Annualrents preceeding <hi>Iean
Blairs</hi> Death, which belonged not to her Daughters, as persons Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
in the Bond, but to her Executors, so that the Bond might well
be preserved, as to the principal Sum, and yet prescribe as to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrents,
these being two several Right, and stated in several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
It was answered, That the Interruption by payment was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for preserving both Principal and Annual, for Prescription being odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
any Deed by which the Debitor and Creditor acknowledge the
Right within the fourty years, is sufficient, not only as to the interest
of the particular Actors, but as to all others who have interest in the
same Right, as payment of any part of the Annualrent by one Person,
preserves the whole Right against all the Cautioners and Co-principals,
though they neither payed, nor were pursued within fourty years, so
payment of any part of the Principal, must in the same manner preserve
the Right of the Bond, as to all Annualrents, to whomsoever they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
if they be not fourty years before that Interruption, by payment
of a part of the principal.</p>

himself of the Inhibition, raised a Declarator that the Inhibition was null,
and that his Estate was free of any burden thereof, because it wanted this
essential Solemnity, that the Execution against <hi>Phillorth</hi> did not bear a
Copy to be delivered, and that the Executions being so Registrat, he being
a Purchaser for a just price; and seing no valid Inhibition upon Record, he
ought not to be Burdened therewith. The Defender alleadged Absolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
Because, <hi>First,</hi> The delivering of a Copy was no Essential So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie,
neither does any Law or Statute ordain the same: much less
any Law declaring Executions void for want thereof: and albeit it be
the common Stile, yet every thing in the Stile is not necessary; for if
the Messenger should have read the Letters, and showen them to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
he could not say, but that he was both Certiorat and Charged not
to Dispone. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Executions bear, that <hi>Phillorth</hi> was Inhibit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
apprehended. <hi>3dly,</hi> The Inhibition comprehends both a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which, the Execution bears a Copy was affixed, so that whatever defect
might be pretended as to <hi>Phillorth,</hi> this Pursuer and all the Leidges were
Inhibite to block or buy from him, so that the Pursuer has acted against the
Prohibition of the Letters, and cannot pretend that he purchased <hi>bona

for there is nothing more ordinar than in Summons to add any thing

knocks, and the affixing of a Stamp, have all been admitted by the Lords
to be supplied, by proving that they were truely done, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in the Execution: Though Horning be odious and penal, inferring
the loss of Moveables and Liferent; therefore it ought much more to be
supplied in the case of an Inhibition, which is much more favourable to
preserve the Croditors Debt, and here the Messenger hath added to the
Execution, that a Copie was Delivered, and Subscribed the same on the
Margent, and it is offered to be proven by the Witnesses in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it was truely so done. The Pursuer answered, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:55692:390"/>
more essential in an Execution, than delivering of a Copy, for
showing or Reading of Letters was no Charge, but the delivering of the
Copy was in effect the Charge; and albeit Executions which require no
Registration, and may be perfited by the Executor, at any time may be
amended as to what was truly done; Yet where Executions must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarlie
be Registrate within such a time, else they are null, after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistration
the Messenger is <hi>functus officio,</hi> and his assertion has no Faith:
and seing the giving of a Copie is essential, and if it be omitted, would
annul the Execution; so after Registration it can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in so far the Execution is null, not being Registrate, <hi>debito tempore,</hi> for
as the whole Execution would be null for want of Registration, so is any
essential part: and whatever the Lords has supplied in Hornings, yet
they did alwayes bear, that the same was lawfullie done according to the
Custom in such cases; and this Execution does not so much as bear that
<hi>Phillorth</hi> was lawfullie Inhibite, but only according to the Command of
the Letters which do not express any Solemnitie: and it hath been found
by the Lords, that a Horning being Registrate, and not bearing a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Delivered, it was found null; because that part was not in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister,
nor was it admitted to be supplied any way, but that it were
proven by the Oath of the Keeper of the Register, that that Clause was
upon the Margent of the Execution, when it was presented to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stister,
and was only neglected to be insert by him, which shows how

Registrating thereof: And if Solemnities of this kind, be by Sentence

Solemnities, but course of time may incroach on all other Solemnities;
whereas, if this be found necessar, none will ever hereafter omit it, or any
other necessar Solemnity.</p>
               <p>The Lords found the Inhibition null, and that the Delivering of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

they would not admit the same to be supplied by Probation, in prejudice of

no doubt the King and Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1650. before <hi>Dumbar</hi> would have
