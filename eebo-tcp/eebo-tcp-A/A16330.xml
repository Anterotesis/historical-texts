            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore, untill they lay certainely hold upon, and really pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse somthing more pretious, surer comforts, sounder ioyes, which may out-balance the weight of all wordly treasures, and over-top the height of all humane happinesses, both in excellency and sweetnesse; they will by no meanes, upon no termes, suffer their hearts to bee drawne, and divorced from possession of the present, and the Bird in hand, as they say; I meane, from that poore, little, leane, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary nothing of contentment; which they seeme to extract, with much adoe, and most certaine losse of eternall blisse, from earthly things.

Whence it is, that it is so often in the holy Scriptures compared to light. Now what power and prevalent antipathy our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary light doth exercise against his most abhorred Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, <hi>darkenesse,</hi> you well know, and it is elegantly and punctually for my purpose expressed by <hi>One</hi> in this manner: <hi>We see, and prove,</hi> saith he, <hi>by dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how powerfull and dreadfull a thing the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the night is.

The night commeth,</hi> saith our Sauiour, <hi>wherein we cannot worke. It arresteth, and keepeth cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive all living wights, men and beasts, that they must be still, and rest there where it arresteth them: yea it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them fearefull, and faint-hearted, full of fancies, and much subiect to frights. It is of all others such a powerfull, and unconquerable Tyrant, as no man is able to withstand. And yet neverthelesse, it is not of that might, that it is able to overwhelme, or to quench the least light in the World. For we see the darken the night is, the clearer the Starres shine: Yea the least candles light, that is lighted, withstandeth the whole night, and not onely suffereth not the darkenesse to cover, or to smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and oppresse it, but it giveth light also even in the middest of the darkenesse, and beateth it backe for some space and distance on every side of it: so that which way soever it is borne, or wheresoever it commeth, there must darkenesse depart and give place unto the light; all the power, and the dreadfulnesse of it, cannot helpe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile ought against it. And tho the light be so weake, that it cannot cast light farre about, or drive the darkenesse farre from it, as in the sparke of an hot coale, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the darknesse cover or conceale, and much lesse quench it; but it giveth light to it selfe alone at least; so that it may be seene a farre off in the darke; and it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth unconquered of the darke, tho it cannot helpe other things nor give light unto them.

The softest of whose sufferings would have strucke full cold to the heart of many a Carnalist, and made it to dye within Him like a stone as <hi>Nabals</hi> did.

For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> onely because the glory of his state-wisedome was obscur'd, and overtopt at the counsell-Bord, <hi>sadled His Asse, gate Him Home, put His houshold in order, and hanged Himselfe.</hi> The onely cause of His fainting in the day of disgrace, and dis-acceptation was His false, and rotten heart in matters of religion.

But when the winde begun to blow a little another way and upon <hi>Absoloms</hi> side, like a true Temporizer. He followes the blast, and turnes his sailes according to the weather. And therefore His hollow heart, having made the Arme of flesh His Anchor, and a vanishing Blase of honour His chiefest blessednesse, shrinkes at the very first sight, and suspition of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, and sinkes this miserable Man into a Sea of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. But now on the contrary: what was the cause,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6598:25"/>
that <hi>Iobs</hi> heart was not crusht into pieces, under the bitter concurrence of such a world of crosses, of which any one severally was sufficient to have made a Man extreamely miserable? The true reason of His patient resolution, amid so many pressures, was the spirituall riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He had hoarded up in the time of His happines. Amongst which the divinest, and dearest Iewel lay nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest unto His heart, as a counterpoyson, to the venome and sting of the Divels deadliest malice. I meane a sound and strong faith in Iesus Christ, <hi>the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the world:</hi> which now began to shine the fairest in the darkest Midnight of His mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and sweetly to dart out many heavenly sparkles of comfort, and such glorious eiaculations as these: <hi>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in Him.</hi> Cap. 13.15.

            </p>
            <p>There were two cutting, and cruell circumstances largely insinuated <hi>Cap.</hi> 29. and 30. which did keenely sharpen the edge, and mightily aggravate the weight of <hi>Iobs</hi> miseries:</p>
            <p>The one was this: <hi>He had bin</hi>

               </note> So on the contrary; <hi>It is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test misery,</hi> they say, <hi>to haue bin happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other was that, which most nettles a generous nature. He being a Man of so great honour and worth; whose rare, and incomparable wisedome, even the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> adored as it were with a secret, and silent admiration, as appeares <hi>Cap.</hi> 29.9.10. was now contemned of the most contemptible. <hi>The children of fooles, and the children of base men</hi>; that were <hi>viler then the earth,</hi> make him their <hi>song,</hi> and their <hi>By-word, cap.</hi>

And he is the Lords noblest Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, and a Professour of the truest, and heavenliest dye, that holds out in the wetting, and shrinkes not in the Day of adversitie. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speakes to the people of Antioch like himselfe, a Man of an invincible spirit, against the tyrannies of his times:<note place="margin">

The one is like the raging Sea that cannot rest: the other stands fast like a Rocke, which shall never bee remooved. An unregenerate heart is ever restlesse, commonly in these three regards at the least: First, by reason of an endlesse, and unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable appetite after pleasures, riches, honours, revenge, or what other Darling delight it hath singled out, and made speciall choice of to follow, and feede upon with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6598:27"/>
greatest contentment, and sensuall sweetnesse, God hath iustly put that property, or rather poison into all earthly things doted upon, and desired immoderately, that they shall plague the heart, which so pursues them; by filling it still with a furious and fresh supply of more greedinesse, iealousies, and many miserable discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: so that they become unto it, as drinke unto a man in a Dropsie, or burning Fever, serve onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame it with new heate, and fiery additions of insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thirst, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ordinate longings. Secondly, because of the many secret grumblings, and stinging reclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a gauled conscience against its present guilty courses, and forbidden pleasures. Thirdly, in respect of a continuall ebullition, as it were, of confused and contrary lusts, out of the empoysoned Fountaine of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption, which fill it with many damnable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, and tumultuations of Hell. But now if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this inward boyling, it bee also tossed with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles, what a miserable Creature is a carnall Man?

But the other is like a strong unmoveable mountaine, that stands impregnable against the rage of winde and weather. And all the cruell incursions, and ungodly oppositions made against it, either by men, or Divels, are but like so many proud, and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling waves, which dash themselves against a mighty Rocke. The more boysterously they beate against it, the more are they broken, and turned into a vaine foame and froath.

But alas poore soules, what will they doe in the evill Day! When after the hot gleame of earthly glory, and a short calme &amp; cut ouer the Sea of this world, they are come into the Port of death, to which all windes drive them, and having there let fall that last Anchor, which can never be weighed againe, shall be set in the land of darkenes; the <hi>dust</hi> whereof is <hi>brimstone,</hi> and the <hi>riuers burning pitch</hi>; where they shall meete with whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of tempestuous and fiery plagues, and the enveno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Arrowes of Gods unquenchable anger, shall sticke fast for ever in their Soule &amp; flesh; where they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more see the Light, nor the Land of the living, but be drowned in everlasting perdition, in the Lake, even a boyling Sea of fire and brimstone, where they can see no banke, nor feele no bottome.

When they shall lie upon their last Beds, like <hi>wild Bulls in a net,</hi> as the Prophet speakes, <hi>full of the wrath of God; saying, in the morning, would God it were Even: and at Even, would God it were morning, for the

feare of their heart, wherewith they shal feare, and for the sight of their eyes, which they shall see.</hi> I say in what case will they be then? Then, But my words doe faile mee here, and so doth my conceit.

            <p>To rouse them out of this cruell carnall security, let them entertaine into their most serious thoughts such considerations as these:</p>

               <hi>If God,</hi> saith He, <hi>should speake thus to a damned Soule: Let the whole world be filled with sand from the earth to the Empyrean heauen, and then let an Angell come euery thousandth yeere, and fetch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one graine from that mighty sandy mountaine; when that immeasurable Heape is so spent, and so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres expired, I will deliver Thee out of Hell, and those extreamest horrours; that most miserable forlorne wretch, notwithstanding, that he were to lie thorow that unconceiveable length of time in those intollerable Hellish torments, yet upon such a promise would infinitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and deeme himselfe not to be damned.

Suppose thy selfe crowned with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of all worldly felicities, to have purchased a Monopoly of all pleasures, honours and riches upon the whole earth, to be attended with all the pompe and state, thy heart could desire. Yet what were this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany golden dreame to a reall glorious eternitie? How stinging would the most exquisite delight be, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously extracted out of them all, accompanied with this one conceite; the Soule is lost everlastingly. All these painted vanities, might seeme perhaps a gaudy Paradise to a spirituall Foole, who hath his portion in this life; But what true pleasure can a Man, in his right wits, but morally and illightned no further then with Philosophy, take in them; sith, setting other respects aside, they are so fading, and He so fraile. For the first: God hath purposely put a transitory and mortall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into all things here below. They spring, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and die. Even the greatest kingdomes, and stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Monarchies, that ever were, haue had, as it were, their infancy, youthfull strength, Mans state, old age, and at last their grave.

For the second; Imagine, there were constancy and eternity in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named earthly bables, yet what Man of braine, would prize them worth a button, sith His life is but a bubble; and the very next houre or day to come, He may ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be cut off from them all, for ever. <hi>To day hee is set up, and to morrow he shall not be found: for he is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into dust, and his purpose perisheth.</hi> Take them both together thus: Set upon the head of the Worthiest Man, that the earth beares, yet wanting grace in His Soule, all the most orient imperiall Crownes, that ever high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ambition aimed at, or attain'd unto; put upon Him the royallest roabes, that ever enclosed the body of the proudest <hi>Lucifer</hi>; fill Him with all the wisedome, and largest comprehensions, which fall within the wide compasse, and capacitie of any depths of policy, or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of state; furnish Him to the full with the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and excellency of all naturall, morall and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicall learning; put Him into the sole possession and command of this and the other golden world: In a word crowne Him with the concurrence of all created earthly excellencies, to the utmost and highest straine: And lay this Man thus qualifyed and endowed upon the one scale of the ballance, and vanity upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and vanity will overweigh Him quite. <hi>Men of high degree are a lye: to be laid in the ballance, they are altogether lighter then vanitie, Psal.</hi> 62.9. The rich Foole in the Gospell teacheth us, that there is no man so assured of his honour, of his riches, health or life; but that he may be deprived of either or all the very next night. Besides, by a thousand other causes, meanes, and wayes, He may also be suddainely snatched away from the face of the earth in anger, for setting his heart and rest, upon such rotten staves of reede, transitory shadowes, and indeed that which is <hi>nothing.

Now what an extreme madnesse is this, for a Man to sell His salvation for a life of pleasures; abhorring the wayes of Gods Childe, as too precise, and painefull; whereas besides Hell for the one, and Heaven for the other hereafter; in the meane time every day spent so sensually, is a true <hi>Purgatory:</hi> And every day passed in the contrary Christian course, is an earthly <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi>

            <p>Tho the one now carries away the credite and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the times, and with all bravery and triumph tumbles Himselfe in the pleasures, riches, and glory of the world; and the other is kept, as they say, under batches, neglected and contemptible to carnall eyes, trampled upon with the feete of pride and malice by the prouder Pharisees, and hunted with much cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and hate by Men of this World: Yet watch but a while; and you shall see the End of this upright man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatsoever his sorrowes and sufferings, troubles and temptations have beene in this life, to be most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>peace</hi> at the last. <hi>Marke the perfect man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.

Yet all the hurt he hath thereby, is upon the matter, besides serving Gods secret holy pleasure, an addition to His happinesse; for an immediate translation from the depth of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary horrour, as in Maister <hi>Peacocke,</hi> and Mistris <hi>Bretlergh,</hi> to the height of endlesse joy, makes even the joyes of Heaven something more joyfull.

            <p n="1">1. In some, from an ambitious affectation of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and applause, for extraordinary undauntednesse of spirit, and high resolution.

            <p n="2">2. In others, from a strong, stirring perswasion, and consciousnesse of the honesty, and honour of some ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill cause, for which they suffer. But fortitude in this case, doth not arise, from any inspired religious vigour or heavenly infusions; but from the severer instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of naturall conscience, and acquired manhood of a meere morall Puritane. Many such morall Martyrs have beene found amongst the more generous, and well-bred heathen. It is storied of a brave and valiant Captaine, who had long, manfully, and with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courage with-stood <hi>Dionysius</hi> the elder in defence of a Citie; that Hee sustained with strange patience, and height of spirit the mercilesse fury of the Tyrant, and all his barbarous cruelties: most unworthy of Him, that suffered them, but most worthy him that

keeping a thing found, and not restoring it, or not inquiring after the Owner: Another for an adulterous project, without any actuall pollution: Another, by concurring with a company of scoffing <hi>Ishmaels</hi> onely once, and ere Hee was aware, by lifting up the hands, and casting up the eyes, in scorne of Gods people, &amp;c.

If the guilty sense then of one Sin, when God sets it on, and sayes unto it, <hi>Torment,</hi> drawes so many fiery points of stinging Scorpions after it; charges upon the excellency of the understanding with such hideous darkenesse; rents the heart in pieces with such desperate rage; grindes into powder, the arme and sinewes of all earthly succour; melts, like Dew before the Sunne, all those delights, and pleasures which the whole world offers, or affords to comfort in such a Case; In a word, makes a man so extreamely miserable, That Hee would make Himselfe away; wishes with unspeakeable griefe, that Hee had never been; that Hee might returne into the abhorred state of annihilation; that Hee were any other Creature; that Hee might lye hid world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out End under some everlasting Rocke, from the face of God; Nay, that Hee were rather in Hell, then in His present horrour: I say it being thus, what unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wrath; what streames of brimstone; what restlesse anguish; what gnashing of teeth; what knawing of conscience; what despairefull roarings; what horrible

Serm. 9. But Satan is not willing to deale so roughly with the unregenerate, if Hee could chuse: for Hee stands ever in most danger of losing them, when Hee carries Himselfe towards them, in so hard a fashion: wherefore Hee rather flatters, and faunes; endeavouring to rocke them asleepe still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if hee can, in the Cradle of securitie and presumption. Neither will Hee storme thus, (to wit, labour to pull them by the strength of utter despaire, as it were, quicke into Hell, and to make them kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or doe some other most grosse and unnaturall crime:) but when hee sees his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in regard of some bodily crosse, or distemper; or that hee sees the Lord will needs awaken their sleepy consciences. <hi>Whately, New-birth Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Qui jugum suscipiunt Diaboli, Diabolus eos delectat, &amp; decipit, ne discedant à malo impij usque ad mortem suam.</hi> Incertus Author, In Mat.

To have Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan slash thy Soule with so many sinnes, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to feele no smart, is a most desperate securitie; To have all this misery towards, and to bee confident,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6598:60"/>
and fearelesse, is the <hi>misery</hi> of <hi>miseries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reasons, why thou art at rest from their guilty rage in the meane time; and that so many sleeping Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I meane all thine unpardoned sinnes, doe not yet awake and stirre; terrific and teare in pieces, are such as these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Satan is suttle, that Hee will not meddle much, or molest thee extreamely, untill Hee bee able to doe thee an irrecoverable mischiefe. Hee is woont not to appeare in His true likenesse, and so terribly; not so much to disquiet and trouble any of His owne, before Hee have them at some dead lift, and desperate advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; as under some extraordinary Crosse, great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, grievous sicknesse; In time of some deepe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, un-avoidable danger, universall confusion; When Hee conceives in all probabilitie, that they have out-stood the Day of their visitation, hardned their hearts, that they cannot repent, received the sentence of death against themselves; And at such other like times, when hee hopes, Hee shall bee able to crush, and confound them suddenly, utterly and for ever. And then hee playes the Divell indeed, and shewes Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in His colours. For Hee then infinitely endeauours with all cunning and cruell industry, after Hee hath wafted them a while downe the current of the times, with as much carnall peace and pleasure, as Hee could possibly, to cast them upon the Rocke of a most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ruine, and swallow them up quicke in the gulphe of calamity and woe; of despaire, selfe-destruction, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting perdition of Body, and Soule. But you must know, that in the meane time, untill Hee can spie such an opportunity, Hee labours might and maine to keepe them in as merry a moode as may bee. Hee laies about Him, by all wayes and meanes, Hee can devise, to plot and provide for them, and that with great variety and curiosity, fresh successions and supplies continually, of pleasures, contentments, the countenance and favours of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6598:61"/>
the times, sensuall satisfactions, all earthly prosperities. If Hee can helpe it, and have his will, they shall wallow still in all worldly felicity, and bee attended upon with all the delights their hearts can desire. And all this, to continue them with more easinesse and irresistance in the damned way: And lest otherwise, they should grow weary of His slavery, sensible of their guilded fetters, and so labour after liberty, and enlargement from His Hellish bondage. For Hee knowes full well, that if thy endured much hardship in His service, they might perhaps thinke of seeking after a new Master; that want of comfort in the world, might draw their hearts to delight in the <hi>Word</hi>; Not finding happinesse upon earth, might make them enquire after that which is in heaven. That crosses and crossing their courses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sanctified for that purpose, may happily helpe to breake their hearts, and bring them to remorse for sin; which Hee mainely feares, and opposeth with all the craft and power, Hee can possibly; lest thereupon, they breake out of His fooles-Paradise, into the <hi>Garden</hi> of Grace; out of the warme Sunne, into Gods blessing.</p>
            <p>In managing this maine policy, for the more secure detainement of His Vassals in the invisible chaines of darkenesse and damnation, and in an everlasting distast and dis-affection to the <hi>good way</hi>; by holding up their hearts in His sinfull service, and wooing them, to go on quietly towards Hell without any grumbling; Hee workes many wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hee plots all Hee can to procure them successe in their wicked enterprises; and unlawfull attempts, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, against the faithfull Ministers, and people of God; for that doth infinitely confirme, harden, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in their prophane courses, and opposition to grace. Herein Hee doth many times mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, by improving the oportunities, &amp; pressing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which hee gaines, by the executions of Gods iustice, and rebellions of his Children. The sinnes even
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6598:61"/>
of His owne people doe many times provoke Gods just indignation against them; and enforces Him, to raise up their adversaries, as scourges, and to give them successe, for the humiliation, and chastisement of his chosen. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.14.15. <hi>Isai.</hi> 10.5 6. &amp;c. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22.19.20. Whereupon Satan fills the hearts of the wicked so prevailing, and conquering, with a great deale of pride, selfe-applause, insolency, contempt of godlinesse, selfe-conceitednesse of their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and worth; and so hardens them extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and holds them with much obstinated resolution in the wayes of death, and prejudice against the <hi>holy Path.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Hee helpes all hee can, to have them thrive and prosper by oppression, usury, simony, sacriledge, bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, covetousnesse, cousoning, <hi>Machiavellian</hi> tricks, &amp;c. That so His service may seeme more sweete and gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto them. To the effecting whereof Hee receives notable assistance, and speciall advantage from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the times, and conscionable simplicity of the Saints. For the first, These worst and ulcerous times, wherein so many <hi>Vines, Olive-trees, and Figge-trees</hi> wither away in obscurity; and so many <hi>Brambles</hi> brave it abroad in the world, tumbling themselves in the pleasures, splendour and glory of the present; wherein so many brave <hi>Princes are walking as servants upon the earth</hi>; and too many servants of luxurie and pride are mounted on horse-backe; I say they are the onely season, for Satan to gratifie all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His gracelesse Ones; and to hoist them up by the common, but accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed staires and stirrops of bribing, basenesse, tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, ill offices to humour greatnesse, and other such vile meanes, and accommodations, into eminency in the world, and high roomes; where hee keepes them in a golden captivity with great contentment, and lockes them full fast in the <hi>Scorners chaire,</hi> with much securitie to their owne sensuall hearts; and notorious service to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6598:62"/>
Himselfe. Whereas indeed and truth to men that have eyes in their Heads the ascent is slippery, the Top sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the downefall desperate. For the second; It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to consider, what a deale of advantage in worldly dealings, the covetous Dwell in a cruell and crafty worldling, doth sucke out of the single-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, plaine dealing &amp; un-suspiciousnesse, of consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, for their rising &amp; enriching, if God crosse it not.</p>

The sting is pointed with the keene unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wrath of God; the horror is heated with the very fire of Hell: And yet ordinarily Satan takes an order by His craft and industry, that these never appeare, untill it appeare unto Him, that in all probability, the sight of them will sinke their Soules into irrecoverable woe.</p>

            <p>Thus as you haue heard, I haue tendred many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to restraine from sinne; which by the helpe of God may serve to take off the edge of the most eager temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; to coole the heat of the most furious entisement; to embitter the sweetest baite, that drawes to any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall delight.

Secondly, it doth also by the working of the Spirit, convince the Party, that that is particularly true of Him, which before Hee used to poste over His head, as pertaining to others, not to Him: But now God makes Him take this to Himselfe, and to apply and appropriate it, as if the Minister spoke to Him alone by Name; and to thinke the Minister knowes all His heart, looketh on Him, and speakes directly to Him; Though it may bee the Minister knew Him nor, or not His case, but God makes Him so to thinke.

                  <p>Thirdly, some middle ones, wrought in the heart of those, that bee not yet actually the children of God; yet certainely shall bee; And which whosoever have wrought in them, shall surely have Faith, and cannot goe long without it; Such is this contrition, and such dispositions as bee in men before Faith, which yet are wrought by the Gospell. These are better then common Gifts, yet not actuall Graces, and yet gracious inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Faith, which are in those that are to bee justified; and which (if wee speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) cannot bee wrought in any that shall perish. <hi>See Master</hi> Hooker <hi>in the Preface to the same Booke.</hi>

Then he beleeves the word of God, and rests, and casts himselfe vpon it. And thus hee finds himselfe discharged of all woe, made partaker of all good, at peace in himselfe, and fitted, and in tune to doe God some service. This is to some sooner, to some later; according to the helpes and meanes they haue, and wise handling they meet withall, and as God gives power.— It is hard to say, at what instant faith is wrought, whether not till a man feeles that hee apprehends the promises, or even in his earnest desires, hungring and thirsting; For even these are pronounced blessed.</hi>

Consider for this purpose, that worke upon <hi>Davids</hi> heart, by <hi>Nathans</hi> Ministry, And <hi>Felix</hi> trembling, when <hi>Paul</hi> strucke Him on the right veine.</p>
            <p>The reasons, why this more particular discovery, and denouncing of judgement against a Mans principall sinne, is like, God assisting with the <hi>Spirit of bondage,</hi> to put such life into the worke of the Law, are such as these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Sword of the Spirit,</hi> which is the word of God, being welded by the hand of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>; and ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as it were, with the speciall power of Gods blessing, for the cutting asunder of the iron-Sinewes of a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and stony heart, doth crush and conquer, strike through and breake in pieces, with an unresistable puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, proportioned to the insolency, or easinesse of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. My meaning is this; As <hi>Philosophers</hi> say of the <hi>Lightning</hi>; that by reason of the easinesse of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, weakenesse of resistance, porosity of the parts, it pierceth through the Purse, Scabberd, and Barke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such scorching and visible hurt; but melts the mony, the sword, rents and shivers the tree, because their substance and solidity, doth more exercise, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove its activenes and ability: So this Spirituall Sword, tho it strike at every sinne, and passeth thorow, <hi>even to the diuiding asunder of Soule and Spirit, and of the joynts, and marrow</hi>; yet the hairy pate of the maine corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Master sinne, it wounds with a witnesse; it there tortures and teares in pieces with extraordinary anguish and smart, Searching and sence: for that opposeth with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6598:100"/>
the most flinty iron-Sinew, to blunt and rebate its edge, if it were possible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Consciences regularly, and rightly wounded, and awaked, sinnes are wont to bite, and sting propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to their hainousnesse, and the exorbitancy of their former sensuall impressions. Some like a Mastife, some like a Scorpion, some like a Wolfe in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: (But vnderstand, that spirituall anguish surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth immeasurably any corporall paine; therefore conceiue of them with a vast dis-proportion) Now the Minion delight or Captaine sinne frighting the heart with greatest horrour, and stinging with extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity proportionable to its former vastation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, doth by an accidentall power, (God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the businesse) give a great stroke, to drive a man to deepest detestation of Himselfe, to throw Him downe to the lowest step of penitent dejection, to eneager His thirsty greedinesse after pardon and grace, and at length to fire Him out of His naturall estate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Mans principall, and most prevailing sinne is Sathans strongest Hold. When Hee is in danger to be dislodged, and driven by the power of the word out of the other parts of the Soule, as it were, and from Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Man by all other sinnes; Hee retires Hither as to His Castle, and most impregnable Fort. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this bee soundly beaten upon by the Hammer, and Horrour of the Law, and battered about His eares, hee will bee quickly enforced to quit the Place quite.</p>
            <p>It may bee good counsell then, and often seasonable to say unto those Men of God, who desire to drive the Devill out of Others, in some sort, as the King of Syria said to his Captaines, <hi>Fight neither with small nor great, save onely with the King of Israel.</hi> My meaning is; Let them addresse the sharpest edge of their spirituall Sword, yet as well with an holy charitable discretion, as with resolute, downeright dealing against those sinnes, which beare greatest sway in them, they have to deale
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6598:101"/>

These, and farre more then these, or then can bee exprest, our blessed Saviour, being Son of the most high God, endured for no other end, but to ransome us from the bondage of Sathan, and of Hell, in a thirsting desire of saving all Penitent sinners; And to offer himselfe freely, a most glorious, and everlasting Husband to all those, who with broken and beleeving hearts cast themselves into His bosome.

            <p>I have said all this, upon purpose, least melancholike men should be miss-led, or disheartened by the cursed counsell of carnall freinds, and wicked clamours of the world, from turning their sadnesse into sorrow for sin; and from plying Gods blessed booke, and the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ministry thereof, the onely wellspring of all true lightsomnesse, and ioy; and able as I said before, if they wilbee converted, and counseled, to dispell the very darkenesse of hell out of their hearts. Mee thinkes, they rather above others, should bee encouraged hereunto: 1. Because they have a passive advantage, that I may so speake, when it pleaseth God, to sanctifie for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and set on worke the spirit of bondage, by reason
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:6598:117"/>
of their sad dispositions, and fearefull spirits, to bee soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner affrighted, and dejected by comminations of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against sinne; more feelingly to take to heart the miseries, and dangers of their naturall state; more easily to tremble and stoope under the mighty hand of God, and hammer of his Law. Guiltinesse, and horrour; damnation and hell beget in their timerous natures stronger impressions of feare: whereupon they are woont to tast deeplier of legall contrition, and remorse; and so proportionably to feel and acknowledge a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter necessity of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; to thirst after him more greedily, to prize him more highly; and at length to throw their trembling soules into his blessed bosome with more eagernesse, and importunity. And having once entred into the <hi>holy path,</hi> their native fearefulnesse beeing rectified, and turned the right way, they many times walke on afterward, with more feare to offend, (<hi>and happy is the man that feareth alway</hi>) more watchfulnesse over their wayes, tendernesse of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, impatiency of losing spirituall peace, sensiblenesse of infirmities, and failings, awfulnes to Gods word, &amp;c. 2. And because of all others, such men have most neede of lightsomnesse, and refreshing: which when carnall counsellers, &amp; flattering mountebanks of the Ministry, labour to introduce into their darke heads, and heavy hearts by the arme of flesh, outward mirth, and such other meanes, they onely palliate, and dawbe: and are so farre from doing any true good, that thereby they drowne them many times deeper and more desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the dungeon of melancholy afterward. So that, a melancholicke man, let him turne him, which way, hee will, is like, without the light of grace, to live, a very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable life upon earth, and as it were in some part of hellish darkenesse: to which also at length, shalbee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the torment, if hee dye impenitently. But now let them addresse themselves to the <hi>booke of life,</hi> and thence onely they may <hi>sucke, and bee satisfied with the breasts
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:6598:117"/>
of consolation:</hi> Let them leane their sorrowfull soules, improoving naturall sadnesse to mourne more heartily for sinne, upon the <hi>promises</hi> there: and every severall one will shine upon them with a particular, heavenly, and healing light, with sound, and lasting joy. All those then are starke mad, either with ignorant or learned malice, who beare the world in hand, that reading scriptures, plying the powerfull ministry, taking sinne to heart, &amp;c. will make melancholike men mad.</p>
            <p>If you desire to know, before I passe out of the point, the differences betweene the heavines of a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like humour, and affliction of conscience for sinne, take notice of such as these.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Terrour for sinne springs out of the conscience, and from the smart of a spirituall wound there: Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly dwels, and hath his chiefe <note n="c" place="margin">I meane in respect of terrible representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For I know well from the learnedst Physitions, that that humour is originally settled in the spleene. But from thence arise cloudes of Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vapours, which annoy the heart, and passing up to the braine, counterfets terrible obiects to the Phantasie; and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting both the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and the spirits of the braine, causeth it without externall occasion, or object, to forge monstrous ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and terrible to the conceite; which the judgment taking, as they are presented by the disordered Instrument, delivers to the heart; which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Sympathy betweene the braine and the heart, the thoughts and affections, and having no judgement of discretion in it selfe, but giving credit to the mistaken report of the braine, is affected proportionably with terrour, sadnesse, and feare.</note> residence in the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie: uncomfortably ouercasts, and darkens the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and lightsomnesse of the animall spirits in the braine.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The melancholike man is extremely sad, &amp; knowes not why: Hee is full of feare, doubts, distrust, and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, without any true and just ground, arising onely from the darkenesse and disorder of the phantasie, the griesly fumes of that blacke humour in the braine: But a broken heart, a thousand to one, can readily tell you, the particular sinnes, the crying abomination, the legall hammer, and ministeriall hand that made it bleed.

Secondly, when times of sorrow come upon them, when melancholy &amp; old age growes on, and they say unto the world, upon which they have doted all their life long, I have <hi>no pleasure in thee</hi>; when losses, crosses, and heavie accidents befall them; when hideous injections, temptations to selfe-murder, despaire &amp;c. presse them full sore; and they thereupon begin to cast about seriously, and to conceive with great terrour and anxiety of spirit, what is like to become of them in the other world: Then in such extremity, and forced by necessity, they are wont to have recourse to Ministers for ease and helpe; and alas! then we are at our wits end, as they say, and in much perplexity how to deale, and what to doe with them.

Nay many in this case are so destitute of matter of humiliation for sinne, that they can scarce tell you what sinne is. At the most, they have not learned, or thinke that there is any other breach of the <hi>seventh</hi> commandement, but the grosse acts of uncleannesse; that there is any sinne against the <hi>ninth,</hi> but giuing in false witnes against their neighbours in open Court: They looke no further into the <hi>sixth</hi> commandement, but unto the actuall bloody murder of the hand; into the <hi>third,</hi> but to blasphemy and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; And so proportionably in the other commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

This cutting, yet conscionable course, stirres up, and raises in them the ill spirits of murmuring, cavilling, reviling, and perhaps persecuting the faithfull Messengers of God, as a generation of terrible Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. To expositions, exercises, and considerations of this nature, they are drawne with very ill will, and much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe; even as a bankrout to his counting-booke, a foule face to the looking-glasse, and a Traytour to the racke.</p>
            <p>By reason of this affected ignorance in the Law of God, and lothnesse to descend to particulars, it comes to passe, that many in trouble of minde complaine in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of sinne onely, and confusedly.

It is a principle in the mysterie of Christ resolved upon by best Divines, rightly <hi>instructed to the Kingdome of Heaven: That a confused acknowledgement, and generall repentance onely for knowne sinnes is never sound and saving; But onely common, formall, perfunctory, and that of counterfeite Converts, not truly touched with sense of their sinnes, nor heartily resolved to forsake their pleasures.</hi> If they can bee first brought to the sight, sense, and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some one speciall notorious sinne, which hath most reigned in their heart, life, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or let them bee indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted very grievously for a time with the horrour of that one sin; yet stay the cry, and abate the rage of that One with some superficiall comfort, and they are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and put into an happy case in their owne conceite, and in the opinion also perhaps of their unskilfull Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; tho they search no further, and dive no deeper into the loathsome Dunghill of those many abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lusts, and corruptions in their heart and life, of which they are as full as the skinne will hold.</p>

            <p>And yet here I would have no true Penitent deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or mistake: the bare omission of some particular sinnes, in this case is not ever damnable. For wee must know, that if a man deale truly with his owne heart in a sincere acknowledgement, confession, and repentance for discovered and knowne sinnes; (and Hee ought to labour, by clearing the eye of naturall conscience, and industrious inspection into Gods pure Law, to know as many as may bee) and for all those that come into His minde, when Hee sets himselfe apart, solemnely to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and afflict His Soule before God; (and Hee ought to remember as many as Hee can possibly) I say, if so, then for secret and unknowne sinnes, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in weakenesse and ignorance, the Lord accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a generall confession, as wee see in <hi>Davids</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Who can understand His errours?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6598:123"/>
Cleanse thou mee from secret faults.</hi> Sinnes there are many, and that in the best men, which are not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted of others, and free from the worlds observation, but even unknowne to a mans owne selfe, and invisible to the watchfullest eye of the most waking conscience; which notwithstanding are clearely subject to the search of Gods All-seeing eye, and to the censure of His pure Majesty: <hi>For Hell and destruction are before the Lord, how much more the secretest waies of the sonnes of men?</hi> Sinnes there are also, which even in the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous exercise, and holy worke of Repentance, may not come into the consideration and remembrance of one truly Penitent; which if Hee could recover into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Hee would heartily, and with much indignation acknowledge, bewaile and detest: So un-numbred are the cursed by-paths of mens crooked wayes. But for both these sorts of sinnes, I must say thus much for the comfort of the true Convert; that both those unknowne sins which Hee commits of ignorance, if He truly repent for all His knowne sinnes, and labour with sincerity and zeale for further illumination of conscience, and fuller revelation of every corrupt Passage both in heart &amp; life, in judgement and practise; and those sins of knowledge also, which came not into his minde, if with diligence, and without dissimulation, with hearty prayer, and best intention of spirit, He endeavour to recover them into His memory, that Hee might also mourne for, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them with the rest; carrying ever in His heart this resolution, that as any sinne shall bee discovered to His conscience, or returne into His mind, Hee will abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and abandon it; I say, both these kinds of sinnes (it is a Pearle for the true Penitent, let no stranger meddle with it) to such an one, upon such conditions are most certainely washed away by Christs blood, and Gods free mercy, upon His generall confession and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Davids</hi> Petition, <hi>O cleanse thou mee from my secret faults,</hi> did assuredly prevaile with God for the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6598:124"/>
forgivenesse of all His unknowne sinnes, and shall bee powerfull for that end, to the worlds end, to all those that so pray, with <hi>Davids</hi> spirit and sincerely.</p>
            <p>Besides these two cases; first, want of knowledge; and secondly, want of remembrance in the sense I have said: There is also a third, and that is, thirdly, want of time: which if truly so, doth also sometimes excuse the omission of some particular sinnes. As wee may see in the <hi>Thiefe</hi> upon the Crosse. For want of leisure, Hee could not possibly punctually revise His vile abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, nor peruse with remorse all the particulars of His former, wicked, and abhorred courses. But He had infused into His Soule by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> an habituall <note n="a" place="margin">Some thinke it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an action. But that Phrase, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Of powring the Spirit of grace</hi> (meaning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) <hi>upon the House of David, and upon the inhabitants of Ierusalem,</hi> seemes to argue it to be a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or infused gift, so as Faith and Charity are. So also that Phrase of giving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Act. 5.31. and 11.18. For if God give it, wee receive it. Now wee cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly bee said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an action, which wee doe, but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, gift or grace, whereby we doe it. That speech also, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Bring forth fruit meet for repentance,</hi> shewes, that Repentance it selfe is not an outward action, but an inward grace to bee expressed in outward actions. <hi>Dike of Repentance, cap.</hi> 1.</note> grace of true Repentance; which if Hee had lived, would have carried Him faithfully along over all the notorious Passages of His lewd and lothsome life, with a truly contrite, broken, and bleeding Soule. So that, if Hee had had space, I doubt not, but Hee would have prooved a very eminent, extraordinary, and exemplary <hi>Penitent.</hi> And therefore the Lord in mercy, did grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously <note n="b" place="margin">It is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and habituall Repentance, the inward frame, bent, and disposition of the Soule that God respects more, then the outward Act; as wee may see by that of <hi>David, Psalm.</hi> 32.5. <hi>I said, I will confesse my transgressions unto the Lord, and so thou forgavest the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my sin.</hi> The inward purpose and disposition of <hi>Davids</hi> heart to repent, was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to moove God to forgive His sin, before His outward, actuall, and particular Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was expressed. <hi>Prynne</hi> of the <hi>Perpetuity of a Regen. mans estate.

            <p>But to returne to the Point, and give my advise in the Case proposed:</p>
            <p>Let the Party, who so takes on for some notorious sin only, and there takes up His rest, be told; That tho He dwell with deepest sighes, heaviest heart and saltest teares, upon some of His greatest and most speciall sinnes; yet the rest must by no meanes bee neglected.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:6598:124"/>
That which is most crying, and <hi>crimson,</hi> must serve as a <hi>Cryer,</hi> that I may so speake, to summon the rest into the Court of Conscience, and as a <hi>Remembrancer</hi> to bring them to minde and remorse: As <hi>Davids</hi> murder and adultery brought even His Birth-sinne into His memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>Psalm.</hi> 51. And that sinne of strange wives many other sinnes to <hi>Ezra's</hi> minde, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. When a father beates His childe for some one speciall fault, He is wont to remember unto Him, and reckon with Him for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny former mis-demeanours also. When a Bankrout is once clapt up for one principall debt, the rest of His Creditours ordinarily come thicke and threefold upon Him. When once Thou begins to reckon with thy conscience for some one extraordinary rebellion, never cease untill thou hast searcht thorowly, and ransackt it to the bottome, that it may smart soundly, before Thou hast done, with penitent anguish, and true remorse for all thy other sinfull corruptions also. When horror for some one hainous sinne hath seiz'd upon thy heart, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Gods blessed hand leading thee to conversion, and thorow the Pangs of the New-birth to unspeakeable and glorious joy, by giving way to all the rest, to bring in their severall inditements against thy Soule. And bee not afraid thus to arraigne, cast and condemne thy Selfe as guilty of innumerable sinnes, and worthy ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Hells, before Gods just Tribunall. For then shalt thou there most certainely find a gracious <hi>Advocate</hi> at His right hand; To whom if Thou make sute, and seeke in truth, Hee will by the plea and price of His owne pretious blood, sue out a pardon for thine everlasting peace. When the guilty rage of thy raigning corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begins to presse upon thy conscience, lay on loade, and more weight still by a penitent addition, and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full apprehension of all thy other sinnes, that growing very sensible of thy spirituall slavery, weary of the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of lewdnesse and lust, sensuality and death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Divell hath kept Thee long; and thine heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The end of Gods dearest servant, after an holy life and unblame-able conversation, may not appeare in the eye of man so calme and comfortable, as was expected; by reason of much tendernesse of conscience, some strong temptation, spirituall desertion, violent distemper of Body; or because God would have the manner of His death serue the glory of His justice, in hardning those about him, who were so farre from being won by His godly life, that they heartily hated it; or for some other secret and sacred end seene, and seeming good to Divine wisedome, who ever disposeth every circumstance, even

For my part (as I my selfe looke for no great things in my death) I would not thinke more hardly of you; neither would I wish any to iudge otherwise of Gods Childe in that state of death: For wee shall not bee iudged according to that particular instant of death, but according to our generall course of life; not according to our deede in that present, but according to the desire of our hearts ever before: And therefore wee are not to mistrust Gods mercy in death, bee wee never so uncomfortable, if so bee it hath been before sealed in our vocation and sanctification.</hi>

For it may seeme rather to arise from feare of iudgement, and an horrour of Hell, then for any griefe for sinne.

many for my part, I have taken speciall notice of two: The one beeing laboured-with in prison, was seemingly so extraordinarily humbled, that a reverend Man of God was mooved thereby, to bee a meanes for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive, whereupon a Pardon was procured. And yet this so extraordinary a Penitent, while death was in his eye, having the terror removed, returned to His vomit; and some two yeeres after, to the same Place againe, as notorious a <hi>Belial</hi> as Hee was before. Another, having upon His Bed of sicknesse received in His owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite the sentence of death against Himselfe; and beeing pressed to humiliation, and broken-heartednesse; for Hee had formerly been a stranger and enemy to purity, and the power of godlinesse, answered thus: <hi>My heart is broken: and so broke out into an earnest confession of particular sinnes: Hee named uncleannesse, stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, obstinacy, vaine-glory, hypocrisie, dissimulation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenesse, covetousnesse, luke-warmenesse, &amp;c. He compared himselfe to the Thiefe upon the Crosse. And if God,</hi> saith Hee, <hi>restore mee to health againe, the world shall see, what an altered man I will bee.</hi> When hee was prest to syncerity and true-heartednesse in what hee said; <hi>Hee protested, that hee repented with all his heart and Soule, and minde, and Bowels, &amp;c. And desired a Minister that stood by, to bee a witnesse of these things betweene the world and Him. And yet this Man upon His recovery, became the very same, if not worse then Hee was before.</hi>

Secondly, the singularities about the good Thiefe: first, His heart was broken with one short Sermon, as it were; but thou hast, or mightest have heard many, and art yet hard-hearted. Secondly, the other Thiefe saw also that soveraigne Soule-healing blood gush freshly and abundantly out of His blessed side, and yet was not strucke, or stird at all. Thirdly, His example is onely for true Penitents; but Thou upon this presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>despising</hi> in the meane time, <hi>the riches of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and forbearance, and long-suffering, leading Thee to repentance, hardenest thy heart, that thou canst not repent.</hi> Fourthly, His case was singular, and such, that the like is not to bee found in the whole Scripture.

Hom. 22. in 2. ad Cor. 10.</note> conceite onely, or rather deceite, to take thy fill of pleasure in the meane time, and to seeke God sufficiently upon thy Bed of death, by repenting with the Thiefe at last. But know for thy terrour, and timely turning, that the longer thou puts off and deferres, the more unfit thou shalt be to repent. Thy custome in sinning will exercise more Tyranny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:6598:137"/>
Thee: The curse of God for thy going on still in thy trespasses will bee more heavy upon Thee. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that lurke in thine owne bosome, will be more strengthened against thee. And this threefold cord is hardly broken: These three Giants will be maistered with very much adoe. The further thou walkest in the wayes of death, the more unwilling, and more unable wilt thou bee to returne, and bee reformed. Thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding will be more darkened with Hellish mists, thy judgement more perverted, thy will more stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, thy memory more stuft with sensuall notions, thine affections will become more rebellious, thy thoughts more earthly, thine heart more hardened, thy conscience more feared, thy selfe more sold to sinne, and every day that comes over thine head in this state of darkenesse, much more the Child of the Divell, then thou wast before. To refuse <hi>Christ</hi> upon this Point so freely and fairely offered, is to receive Gods curse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Seale; and to make sure thy covenant with Hell, and League with death, untill thou bee slaine by the one, and swallowed up of the other, without all mercy, or recovery. For in this time of delay, God growes more angry, Satan more strong, thy selfe more unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, sinne more unconquerable, thy conversion more hard, thy salvation more impossible. A ruinous house, the longer thou lettest it run, the more labor &amp; charge will it require in repairing. If thou drive a naile with an hammer, the more blowes thou givest to it, the more hard will it bee to plucke it out againe.

               </gap>inne: and every new sin is a new stroke with an hammer, that drives the naile in further. Secondly, with what possibility art thou like to passe thorow the great work of saving repentance? or with what heart canst thou addresse thy selfe unto it? when upon thy sicke Bed, thou art set upon at once, if thy conscience bee waking, with the ugly sight of all thy sinnes charging upon thee with insupportable hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

of any true remorse, as hard as a Rocke of flint.

            <p n="1">1. That happy Soule, which is under the terrifying hand of God, preparing by the worke of the spirit of bondage, for the entertainement of Christ, and a sound conversion upon that fearefull apprehension of Gods wrath, and strict visitation of his conscience for sinne, casts about for ease and reconcilement, onely by the blood of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> and those Soule-healing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in the Booke of life, with a resolute contempt of all other meanes and offers, for pacification: feeling now, and finding by experience, that no other way, no earthly thing, not this whole world, were it all dissolved into the most curious, and exquisite pleasures, that ever any carnall heart conceived, can any way asswage the least pang of his grieved spirit. Glad therefore is Hee to take counsel and advise, with any that is able, or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to leade him by a wise and discreet hand to a well-grounded comfort and refreshment: And resolveth greedily, what-ever the prescription and direction bee, to give way unto it most willingly in his performance and practise. <hi>And the people asked him, saying, What shall wee doe then? Then came also Publicans to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and said unto Him, Master, what shall wee doe?
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:6598:145"/>
And the Souldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall wee doe?</hi> Thus were <hi>Iohns</hi> hearers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.10, 12, 14. beeing afflicted with the piercing passages of <hi>Iohns</hi> thundring Sermon; <hi>Men and brethren what shall wee doe?</hi> say the Penitent Iewes, <hi>pricked in their hearts, Acts.</hi> 2.37. <hi>The Iaylour, Acts</hi> 16.30. <hi>came trembling, and fell downe before</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas, <hi>and said, Sirs, what must I doe to bee saved?</hi> As if they had said: Prescribe and enioyne what you will; bee it never so harsh and distastefull to flesh and blood, never so crosse and contrary to carnall reason, profit, pleasure, preferment, acceptation with the world, ease, liberty, life, &amp;c. having warrant out of the Word, wee are resolved, and ready to doe it. Onely informe us first, how to partake, and bee assured of the person and passion of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; how to have the angry face of our blessed God, to whom wee have continued Rebels so long, turned into calmnesse and favour unto us. But now a Cast-away and Alien thus legally terrified, and under wrath for sinne, is never wont to come to this earnestnesse of care, eagernesse of resolution, stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of endeavour, willingnesse upon any termes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon utterly all His old wayes, and to embrace new, strict and holy courses. These things appeare unto Him terrible Puritanicall, and intolerable. He common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in such cases, hath recourse for ease and remedy to worldly comforts, and the arme of flesh. He labours to relieve his heavy heart, by a strong and serious casting his minde, and nestling his conceit upon his riches, gold, greatnesse, great friends, credit amongst Men, and such other transitory delights, and fading flowers of His fooles Paradise. For Hee is at a Point, and resolute with a sensuall impenitent obstinacy, not to passe forward thorow the Pangs of the New-birth by repentance and sanctification, into the holy Trade of new-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: lest Hee should, (as out of a foolish and phran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke basenesse, Hee is apt to feare) bee engaged and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:6598:146"/>
enchained, as it were, to too much stricknesse, precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, holinesse of life, communion with Gods people, and opposition to good fellowship.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hee, that is savingly-wounded with Legall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, is wont in cold blood, and being something come to Himselfe, to entertaine the very same conceit (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mingled with a great deale more reverence, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionatenesse and love, as farre as the life of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Soule doth surpasse in dearenesse and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the cure of a fraile and earthy body) of that Man of God, which by a right managing the edge of his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sword, hath pierced his heart, scorched his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and bruised his spirit; I say, the same in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which a wise and thankefull Patient would have of that faithfull Surgeon, which hath seasonably and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly launced some deepe and dangerous Sore, which otherwise would have been his death. Vpon the search and discovery, Hee clearely sees and acknowledgeth, that had not that holy incision been made into his rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ulcerous heart, it had cost him the eternall life of his Soule. But now the Alien put out of his sensuall humour with horrour of conscience, is ordinarily trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with much ragefull discontentment, against the powerfull Ministery of Gods paineful Messengers, who put Him to such torture, by troubling Him for sinne, and frighting Him with Hell. And thereupon cries out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, at least with secret indignation and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as the Divels did against <hi>Christ: Why doe you thus torment us before the time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Aliens in such cases entertaine no other thought, and cast about for no other comfort at all, but onely how they may recover their former quietnesse of mind, carnall ease, and freedome from present terrour. But hee that is fitting, by the spirit of bondage, for Faith, and the fellowship of the Saints, will never by any meanes, whatsoever come of Him, relapse to his wou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sensuall security. Nay, of the two, Hee will rather

lie still upon the Racke, waiting for the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> all the dayes of his life, then to <hi>returne any more unto foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse,</hi> or hunt againe after any contentment in the miserable pleasures of good fellowship.</p>

I say, such a blessed Man of God to such a broken heart, is for ever after most deare and welcome. <hi>His secte are beautifull</hi> in his eye, every time Hee comes neere Him. Comfort of so high a nature, in extremity of such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible consequence, doth infinitely and endlesly endeare the delivered Soule to such an heavenly Doctour. But Aliens commonly make no great account of godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters any longer, then they have present need of them, and that trouble of minde makes them Melancholike, and without mirth. They seeme to reverence them, while from their generall discourses of mercy, and Gods free grace, of mercifull invitations to Christ, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of acceptation (if they will come in) &amp;c. They sucke into their false hearts before the time, and truth of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, some superficiall glimmerings, and flashes of comfort and cooling. But if once the heate of their guilty rage begin to asswage, and they find againe some ease from their former terrours, and wonted rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in earthly delights, they turne such holy men out of their hearts, cast them out of their consciences, and hold no higher, or further conceit of them, then of other, and ordinary men; if they forbeare to persecute them with thoughts of disdaine and contempt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The true Penitent, having smarted under the sense of divine wrath, and frighted with the flames of horrour for sinne, doth grow fearefull for ever after to offend, and with much gracious care dreads that <hi>consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

But if once the storme bee over-blowne, Gods hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne, and his painefull conscience cast againe into a deade sleepe by the power, or rather poison of some sensuall receit, Hee performes just nothing: But like a filthy swine, wallowes againe in the mire and mud of earthlinesse and carnality, and againe with the beastly dog, returnes unto, and resumes his vomit.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hee that hath savingly passed thorow the Pangs of such spirituall afflictions, is wont to bee very kindlily affected, most compassionate, and tender-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to others, afflicted with the same wofull terrours and troubles of conscience. A woman, which hath her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with extraordinary paine, tasted of that exquisite torture of child birth, is wont to bee more tenderly and mercifully disposed towards another in the like tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then she, that never knew what that miserie meant: And is more ready, willing, and skillfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in such distresses.

Which is then, when his troubled heart is soundly humbled under Gods mighty hand, and brought at length to, first, a truly penitent sight, sense, and hatred of all sinne: secondly, a sincere and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable thirst after Iesus Christ, and righteousnesse both imputed, and inherent: thirdly, an unfained and un-reserved resolution of an universall New-obedience for the time to come, &amp;c. Here I had purposed to have been large; but I am prevented by that which hath been said already: and therefore to avoide repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I must remit you to the consideration of those Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and Evangelicall preparations for the entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ and true comfort, which I handled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which may give some good direction and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Point.</p>
            <p>Yet take notice, that in the meane time before such fitnesse bee fully effectuated, I would have the Man of God ply his Patient with his best perswasions and Proofes, seasonably mingled with motives to humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the pardonablenesse of his sinnes, possibility of pardon, damnablenesse of despaire, danger of ease by outward mirth, &amp;c. And to hold out to the eye of the troubled conscience, as a prize and Lure, as it were, the freenesse of Gods immeasurable mercy, the generall
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:6598:148"/>
Offer of Iesus Christ without any exception of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, times, or sinnes; the pretiousnesse and infallibilitie of the promises, in as faire and lovely a fashion, in as orient and alluring formes, as Hee can possibly. But it is One thing, to say; If these things bee so, I can assure you in the Word of life, of the promises of life, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready-reall right and interest to all the riches of Gods free grace, and glorious purchase of Christs meritorious blood: Another thing, to say; If you will suffer your understandings to bee illightened, your consciences to bee convinced, your hearts to be wounded with sight, sense, and horrour of sin; If you will come-in, and take Iesus Christ, His Person, his Passion, his yoke; If you will entertaine these and these affections, longings, and resolutions, &amp;c. Then most certainely our mercifull Lord will crowne your truly humbled soules with his dearest compassions, and freest love.</p>
            <p>Lastly, bee informed, that when all is done, I meane, when the Men of God have their desire; That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in their perswasion is soundly wrought upon, and professeth understandingly and feelingly, and as they verily thinke from His heart; first, that Hee is <hi>heavy laden</hi> with the grievous burden of all His sinnes; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That Hee is come by his present spirituall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and trouble of minde, to that resolution, <hi>to doe any thing</hi>; which wee find the Hearers of <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter, Luk.</hi> 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Thirdly, That Hee most highly prizeth <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> farre above the riches, pleasures, and glory of the whole earth; thirsts, and longs for Him infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Fourthly, That Hee is most willing to <hi>sell all:</hi> To part with all sinne, with His <hi>right eye,</hi> and <hi>right hand,</hi> those lusts and delights which stucke closest to His bosome; Not to leave so much as an <hi>hoofe behind.</hi> Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That hee is content with all his heart to take <hi>Christ,</hi> as well for a Lord and Husband to serue, love, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Him; as for a Saviour to deliver Him from the miseries of sinne. To take upon Him His yoke: To

enter into the <hi>narrow way,</hi> and walke in the <hi>holy Path</hi>: To associate Himselfe to that <hi>sect,</hi> which is so <hi>spoken against everywhere, &amp;c.</hi> I say, when it is thus with the afflicted Party, and most happy is Hee, when it is thus with Him; yet notwithstanding, because God alone is the <hi>Searcher of the heart,</hi> and <hi>the heart of Man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull above all things,</hi> wee can assure mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but onely conditionally, (Tho by the mercy of God, wee doe it many and many times with strong and undeceiving confidence). Wee must ever adde either expressedly, or impliedly, such formes of speech as these: If all this which you professe bee in truth; If you bee thus resolved indeed; If these things bee so as you have said, &amp;c. Why, then wee assure you in the word of life and truth, your Case is comfortable; you may sweetly repose your troubled, and truly-humbled soule upon <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as your <hi>wisedome, righteousnes, sanctification</hi> and <hi>redemption</hi>; upon all the Promises of life, Gods free grace, &amp;c. as truly belonging unto you, and certainely yours for ever.</p>

no pardon, if the sinner doth not earnestly repent; The other, that hee himselfe which pardoneth, hath need of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.

It is a thing certaine, that if a sinner seriously converting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beleeving in Iesus Christ, cannot obtaine absolution of his Pastor which is passionate, or badly informed of the truth; God will pardon him. On the contrary, if a Pastor that is indulgent, an winketh at vices, or that is deceived by appearance of repentance, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth an hypocriticall sinner, and receiveth him into the communion of the faithfull, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

keepe from presumption: as shall appeare in the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Counsells, I shall commend for that purpose.</p>
            <p>Vpon this ground, I reason thus:</p>
            <p>A man may presse, and apply Gods justice, and the terrours of the Law <hi>Too much</hi>; therefore also mercy, and the comforts of the Gospell, too much. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is cleare. For as the former may plunge into the Gulphe of despaire; so the other may cast upon the Rocke of presumption: Nay, it is more then un-answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably strong; Because wee are farre readier to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and apply unto our selves mercy, then judgement. And thousands are endlesly overthrowne thorow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, for one by despaire.</p>
            <p>And the Antecedent who will deny? It is rather so preposterously applauded and prest; that most, if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, even with his best discretion, reveale the whole Counsell of God, and tell them; That none shalbee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed by Christ, but onely those who <hi>labour and are heavy laden</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note> That they must <hi>humble themselves in the sight of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames 4.10. Prov. 28.13.</note> if they would have him <hi>to lift them up:</hi>

            <p>Conceive therefore, I pray you;</p>
            <p>That there is in God; first, His justice; and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, His mercy, both infinite and equall. Onely in regard of Man there is an inequality; For God may bee said, to bee more mercifull unto them that are saved, then just to them that are damned: For of damnation the

            <p>Bee content therefore on the otherside, that wee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Armory of Gods justice, and <hi>reveale his wrath from heaven against all ungodlinesse and unrighteousnesse of Men; That indignation and wrath, Tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,</hi> shalbe <hi>upon every soule of man that doth evill, &amp;c.</hi> As wee are ever ready to binde vp the bruised spirit with the softest oyle of Gods sweetest mercy: So let us, I pray you, have leave, in the equity of a just and holy proportion, to wound with the <hi>Hammer</hi> of the Law, the <hi>ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let it bee thus then, and let our Ministeriall dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation bee in this manner: If thou bee an impenitent Person; I would tell Thee, That the vtmost wrath of God, vnquenchable and everlasting vengeance, all earthly and infernall plagues, are thy certaine Portion: But I would mollify and sweeten the bitternesse of this sentence, with assurance of mercy upon Repentance, to prevent the assaults of despaire.</p>
            <p>On the other side, If the Ministry of the Word hath
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:6598:152"/>
wrought upon Thee effectually; and now thy truly-humbled soule thirsts after Christ with a syncere hatred and opposition against all sinne; I would assure thy troubled and trembling heart in the Word of life and truth, of all those most pretious blessings and sweetest comforts, which the Booke of God doth promise, and the blood of Christ hath bought: But withall I would commend unto thee some Coolers and Counterpoisons against presumption, and falling to Pharisaisme.</p>
            <p>For which purpose, and for prevention of danger, and spirituall undoing by unskilfull, and undiscreet dawbing in the Case proposed; I come now to tender such Counsels and Caveats as these, or the like, which the faithfull Physition of the Soule according to occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, circumstances, and present exigents, may thinke fit to bee mingled with administration of mercy, and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propounded to the afflicted Party.</p>
            <p>It may not proove unseasonable to speake thus, or in some such manner, to thy spirituall <hi>Patient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If these things bee truly and soundly so: If thou finde and feele indeed such a mollified and melting spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, such broken and bleeding affections in thy bosome; Thou art certainely blessed.

Consider the <hi>young Man</hi> in the Gospell: Hee came hastily unto Iesus Christ, and would needs bee His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and follower upon the sudden. But alas! Hee did wofully mistake. Little did he know, neither indeed would know, what belonged unto it: That the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of such an heavenly Master must bee no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme; That every one of his Disciples must <hi>take up their crosse and follow</hi> him; For his sake, part with any thing, every thing; bee it riches, honours, credit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, &amp;c. And therefore, when once Christ for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of his heart had bid Him <hi>go, and sell that he had, &amp;c.</hi> Hee had soone done: Hee was quickly gone. Now had this young Man gone away without this Lesson, Hee had gone away a Disciple, as well as any other, and perhaps as iolly a Professour, as the forwardest of them all; and that both in his owne strong opinion, and charitable mis-conceite of the rest, who were true of heart. As <hi>Iudas</hi> did a long time, and the <hi>foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines</hi> all their life long. Too many such Professours, as Hee would have prooved, are to bee found, even in this Noone-tide of the Gospell abroad in the World: who beeing at their first entrance into Profession, not sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled, nor laying a sure foundation; not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon an universall Selfe-deniall; nor weighing with due fore-cast, what it will cost them, doe afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves thereafter upon any gainefull occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on greater triall, and temptation, or beeing put to it indeed: They are wont from time to time to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their rottennesse, open the mouthes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and shame all. They are like unto Reeds, which in a calme stand bolt upright, and seeme stiffe and strong; but let a tempest breake-in upon them, and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:6598:162"/>
they bend any way: While their temporall state is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht, their outward happinesse unhazarded; they seeme resolute, thorow, and couragious; but let a storme of persecution bee raised against them; Let them bee put into a great fright, that if they stand to it, they may bee undone, &amp;c. And then they cowardlily hide their heads, pull in the hornes, as they say, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully shrinke in the wetting: unhappily holding it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to sleepe in a whole skinne, then with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Like the <hi>Eagle,</hi> they soare aloft with many goodly religious shewes and representations; but they still keepe their eye upon the Prey; and therefore when advantage is offered, they will basely stoope from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, honesty, generosity, humanity, any thing, to seize upon a worldly commodity, office, honour, some earthly pelfe, and transitory <hi>Nothing.</hi> Some of these after Profession for some time, fall quite away from it, and turne Epicures, or Worldlings, if not Scorners and Persecutors: Others hold-on in a plodding course of formall Christianity all their life long; and at last, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this life like the <hi>foolish Virgins,</hi> and in that formall manner I told you of before. Neither be thou dis-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this counsell of leaving all for Christ. For thou shalt bee no loser, but a great gainer thereby.

Yea, but they thirst onely for salvation, not for sanctification; for mercy, not for grace; for happinesse, not for holinesse, &amp;c. These men, as well as the second sort, will by no meanes thorow the pangs of the New-birth into the holy Path. They wickedly misconceiue out of the rotten Principles of their owne worldly wisedome, prejudice against the power of godlinesse, and pestilent perswasions of <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-sowers under their elbowes,</hi> that in so doing, they shalbee utterly undone, and never have good day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: But, to speake in their owne language, fall presently into the hands of the Puritanes, into the strict tortures, and Hypocriticall miseries of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse, into fowrenesse, vnsociablenesse, dumps of Melancholy; and indeede, into a state, not past a step

short of distraction and madnesse. And these therefore cast about to get out of trouble of minde, and sense of divine terrour with as great impatiency and precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the former; onely more plausibly, and with see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly fairer, but truly false satisfaction to their owne Soules. For the former rush with furious indignation out of these spirituall dejections of Conscience, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly feares, not fit for worthy spirits, and men of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall resolution, into greater excesse, and variety of worldly delights, and sensuall loosenesse; and so ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily become afterward very notorious, and more des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate enemies to the <hi>Kingdome of Christ</hi>: Because the power of the Word hath once stung their carnall hearts with some remorsefull terrour, they ever after heartily hate the sound and searching Ministry, and managers thereof, the Inflicters of their smart; for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the world, but that they tell them the truth, and thereupon torment them before their time; that so, if they be not wanting unto themselves, they may escape the torments of eternity hereafter. And they set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against godly Christians with incompatible estrangement, and implacable spite; onely because they are Professours of Selfe-deniall, holy strictnesse, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the world, repentance, mortification, &amp;c. the entertainement and exercise whereof they furiously more detest and flie from, then the death of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and damnation of their Soules. But these latter, passe more plausibly out of trouble of conscience, and take a fairer course of the two, tho it proove but an imaginary and counterfeite Cure. For they labour to close up their spirituall wound, with comfort out of the Word; and promise peace to their troubled hearts from the promises of life: But herein they faile, and fearefully deceive themselves, in that they conceive, the first fits and qualmes, as it were, of Legall terrour, to bee saving repentance; a generall speculative appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Christ's Passion, to procure a speciall pardon

dealing with their Brethren. But these men are to know, that Christs blood never pardoned any mans Soule from sinne, whose spirit the power thereof did not purge from guile. It never saves any one from Hell, whom it doth not first in some good measure sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with holinesse and heavenly life.

Secondly, Violent affections about the infusing of it, which are wont to bee raised in the humbled heart by the Holy Ghost; extreme thirst, inflamed desires, vehement longings, un-utter-able groanings of spirit, prizing and preferring the Person and Passion of <hi>Christ,</hi> before the Possession of infinite Worlds; willingnesse to <hi>sell all,</hi> to part with any thing for Him, tho neuer so deare, or so much doted upon heretofore; with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, riches, preferments, a <hi>right hand,</hi> a <hi>right eye,</hi> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, life, &amp;c. Nay, if in such a Case, if even Hell it selfe should stand betweene Iesus Christ and a poore Soule, He would most willingly passe thorow the very flames thereof to embrace His blessed crucified Lord, in the armes of a lively Faith.

            <p>Many unfaithfull men in the Ministry, both in their publike teaching, and private visitations of the sicke, have much to answer-for in this Point: who for want of skill in that highest Art of saving soules, of familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with God, and secret workings of his Spirit, of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in their owne change, and of the spirit of discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp;c. many times concurre with such miserable men to marre all, in stife-ling the very first stirrings of Legall remorse, by healing the wounds of their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with sweet words, before they be searcht, and sounded to the bottome; and by an unseasonable and undiscreet heaping a great deale of comfort there, where as yet, a good ground-worke of true humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not soundly laid. Many and lamentable are the spirituall miseries in those Places, where such Dawbers with untempered morter domineere; who never pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thorow the Pangs of the New-birth themselves, were never feelingly acquainted with the wonderfull dealings of God in that great Miracle of a Mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; nor trained up experimentally in the Schoole of temptations, painefull exercises of mortification, and counter-minings against the <hi>Depths, Wiles, Devises, and stratagems of the Divell.</hi> The blessed Prophet paints them out to the life, and denounces a dreadfull woe against such flattering and foolish Prophets, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13. A Ship-Master skilfull onely in Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and other speculative Passages of the Art of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, is no body in conducting Men safely over some dangerous Sea, to Him, that besides sufficiencies of Art, is furnisht also with experimentall skill in those Parts, by passing formerly that way Himselfe, and having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered those dangers of ruine, and hidden Rockes,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:6598:171"/>
which the other Man might easily runne upon. Give me a Man, in whom variety and profoundnesse of best lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth concurre in the highest degree of excellency, yet if his owne heart bee not soundly wrought upon, and seasoned with saving grace, Himselfe experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally seene into the Mystery of Christ, and Secrets of sanctification, as Hee shall bee hardly able to wound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens consciences, and pierce them to the quicke; so Hee will bee found very unfit to manage aright the spirituall miseries of a troubled Soule; and to transport it savingly thorow the tempestuous terrours and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations incident to the New-creation, into the Port of true peace, and Paradise of the blessed <hi>Brother-hood.</hi> A right dreadfull and tender Point it is, to deale with distressed consciences; so many depths of Satan, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of Mans heart mingle themselves with businesse of so great consequence. Even a well-meaning Man without much heedfulnesse, and good experience both in the Point, and the Party, may erre dangerously, and bee much deceived herein. I have heard from a Man of conscience and credit, besides many and many in the same kind, of a fearefull imposture to this purpose: <hi>A man, who for the world was well enough, visited with some trouble of minde for his sinnes, sent for a Minister to minister comfort. Hee, it seemes, not sounding Him to the bottome, or searching to the quicke, heaped upon Him unseasonably, and too soone, mercies, and hopes of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all safety. Amongst other things, Hee asked Him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formerly, Hee had ever felt testimonies and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods favour, and love; Yea, answered the Party</hi>; [and here take notice of a notorious depth of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell] <hi>Once riding alone upon the way in such a Place, I grew upon the sudden, very lightsome, and light-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c.</hi> [This was but a flash of Satans Angelicall glory, cunningly to lighten and leade him the way to further confusion]. <hi>Why then, replied the Minister, you may build upon it. God is constant in His favours; and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:6598:171"/>
whom Hee loves once. Hee loves for ever. Hereupon the Patient was presently healed of his wounded heart, and after fell unto his former courses, and grew fully as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, as Hee was before.</hi> Amongst the many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Passages of our Ministeriall imployments, I feare mee, this <note n="p" place="margin">

Others there are, who passe out of trouble of Conscience for sinne, into some more tolerable courses for the time to come; but yet not thorowly, and saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the truth and Trade of Christianity. For when Satan once perceives, that sorrow for sinne lies so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie upon a Mans heart; and the rage of guiltinesse doth sting him still with such restlesse angvish, that in all likelihood, it will at length draw and drive him to some alteration at least, and worke out at last some measure of amendment; then doth hee out of an insatiable hellish thirst to hold him still in his clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, bend and imploy all his power and policy, to make him satisfie himselfe; and rest finally, as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently fitted for salvation, in some partiall, insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, halfe-conversion; and to sit downe contentedly with religious formes onely, and some outward refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

A Traitour in graine, as it were, and most desperate Rebell to the divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, wallowing still in all variety of villany and vanity. But if that will not bee, Hee is glad to detaine him, in what degree of prophanenesse, hee can most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and with greatest safty, tho the least and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; in any state of unregeneratenesse, tho furnished

               </gap>f which it is capable; so that Hee step not into the Kingdome of <hi>Christ.</hi> Rather then Hee will utterly lose him, and part with Him quite, Hee will leave possession of Him in part; and be willing, tho full sore against his will, to lose a great deale of his former more furious service; and something of the fullnesse of his conformity to the fashions of Hell, If Hee cannot doe as hee would, Hee will doe as hee may, as they say. When Hee sees him grumbling and grow discontent, and weary with the loathsomnesse of the Dungeon, and waight of his fetters; rather then Hee should escape, and breake quite away; Hee will knock off some of his irons, grant him the liberty of the Prison, the comfort of the walks; nay and suffer Him sometimes to walke abroade, so that Hee bee still watchfully attended by his <hi>Keeper</hi>; and continue a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer</hi> to the kingdome of darkenesse. Hee will bee content, to give him the benefit of the fewest stripes in Hell, and the least measure of damnation; tho that also be more then infinitely terrible, and intolerable, rather then Hee should bee undamned at all. And therefore in such a Case, Hee will easily suffer Him to proceede to some kinde of Repentance; and reformation, of some one or moe outward grosse notorious sinnes; remorse whereof, perhaps, did first raise the terrour and trouble in his minde; so that He wil there rest, and remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified and unamended in the rest. Or, Hee cares not much, tho He be universally, outwardly reformed; and unblameable, for the most part, in his visible carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and conversation; Tho Hee restore ill gotten goods with <hi>Iudas</hi>; say his praiers, give almes, fast often, give tythes of all that He possesses, with the <hi>Pharisee</hi>; hold out a Lamp of goodly professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the eie of the world, with the foolish <hi>Virgines; observe</hi> godly Ministers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <hi>many things</hi> after their Preaching, and <hi>heare them gladly,</hi> with <hi>Herod</hi>; So that for all this plausible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicious outside the heart continue unchast, impure,

Hee is told and terrified; That by such sinnes He doth not onely damne Himselfe, but also ever draw another to Hell with Him, &amp;c. Whereupon Hee may grow into a slavish distaste, and dis-continuance from them; and Satan will not say much, so that there succede in their roomes, some other kinds of uncleannesse; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps immoderate abuse the marriage, without any checke, or remorse; or some other secret, Selfe-abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, not to bee conceived without horrour, much lesse to bee named. Nay, Hee will yet yeeld further, and endure an utter cessation from the externall acts, and visible practise of a Mans predominant and reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sinne; so that hee delightfully feede upon it still in his heart with speculative greedinesse; and spend the strength of his affections, and the most of His thoughts that way.

Change, (of which see <hi>My Directions for walking with God,</hi> pag. 310.) And yet continue him still within the confines of His cursed kingdome, and in a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state. Hee doth improove to the utmost, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of advantage is offered, both the grisseliest shape of a foule Fiend, and the most alluring light of His Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall glory; to doe us a mischiefe any way, either upon the right hand, or the left.

Bee advised then in the Name of Christ, whosoever thou art, when the hand of God, great mercy, shall visit and vex thy conscience for sinne, by the piercing power of the Ministry: Bee sure to follow the direction and guidance of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hand, without dawbing or diversion, out of the kingdome of darkenesse, thorow the Pangs of the <hi>New-birth,</hi> into the <hi>holy Path,</hi> wholly and for ever.

Have never any thing more to doe with the Divell; Give over the Trade of sinning quite, never more to <hi>turne agains unto Folly</hi> upon any termes. And if Satan set upon Thee with baites and allurements, to detaine Thee in his spirituall Bondage, but by one darling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to which thou hast been most addicted: Answer him in this Case with an un-shaken resolution, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in a Point of temporall Bondage;<note place="margin">Exod. 10.26.</note>

            <p>Art thou haunted with some of Satans most hatefull and horrible injections, grissely to the eie even of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature, Thoughts framed by himself immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and put into thee; perhaps tending to Atheisme, or to the dishonour of God in the highest degree, or of his blessed word; to self-destruction, or the like? Thoughts, which thou canst not remember without horrour, and darest not reveale, or name for their strange and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious monstrousnesse. If it bee thus with thee: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how this malicious Feind dealt with the Sonne of God himselfe. He offered to his most holy, and unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted imagination, these propositions: First, <hi>Murder and make away thy selfe, Matth.</hi> 4.6. Secondly, <hi>Fall downe and worship the Divell: Vers.</hi> 9. Then which a fouler thought, I thinke, was never injected: that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> blessed for ever, in whom the <hi>God head dwelt bodily,</hi> should fall downe and worship the Divell, the vilest of Creatures. And yet this was suggested to our blessed Saviour. To which his purest heart infinitely uncape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of sinne, was as a brasse wall to an arrow, beating it backe presently with infinite contempt. And him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6598:183"/>
did utterly conquer and confound the tempter; and that for thee, and thy sake too. And therefore <note n="*" place="margin">All temptations are not sins in the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for then Christ should have sinned.

Extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then doe those wrong themselves, and gratifie the Divell to the height; who suffer such injections, which they heartily hate, and stand against, with all their strength, to hold their hearts still upon the racke of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary astonishment and distraction; whereby they are unnecessarily discouraged and disabled for a chearefull discharge of both their callings.

After often and curious seeking occasion for that bloody fact, at last having first put off her apparrell, threw her self head-long from an high Promontory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea. But having received no hurt by her fall; shee was there, by a Miracle, and extraordinary mercy, strangely preserved, for the space of two houres at the least; though all the while shee laboured industriously to destroy her selfe.

            <p>Hereupon by little and little, there flowed by Gods blessing into her darke and heavy heart, abundance of life, lightsomnesse, spirituall strength, and assurance. In which she continued with constancy and comfort, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a yeere after; crowned those happy dayes, and a blessed old age, with a glorious and triumphant death, and went to Heaven in the yeere 1595. What heart now, but Hers that felt it, can possibly conceive the depth of that extraordinary, un-utterable refreshing; which sprung out of that promise, upon her forlorne and fearefull soule; or the excesse of that love, which shee bore ever after to those blessed lines; to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that made them, and to the blood that sealed them?</p>

               <hi>An other terrified in conscience for sinne, resolves to

incomprehensible goodnesse in this <hi>Name of God</hi>; and hold them most blessed, who have their part and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein. But for my part, I am affraid, I come too late. For I have observed the course of the Ministery amongst us, and the dispensation of Gods mercy in it. At first comming, our Towne being full of Ignorance, prophanesse, and much superstitious follies, having never before injoyed the Word with any life or power; wee all stood amazed a good whle, at the Majesty and Mysterie of this new heavenly Light. The first messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Ministry sounded in our eares, <hi>as the voyce of many waters,</hi> mighty, and great; but confused: not working in us either joy or terrour, but onely an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary wonder, and secret acknowledgement of a strange force, and more then humane power. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when our <hi>Watchman</hi> was better acquainted with our waies, and had more fully discovered the state of our soules; the Word was unto us, <hi>as a voice of a great thunder,</hi> more distinct and particular; breeding not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admiration, but feare also; not filling our eares one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with an uncouth sound, but our hearts also with a terrible searching. For the Sermons of every Sabbath came-home to our consciences, singling out our severall reigning corruptions; beating punctually upon our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some-sinnes; manifesting clearely our spirituall misery, and certaine liablenesse to the extremest wrath of God, and endlesse woe. Whereupon, wee were all at our wits end what to doe, grew weary of our lives, wished with all our hearts, that such a Puritane-Preacher had never come amongst us; told every man, almost wee met, that wee had a Fellow at our Towne would drive us all to despaire, distraction, selfe-destruction, or some mischiefe, or other. That wee heard nothing from him but of damnation, and hell, and such horrible things, &amp;c. Now in this second worke of the Word, there was a good number, even some out of that cursed crue and knot of Good-fellowship, wherein I have been insna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:6598:191"/>
so long, wonne unto <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> For beeing illight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, convinced and terrified in conscience for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sinfull courses; the continued piercing of the Word, and worke of the spirit of bondage, keeping them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Racke, under the dreadfull sense of divine wrath, and their damnable state a good while: at last, they happily resolved without any more delay, diversion, by-path, or plunging againe into worldly pleasures, to passe on directly, by the light and guidance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, into the <hi>holy path.</hi> And so undertooke, and hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have holden out in Profession; and a blessed confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the better side, But I, and the greater part a great deale, more was the pitty, hating heartily to bee reformed; and abhorring that precise <hi>way,</hi> so much <hi>spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against every where</hi>; into which woe conceived, such severe Ministeriall counsell would have conducted us; I say, wee wickedly wrested out of our vexed conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, those keene arrowes of truth and terrour, with great indignation; wee unhappily hardned our hearts and foreheads against the power of the Word, which particularly pursued us every Sabbath: Nay, alas! we persecuted the very meanes, which should sanctifie us; and men, which would have saved us. Here then is my Case and complaint; neglecting that blessed season, when I was first terrified and troubled in minde; when the <hi>Angell</hi> from Heaven, as it were, <hi>troubled the water</hi>; and when some, even of mine owne Companions in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, were converted; I am affraid, I now come too late, that the mercy of God to doe mee spirituall good, is already expired; and that the Ministry, which I have so wretchedly opposed, is the very same to mee, that it was to the obstinate <hi>Iewes, Isa.</hi> 6.9.10. Nay, but yet say not so; though it bee with thee as thou hast sayd: For our gracious God <hi>keepeth mercy for thousands.</hi>

In the meane time, hee heares it cry, run about, and call upon him; and yet hee stirres not, but forbeares to appeare; not for want of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and kindnesse, which the more it takes-on, the more abounds; but, that it may dearelier prize the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers presence; that they may meete more merrily, and rejoyce in the enjoyment of each other more heartily.

            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. One argument may bee taken from the blessed noblenesse of Gods nature, and the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sweetnesse of his divine disposition: Which by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite distance, without all degree of comparison, and measure of proportion, doth surpasse, and transcend the ingenuousnesse of the noblest spirit upon earth. Now, men of ingenuous breeding, and generous dispositions, are wont to receive sweetest contentment, and rest best satisfied, in prevailing over, and winning the hearts, good wills, and affections of those, who attend, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them. Outward performances, gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and visible effects, are often beyond our strength and meanes; many times mingled, and quite mard, with Hypocrisies, disguisements, famed accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and flatteries; with selfe-advantages, by-respects, and private ends: But inward reverence, and love, kind and affectionate stirrings of the heart, are ever, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in our power; and ever, by an uncontrole-able free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, exempted from enforcement, dissembling, and formality. No marvaile then, tho the most royall, and Heroicall spirits, prize most, and bee best pleased with possession of Mens hearts; and beeing assured of them, can more easily pardon the want of those outward Acts of sufficiency, and service (most minded by basest men) which they see to be above the reach of their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:6598:204"/>
and power. Now if it be so, that even ingenuous, and noble natures accept with speciall respect and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme the affectionatenesse, and hearty well-willing of their followers and Favourits; tho th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If Satans spitefull craft, taking a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell advantage of thy present dejection of spirit, doe not hinder thy trembling heart from telling the truth; I know, thou canst not deny this. And then I must tell Thee; These hearty longings, and longing desires in the meane time, untill God give more strength, be right deare to that tender-hearted Father of thine; which doth infinitely more esteeme one groane or sigh from a broken spirit, then <hi>a thousand rammes, or tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand rivers of oyle</hi>; and are most pretious and piercing to that compassionate heart, that poured out it's warmest and dearest blood to purchase the salvation, and refresh the sadnesse of every truly-humbled Soule.

            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Thou mayst bee diversly distressed upon thy Bed of death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Casting thine eye backe upon thy whole life, all thy sinnes from <hi>Adam</hi> to that houre; and willing, as thou must now take thy farewell, so to take thy fill of repentance; They appeare to the eie of thy conscience farre moe in number, and more ougly, then ever before. And no marvaile; for beeing now sequestred for ever from all worldly comforts, and company; distractions, and diversions, and the cloudes of naturall feare, raised by the dreadfull circumstances of approaching dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; uniting, as it were, and collecting the sight of thy Soule, which imploiments in the world, commerce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, and Sunne-shine of outward prosperity, did before too much disperse, dazle, and divert; they are represented farre more to the life, and in their true colours. Whereupon, comparing the poore weake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingnesse,

as thou now apprehends, of thy godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, hatred, and opposition against them, with thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent apprehension of their hainousnesse, hatefulnesse, and horrible number; Thou begins to bee dejected, and knowest not well what to thinke of thy Selfe. I say then, for thy comfort, consult with thy sanctified heart; and thou shalt finde, and feele an infinite hearty desire, that thy repentance for them, detestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, and heart-rising against them, had been, and now were as thorow, sound, and resolute, as ever was in any peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Soule, that breathed the life of grace upon earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Revising now, thy whole Christian conversation; spending of Sabbaths, pouring out pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, reading Scriptures, hearing the Word, love of the Brethren, dayes of humiliation, workes of mercy, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament, godly conference, living by Faith in all estates, &amp;c. Thou mayst see them in this last, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, cleare, retired examination of thy conscience, to have been pestered with so many failings, imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deadnesse of spirit, distractions, distempers; that thou begins to feare and conceive; <hi>As well never a whit, as never the better,</hi> as they say, &amp;c.

            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Thou mayst bee troubled at that time; because, beeing perhaps, as yet, but of little standing in Profession, thou hast done God so little service; and in that short time, hast not stood on Gods side with that courage and life, nor walked in his holy wayes, with that watchfulnesse and Zeale, as thou mightest. And it cuts thy heart the more; because thou spent so much of thy time, in serving thy selfe and Satan; and expectest

now, to enjoy immortall joyes and a Crowne of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse blisse. But here is thy comfort.

            <p>Assure now thy selfe, in these three cases, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles upon thy last Bed; this syncere desire of thine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Soule, wilbe graciously accepted of our mercifull God, in the Name of Iesus Christ: As tho, first, Thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance had been to the full: Secondly, Thy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the height: Thirdly, Thy present promises, vowes and resolutions, for future forwardnesse and fruitfulnesse performed to the vtmost. For when all is done, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is <hi>All in All</hi>: Hee alone is the onely Sanctuary, and Tower of everlasting safty, for every truly humbled Soule to fly unto, both in life and death: Hee is made unto us <hi>wisedome,</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

Thou art ravisht with extraordinary admiration and affection, after that <hi>hidden Treasure</hi> and <hi>Pearle of great price</hi>; holding thy selfe happy, that ever thou wast borne; and made for ever, if thou canst get possession of it; but a gone-man, if thou canst not get it, and an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Cast-away. Most willing therefore art Thou <hi>to sell all that thou hast</hi>; prizing it infinitely before the riches, glory, and pleasures of the whole earth, &amp;c.

And that which troubles thee most of all, for all these sinnes, thy sorrow is very poore and scant, in no proportion to thy former hainous provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I say, upon these, and the like mistaken grounds, Thou very unadvisedly professes, but against thine own Soule, That as yet, Thou canst not, thou dares not, Thou wilt not, meddle with any mercy, apply any promise, or bee perswaded, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> belongs unto Thee. What? Such a vile, unworthy, abominable wretch at thou! to expect such glorious things; to come neare so pure a God; to lay violent hands upon the Lord of

            <p>But before I come to speake more fully to the Point, Let mee premise this Principle:</p>
            <p>When a Man is once syncerely humbled under Gods mighty hand, with sight of sinne, and sense of divine wrath; so that now all his former wicked wayes, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:6598:218"/>
and provocations of Gods pure eye, lie so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon His heart; that Hee is truly weary, willing to bee rid of them all, unfainedly thirsting after the blood and holinesse of <hi>Christ</hi>: And therefore as well content to take upon him His sweet and easy yoke, for to please Him in New-obedience for the time to come; as to partake of the merit of His Passion, for the present par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of His sinnes; I say, then Hee must conceive, that Hee hath a sound, seasonable, and comfortable Calling, to lay fast hold upon <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; and to bee undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly perswaded, that Hee hath his part and portion in Him. And besides, that Gods blessed Word determines it, Hee may the rather assent unto the season, and the more boldly believe; Because Hee hath now found, and feeles by his owne experience, the practise of that double policy of the Divell, so often discovered unto Him heretofore by Gods faithfull Messengers, to wit; That whereas Hee was a long time most industrious to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eepe His heart resolutely stubborne, and unstird a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the might and piercing of the most powerfull Ministry; and when at any time Hee once perceived it to begin to worke upon Him, raised all possible oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against His yeelding: So now, when Hee is truly toucht indeed, and resolute to abandon His Hellish sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very for ever; Hee labours might and maine, with all restlesse cruelty and malice, to keepe His conscience continually upon the Racke. To this purpose, He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and urgeth to the utmost, the hainousnesse of his former sinnes, the fiercenesse of Gods wrath, which Hee cunningly concealed before; the littlenesse of His sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; His unworthinesse to meddle with any promise, and the like. And what's the reason, thinke you, that Hee, who was so dawbing before, is now so downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; Hee, that was so indulgent before, is now so des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately bloody, and for nothing but despaire, and damnation? It is easie to tell; For that foule Fiend knowes full well, if a poore Soule in the supposed case,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:6598:218"/>
and such a truly-humbled state, shall but come now, when Christ calls Him, and <hi>set to His seale, that God is true</hi>; which not to doe, shall ever bee an unmannerly madnesse, and willfull cruelty to a mans owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Hee is then quite gone out of His kingdome of darkenesse; and an immortall Soule is pulld out of His Hellish Paw for ever. This is the true reason, why Hee so rageth, when Hee sees a weary Soule make towards <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for rest. I have often foretold you of Satans methode, and malice, in managing His temptations in this kinde; that beeing fore-warned, yee may be fore-armed. He plots first, and prevailes with most amongst us, to keepe them from terrour and trouble for sinne. But if they bee once happily wounded that way, then His next plot, is to allay, and take away the smart by outward mirth; or dawbe, and draw over a skinne one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with unsound and superficiall comfort. But if Hee find, that it bleeds still, and will not bee stanched, but onely by the blood of <hi>Christ</hi>; and that no earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure can any whit asswage the paine; then in a third Place doth Hee cast about, and contend with all cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to keepe the poore Soule in a perpetuall sad slavish trembling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it may not dare to meddle with any comfort, or apply the promises; but cherishing the bruise, against the counsell of the Prophets, bleede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly still. And this Point Hee plies with more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernesse and fury, because the very next step, to wit, but even reaching out of this spirituall Gulfe and griefe for sinne, towards the mercifull hand of Christ, holden out to helpe Him up, is the next and immediate Act, by which a man is quite, and for ever puld out of His power, and put into the Paradise of grace.</p>
            <p>Or in a word, and shorter thus: Tho thou commest freshly out of an Hell of hainous sinnes; and hitherto, hast neither thought, or spoke, or done any thing but abominably: yet if now with true remorse thou groans under them all, as an heavy burden, and syncerely lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:6598:219"/>
for the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> and newnesse of life; thou art bound presently, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> as they say, immediatly after that Act, and unfained resolution of thy Soule, to take <hi>Christ</hi> Himself, and all the promises of life as thine own for ever. All delaies, demurres, exceptions, objections, pretexts, standing out, scruples, distrusts, &amp; contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary, are dishonourable to Gods mercy and free grace, disparagement to the Promises, deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Truth &amp; tender-heartednes of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; an unnecessary detainement of the Soule in terrour; and onely a gratification of that <hi>roaring Lion,</hi> whose trade is to teare soules in peeces, and torture them all Hee can. For as soone as wee are <hi>poore in spirit,</hi> we are presently <hi>blessed; Mat.</hi> 5.3. As soone as we are weary of our sins, the Hand of Christ is ready to take off the burden, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.

            <p>And now come and take abundantly mighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and invincible motives, which neither Man, nor Divell, nor natural distrust can ever, any waies possibly disable; Not to lie any longer, being in the proposed and supposed state, upon the racke of terror; but to lay hold upon the <hi>Rock of eternity.</hi> I meane, to rest and establish thy trembling heart upon the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> with everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting peace and safty; and after walke watchfully and fruitfully in the holy way, untill thine ending houre.</p>

the same Omnipotent hand? Nay, it is easier in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit (to the Divine Majesty nothing is difficult or un-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie); For those glorious shining Constellations were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated of nothing; and nothing hath no disposition to any <hi>Beeing</hi> at all, much lesse to any particular existence; But a Soule sensible and weary of it's spirituall darknesse, is in the nearest, and most immediate passive dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if I may so speake, to receive the whole <hi>Sunne of righteousnesse.</hi> Reach but out thy hand in this Case to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> offering Himselfe freely unto Thee, as a Saviour and Lord; and thou shalt presently take posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Kingdome of Grace,</hi> and undoubted Right to the everlasting Kingdome of Glory. The <hi>Prophet Amos</hi> 5.8. presseth this Argument of power for some such purpose. And it may serve excellently against all pretences and counter-pleaes for a supposed impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of being illightened, and refreshed in the depth of spirituall darkenesse and distresse. It may bee, Thou mayest say unto Mee, You advise mee indeed to seeke Gods face and favour, &amp;c. But alas! Mine is not an ordinary heart, it is so full of guilty sadnesse, and horror for sin, that I have little hope, &amp;c. Yea, but consider, He that I counsell Thee to seek, <hi>made the seven Starres and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>: and will doe fargreater wonders for thy Soule, if thou wilt <hi>believe the Prophets, that thou mayest prosper.</hi> If thou will <hi>trust in Him,</hi> He will quickly turne the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous roarings of thy conscience into <hi>perfect peace.

            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Prophet</hi> therefore, to prevent all scruples and exceptions in this kinde, calles upon them thus: <hi>Seeke him that maketh the seven Starres, and Orion, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, thou mayst well consider, that it is a farre greater worke <hi>to make Heaven and Earth</hi>; then to put spirituall life and lightsomnesse into thy truly humbled, and thirsty Soule, to which so many pretious Promises are made.

            <p n="3">3. It may bee, tho there was some probable and plausible shewes, that the Party was principally cast downe, and affected with the heavy waight of sin, and horrour of Gods wrath for it; yet the true predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant cause of His heavinesse, harts-griefe, and bitterest complaint, was some secret earthly discontentment, the restlesse biting of some worldly sting. And in such Cases, remove this, and you remove His paine; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Him about his Crosse, and you set Him where Hee was. And therefore, as in all this He continues a meere stranger in affection to the sweetnesse, amiablenesse, and excellency of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; so it is impossible, that
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:6598:231"/>
Hee should bee acquainted with any sound spirituall comfort.</p>
            <p>But I will suppose all to bee syncere, and as it should bee: Let mee advise Thee then to take notice of thine unadvisednesse.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou art, perhaps, so full of the want of feeling, such a stranger to so much expected, and desired <hi>ioy, and peace in believing</hi>; and by consequent, so drowned in the unnecessary distractions, and distempers of a sad heart, that thou utterly forgets to give thankes, and magnifie Gods singular, and incomprehensible mercy, for illightening, convincing, and terrifying thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; offering his Sonne; raising in thine heart an insati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thirst after Him; and giving Thee spirituall abilitie to rest thy weary Soule upon Him. And who knowes not, that unthankfulnesse keepes many good things from us; and is an unhappy blocke in the way, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept, and hinder the comfortable influence, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of God, favours and mercies, from being showred downe so frankly and plentifully upon His people. And Hee is more likely to bee the more provoked in this Case; because thou suffers thine heart to bee lockt up, and thy Tongue tied, by Satans cunning and cruell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, from <hi>praysing the glory of Gods free grace,</hi> for such a worke of wonder: I meane, that mighty Change of thine from nature to grace; in extolling of which, were all the hearts and tongues, of all the Men and Angels in Heaven and Earth, set on worke industriously thorow all eternitie, they would still come infinitely short, of that which is due and deserved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or it may be, when some <hi>One of a thousand,</hi> upon thy complaint, that no comfort comes, doth seriously labour to settle thine heart in peace; pressing upon Thee for that purpose, invincible and unanswer-able Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the Word of Truth; to open it wide, that over-flowing Rivers of Evangelicall joyes, which may spring to Him that is advised, and <hi>believes the Prophets,</hi>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:6598:231"/>
abundantly, even from the weakest Faith, to refresh and comfort it: Telling thee, that as thine humbled Soule, <hi>learning</hi> upon <hi>Christ,</hi> drawes much heavenly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, mortifying power, and sanctifying grace from him; so it may, and ought also to draw abundance of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lightsomnesse from that ever-springing Fountaine of life, &amp;c. Yet notwithstanding all this, thou suffers some malicious counter-blasts, and contrary suggestions of the Divell, to disperse and frustrate all these well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and glorious Messages. And therefore it is just with God, that thou fare the worse at his hands, and fall short of thine expectation; because thou gives more credit to the Father of Lyes, then the Lord of Truth. Sith thou spills all the Cordials, that are tendered unto thee in the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> by His faithfull Physicions, thou art deservedly destitute of comfort still. Many in such Cases, while Gods Messenger, who can rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare His wayes unto them, stands by, opening, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the rich treasures of Gods free mercy, in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the Gospell, and with present replies, repelling Satans cavils, are reasonably well cheared, and revived; But when Hee is gone, they very weakely, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily give way againe to that foule lying Fiend, to cast a dis-comfortable mist over the tender eye of their weake Faith, and to domineere as Hee did before.</p>
            <p>Tell mee true; If thou wert in doubt and distresse about thy temporall state, Tenure of thy Lands, sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy evidence; Wouldest thou advise with, and take counsell from a Foole, a Knaue, and an enemy; or wouldest Thou make choise of an honest, wise, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Friend? I doubt not of thine Answer: And wilt thou then so farre disparage divne truth, gratifie Hell, and hurt thine owne heart, as in that waightiest Point of thy spirituall state; to consult and resolve with the Divell, a Liar, a Murtherer, and sworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Gods glory, and thy Soules good; And neglect God Himselfe, blessed for ever, speaking unto Thee
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:6598:232"/>
out of His Word, by that Minister, which in such a Case durst not falsify, or flatter Thee for a World of gold. Shall many thousands of worldly-wise men, give credit very readily, and roundly, to <hi>Dawbers with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered morter,</hi> upon a false and rotten foundation, to the most certaine, and eternall ruine of their Soules; And shall not an humble, and upright-hearted Man, <hi>believe the Prophet</hi> upon good ground; that the bones, which the heavy burden of sinne hath broken, may reioyce? God forbid.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nay, but suppose the Party bee truly humbled, very thankefull, resolute against all sinne, labour to <hi>believe the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. And yet no comfort come? I say then, there is an other Duty expected at thy hands, right pretious and pleasing unto God: And that is <hi>waiting.</hi> By which God would,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Set yet a sharper edge and eagernesse more hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirsting, greater longing, and panting after the ravishing sweetnesse of His comfortable presence; with which melting, earnest, crying dispositions, Hee is very much delighted;</p>
            <p n="2">2. Cause us with peace and patience to submit unto, and depend upon His mercifull wisedome, in disposing and appointing times and seasons for our deliverances and refreshings. For Hee well knowes, that very Point and Period of time: first, when His mercy shall bee most magnifyed: secondly, His childrens hearts most seasonably comforted, and kindlily enlarged, to poure out themselves in praisefulnesse: thirdly, His, and our spirituall enemies most gloriously confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:</p>
            <p n="3">3. Quicken, and set on worke with extraordinary fervency, the spirit of prayer; fright us further from sinne for the time to come; fit us for a more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full improovement, of all Offers and opportunities to doe our Soules good; to make more of <hi>ioy and peace in believing,</hi> when we enioy it; And to declare to others
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:6598:232"/>
in like extremity, Gods dealing with us, for their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wee must learne then, to expect, and bee content with Gods season: And hold up our hearts in the meane time with such considerations, as these; first, we performe a very acceptable service, and a Christian Duty, right pleasing unto, and much prevailing with God, by <hi>waiting,</hi> See <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.31. and 64.4. And 49.23. <hi>Lam,</hi> 3.25. Secondly, By our patient dependance upon God in this kinde, wee may mightily encrease, and multiply our comfort, when His time is come. For He is woont to recompence abundantly, at last, His lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tarrying with excesse of ioy, and over-flowing expressions of His love. Thirdly, wee must ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; that all the while Hee exerciseth us with <hi>waiting,</hi> that season is not yet come, which in His mercifull wisedome, Hee holds the meetest to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the glory of His mercy most, and wiseliest to advance our spirituall good. Fourthly, And that which is best of all, If the true Convert, resting His weary Soule upon the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> and Promises of life, should bee taken away, before Hee attaine His desired comfort; Hee shall bee certainely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and undoubtedly crowned with everlasting bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse. For, <hi>Blessed are all they that waite for Him: Isa.</hi> 30.18. A Man is saved by Believing; and not by <hi>ioy and peace</hi> in Believing: Salvation is an inseparable companion of <hi>Faith</hi>: But <hi>ioy and peace</hi> accompany it, as a separable accident: As that which may be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from it; yea, there is cause why it should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved. The light would never bee so acceptable, were it not for that usuall entercourse of darkenesse, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Take here notice upon this occasion; That as a truly humbled Soule receiving Christ, in the sense I have said, hath <hi>power given Him</hi> thereby <hi>to become the Sonne of God</hi>; so Hee doth draw also from that glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:6598:233"/>
of Faith, so full of all amiablenesse, excellency, and sweetnesse.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes, by the mercy of God, a very sensible, stirring, and ravishing ioy, <hi>unspeakeable, and full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>: which, tho it be many times very short, yet is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterably sweet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If not so, yet an habituall calmenesse of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if I may so call it. Which, tho wee doe not marke it so much, or magnifie Gods mercy for it, as we ought; yet it makes us differ as far by a comfortable freedome from many slavish, guilty twitches, &amp; an universall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentednesse in all our courses, and Passages thorow this vale of teares, from the worlds dearest Minion, and most admired Favourite, as <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>These, and the like Conclusions, are in themselves as full of sound joy, and true comfort; as the Sunne of light or Sea of waters. Open but the eye of thine humbled soule, and thou maist see many glorious things in them. Crush them but a little with the hand of Faith, and much delicious sweetnesse of spirituall peace may distill upon thy Soule.</p>
            <p>Lastly, such considerations as these, may contribute some matter of comfort, and support, to Him of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest apprehension, in this Case:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Hee consult with His owne Conscience, Hee shall happily finde in His present syncere resolution, an impossibility to turne backe againe to His former sinnefull life, pleasures, goodfellow-ship, sensuall cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, company: Hee sayes, and thinkes it, that Hee will rather die, then lie, sweare, prophane the Sabbaths; put to usury, doe wrong, keepe any ill-gotten goods in his hands, Haunt Ale-houses, Play-houses, Gaming-houses; or willingly put His heart, or hand to any kind of iniquity, as Hee was formerly wont. <hi>And doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thinke you keepe Him backe; or grace, and Gods Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If Hee should now heare, and have his eares fill'd with oathes, blasphemies, ribald talke, rotten spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, filthy songs, railing at Gods people, scoffing at reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, jesting out of Scriptures, &amp;c. His heart would rise;
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:6598:235"/>
Hee would either reproove them, or bee rid of them, as soone as Hee could; whereas heretofore, Hee hath been, perhaps, a delightfull Hearer of them, if not a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Actour Himselfe. <hi>And whence doe you thinke doth this arise, but from the seede of God remaining in Him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, If when you heare Him complaine; That howsoever Hee hath cast Himselfe upon <hi>Christ,</hi> as the <hi>Prophets</hi> have counselled Him; yet sith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Hee feeles no such comfort, and <hi>peace in Believing</hi> as other Christians doe; Hee begins to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hee hath done well, or no: and to conceive, that Hee hath layd hold upon the Promises too soone: Nay, and it may bee upon this discontent, doth thus further enlarge His complaint: Alas! my sinnes have formerly been so great, my heart is at this present so hard, my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row so scant, my failings so many, &amp;c. that I know not what to say to my Selfe. Mee thinkes, I can neither pray, conferre, love the Brethren, sanctifie the Sabbath, rejoyce in the Lord, &amp;c. as I see other of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doe. And therefore, I am affraid, all is naught: What heart can I have to hold on? I say, if to such a speech, thou shouldest for triall give this reply: Well then, if it bee so; even give over all, strive no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the streame; trouble thy selfe no longer with reading, prayer, following sermons, forbearing good fellowship, and thine old companions. And sith no comfort comes by casting thy selfe upon Christ, cast thy selfe againe into the current of the times, course of the world, and merry company; For there yet, is there some little poore pleasure to bee had, at least: Oh! No, No, No, would Hee say; That will I never doe, whatsoever comes of mee: I will trust in my Christ, tho Hee should kill mee; for all these discouragements, I will by no meanes, cast away my confidence. I have been so freshly stung with their guilt, that I will rather be pull'd in peeces with wild horses, then plunge againe
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:6598:235"/>
into carnall pleasures; I will put my hand to all holy duties in obedience to God, tho I performe them never so weakely; I will, by the mercy of God, keepe my face towards Heaven, and backe to <hi>Sodome,</hi> so long as I breath; come what come will, &amp;c. <hi>And whence, doe you thinke, springs this resolution; but from a secret sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power, supporting Him in the most desperate temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and assaults of distrust?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this first, <hi>secret saving power,</hi> by which an humble Soule leaning upon <hi>Christ</hi> is supported, when it is at the lowest; secondly, The <hi>seed of God,</hi> and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>presence of grace</hi>; doe every one of them argue a blessed state, in which thou shalt bee certainely saved; and therefore thou mayst lift up thine heart and head, with comfort unspeakeable and glorious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Many there are, who much complaine of the great disproportion betweene the notorious wickednesse of their former life, and their lamentable weakenesse of an answerable be wailing it: Betweene the number of their sinnes, and fewnesse of their teares; the hainousnesse of their rebellions, and little measure of their humiliation. And thereupon, because they did not finde, and feele those terrours, and extraordinary troubles of mind in their turning unto God; those vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent passions, and pangs in their New-birth, which they have seene, heard, or read of, or knowne in others, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, farre lesse sinners then themselves; they are much troubled with distractions and doubts about the truth, and soundnesse of their conversion. <note n="d" place="margin">Many are still que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings; and though they came to Faith and comfort by these steps, yet are still fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that they have not begun in truth, or that they are not in the right way, or took comfort, ere it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto them. And this, because their corruptions bee so strong, and that they cannot doe as they would. But corruptions felt, hated, and striven against, are no Markes that wee are not the Lords; but the contrary. It is the subtilty of Satan, to keepe them ever at the beginning, that they may never get forward. True, it is good to bee very carefull in laying the foundation of our house; But if we be ever pulling up, after it is laide, wee shall never finish the Building. <hi>Moster Rogers of Dedham, Doctr. of Faith, cap.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 177. For a true Christian to denie the work of Gods grace in Himselfe—doth no good to Him; But interrupts His prayers, hinders his humi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liation, estrangeth Him from God, and turneth godly sorrow for His sinne, into desperate: sorrow for the punishment of sinne. <hi>Master Whately. Gods Husbandry, cap.</hi> 12.</note> Whereby they
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:6598:236"/>
receive a great deale of hurt and hindrance in their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall state. For Satan gaines very much by such a suggestion, and grounds many times a manifold mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe upon it. For by keeping this temptation on foot; these doubts and troubles in their mindes, whether they bee truly converted or no; Hee labours, and too often prevailes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To hinder the Christian in His spirituall Building. With what heart can Hee hold on, who doubts of the soundnesse, and sure-laying of the foundation? What progresse is Hee like to make in Christianity, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually terrifies Himselfe with fearefull exceptions and oppositions, about the truth of His conversion? A man in a long journey, would jogge on but very heavily, if Hee doubted whether Hee were in the right way, or no.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To abate, lessen, and abridge His courage in stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Gods side, patience under the Crosse, spirituall mirth in good company: To keepe Him in dulnesse of heart, deadnesse of affections, distractions at holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, and under the raigne of almost, a continuall sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and uncomfortable walking: To make Him quite neglect, and never looke towards those sweete commands of the blessed Spirit: <hi>Reioyce evermore. Reioyce, and I say againe, Reioyce. Bee glad in the Lord, reioyce, and shout for ioy all yee, that are upright in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To fasten a great deale of <note n="e" place="margin">Take heed of false reasoning; As because our fire doth not blaze out, as others, therefore we have no fire at all; and by false Conclusions to sinne against the Commandement, in <hi>bearing false witnesse</hi> against our selves.

                  </gap>uld cherish our love to <hi>Christ,</hi> and arme us against Satans discouragements. Some are so faulty this way, as if they had been hired by Satan, <hi>the Accuser of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> to pleade for Him, in accusing themselves. <hi>Doctor Sibbes, Bruised Reed, pag.</hi> 94.</note> dishonour upon God; when He can make the Christian dis-avow, as it were, and nullifie in conceit, so great a worke of mercy and grace, stampt upon His Soule by an Almighty hand:
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:6598:236"/>
A worke for wonder and power answerable, if not transcendent, to the Creation of the World. To the production whereof, the infinite mercies of the Father of all mercy; the warmest hearts-blood of His onely Sonne; the mightiest <hi>Moouing</hi> of the blessed Spirit were required. Now what an indignity, and disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is offered unto so glorious a Workeman, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a worke, to assent and subscribe unto the Divell, a knowne Liar, that there is no such Thing?</p>
            <p n="4">4. To double, and aggravate upon the Christian, the grievous sinne of unbeliefe: Not to believe the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as they lie in His Booke, is an unworthy, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wrong unto the Truth of God: But for a Man to draw backe, and deny, when they are all made good upon His Soule, makes Him worse then <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle: For when He had <hi>thrust His hand into Christs side,</hi> Hee believed. But in the present Case, a Man is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to renounce, and disclaime; Tho Hee have already graspt in the armes of His Faith, the crucified bleeding Body of His blessed Redeemer. The sacred and saving vertue whereof, hath inspired into the whole Man a new, spirituall, sanctifying life, and a sensible, un-denia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change from what it was:</p>
            <p n="5">5. To discontinue, or detaine the heart lock't up, as it were, in a perpetuall barrennes, from giving of thanks; which is one of the noblest, and most acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and service, that is offered unto God. Now what a mischiefe is this; that an upright heart should bee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced up, and His Tong tied by the Divels temptation, from magnifying heartily the glory of <hi>Gods free grace,</hi> for such a worke? I meane, the New-Creation; at which Heaven and Earth, Angels and Men, and all Creatures may stand everlastingly amazed. So sweet it is and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and makes an immortall Soule for ever.</p>
            <p>But to keepe my selfe to the Point. Those who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, as I have said: That because the pangs of their New-birth were not in that proportion they desire, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:6598:237"/>
to the hainousnesse of their former pestilent courses, and abominablenesse of their beastly life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, many times suspect themselves, and are much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about the truth of their conversion; may have their doubts, and scruples encreased, by taking notice of such propositions as these, which Divines both ancient and moderne, let fall sometimes in their Penitentiall Discourses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordinarily men are wounded in their Consciences at their conversion, answerably to the wickednesse of their former conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>And there is good reason for it. For ordinarily the newly-illightened eye of a fresh-bleeding Conscience, is very sharpe, and cleare; piercing and sightfull; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to discover every staine, and spot of the Soule; To dive even to the heart-roote, to the blackest bottome and ougliest nooke of a Mans former Hellish courses; to looke backe, with a curious survay, thorow the pure Perspective of Gods righteous Law, over his whole life to His very Birth-sinne, and <hi>Adams</hi> rebellion. And in this sad, and heavy search, it is very inquisitive after, and apprehensive of all circumstances, which may adde to the hainousnesse of sin, and horrour to his heart. It is quick-sighted into all aggravating considerations; and quickly learnes, and lookes upon all those wayes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and circumstances, by which sins are made more
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:6598:238"/>
notorious and hatefull. And what the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, in a fearefull heart, may inferre hereupon, you may easily iudge.</p>
            <p>Now to the Case proposed; I say, first;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That betweene sinne and sorrow, wee cannot expect a precise adequation; not an Arithmeticall, but a Geometricall proportion: Great sinnes should bee greatly lamented; yet no sinne can bee sufficiently sorrowed for; Tho it may bee savingly. When wee say, the pangs of the New-birth must bee answerable to our former sinnefull provocations; wee meane not, that wee can mourne for sinne according to it's merit; that is impossible: But great sinnes require a great deale of sorrow. Wee must not thinke, that wee have sorrowed enough for any sinne, tho wee can never sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row sufficiently.</p>
            <p>Before I proceede to a further, and fuller satisfaction in the Point, let mee tell you by the way, how discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and doubtfull, the Popish doctrine is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; that the truth of our <hi>Tenet</hi> may appeare the more pretious, and taste more sweet.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Attrition</hi> and <hi>Contrition,</hi> as I take it, differ, as our Legall and Evangelicall repentance; 1. In respect of the object. <hi>Contrition,</hi> as they say, is sorrow for sinne, as an offence to God: <hi>Attrition</hi> is a griefe for sinne, as liable to punishment. 2. In respect of the cause. <hi>Contrition</hi> ariseth from sonne-like, <hi>Attrition</hi> from servile feare. [See <hi>Valent. Disp.</hi> 7. <hi>Q.</hi> 8. <hi>De contrit. punct.</hi> 2.]</p>

set, and the same formes, measures, times, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his waies, and workings upon his Children. For Hee is wise without limit, and above measure; and therfore hath many secret and glorious ends, and aimes, which, according to His good pleasure, much diversifie the meanes serviceable and subordinate thereunto. From whence may spring these three Conclusions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee may, for the most part, create in the heart of the true Convert, terrours and troubles of Conscience; amazements and mourning, answerable, in some good measure, to the varietie, vanity, and villany of His former wicked waies, and lewd life.</hi> As appeares before in <hi>Manasses,</hi> the <hi>sinnefull Woman, Idolatrous Israelites,</hi> Hearers of <hi>Peter,</hi> and many in these dayes, if it were convenient to name them. <hi>For the most part,</hi> saith a great Divine, <hi>the violence of humiliation in the Calling of a sinner, is according to the continuance and greatnesse of His actuall transgressions: According to the same, is the rent in the conscience and Soule. Therefore, if there bee any, who hath been a great and grievous sinner; and hath not with violence been pulled from his sinne, Hee may doe well to suspect, and search Himselfe soundly.</hi>

Every hearty, and sensible complaint, that the Pangs of the New-birth were not more painefull, and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the pollutions of His youth, is, as it were, and in the sense I have said, a Pang of the New-birth. Or else

upon some occasion afterward in His Christian course, Hee may bee revisited, and vexed afresh, with more terrour and trouble of conscience, then in His first change; As in such Cases as these: first, If Hee should, which God forbid, by some volent enticement, and snaring opportunity, bee entangled againe, and re-infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with any former sensuall pleasure of His unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate time; or by neglect of His care, and watchfulnesse over His waies, bee suddenly surprised with some new scandalous sin.

Thirdly, when some heavy <note n="r" place="margin">

There is a kinde of naturall power, besides Gods speciall hand, in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sorrow, darknesse, melancholy, the night, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary crosses, the Bed of death, to represent the true number, and hainousnesse of sinnes with greater horror, and more unto the life: Whereas prosperity, health, and daies of peace, doe rather delude the eyes of the conscience; and like false and flattering glasses, make those foule Fiends seeme fairer then they are indeede.

Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That tasting againe sometimes the bitternesse of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath for sinne, they may bee the more frighted, and flee further from it. Eighthly, That thereby the incomprehensible love of Christ toward them, may sinke deeplier into their hearts; who for their sakes, and salvation, drunke deepe and large; and the very dregs of that Cup; the least drop whereof, is to them so bitter and intolerable. Ninthly, That by sometimes, sense of the contrary, their joy in the favour and light of Gods countenance may bee more joyful; Their spirituall peace more pleasant, the pleasure of grace more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the comforts of godlinesse more comfortable, &amp;c. Tenthly, For admonition to others: To draw duller and drouzy Christians to more strictnesse, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Zeale; by observing the spirituall troubles and terrours of those, who are far more holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous then themselves. To intimate unto Formall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours, that all is certainely naught with them, who ordinarily are meere strangers to all afflictions of Soule, and sorrow for sinne. Eleventhly, For terrour to many, who going on securely in their sensuall courses, are woont to cry downe all they can, the power of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, by crying to their companions thus, or in the like manner: <hi>Well for all this, wee hope, Hell is not so hot, nor sinne so heavy, nor the Divell so blacke, nor God so unmercifull, as these precise Preachers would make them, &amp;c.</hi> How may such as these bee affrighted, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon this occasion, with pondering upon that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Place, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.18. <hi>If iudgement begin at the house of God, what shall the end bee of them, that obey not the Gospell of God?

               </hi>; If Gods Children have their consciences scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it were, with the flames of Hell; <hi>where shall the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:6598:243"/>
and the sinner appeare</hi>? But even in the bottome of that fiery Lake, and amidst the unquenchable rage of those endlesse flames. Twelfthly, For the just harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of such as hate to bee reformed, and are desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolved against the saving precisenesse of the Saints. It may bee in this manner: A godly Man hath lived long, amongst <hi>Rebels, thornes and Scorpions,</hi> scorners, railers, Persecutours; who, altho Hee hath shined all the while <hi>as a Light, in the midst of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse generation</hi>; yet they were ever so farre, from bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heated with love of heavenly things, by His holy life; or wonne unto good by His gracious example: that like so many <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Owles,</hi> impatient of all spirituall light, they did either flie from it, as farre as they could in affection, practise, if not in Habitation; Or fell upon it fiercely with their envenomed Clawes of spite and cruelty, to extingvish quite, if it were possible, such bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed beames of saving Light; and to darken with Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish mists of ignorance, and ill life, the Place where they live. They wilfully blinded themselves with a pestilent conceit; That His sincerity was nothing but Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; His holinesse, onely humour; His forwardnesse Phantasticallnesse; His sanctification, singularity. And thereupon resolved, and boisterously combind against Him, with all their policy, purses, and possibilities; like those ungodly Ones, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 2. <hi>Let us lie in waite for the righteous: because Hee is not for our turne, and Hee is cleane contrary to our doings; He upbraideth us with our offending the Law, and obiecteth to our infamy, the transgressings of our education, &amp;c.</hi> I say, now God may suffer such a Man upon His Deaths-bed, to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some more extraordinary, and markable discomfort, and distresse of Conscience: Of which those gracelesse wretches taking greedy notice, may thereby bee desperately obstinated, and hardned in their lewd and carnall courses. For seeing Gods hand upon Him in that fearefull manner, and wanting the spirit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:6598:243"/>
they doe conclude most peremptorily, that for all His great shewes, Hee was most certainely but a Counterfeite. And so themselves become, upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, many times more, most implacable enemies to grace, and all good men; They are stronglier lockt up in the armes of the Divell, faster nailed to formality, or good-fellowship; and which is the perfection of their madnesse and misery, <hi>blesse themselves in their hearts,</hi> saying merrily to their Brethren in iniquity: <hi>You see now what these men are, which make themselves so holy, and are so hot in religion: These are the Fellowes, which pretend to bee so scrupulous and precise: and of that singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar streine of sanctity, that they thinke none shall be saved but themselves, &amp;c. You see in this Man the desperate ends of such hypocriticall Puritans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the glory of Gods justice is justly magnified, by letting them grow starke blind, who wilfully shut their eyes against the Light of grace; by giving them over to a reprobate minde, who so maliciously hated to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; And so too often, they walke on for ever after, with confidence, and <hi>hardnesse of heart, which cannot repent,</hi> in a perpetuall prejudice against purity, and the power of godlinesse; unto the Pit of Hell. Whereas by the mercy of God, and inviolable constancy of His Covenant, that blessed Man, by these terrours, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Conscience, besides glorifying God in harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others, is, as it were, the more thorowly fitted and refined, for that glory, which is presently to bee revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

Gods heavy hand was sometimes upon <hi>David,</hi> specially, for the manifestation of His innocency: See <hi>Psal.</hi> 17.3. Nay our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, infinitely free from sinne, was notwithstanding tempted and tried by Satan and the world; that His heavenly vertues, &amp; divine excellencies might appeare, and bee made more illustrious.

               <note place="margin">2. Chron. 33.11.</note> Gods extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary angry visitations, make men many times cry with troubled, and grieved hearts; <hi>Come, Let us turne unto the Lord; Hee hath wounded us. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>a. Strange terrours sometimes arising from exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Accidents; yea, hidden naturall causes; uncouth visions, and apparitions, full of amazement and feare; Bodily distempers; horrible injections, hideous thoughts, &amp;c. Whereby they are mightily affrighted before hand, and prepared to passe thorow the Pangs of the New-birth more terribly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some hainous and crying sinne, which He suffers some to fall into, and immediately upon it awakes the Conscience. That Almighty Physition, who is able to bring health out of poison; death out of life; Light out of darkenesse; Heaven out of Hell; may by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as they say, prepare One to conversion, by giving Him over to the height of some One, or moe abhorred abominations, and crimson sinnes: As wee may see in <hi>Peters Hearers, Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Paul, Manasses,</hi> the <hi>sinnefull Woman, Publicans and Harlots</hi>; left to the killing of Christ, spilling the blood of the Saints, those hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible out-rages, extreme filth, extorsions, pollutions. Physitions, by ripening diseases, make way to heale them; For sicke matter is never more easily remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then when it exceedeth in ripenesse, and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Lying long in ignorance, sensuality, &amp; dissolute life; without profitable, and powerfull meanes. In this Case upon the first awaking, and affrighting the Conscience
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:6598:246"/>
for sinne, it may bee exposed to many terrible perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and longer continued terrours. For the light of Naturall Conscience, bred with them in their owne bosomes, may in the meane time serve to enrage, and torture; as wee see in many guilty <hi>Heathens:</hi> but there is no naturall light, to leade us to Christ, and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call comforts. The commandements have ground in nature; but the mysterie of the Gospell is wholly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall. Wee finde it by manifold experience, what an hard, and heavy Taske it is, to undertake a poore ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Soule, troubled in minde. The Cure is many times very difficult, dangerous, and long. The darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their ignorance, beeing now distressed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, is very fit, and fearefull matter, for Satan to worke in hideously; and to play his pestilent prankes of most grosse impostures, and much Hellish cruelty. His malicious maine Plot against such, ordinarily is, and His utmost endeavour; to drive them to Selfe-destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if it bee possible, before they get understanding in the waies of God; of wee can get any competent light, and comfort into their consciences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some concurrent circumstances: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The melancholike, and sad constitution of the Party. That humour doth naturally give extraordinary entertainement, and edge to terrours and sorrowes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The crabbednesse, and crookednesse of His natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall disposition, which must be tamed, and taken downe with more adoe; with much violence, and renting. An hard and knotty Block, must have an hard wedge. An angry word, or frowne, will worke more with some dispositions; then many sore blowes upon a crosse, and sturdy spirit. God is here woont sweetly, and wisely to apply Himself to the severall natures, conditions, and dispositions of His Children.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Height of Place, and Happinesse to have for this life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat heart can wish. Whereby it comes to passe, that men are so deepely drowned in sensuality Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:6598:246"/>
and earthly mindednesse; that for a thorow Change, they have need many times to be taken down thorowly with a deepe sense of legall terrours.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Excellency of naturall, or acquired Parts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; as wit, learning, courage, wisedome, &amp;c. wretchedly abused, and long mis-imploied, upon wrong and wicked Objects. Much adoe, many times, and a great measure of humiliation, will hardly fright such vaine over-valewers of themselves, and Idolizers of their owne sufficiencies, from their admired follies. And here also Satan interposeth most furiously, and hinders this happy worke all Hee can possibly. For Hee well knowes, That, if such noble, and worthy Parts should bee sanctified to the Owners, and turned the right way; His Kingdome would fare the worse, and Hee should bee a great looser. <hi>Suppose, a Christian Prince should with his Army breake into the Turkes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: Would not the Turkes fortifie those Castles best, out of which beeing wonne, the enemy might doe Him most harme? So whom the Divell seeth to bee the likeliest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for the overthrow of his kingdom, if once they become Temples of the Holy Ghost; those Hee is lothest to loose, and labours mightily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o keepe in His slavery still.</hi> And therefore He opposes with all His power, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; raysing as many tempests of terrour, as Hee is able; that Hee might either drive them backe in their Passage to the <hi>holy Path,</hi> or swallow them up into the abhorred gulphe of despaire, by the way.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A more searching, and piercing Ministry; which is ordinarily woont to awake the conscience with more terrour; to irradiate, and fill it with more universall, and clearer light, to quicken it with more apprehension; and so proportionably, to affect and afflict it with a more feeling, and fearefull sense of Gods most just, and holy wrath against sinne. Whereupon they become excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and everlasting Christians.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Byting it in, as they say, and not opening the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:6598:247"/>
wound of Conscience betime to some skillfull Soule-Physition, may bee an unhappy meanes, much to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large, both the continuance, and extremity of a Mans spirituall trouble. Shame, bashfulnesse, pretence of want of opportunity, hope to get thorow by Himselfe, &amp;c. are ordinary keies to lock up his tongue at such a time. But sure I am, Satan hath a chiefe stroke, and principall part to perswade concealement. For alas! Hee winnes by it wofully: All the while Hee plies with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and much subtilty, his hideous temptations to Selfe-killing; despaire of mercy, returning againe to folly, &amp;c. And it is to bee feared, which is a most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous thing; that sometimes, by this cruell silence, Hee conquers, &amp; casts some poore soules, upon the bloody, and most abhorred villany of Selfe-perishing. Let such an One then be ever sure most resolutely, to break thorow the Divels accursed snare in this kinde; and to powre out His Soule-secrets betime, into some faith full holy bosome. I have heard many, after they have escaped tell what strange tricks, and variety of devises Hee practised, to discourage, divert, and dis-able them to discover their mindes, as they purposed; even when they were come, with much adoe, into the presence of the spirituall Physition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ends to which God prepares, and fits some by their sore travaile, in the New-birth, and longer lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gvishing under His visiting hand in this kinde. God may purpose sometimes in such cases:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <note n="g" place="margin">Gods Children are bruised Reeds bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging whereof, remembrance of their having beene once, as it were, in the mouth of Hell, and scorched
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:6598:247"/>
with flames of terrour, serves as a continuall spurre, and incentive unto them, to doe nobly, and to supply them, from time to time, with mightinesse of courage, height of resolution, and eminency of Zeale, in those glorious waies. As wee may see in those renowned pillars of the Church, <hi>Austin, Luther, &amp;c. The higher and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the building is, the deeper must the foundation be laid in the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To make them afterwards of excellent use, and speciall dexterity, out of their former experience, to speake unto the hearts of their Brethren, ready to sinke into the same gulphe of horrour, and danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire; out of which, the good hand of Gods gracious providence, hath by such, and such meanes, so merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ly pulled, and preserved them. The same keyes, which dip open the locks, and loose the fetters, which Satan hung upon their heavy hearts; may happily undoe those also, which Hee hath fastned upon the Soules of others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To render them to the Church, as remarkeable Precedents, and Mirrours of mortification, Selfe-denial, heavenly mindednesse, and holy walking with God; for others to looke upon, and imitate. Mindfulnesse of their former wrastling with the wrath of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, and the horrours of Hell; makes them for ever after, more mindlesse of earthly things, weaned from the world, startling at every appearance of evill, greedy of godlinesse, conversing in Heaven, excellent Christians indeede. Master <hi>Iohn Glover,</hi> after five yeeres horrible afflictions of Soule, was framed thereby, saith Master <hi>Foxe,</hi> to such mortification of life, as the like lightly hath not been seene; in such sort, as Hee beeing like one placed in Heaven already, and dead in this World, led a life altogether celestiall, &amp;c. <hi>See Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. pag.</hi> 1885.</p>

Secondly, To much deadnesse of affection and listles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; many dampes and distempers in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of holy duties, use of the Ordinances, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exercises. Thirdly, To greater variety of Crosses, and a heavier hand upon their outward states; purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring the eye of their Conscience to looke backe more heavily, and with heartier remorse upon the loathsomnesse and filth of their youthfull folly. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To more easinesse of re-entry and surprise, by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, and insinuation of old sinnes in their un-regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate time, especially that of the bosome; which is an horrible Thing. For the lesse sinnes are sorrowed for, the sooner doe they re-insnare us with their sensuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and re-pollute with renewed Acts.

And no doubt, a farre nearer embracement, and dearer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of Him, upon His returne; and enjoyment of a
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:6598:259"/>
more full, blessed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with Him, againe. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.3.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, The graces of salvation, are the most pretious, and worthfull things, that ever issued out of the hands of God by creation. The dearest of His infinite mercies, the hearts-blood of His Sonne, the noblest worke of His blessed Spirit, doe all sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concurre moovingly, meritoriously, efficiently to the production of them. No mervaile then, tho it bee right pleasing unto God, that such rare, and inestimable Iewels, should bee rightly prized, and holden in highest esteeme, by those that have them: That they should still appeare, and present themselves to those Soules, wherein they shine, in their true excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, orient fairenesse, and native beauty. Now pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of excellent things hath speciall power to raise our imaginations, to an higher streine of estimation of them; and to cause us, at their returne, to entertaine them, with much more longing, farre dearer apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and embracement. Absence, and intermission of the most desirable comforts, adde a great deale of life to the love of them, and waight of pretiousnesse to their valewation. The goodnesse of whatsoever we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, is better perceived by vicissitude of want, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall fruition. Sleepe is more sweet, after the tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of some wakefull, and wearysome nights: Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and enjoyment of the free aire, and faces of men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter restraint and imprisonment: The glory and faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Sunne, after a blacke day, or boisterous storme, &amp;c. So Gods favourable aspect is much more acceptable after an angry tempest, and <hi>hiding his face</hi> for a season: And the graces of salvation farre more amiable, and admirable to the eie of His humbled Childe, after the darkenesse of a spirituall desertion. Wherefore our gracious God doth many times, in great mercy and wisedome, deprive His dearest servants, for a time of the presence of their Spouse, the assurance of His love, and sense of those graces; that the absence
<pb facs="tcp:6598:259"/>
thereof, may represent the glory of such an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble happinesse, and those heavenly Pearles, more to the life; and discontinuance of their enjoyment, may inflame, and affect their hearts with more holy gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, and eager pursuite after them; and stirre up in them that height of esteeme, and heate of love, which may in some good measure, bee answerable to their unvalewable excellency and sweetnesse. Such dulnesse of heart, deadnesse of affections, and declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the World, may grow sometimes upon a good man; that Hee may finde little more contentment in communion with <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> then in the prosperity of His outward affaires; which is infinitely unworthy an Heire of Heaven. But now in such a Case, Let God make Him but to repossesse <hi>the iniquities of His Youth,</hi> and fight against Him with His ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours for a while; and the same Man with all His heart, will preferre the reconciled face of God and peace of conscience, before the Soveraignty, and sole command of all the Kingdomes upon Earth. While wee have a free, and un-interrupted recourse unto the Throne of Grace, wee are apt to under-valew, and to conceive of that mighty grace of prayer, but as of an ordinary gift: But if once the Lord please, to leave us to that confusion, and astonishment of Spirit, that our ejaculations doe sadly rebound upon our heavy, and un-heated hearts, without answer, or encouragement from Heaven; wee shall easily then acknowledge the Spirit, and power of praier, to bee one of the fairest flowers in the Garland of all our graces; the very arme of God to doe Miracles for us many times, and ever to settle our troubled Soules in sweetest peace and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, amidst the greatest pressures and persecutions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Hellish, or earthly enemies.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seventhly, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> Himselfe, blessed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, drunke full deepe of the extremity and variety of sorest sufferings, in many kinds; not only to deliver
<pb facs="tcp:6598:260"/>
His, from the <hi>vengeance of eternall fire</hi>; but also loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to learne out of the sense of that sympathy, and self-feeling, to shew Himselfe tender hearted, kind, and compassionate unto them in all their extremities; and never to suffer them to sinke in any trouble or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; though never so full of desperate representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or apprehensions of impossibility to escape; or to bee tempted at any time above their power and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. And many are the meanes, and Methods, by which, Hee is woont to ease, and mitigate their many painefull miseries; especially, that extremest of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome. First, Somtimes He rescues them by His own mighty, and immediate arme, out the mouth of Lyons; and pulls them, by strong hand, from between the teeth of bloody persecuting Wolues, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. Secondly, <note n="*" place="margin">Let no Christian then afflict his Soule with any catking, or vexing fore-thought of fiery times. Assure thy selfe, if God call thee to suffer in that kinde; Hee will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously give unto Thee a Martyrs Faith, a Martyrs pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a Crowne of Martyrdome.</note> Sometimes Hee takes away, or lessens the sting, and fury of the torment and torturers. The fire had no force at all over the bodies of those blessed men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.27. And no doubt in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, of most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred memory, Hee many times mollified, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the rage, and bitternesse of those mercilesse flames, for our Martyrs sakes. Thirdly, Sometimes he supports, and supplies them with supernaturall vigour, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary courage over the smart, and rigour of the most terrible, and intolerable tortures. The heart of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proto-Martyr, <hi>Steven,</hi> was furnished, and filled with those heavenly infusions of spirituall strength and ioy; when <hi>the Heavens opening,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 7 55.56.</note> 
               <hi>He saw the glory of God, and Iesus standing on His right hand</hi>; which were gloriously transcending, and triumphant over the utmost of all corporall paine, and <hi>Iewish</hi> cruelty. And so graciously dealt He with many other Martyrs in succeeding ages, as we may reade in Ecclesiasticall Stories. Fourthly, Hee may sometimes also, out of His mercifull wisdome, put into their hearts such a deale of Heaven before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and ravishing comforts of the World to come; that the excesse thereof doth swallow up, and devoure,
<pb facs="tcp:6598:260"/>
as it were, the bitternesse of all bodily inflictions, and sufferings of sense. Thus mercifully dealt Hee with that worthy Martyr, Master <hi>Robert Glover,</hi> even when He was going towards the Stake. He poured into His Soule upon the sudden, such over-flowing Rivers of spirituall joyes; that, no doubt, they mightily abated, and quencht the ragefull fury of those Popish flames; wherein Hee was sacrificed for the Profession of the Gospell of <hi>Christ,</hi> and Gods everlasting truth. And as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly, that comfortable Sun-shine of unexpresse-able joy, which, by the good hand of God, was shed into Master <hi>Peacocks</hi> sorrowfull heart, in the depth of His darkenesse and desertion, a little before the resignation of His happy Soule into the hands of God; did make the pangs of death, and that dreadfull Passage, a great deale lesse painefull, and sensible; if not very lightsome and pleasant. Now in both these men of God, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spirituall dereliction, was a fit introduction, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preparative, to the effusion of such a sudden torrent of strange exultations, and ravishments of spirit, upon their sad and heavy hearts. Conceive the Point then thus: The Lord sometimes even in tendernesse, and love to His owne deare Children, whom Hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes for extraordinary sufferings, may purposely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse them with such a Paradise of divine pleasures, as a counter-comfort to the extremity of their paines; that, besides their owne private refreshing, and support, their couragious insensibility, and victorious patience thereupon, may bring a great deale of terrour to their tormentors, glory to their Mercifull Maister, credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cause, and confusion to the enemies of grace. And that there may be an addition of more heart, and life to such joyfull elevations of spirit; and, that He may make the excellency of that spirituall joy, proportionable to the exquisitnes of their tortures and trouble, He may in His unsearchable wisedome make way thereunto by a spirituall desertion. As Hee did in the fore-named glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb facs="tcp:6598:261"/>
Martyr, Master <hi>Glover.</hi> For want of the sense of the comforts of godlinesse for a season, doth make our Soules a thousand times more sensible of their sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, upon their re-infusion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Eighthly, Thus may the Lord sometimes deale with His best, and dearest Children; even, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the light of His countenance, leave them for a while to these inward conflicts, and confusions of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that thereby they may bee fitted, and informed with an holy experimentall skill, to speake feelingly, and fully to the hearts of their Christian Brethren, which may afterward bee tempted, and troubled, as they have been. For God is woont at all times in His Church, so gracious is Hee, purposely to raise up, and single out some speciall men; whom Hee instructs, and enables in the Schoole of spirituall experiments, and afflictions of Soule, with extraordinary dexterity, and Arte, to comfort and recover other <hi>Mourners in Zion,</hi> in their distresses of consciences, stronger temptations, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall desertions, decaies of grace, relapses, Eclipses of Gods face and favour, wants of former comfortable feelings; in case of horrible thoughts, and hideous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, darkenesse of their owne spirits, and such other Soule-vexations. And such a blessed Physition, which is able to speake experimentally to a dejected sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, out of practise and sense in His owne Soule, is farre more worth, both for a true search and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and sound recovery and cure of a wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, then an hundred meere speculative Divines. Such an One, is that One of a thousand, spoken of by <hi>Iob,</hi> which can wisely, and seasonably declare unto His Soule-sicke Patient, the secret Tracks, &amp; hidden Depths of Gods dealings with afflicted spirits. Let us take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in those experimentall abilities, which <hi>David</hi> gained for such a purpose, by His passing thorow that most grievous spirituall desertion: <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.

               </gap> Zealous professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Truth, walking with God, and secret communion with <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> should come to that passe, and fall into those wofull straights of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall trouble: First, That Hee should feare, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extraordinary horrour, lest the mercies of God were departed from Him for ever; and that the Lord would never more bee intreated, or ever shine againe with his favourable countenance upon His confounded Soule. Secondly, that the very remembrance of God, which was woont to crowne his heart with a conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all desire-able contentments, should even rent it asunder, and make it fall to pieces in His bosome, like drops of water. Thirdly, That the pouring out of His Soule with pittifull groanes, and complaints in secret unto His God, which heretofore did set wide open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, heavenly flood-gates of gracious refreshing, should now quite overwhelme His spirit, with much distracted amazement and feare. Fourthly, That, that heart of His, which had formerly full sweetly tasted those holy pleasures, which farre passe the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any carnall conceit, should now be so brim-full, and damm'd up with excesse of griefe; that no vent, or passage should bee left unto His speech. Fifthly, And which, Mee thinkes, is the perfection of His misery in this kinde, that amidst all these heavy discomforts, His Soule should refuse to bee comforted. That tho the Ministers, and Men of God stand round about Him, bring into His minde, and presse upon Him the preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant evidences, and testimonies of His owne godly life; the unchangeablenesse of Gods never-failing mercies to His; the sweetnesse of His glorious Name; the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power, and mighty price of His Sonnes blood; the infallible, and inviolable pretiousnesse, and truth of the promises of life, &amp;c. Yet in the agony, and angvish of His grieved spirit, Hee puts them all away from

Tho they assure Him in the Word of life and truth, having had (for that I suppose) true and sound experience of His conversion, and former sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied courses, from <hi>Isai.</hi> 44.22. That as the heate, and strength of the Summers Sunne, doth disperse and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to nothing, a thicke Mist, or foggy Cloud: so the inflamed zeale of Gods tender love, thorow the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of His owne onely deare Sonne, hath done away all his offences; <hi>His iniquity, transgression, and sinne,</hi> as tho they had never been. And <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.19. That, that God, which delighteth in mercy, Vers. 18. hath cast all his sinnes into the bottome of the Sea; never to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, either in this World, or in the World to come. The Prophet alludes to the drowning of the Egyptians in the Red Sea. And therefore they assure Him, that as that mighty Host sunke downe into the bottome, like <hi>a stone, Exod.</hi> 15.5. Or <hi>as Lead,</hi> Vers. 10. So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sunne of Heaven, nor Sonne of Man ever saw their faces any more: So certainely, all his sinnes are so swallowed up for ever, in the Soule-saving Sea of His Saviours blood, that they shall never more appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of God or Angell, Man or Divell, to His damnation or shame. Yet for all this, lying in a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Swoune, Hee findes His heart even key-cold, and as it were, starke dead, in respect of relishing, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all, or any of these incomparable comforts. The Case thus proposed, may seeme very deplorable, and desperate: yet consider, what good <hi>Davids</hi> experience might doe in such distresse. What a deale of life and light were it able, to put into the very darkest Dampe,

That proportionably to his present perplexities, Hee cryed out with a most heavy heart: First, <hi>Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will hee bee favourable no more? Is His mercy cleane gone for ever? Doth his promise faile for evermore? Hath God forgotten to bee gracious? Hath hee in anger shut up His tender mercies?</hi> Vers. 7.8.9. Secondly, That <hi>when Hee remembred God, Hee was troubled:</hi> Vers. 3. Thirdly, That when He prayed unto God, and <hi>complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, His spirit was overwhelmed. Ibid.</hi> Fourthly, That Hee <hi>was so troubled, that Hee could not speake:</hi> Vers. 4. Fifthly, That <hi>His Soule refused to be comforted.</hi> Vers. 2. Which painefull passages of His spirituall desertion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer exactly to the comfortlesse Case of the supposed Soule-grieved Patient. Nay, and besides assurance of the very samenesse in apprehensions of feare, and thoughts of horrour; <hi>David</hi> also out of his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and precedency, might sweetly informe, and direct such a poore panting Soule in a comfortable way, to come out of the <hi>Place of Dragons,</hi> and depths of sorrow; by teaching, and telling Him the manner, and meanes of his rising, and recovery. Meditation of Gods singular goodnesse, and extraordinary mercy to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, his Church and Children aforetime, gave the first lift, as it were, to raise his drooping Soule out of the dust. And no doubt, ever since the same consideration, by the blessings of God, hath brought againe many a bruised spirit from the very Gates of Hell, and brink of despaire. <note n="a" place="margin">

For Hee was wofully guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by His transgression, of casting both Himselfe, and all his Sonnes and Daughters, from the Creation to the Worlds end, out of Paradise into the Pit of Hell: and also of empoysoning with the cursed contagion of originall corruption, the Soules and Bodies of all that ever were, or shall bee borne of Woman, the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> onely excepted. And yet this Man, as best Divines sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, tho Hee had cast away Himselfe, and undone all Mankind, was received to mercy. Let never poore Soule then, while the World lasts, upon true and timely repentance, suffer the hainousnesse, and horrour of His former sinnes, whatsoever they have been, to hinder his hopefull accesse unto the Throne of Grace, for present pardon of them all; or at any time afterward confound His comforts, and confidence in Gods gracious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

            </p>
            <p>Thus having discovered the Cases, and Causes of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Desertion; I come now to the comforts and the Cure.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And let us first take notice of a double desertion: first, Passiue; when God withdrawes Himselfe from us: secondly, Active; when wee with-draw our selves from God. And they are both two-fold: first, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary: and secondly, Finall.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Passive desertion temporary; As in <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 77. <hi>Heman the Ezrahite, Psal.</hi> 88. <hi>Iob.</hi> Both the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> See their story, <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> 1885. 1891. Mistris <hi>Brettergh</hi>; Master <hi>Peacocke</hi>; And many moe of Gods Children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Finall, In many, after a wofull, and willfull abuse of many mercies, meanes of salvation, and generall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As <hi>Saul, Iudas,</hi> &amp;c. Such as have out-stood all opportunities and seasons of grace, and all those, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Active desertion temporary; As in <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Finall; as in those, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>Now in the present Point, I understand onely a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive temporary Desertion. And therefore in that Man, which is truly ingraffed into Christ by a justifying Faith, and regenerated; who can never possibly, either forsake finally, or be finally forsaken of God Of whom <hi>Hooker</hi> thus speakes. <note n="*" place="margin">

And from hence mayest thou take comfort in two respects: First, Desertion deprives thee only of these comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table accessar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es; but thou art still possest of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and substantialls of salvation: Of which, not the utmost concurrence of all hellish, and earthly rage, can
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:6598:271"/>
possibly rob thee; And therefore thou art well enough in the meane time, and as safe, as safety it selfe can make thee. 2. Secondly, Losse of these lesse principall graces (which by accident, is a singular advantage and gaine) drives thee nearer unto <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> at least, by many unutterable groanes; every one whereof, is a strong cry in the eares of God; and causeth thee, better to prise, and plie; to exercise, and improove more fruitfully, those other more necessary graces, without which thou canst not bee saved. It is a wise, and honest passage in Mistris <hi>Iuxons Monument; pag</hi> 60. <hi>Shee continued faithfull to the ende, in the most substantiall graces. For howsoever shee mourned for the want of that degree of ioy, which shee had felt in former times; yet she continued in repentance; in the practise of holinesse, and righteousnesse; in a tender love of God, and to his Word, and Children; in holy zeale, and fruitfulnesse, even to the last period of her daies. And indeede, her want of full ioy was so sanctified unto her, that it was a furtherance to a better grace; namely, to repentance, and selfe-deniall, and base esteeme of her selfe. And I call repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a better grace then ioy, because, howsoever ioy, is a most excellent gift of the Spirit; yet unto us, repentance is more profitable. For I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but that a mourning Christian may bee saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ravishing ioy; and that Christ may wipe away his his teares in heaven: but no Christian shall bee saved without repentance, and selfe-deniall.</hi> For instance: The darkenesse of our Spirits in spirituall desertions, sets our <hi>Faith</hi> on worke extraordinarily. In such a Case, it hath recourse with more love, and longing to all the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of life. The Person and Passion of <hi>Christ</hi>; all the Promises; Gods free grace; His sweet Name, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaies them more seriously; searches and sounds them to the bottome; that by some meanes, at least, it may subsist, and hold up the head in such an evill time, and amongst so many terrours, and boisterous tempests. It is now put to the improvement, of the very utmost of all
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:6598:271"/>
it's heavenly vigour and valour; and inforced to put forth it's highest, and most heroicall Act; even to cleave fast to the <hi>sure Word</hi> of God, against all sense and feeling; against all terrours, tricks of Satan, and temptations to the contrary. And by this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exercise and wrastling, it is notably strengthened, and steeled for the time to come. For as sloth, idlenesse, and want of exercise, doth much emasculate, and make our bodies more unactive, and unable; but hard-ship, agitation and imployment, doth much quicken, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them: So it is in the present Point. Without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and assault, Faith langvisheth, and lies hid; but when stormes, and spirituall troubles are towards, it stirres up it selfe; gathers it's strength, and forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: casts about for subsidiary assistance by prayer, Ministeriall counsell, meditation upon speciall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for the purpose; experimentall recounting former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, mercies, and favours upon our selves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c. And so becomes farre more excellent and victorious, for future incounters. It furthers also <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>: In respect of, first, Sight of sins. For thorow the glasse of spirituall Affliction we see more, and them more monstrously vile. The clouds of inward trouble especially, unite, as it were, and collect the sight of our soules; and so represent our sinnes more to the life, and in their true colours: where as the glistering of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is wont to disperse and dazle it. Secondly, Of sense; wee are then more apprehensive of divine wrath, and weight of sinne; when wee are terrified, but with a taste of those immeasurable Seaes of bitternesse, and terrour, which it infinitely merits at the hands of God. Thirdly, Of hatred and opposition; wee then grow into a more hearty loathing of that <hi>sweet</hi> meat, which wee are too apt to tumble into our mouth,<note place="margin">Iob 20.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

entertainement, or warmth in our bosomes to those Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which have so bitten and stung us. It makes <hi>Selfe-deniall</hi> more resolute and thorow. For the dearest and most desirable things of this life, compared with <hi>Christ,</hi> were never viler dung in our esteeme, then at such a time. Wee then finde that most true; That tho all the Starres shine never so bright, yet it is still night, because the Sunne is gone; But the alone presence of that Prince of light, creates a comfortable and glorious day; though never a Starre appeare. So, let us enjoy the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi>; and no matter, tho all the creatures in the World bee turned into Beares, or Divels about us; But if hee withdraw himselfe; and the light of his countenance set out of our sight; the confluence of all the comforts, the whole Creation can afford, will doe us no good at all. It quickneth notably our <hi>New-obedience.</hi> In respect of, first, <hi>Holinesse towards God,</hi> and reverent heavenly behaviour about the first Table. A generall taste and triall whereof, wee may take, by comparing Marriners in a storme, and arrived in the Haven; <note n="h" place="margin">Chrysostomus <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubi docet; Satius esse longe in carcere detine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri obscurissimo, teterri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo; quàm in Theatris versari.

For as in the one state, wee may observe too much presumption, and putting farre from us the evill day, forgetfulnesse of God, security, and sloth: so in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Trouble, danger and distresse, much alter the Case. Wee shall then see them, bitterly bewayling their former sinnes; trembling in the dust, seeking ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods face and favour; falling to prayer; vowing better obedience; and promising, upon deliverance, much holinesse, and a happy change. What mighty groanes of spirit proceede from the deserted, in such a Case, which are the strongest praiers, tho in that agony they falsely complaine, that they cannot pray? How gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are they of godly conference, counsell and comfort
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:6598:272"/>
out of the Word, daies of humiliation, of the most sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Sermons, godliest company, presence and praiers of the precisest Ministers? How fearefull are they, to heare any worldly talke upon the <hi>Lords day</hi>? How sensible of the least sinne, any dishonour of God, and all appearance of evill? In a word; how busie are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that <hi>One necessary thing</hi>? Secondly, Of <hi>compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionatenesse towards others.</hi> Selfe-sufferings soften mens hearts towards their Brethren: Personall miseries makes them pittifull, and painefull to afford all possible help in times of distresse. Experience of our owne weakenesses, wants, danger to sinke under the waves of Gods wrath, and dis-ability to subsist by our selves, begets a sweet mildnesse, and gentle behaviour towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; whose assistance, visitation and praiers wee now see, wee stand in need of in extremities, and evill times. Prosperity is apt of it selfe, to produce scornefulnesse, insolency, selfe-confidence, and contempt of others; But Gods hand upon us, especially in afflictions of Soule, teacheth us another lesson; to wit, how fraile, weake, and unworthie wee are. Thirdly, Of <hi>selfe-knowledge.</hi> In times of peace and calmenesse, looking thorow the false spectacles of selfe-love and conceitednesse, we are ready to over-weene, and out-prize our gifts; to mistake sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, for substances; smallest Mites of vertues, for rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est talents; the infant beginnings of grace, for <hi>tallnesse in Christ:</hi> But remove these deceiving glasses, and let the touchstone of some sorer triall represent our selves unto our selves; and wee shall more clearely see our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall abilities, in their true nature and proportion. Then all unsound semblances of selfe-conceited suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, and former flourishes of unhumble assurance (which like gilded Papers, or Posts, shewing glorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Sunshine, and seeming pure gold in outward appearance) will vanish quite away, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the fire of spirituall afflictions.

The Sun, we know, tho hee leaves his light upon the face of the earth, yet notwithstanding, descends by a reall effectual influence into the bosome, and darkest bowels thereof; and there exerciseth a most excellent work, in begetting mettals, Gold, Silver, and other pretious things.

Secondly, Privatively: In that hee was berest, and forsaken of all comfortable presence; the God-head for a season, shadowing it selfe under the Cloud of Gods wrath, that the Man-hood of Christ might feele the intolerable burden thereof: And thus Christ being destitute of consolation, complaineth that hee was forsaken.

Either the <hi>Heire of all things</hi> must die, or we had all been damned.

Some of Gods dearest Children, and those that love him best, (Would you thinke it? yet it is too true) are sometimes so pestred with their irkesome intrusions; that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they speake, doe, heare, reade, or think upon, is wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, perverted, and hellishly empoisoned with this temptation of blasphemy. And they are ordinarily prest upon them with most importunity and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, when they are best busied, and exercised in the holiest duties; as in praier, hearing, or reading the Word, singing of Psalmes, dayes of humiliation, &amp;c.</p>

Secondly, That hee might take the venome, sting, and guilt from this hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and horrible temptation, for all His, to the Worlds end.
