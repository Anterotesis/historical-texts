            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is thought as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to write a Preface before a Book, as it is judg'd civil, when you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite a Friend to Dinner, to proffer him a Glass of Hock before-hand for a Whet: And this being maim'd enough for want of a Dedication, I am resolv'd it shall not want an Epistle to the Reader too. I shall not take upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether it is lawful to play at Dice or not, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:55286:3"/>
that to be disputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Fanatick Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> and the <hi>Sharpers;</hi> I am sure it is lawful to deal with playing at Dice as with other Epidemic Distempers; and I am confident that the writing a Book about it, will contribute as little towards its Encouragement, as Fluxing and Precipitates do to Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>It will be to little purpose to tell my Reader, of how great Antiquity the playing at Dice is, I will only let him

know, that by the <hi>Aleae Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> the Antients comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all Games, which were subjected to the determination of mere Chance; this sort of Gaming was strictly forbid by the Emperor <hi>Justinian, Cod. Lib. 3. Tit. 43.</hi> under very severe Penalties; and <hi>Photius Nomocan, Tit. 9. Cap. 27.</hi> acquaints us, that the Use of this was altogether denied the Clergie of that time. <hi>Seneca</hi> says very well, <hi>Aleator quantò in arte est melior, tantò est ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quior;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55286:5"/>
That by how much the one is more skilful in Games, by so much he is the more culpable; or we may say of this, as an ingenious Man says of Dancing, That to be extraordinary good at it, is to be excellent in a Fault; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope no body will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I had so mean a Design in this, as to teach the Art of Playing at Dice.</p>
            <p>A great part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is a Translation from Mons. <hi>Hugen</hi>'s Treatise, <hi>De ratiociniis in ludo</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55286:5"/>
               <hi>Aleae,</hi> one, who in his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of Philosophy, has but one Superior, and I think few or no Equals. The whole I undertook for my own Divertisement, next to the Satisfaction of some Friends, who would now and then be wrangling about the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Hazards in some Cases that are here decided. All it requir'd was a few spare Hours, and but little Work for the Brain; my Design in publishing it, was to make it of more general
<pb facs="tcp:55286:6"/>
Use, and perhaps persuade a raw Squire, by it, to keep his Money in his Pocket; and if, upon this account, I should ineur the Clamours of the Sharpers, I do not much regard it, since they are a sort of People the World is not bound to provide for.</p>
            <p>You will find here a very plain and easie Method of the Calculation of the Hazards of Game, which a man may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, without knowing the Quadratures of <hi>Curves,</hi> the Doctrin of <hi>Series</hi>'s, or the
<pb facs="tcp:55286:6"/>
Laws of <hi>Centripetation</hi> of Bodies, or the Periods of the <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> yea, without so much as the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Euclid.</hi> There is nothing required for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the whole, but common Sense and practical Arithmetick; saving a few Touches of <hi>Algebra,</hi> as in the first Three Propositions, where the Reader, without suspicion of Popery, may make use of a strong implicit Faith; tho I must confess, it does not much recommend
<pb facs="tcp:55286:7"/>
it self to me in these purposes; for I had rather he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and I believe he will find the speculation not unpleasant.</p>
            <p>Every man's Success in any Affair is proportional to his Conduct &amp; Fortune. Fortune (in the sense of most People) signifies an Event which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on Chance, agreeing with my Wish; and Misfortune sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies such an Event contrary to my Wish: an Event depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Chance, signifies such an one, whose immediate Causes I don't know, and consequently
<pb facs="tcp:55286:7"/>
can neither foretel nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it (for it is no Heresie to believe, that Providence suffers ordinary matters to run in the Channel of second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses). Now I suppose, that all a wise Man can do in such a Case is, to lay his Business on such Events, as have the most or most powerful se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Causes, and this is true both in the great Events of the World, and in ordinary Games. It is impossible for a Dye, with such a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd force and direction, not
<pb facs="tcp:55286:8"/>
to fall on such a determin'd side, only I don't know the force and direction which makes it fall on such a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd side, and therefore I call that Chance, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but want of Art; that only which is left to me, is to wager where there are the greatest number of Chances, and consequently the greatest probability to gain; and the whole Art of Gaming, where there is any thing of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, will be reduc'd to this at last, <hi>viz.</hi> in dubious Cases, to
<pb facs="tcp:55286:8"/>
calculate on which side there are most Chances; and tho this can't be done in the midst of Game precisely to an Unite, yet a Man who knows the Principles, may make such a conjecture, as will be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient direction to him; and tho it is possible, if there are any Chances against him at all, that he may lose, yet when he chuseth the safest side, he may partwith his Money with more content (if there can be any at all) in such a Case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55286:9"/>
I will not debate, whether one may engage another in a disadvantageous Wager. Games may be suppos'd to be a tryal of Wit as well as Fortune, and every Man, when he enters the Lists with another, unless out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance, takes it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his Fortune and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are, at least, equal to those of his Play-Fellow; but this I am sure of, that false Dice, Tricks of <hi>Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-main, &amp;c.</hi> are inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, for the question in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:55286:9"/>
is not, Who is the best Iugler?</p>
            <p>The Reader may here observe the Force of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which can be succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applied, even to those things, which one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin are subject to no Rules. There are very few things which we know, which are not capable of being reduc'd to a Mathematical Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, and when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, its a sign our Knowledg of them is very small and confus'd; and where
<pb facs="tcp:55286:10"/>
a mathematical reasoning can be had, it's as great folly to make use of any other, as to grope for a thing in the dark when you have a Candle stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by you. I believe the Calculation of the Quantity of Probability might be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to a very useful and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Speculation, and applied to a great many Events which are accidental, besides those of Games; only these Cases would be infinitely more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, as depending on Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which the most part of
<pb facs="tcp:55286:10"/>
Men are ignorant of; and as I have hinted already, all the Politicks in the World are nothing else but a kind of Analysis of the Quantity of Probability in casual Events, and a good Politician signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no more, but one who is dexterous at such Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; only the Principles which are made use of in the Solution of such Problems, can't be studied in a Closet, but acquir'd by the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55286:11"/>
There is likewise a Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Quantity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability founded on Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, to be made use of in Wagers about any thing; for Example, it is odds, if a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is <hi>with Child,</hi> but it shall be a <hi>Boy;</hi> and if you would know the just odds, you must consider the Proportion in the Bills that the Males bear to the Females: The Yearly Bills of Mortality are observ'd to bear such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the live People as 1 to 30, or 26; therefore it
<pb facs="tcp:55286:11"/>
is an even Wager, that one out of thirteen, dyes within a Year (which may be a good reason, tho not the true one of that foolish piece of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition), because, at this rate, if 1 out of 26 dyes, you are no loser. It is but 1 to 18 if you meet a <hi>Parson</hi> in the Street, that he proves to be a <hi>Non-Juror,</hi> because there is but 1 of 36 that are such. It is hardly 1 to 10, that a <hi>Woman</hi> of Twenty Years old has her <hi>Maidenhead,</hi> and almost
<pb facs="tcp:55286:12"/>
the same Wager, that a <hi>Town-Spark</hi> of that Age has not been <hi>clap'd.</hi> I think a Man might venture some odds, that 100 of the <hi>Gens d'arms</hi> beats an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Number of <hi>Dutch Troopers;</hi> and that an <hi>English Regiment</hi> stands its ground as long as another, making Experience our Guide in all these Cases and others of the like nature.</p>
            <p>But there are no casual Events, which are so easily subjected to Numbers, as
<pb facs="tcp:55286:12"/>
those of Games; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there the Speculation might be improved so far, as to bring in the Doctrin of the <hi>Series</hi>'s and <hi>Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithms.</hi> Since Gaming is become a Trade, I think it fit the Adventurers should be upon the Square; and therefore in the Contrivance of Games there ought to be a strict Calculation made use of, that they mayn't put one Party in more probability to gain than another; and likewise, if a Man has a
<pb facs="tcp:55286:13"/>
considerable Venture, he ought to be allow'd to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Money when he pleases, paying according to the Circumstances he is then in: and it were easie in most Games to make Tables, by the Inspection of which, a Man might know what he was either to pay or receive, in any Circumstances you can imagin, it being convenient to save a part of ones Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, rather than venture the loss of it all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55286:13"/>
I shall add no more, but that a Mathematician will easily perceive, it is not put in such a Dress as to be taken notice of by him, there being abundance of Words spent to make the more ordinary sort of People understand it.</p>

            <p>ALthough the Events of Games, which Fortune solely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet it may be certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, how much one is more ready to lose than gain. For <hi>Example:</hi> If one should wager, at the first Throw with one Dye, to throw Six, it's an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55286:15"/>
accident if he gains or not, but by how much it's more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he will lose than gain, is really determin'd by the Nature of the thing, and capable of a strict Calculation. So likewise, if I should play with another on this condition, that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory should be to the Three first Games, and I had gain'd one already; it is still uncertain who shall first gain the third; yet by a demonstrative reasoning I can estimate both the Value of his expectation and mine, and consequently (if we agree to leave the Game unperfect) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin how great a share of the Stakes belong to me, and how much to my Play-fellow;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55286:15"/>
or if any were desirous to take my place, at what rate I ought to sell it. Hence may arise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Queries among two, three, or more Gamesters; and since the Calculation of these things is a little out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road, and can be oft-times apply'd to good purpose; I shall briefly here shew how it is to be done, and afterwards explain those things which belong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to the Dice.</p>
            <p>In both cases I shall make use of this Principle, <hi>Ones Hazard or Expectation to gain any thing, is worth so much, as, if he had it, he could purchase the like Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard or Expectation again in a just and equal Game.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55286:16"/>
For <hi>Example,</hi> If one, without my knowledg, should hide in one Hand 7 Shillings, and in his other 3 Shillings, and put it to my choice which Hand I would take, I say this is as much worth to me, as if he should give me 5 Shillings; because, if I have 5 Shillings, I can purchase as good a Chance again, and that in a fair and just Game.</p>

As for the <hi>Dice;</hi> these Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions may be proposed, at how many Throws one may wager to throw 6, or any Number below that, with one Dye; How many Throws are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for 12 upon two Dice; or 18 on 3; and several other Questions to this purpose.</p>
               <p>For the resolving of which, it must be consider'd, that in one Dye there are six different Throws, all equally probable to come up; for I suppose the Dye has the exact figure of a Cube: On Two Dice there are 36 dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Throws; for in respect to every Throw of One Dye, any One Throw of the 6 of the other Dye may come up; and 6 times
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55286:29"/>
6 make 36: In Three Dice there are 216 different Throws; for in relation to any of the 36 Throws of Two Dice, any one of the six of the Third may come up; and 6 times 36 make 216: So in Four Dice there are 6 times 216 Throws, that is, 1296: And so forward you may reckon the Throws of any Number of Dice, taking always, for the addition of a new Dye, 6 times the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the preceeding.</p>
               <p>Besides, it must be observ'd, that in Two Dice there is only one way 2 or 12 can come up; two ways that 3 or 11 can come up; for if I shall call the Dice A and B to make 3, there
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55286:29"/>
may be 1 in A and 2 in B, or 2 in A and 1 in B; so to make 11, there may be 5 in A or 6 in B, or 6 in A and 5 in B; for 4 there are three Chances, 3 in A and 1 in B, 3 in B and 1 in A, or 2 as well in A as B; for 10 there are likewise three Chances; for 5 or 9 there are four Chances; for 6 or 8 five Chances; for 7 there are six Chances.</p>

so on by turns, till one of them wins. I require the proportion of A's Hazard to B's? <hi>Answer,</hi> It is as 10355 to 12276.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Three Gamesters, A, B, and C, take 12 Counters, of which there are four white and eight black; the Law of the Game is this, that he shall win, who, hood-wink'd, shall first chuse a white Counter, and that A shall have the first choice, B the second, and C the third, and so, by turns, till one of them win. <hi>Quaer.</hi> What is the proportion of their Hazards?</p>
               <p n="3">3. A wagers with B, that of 40 Cards, that is, 10 of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55286:37"/>
every Suit, he will pick out four; so that there shall be one of every suit; A's Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to B's, in this Case, is as 1000 to 8139.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Supposing, as before, 4 white Counters and 8 black, A wagers with B, that out of them, he shall pick 7 Counters, of which there are 3 white. I require the proportion of A's Hazard to B's?</p>

                  <p>I have suppos'd here the sense of the Problem to be, that when any one chus'd a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he did not diminish their Number; but if he miss'd of a white one, put it in again, and left an equal Hazard to him who had the following Choice; for if it be otherwise suppos'd, A's share will be 55/123, which is less than 9/19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prob.</hi> 2. It is evident, that wagering to pick out 4 Cards out of 40, so that there be one of every Suit, is no more, than wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering,

out of 39 Cards to take 3 which shall be of three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Suits; for it is all one which Card you draw first, all the Hazard being, whether out of the 39 remaining you take 3, of which none shall be of the Suit you first drew.

again you had gone right only for two Draughts, then you have 18 Cards (of the Suits you have drawn before) which make you lose, and 20, which put you in the Case suppos'd formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> where you have but one Card to draw, which, as we have already calculated, is worth 10/37<hi>a;</hi> so you have 18 Chances for nothing, and 20 for 10/37<hi>a,</hi> which, by Prop. 3. is worth 100/703<hi>a.</hi> Suppose again you have 3 Cards to draw, then you have 9 (of the Suit you drew first) which make you lose, and 30 which put you in the Case suppos'd last; so you have 9 Chances for nothing, and 30 for 100/703<hi>a,</hi> which, by

                  <p>It is easie to apply this Method to the Games that are in use amongst us: For <hi>Example,</hi> If A and B, playing at <hi>Backgammon,</hi> B had already gain'd one end of three, and A none, and if A had the Dice in his Hand for the last Throw of the second end, all his Men but two upon the Ace Point being already cast of: <hi>Quaer.</hi> What is the proportion of As Hazard to Bs?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solution:</hi> There being of the 36 Throws of two Dice, six which give Doublets; if A

throw any of the Six, he has the Stake <hi>a;</hi> if he throw any of the other Thirty, then he wants but one Game, and his Fellow-Gamester three, which, by Prop.

                  <p>Supposing the same Case, and if their Bargain had been, that he who gain'd three ends before the other gain'd one, should have double of what each stak'd, that is, the Stake and a half more, then there had been due to A 282/285 of the

                  <p>Thus likewise, if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the former Rule to the <hi>Royal Oak-Lottery,</hi> you will find, that he who wagers that any Figure shall come up at the first throw, ought to wagers 1 against 31; that he who wagers it shall come up at one of two throws, ought to wager 63 against 961; that he who wagers that a Figure shall come up at once in three times, ought to lay 124955 against 923621, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it being only somewhat tedious to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the rest.

of wagering at how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Throws of one Dye 6 shall come up, falls on three; the contrary of which you have seen already demonstrated; you will find by calculation, that he has the Disadvantage, who wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that 1 of the 32 different Throws of the <hi>Royal Oak-Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> shall come at once of 20 times, and that he has some Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, who wagers on 22 times; so the nearest to Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is on 21 times: But it must be remembred, that I have suppos'd in the former Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Ball in the <hi>Royal Oak-Lottery</hi> to be regular, tho it can never be exactly so; for he who has the smallest Skill in

               <p>NOthing is more easie, than by the former Method to determine the Value of any Number of Throws of any Number of Dice; for in one Throw of a Dye, I have an equal chance for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, consequently my Hazard is

worth their Sum 21 divided by their Number 6, that is, 3½.

               <p>This is not to be understood as if it were an equal Wager to throw 7, or above it, with two Dice at one Throw; for he who undertakes to do so, has the advantage by 21 against 15. The meaning is only, if I were to have a Guinea, a

Shilling, or any thing else, for every Point that I threw with two Dice at one Throw, my Hazard is worth 7 of these, because he who gave me 7 for it, would have an equal proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of gaining or losing by it, the Chances of the Throws above 7 being as many, as of these below it: So it is more than an equal Wager to throw 14 at least at two Throws of two Dice, because it is more probable that 14 will come, than any one Number besides, and as probable that it will be above it as below it; but if one were to buy this Hazard at the rate above-mention'd, he ought just to give 14 for it.

It is evident likewise, that it is an even Wager to throw 11 or above it, because there are as many Chances for 11, and the Throws above it, as for the Throws below it; but tho it be an even Wager to throw 11 at one Throw, it is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to wager to throw 22 at two Throws, and far more to wager to throw 33 at three Throws; and yet it is more than an equal Wager that you shall throw 21 at two Throws in Raffling, because it is as probable that you will, as that you will not throw 11, at least, the first time, and more than probable that you will throw 10, at least, the second time.</p>

For an instance of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the preceeding Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, I will shew, how by sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Subtraction, the most part of the former Problems may be solv'd.</p>
               <p>Suppose A and B, playing together, each of 'em stakes 32 Shillings, and that A wants one Game of the Number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, and B wants two; to find the share of the Stakes due to each of 'em. It's plain, if A wins the next Game he has the whole 64 Shillings; if B wins it, then their Shares are equal; therefore says A to B, If you will break off the Game, give me 32, which I am sure of, whether I win or lose the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55286:47"/>
next Game, and since you will not venture for the other 32, let us part them equally, that is, give me 16, which, with the former 32, make 48, leaving 16 to you.</p>
               <p>Suppose A wanted one Game, and B three; if A wins the next Game, he has the 64 Shillings; if B wins it, then they are in the condition formerly suppos'd, in which Case there is 48 due to A; therefore says A to B, give me the 48 which I am sure of, whether I win or lose the next Game, and since you will not hazard for the other 16, let us part them equally, that is, give me 8, which, with the former 48, make 56, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55286:47"/>
8 to you, and so all the other Cases may be solv'd after the same manner.</p>
               <p>Suppose A wagers with B, that with one Dye he shall throw 6 at one of three Throws, and that each of them stakes 108 Guineas: To find what is the proportion of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards; Now there being in one Throw of a Dye but one Chance for 6, and five Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against it, one Throw for 6 is worth 1/6 of the Stake; therefore says B to A, of the 216 Guineas take a sixth part for your first Throw, that is, 36; for your next Throw take a sixth part of the remaining 180, that is, 30; and for your third
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55286:48"/>
Throw, take a sixth part of the remaining 150, that is, 25, which in all make 91, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me 125; so his Hazard who undertakes to throw 6 at one of three Throws, is 91 to 125.</p>
               <p>Suppose A had undertaken to throw 6 with one Dye at one Throw of four, and that the whole Stake is 1296; says A to B, Every Throw for 6 of one Dye, is worth the sixth part of what I throw for; therefore for my first Throw give me 216, which is the sixth part of 1296, and there remains 1080, I must have the sixth part of that, <hi>viz.</hi> 180, for my second Throw; and the sixth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55286:48"/>
part of the remaining 900, which is 150, for my third Throw; and the sixth part of the last remainder 750, which is 125 for my fourth Throw; all this added together makes 671, and there remains to you 625; so it is evident, that A's Hazard, in this Case, is to B's 671 to 625.</p>
               <p>Suppose A is to win the Stakes (which we shall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be 36) if he throws 7 at once of twice with two Dice, and B is to have them if he does not; says B to A, the Chances which give 7 are 6 of the 36, which is as' much as 1 of 6; therefore for your first Throw you shall have a sixth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55286:49"/>
part of the 36, which is 6; and for your next Throw a sixth part of the remainder 30, which is 5; this in all makes 11; so you leave 25 to me; so A's Hazard is to B's as 11 to 25.</p>
               <p>It were easie, at this rate to calculate the most intricate Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, were it not that Fractions will occur, which, if they be more than ½, may be suppos'd equal to an Unit, without caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any remarkable Error in great Numbers.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiss, before I conclude, to give you a Rule for finding in any Number of Games the Value of the first, because <hi>Hugens</hi>'s Method, in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55286:49"/>
that Case, is something te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
               <p>Suppose A and B had agreed, that he should have the Stakes who did win the first 9 Games, and A had already won one of the 9; I would know what share of B's Mony is due to A for the Advantage of this Game. To find this, take the first eight even Numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply them continually; that is, the first by the second, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct by the third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take the first eight odd Numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and do just so by them, the product of the even Number is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominator, and the product of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55286:50"/>
the odd Number the Numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a Fraction, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth the quantity of B's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney due to A upon the winning of the first Game of 9; that is, if each stak'd a number of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, or Shillings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd by the product of the even Numbers, there would belong to A, of B's Money, the Number express'd by the product of the odd Numbers: For <hi>Example,</hi> Suppose A had gain'd one Game of 4, then by this Rule, I take the three first even Numbers, 2, 4, 6, and multiply them continually, which make 48, and the first three odd Numbers, 1, 3, 5, and multiply them continually,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55286:50"/>
which make 15; so there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to A 15/48 of B's Money, that is, if each stak'd 48, there would belong to A, besides his own 15 of A's. Now by <hi>Hugens</hi>'s Method, if A wants but three Games while B wants four, there is due to A 21/32 of the Stake; by this Rule there is due to A 15/48 of B's Money, which is 15/69 of the Stake, which, with his own 48/96 of the Stake, makes 63/96 or 21/32 of the Stake, and so in every Case you will find <hi>Hugens</hi>'s Method and this will give you the same Number; a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of it you may see in a Letter of Monsieur <hi>Pascals</hi> to Monsieur <hi>Fermat;</hi> tho it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise express'd there than here,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55286:51"/>
yet the consequence is easily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd. To prevent the labour of Calculation, I have subjoyn'd the following Table, which is calculated for two Gamesters, as Mons. <hi>Hugens</hi> is for three.</p>
               <p>If each of us stake 256 <hi>Guineas</hi> in</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:55286:51"/>
The Use of the Table is plain; for let our Stakes be what they will, I can find the Portion due to me upon the winning the first, or the first two Games, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For <hi>Example,</hi> If each of us had stak'd 4 Guineas, and the Number of Games to be plaid were 3, of which I had gain'd 1, say, As 256 is to 96, so is 4 to a fourth.</p>
               <p>256: 96:: 4: 1½</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To find what is the Value of his Hazard, who undertakes, at the first Throw, to cast Doublets, in any given Number of Dice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:55286:52"/>
In two Dice it is plain to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Doublets, every one of the six different Throws of the first, can only be combin'd with five of the second, because one of the six is of the same kind, and consequently makes Doublets; for the samo reason, the thirty Throws of two Dice, which are not Doublets, can only be combin'd with four Throws of a third Dice, and three Throws of a fourth Dice; so generally it is this Series,</p>
               <p>6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 0, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The second Series is the Sum of the Chances, and the first the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55286:52"/>
Number of Chances against him who undertakes to throw Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets, each Series to be continu'd so many terms, as are the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Dice. For <hi>Example,</hi> If one should undertake to throw Doublets at the first Throw of four Dice, his Adversary's Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard is <gap reason="math">

                  </gap> or 5/18 leaving to him 13/18, so he has 13 to 5. In seven Dice, you see the Chances against him are o, because then there must necessarily be Doublets.</p>

wanted two of the four, and had wager'd to have both those two, then they have an equal Hazard to get nothing; if they miss the first of those two, or to put themselves in the former Case if they get it; so they have an equal Hazard to get nothing or ½, which, by <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. is worth ¼ of the Stake; so if they want three Honours, you will find due to them 1/8 of the Stake; and if they wanted four, 1/16 of the Stake, leaving to C and D 15/16; so C and D can wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger 15 to 1, that A and B shall not have all the four Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55286:54"/>
there is due to them 1/8 of the Stake; therefore, by Prop. 1. their Hazard is worth 5/16, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to C and D 11/16.</p>
               <p>A <hi>and</hi> B <hi>playing at</hi> Whist <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> C <hi>and</hi> D; A <hi>and</hi> B <hi>have eight of ten, and</hi> C <hi>and</hi> D <hi>nine, and therefore can't reckon Honors; to find the proportion of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is 5/16 due to C and D upon their hazard of having three of four Honours; but since A and B want but one Game, and C and D two, there is due to C and D but ¼, or 4/16 more upon that account, by Prop. 4. this in all makes 9/16,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55286:55"/>
leaving to A and B 7/16; so the hazard of A and B to that of C and D, is as 9 to 7.</p>
               <p>In the former Calculations I have abstracted from the small difference of having the Deal and being Seniors.</p>
               <p>All the former Cases can be calculated by the <hi>Theorems</hi> laid down by Monsieur <hi>Hugens;</hi> but Cases more compos'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire other Principles, for the easie and ready Computation of which, I shall add one <hi>Theorem</hi> more, demonstrated after Mons. <hi>Hugens</hi>'s Method.</p>

               <p>By the Law of the Game, the Caster, before he throws next, has four Chances for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>viz.</hi> these II, III, XII; eight Chances for the whole Stake, <hi>viz.</hi> those of VII, XI;

               <p>Now to save the trouble of a tedious reduction, Suppose the Stake which they play for be 36, that is, the Setter had laid down 18; in that case, every one of these Fractions are so many parts of an Unite, which, being gather'd into one Sum, give 1741/59 to the Caster, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1814/55 to the Setter; so the hazard of the Caster is to that of the Setter 244, 251.</p>

               <p>It is plain, that in every Case the Caster has the Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and that V. or IX. are better Mains to set on than VII, because, in this last Cast the Setter has but 18 and 14/55 or 84/330; whereas, when V. or IX. is the Main, he has 1886/315; likewise VI. or VIII. are better Mains than V. or IX. because 167/396 is a greater Froction than 86/315.</p>
