         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON the <hi>22<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> day of the 6. Month 1656. it being two
dayes after the Generall Election of Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

Fiſher,</hi> at my own outward being at <hi>Lid</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> ſaying, go

the day appointed for the firſt ſitting of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and

I was ſtill, and quiet, and not unwilling if the Lords will
were to continue it upon me but ſweetly ſatisfyed within me
to obey it,) yet was afterwards at ſundry times, (even ſo oft as
fleſh, and blood drew me to conſult with it) attended with no
ſmall <hi>Commotion</hi> in my Minde, and being often held under a

called of the Lord to ſeek his face yet further, even ſeven or
eight dayes together with faſting, tears, and ſupplications, for
the full clearing up of his Mind unto Me in that Matter, and
his ſtrengthning of me to it, in caſe he would not excuſe me in
it, nor ſend his Meſſage by the Mouth of any other beſide my

of new evidences, and refreſhments to my ſpirits, during
all the time of that abſtinence, which was a faſt not of mine,
but of the Lords own chooſing, (which kind of faſts the formall
faſters of this age, are not acquainted with the Miſtery of, nor
ever will be, till they come out from the <hi>outward Court,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

which in the holy of holys onely is to be had: on the <hi>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> day
waiting upon <hi>God</hi> after the receiving of ſomething, for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance
of my <hi>outward,</hi> I was alſo more then ordinarily ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
in my <hi>inward Man;</hi> Yea, the Lord not onely put it out
of doubt, and perfectly ſealed it up to me, that it was his mind
that I muſt go, which I had all along deſired earneſtly, that
I might never do at my own will, if it were not his, but alſo
forbear to be a terror to me himſelf, as he had been very often
by fits, not without ſpeciall reference to my good, for theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
months together, wherein his hand hath been very heavy
on my Family, making me moreover by his wrath in a renewed
ſenſe of all my old ſins, even thoſe of my youth, which he made
me anew to poſſeſs, ſometimes a very terror to my ſelf, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take away all that terror that was wont to ariſe in me, from
the weightineſs of the work under hand, and removed all my
<pb facs="tcp:114679:2"/>
fears of the frowns of mans face, and counter-pleaded all my
pleas to him, that I ſhould not ſpeak for fear, and that they would
not hear me, &amp; ſuch like, with the often iteration of what he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
his Meſſengers by of old (<hi>viz.</hi>) whether they will hear,
or whether they will forbear (for its like they will be rebellious
enough, and make their necks as an iron ſinew) yet go thou,
and be not afraid, nor diſmayed at their faces, leſt I confound
thee before them; whereupon having received ſuch a charge
from the Lord, without any more gainſaying, or giving any
heed to fleſh, and blood, I from thenceforth concluded unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to be there, and accordingly was there at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and began to ſpeak ſo ſoon as poſſibly I could get conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of a ſtanding, after the Protector had done his ſpeech:
but ſo it was, that by the grievouſneſs of the crowd, that was
there, and the violence of five or ſix more barbarous than all
the reſt that ſtood about me, (who hearing me ſay with deſires
to them of room (of whom I hoped to have had aſſiſtance in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the audience of the rest) that I had a word to ſpeak from
the <hi>Lord</hi> to the <hi>Protector,</hi> the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> ſet
me at nought, (ſome ſaying the <hi>Protector</hi> had ſpoken long, and
was very hot, and weary, and I might be aſhamed to occaſion
his ſtay now any longer, ſome crying a <hi>Quaker,</hi> a <hi>Quaker,</hi>
keep him down, he ſhall not ſpeak,) I was hindred a while, and
held under of them by the utmoſt force they could uſe, till there
was a riſing to go away, and the <hi>Protector</hi> was with the ſword,
and Maces before him deſcended, and departing from his
<hi>Chair,</hi> but the word of the <hi>Lord</hi> burning then as a fire in my
bowells; ſo that I could not but ſpeak, whether I ſhould be
heard yea, or nay; for I was weary with forbearing, it forced
me to crowd in and ſtand between two of them, that ſtood before
me on a form, and ſo ſpoke whether they would or no, (and
whether it were fit for me to obey God, or theſe Men that had
no power there to forbid me, but the power of darkneſs, judge
ye) but having ſpoken with much difficulty, ſo much as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in about half a dozen lines, of what is here under writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
in which the <hi>Protector,</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> are onely named,
and before I came to that, by which I was moved of the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:114679:3"/>
in his Name, to be ſpeak, and challenge their attendance, I was
forthwith unpeaceably prohibited, not by the <hi>Protector</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
(whoſe Nobility in hearing what is ſaid, whether he heeded
it yea, or nay, as it hath been experienced heretofore, ſo I am
as free to acknowledge it here, as <hi>Paul</hi> was to take notice of the
like in <hi>Feſtus,</hi> whom he held moſt noble in that he would hear
him, though he thought him Mad) nor yet by any one of the
<hi>Parliament</hi> Men that I know of,<note n="a" place="margin">Unleſs either of the two Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices were Members of the Houſe, that took me to do a little after, one of which taking me to be a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyed himſelf more about me than he needed to have done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had found cauſe to do more to me than at laſt they did.</note> (of whom I am perſwaded
that together with the <hi>Protector</hi> they would have heard, could
I have ſpoken before they had been ſo far onward in paſſing our,
and am not out of hopes, but that they will patiently read me
herein, how ever) but by many of that multitude, that was
mingled then among them, who (much like them who fell with
one accord upon <hi>Paul,</hi> accuſing him that contrary to the Law,
he taught the worſhip of God, and took <hi>Soſthenes,</hi> and beat him
before the very judgement Seat of <hi>Gallio the Governour,</hi> he
caring for none of thoſe things, 18 <hi>Act</hi> 12. 17.) took and tore
me from my ſtanding, tumbling and haling me to, and fro, and
how far hitting me, I name not, ſith I had no hurt, I cannot
ſay before his face, for his back was then turned to paſs away,
but while the <hi>Protector</hi> was yet in preſence, howbeit not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happily what they did; which incivility of theirs I now
mention, not to ſhame any of thoſe men that ſhamed themſelves
(if they be not ſuch unjuſt ones as know no ſhame) too much in
the very acting it, yet O Lord lay not that their ſin unto their
charge) but to ſhew them how much more uncivill they were
when they had done, in laying their own ſin to my charge, for
howbeit I was wholly innocent as to any breach of peace in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither in a peaceable manner, to ſhew them the way to the
true peace, which they know not, yet (as it ever did upon the
<hi>Lord</hi> himſelf, and all his <hi>Prophets,</hi> who when they were moſt
diſturbed were made diſturbers, whereupon I rejoyce and am
contented) diſturbance aroſe upon me, and not onely ſo, but even
by the Juſtice of Peace in whoſe cuſtody I was a while, as well as
by the reſt, who made the ront, I was accuſed as a wanderer
that went about diſturbing of the peace.</p>
            <p>But the day is now dawning, and that true light ſhining forth,
<pb facs="tcp:114679:3"/>
which will ſhew, (as the book of conſcience comes on to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and it cannot now be much longer cloſed) that ſuch as are
run out, and gone aſtray from the light of the Lord, and cry
peace, peace to themſelves in their ſins, and in their wicked
diſturbings of his truth, are the chief <hi>vagabonds,</hi> and <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers</hi>
both in their own ſouls, and in the Nations, ſith there
begins to be from henceforth, for ever, and is to be from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
more than ever, no peace (ſaith my <hi>God</hi>) unto the wicked.</p>
            <p>Now as to all thoſe that were then ſo rude and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as to ſay it was both unmannerly, and unſeaſonable for me
to offer to ſpeak <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> though in the Name, and
power of the living <hi>God,</hi> as if it were King <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
or ſome place ſo priviledged by the <hi>Lord God</hi> himſelf from
having any of his word dropped there, that none of his <hi>Prophets</hi>
may come near it, I adviſe them to conſider that the word of
<hi>God</hi> as it is worthy to be tarryed for by Man, and waited for
by Man, ſo it cannot, (as the words of trencher-Chaplains often
if not ever do) tarry for Man, nor wait for Man, it ever comes
at his own will, and not at the will of Man, but in a Croſs to
it, even his will who ſpeaks, and his who is ſpoken to, the <hi>Spirit</hi>
blows as well when as where it liſts, and the Man that is born
after the <hi>fleſh</hi> may hear the ſound thereof, but cannot tell
whence it comes, nor whether it goes, nor what his being, nor
way, nor time, nor ſeaſon is, who is borne after the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
therefore ever oppoſes, and contradicts him, fancying that,
which the other knows to be moſt <hi>in ſeaſon,</hi> to be moſt <hi>out of
ſeaſon,</hi> and holding the word which is to be preached, both <hi>in,</hi>
and <hi>out</hi> of ſeaſon moſt <hi>unſutable,</hi> and <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> at the time
and place, <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> if it be not ſpoken; no other time,
or place to ſpeak it in (acceptably unto God) can be found either
<hi>ſutable,</hi> or <hi>ſeaſonable:</hi> and juſt ſo no otherwiſe, (as will appear
by theſe preſents to any but the blind) was the caſe in that my
ſpeaking of it, which is here ſpoken for, and proved to be both
juſt, and warrantable: in my faithfull tendring of my ſelf to
the ſpeaking of which, as I was commanded, I am delivered
from the terror of the Lord, and the blood of theſe three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which would have been upon my head, if for either fear
<pb facs="tcp:114679:4"/>
or favour, I had rebelled againſt his ſpirit, and forborn to bear
my Teſtimony, againſt thoſe tranſgreſſions of theſe times, which
makes them perilous, and how hardly ſoever I am both judged,
and ſpoken of in the dark night of Mans day, yet in the Lords
own light, I ſee my acceptance with him, and abide in that
peace, which far paſſes all their underſtandings, that for the
truths ſake ſhall ever trouble me, and which I would not want,
for want of obeying, for all that outward peace, and proſperity
of thoſe I would have ſpoken to put together, if they be at peace
under the power of any ſin; and in the Generall day of the Lords
judgement, which is near upon them, I ſhalbe cleared to have
done nothing amiſs in that Matter, and nothing but what was
in true love, not onely to the Lord, but alſo to their ſouls, who
may probably hate me for my offering to tell them the truth:
nevertheleſs that in the mean time, <hi>truth</hi> may not bear all the
blame (as it hitherto hath done in all ages, and places) of thoſe
hurryes and ſtirs that are about it in the world, to which its no
way acceſſary as the cauſe thereof (for that Mens luſts who
hate it) but as an occaſion, I was ſince then moved of the <hi>Lord,</hi>
ſith I was not heard, to write this, one ſillable of which neither
was before, nor elſe was to have been (for ought I know) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to writing, and at my return to my own home, whether

that came unto me before; and by how much I gathered by
my firſt entertainment, that in this ſecond ſervice I ſhould be
leſs welcome, and more troubleſome to my ſelf and them, by ſo
much was I tempted by the evill one to ſay, as his ſervants out of
fleſhly fears have done before me, Lord ſend by the hand of
whom thou wilt ſend, for thy word is made ſuch a deriſion, and
reproach, that its in vain to make mention of it any more in thy
name, for they will neither hear nor receive it; thus though
the Spirit in me had a willing neſs to go, (yet a Lyon being in the
way) the fleſh was very weak and fearfull; nevertheleſs waiting
from thenceforth, with faſting on the Lord, till the day after
this ſervice, and their faſt was fully over, not without ſome
weeping and ſupplication; the Spirit of the Lord, who was
greater in me, than he that is in the world, waxed ſtronger than
either he or I, and did prevail ſo, that in the pure fear of the
Lord, wherein onely his ſecrets are ſeen, if not without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fear, yet without any further fainting for fear of any fleſhly
foes, and at the will of the Lord, which (whatever became of
me and of my houſe) I ſaw was worthy to take place againſt
mine own: I at laſt very quietly and freely gave up to go, and
ſo was with them at the time appointed, where hearing two of
their three Miniſters, and abiding with much patience, till they
had fully done, in the pure heat of my Spirit, in which the word of
the Lord, even like a fire was often kindled, ſo that my heart
waxed very hot within me at laſt (having a fit ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the ſeat of the houſes Speaker) I began to ſpeak as the
Spirit mov'd, and gave utterance to me: but (what patience
the Rulers would have had with me, had not the people been ſo
unruly as to hinder me, I know not) the multitude gave me
but little audience, for no ſooner did I cry aloud (as I was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114679:11"/>
to do) and lift up my voice like a trumpet to tell them of
their ſins and their tranſgreſſions, which in the viſions of the
Lord, I ſaw for all their faſts, if not faſted from, would be their
ruin; but I was handled after the old ſort, as at other times,
even hurled from my place, and haled up and down by ſome, and
thulched on the breaſt by others, that I might not ſpeake, and
(ſpeaking notwithſtanding in the power of the Lord all along as
I went with my face inward toward the Auditory, ſo much of
the burden that was on me, as will leave them without excuſe,
and witneſs againſt them for ever, yet (whether they will hear

Lords ſervants for their obedience unto him, and declaring the
truth when he had ſent them in love, their very ſouls that do
hate them, have before this attended ſome other Parochiall faſts
in ſome other places: which rude doings of the people then. Ile
not impute either to the Magiſtrates, or to the Miniſters that
were there (ſith in that croud, if they would, they could not help
it) though in many places both Magiſtracy and Miniſtry,
may find cauſe in their own conſciences to condemn themſelves,
as acceſſary to the ſufferings of the Lords ſervants, by their
diſcountenancing of them in the work of the Lord, and their
connivance at theſe that do abuſe them: nor do I relate theſe

worketh care, and fear to offend, and zeal, and deſire, and

repentance which brings to a ſalvation of you from thoſe ſins
you profeſs, to repent of, is the onely true repentance that
can ſtand you in any ſtead in the ſight of God, all other will

(which I own and honour, and am far from diſſwading
any man from looking into) you may read the Right of
things, and what you ſhould, and ſhould not be and do, but
the light within is larger than that, and of further extent,
ſhewing not onely the Right, and the Law, and what we
ſhould be and do, but alſo the fact, even what we do and
are: the light, which the Scripture ſends to (as we alſo do)
it manifeſts all things, not onely that ought to be done, but
alſo that are done, and therefore evill ones come not to it,
leaſt their deeds by it ſhould be reproved, but they that do

            <p>Now therefore turn into that Law of mine written in your
hearts, ſaith the Lord, which Law if you turn away your ears
from the hearing of, your very prayers are abominable unto
me, ſaith the Lord, yea, though you make many prayers to me,
and long, and ſpread forth your hands, and howl unto me,
as you do on your faſt dayes, and in the dayes of your ordained
humiliations, whereby to make your voyce to be heard on
high, yet will I not give ear unto you, ſaith the Lord: but as
I call and cry for righteouſneſs, and purity, even within you,
and ye hear not, ſo ye ſhall call and cry to me without, and
not be heard: and though my hand be no way ſhortned
that it cannot ſave, nor my ear heavy that it cannot hear, yet
if after your faſts you enter (as you have often done) into
ſtrife and debate, and ſmite (even my people) with the fiſt
of wickedneſs, and find your own pleaſure, and do your own
works and wills, and think your own thoughts, and live ſtill
under the power of your luſts, and will not be led by my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

accept you at all, yea, my Soul ſhall even loath and abhor you,
and theſe iniquities of yours ſhall ſeparate between me and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114679:16"/>
you, and your ſins ſhall keep good things from you, even the
good things ye cry and call for: and you ſhall wait for peace,
but behold trouble for light and joy: but there ſhall be dimneſs
of anguiſh, and ye ſhall be driven more and more to darkneſs,
and ye ſhall roare like Bears, and mourn ſore like Doves,
and groap for the wall like the blind, even like them that
have no eyes, and thoſe that looke for good from you, who
are their repreſentatives, ſhall find none, their eyes ſhall fail
with looking for help from you, and even drop out before ever
deliverance ſhall come to them by you, yea, they ſhall, wait
for juſtice: but there ſhalbe more oppreſſion of them, &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
but there ſhall be nothing but a cry, becauſe he that

ye hate him that reproveth in the gate, and a man is made an

any one of you from the higheſt to the loweſt that ſhall come

<hi>Be wiſe now therefore O ye Kings, ye Rulers and Judges of the

putting a way the filth of your own Spirits, ſweeping every one
of you your own houſes firſt, even your own hearts, that they
may be fit Temples to receive the King of Glory, that he may
come into them, and ye be made holy habitations for God
through the Spirit: and caſt the beams out of your own eyes,

others that are blind, thou being blind alſo: if the blind lead

Life, elſe the counſel of all thoſe that put &amp; preſs you on to the

and Hereticks (whom yet I plead not for) and ſuch like, will

at, and not at the Lord himſelf and his Spirit, ſhall be at
your wits ends, even you that they call to for help, and they
that call to you for help ſhall both fail together, and none
ſhall help either of you, and thoſe that have miſguided you
into by-wayes, even blind and bloody ways of ſuppreſſing
Saints as Hereticks by your Civil ſword, you ſhall at laſt be
forc't to leave, and look to your ſelves, and run in holes of
the earth, to hide you from the face of the Lamb, and from
his wrath, and they ſhall be even ſmitten with ſhame and

the ways of God) upſide down, and eſteemed as the Potters
Clay: therefore kiſs the Son, turn to him, ſeek his face, ſee
him, and ſubmit to him in his own Light, walk with him in
his own way, leſt he be angry, and you periſh for ever from
the way of your own eternall peace, yea, not as one, reading
it in the Letter onely, and out of that amplyfying it to you,
or as one having it by hear-ſay onely, from thoſe that felt it,
and ſo wrote of it (for ſo many a one can tell you much of the
terribleneſs of Gods wrath, and that talk may be a bug-bear
too to terrify your hearts a while, howbeit that terrour will
wear out after a while) but as one that hath witneſſed it, and
been made in ſome meaſure to know the power of his wrath,
and feel the weight of his hand in my own conſcience, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
its black Jaws upon me of late, to the affrightment of me
for all my old ſins, and bringing me to judgement for them
(for judgement now begins, though the wicked, among

no marvail if there be ſo much trembling in the true Church,

are all they (and all they that do ſo well know it alſo) even all
they that truſt in him: moreover all ye people, and you that
are the Repreſentatives of the people, think not your faſt is

your Sermon is done (as many do who look for one day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven, and then after live as if hell it ſelf were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
looſe again upon them) but know that your buſineſs is
now to begin after you have humbled your ſelves, and are got
up from the ground, where you lay before the Lord, now are
you to live over all that good that hath been yet but talkt on;
many good and excellent things (though ſome alſo that
might not unjuſtly be excepted againſt) have been ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, and preſt upon you I acknowledge (for far be it
from me not to give every one his due) by the men that have
preached before you, this day, in my hearing, yet much more
in the words, which mans wiſdome teacheth, than in the
words which the holy Spirit teacheth, who giveth utterance
to them he ſends, yea both what and how to ſpeake even in
that hour they are to ſpeake in, nor are they ſo ſollicitous, if
they be called before Kings and Governours, to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the truth, ſo as before hand to take thought for it,
much leſs by way of preparation to pen it down, and ſo to
preach it out of notes, as is the uſual courſe of your national
men, and a courſe uſed before you at this day; I ſay many good,
things you have heard, and good words, and fair ſpeeches,
which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith they may uſe, who ſerve not God but their
own bellys, whereby to deceive the hearts of the ſimple, now
ſee that they be turned by you into good works, and let it not
ſuffice, that a ſound of words hath paſſed from their mouths,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114679:17"/>
and pierced your ears; as if there were an end of the matter,
or at leaſt as if when as private men you are come home to
your own houſes, or as Parliament men into your place of
ſitting, and have according to the common cuſtome, and their
expectation ſent them the great thanks of the Houſe, for their
great pains, then you are quit of what is required; be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
God is not ſo mocked, nor will he be put off with ſuch
ſlender ſhews and complemental ſervices (which mens Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
moſtly lyes in, while they lye in the dead and fleſhly
night of mans day, and till they come to be in the Spirit on
the Lords Day) in this hour wherein his own day is approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;
but know that for all this, if ye go on again to ſow to
the fleſh, when you are ripe in corruption, you ſhall reape
condemnation; and if the ground of your hearts ſtill brings
forth Briars and Thorns, it is nigh unto curſing, and its end
is to be burned; and if this be all the fruits of your faſtings, to
continue the ſame men you were, or rather to waxe worſe
and worſe, as ſuch ever do that grow not better by ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
(and oh how often is it ſo ſeen at this day in many, who
the more they pray to God the more they play faſt and looſe
with him, the more they harden, the more they heighten, the
more they ſtrengthen themſelves in the Devills Kingdom,
and (in their blind miſguided zeal, which tells them 'tis errour
who can't ſee wood for trees) againſt the truth, ſo as in that
zeal as <hi>Paul</hi> once did, till his eye was opened, to perſecute
the Church, for how true that was which was ſaid before you
this day (<hi>viz.</hi>) that in the turnings of the world there was a
change of men, but not of things, Ile not determine, in ſome
reſpects it may be ſo, yet ſure I am, this is as true alſo that in
the turnings of the world to God, ther's a change of things,
and not of men (unleſs it be into worſe) for though they ſhift
from forme to forme, from a darker to a clearer, and from a
ſuperſtitious to one more refined, yet themſelves remain ſome
as, and ſome more dark and ſuperſtitious in thoſe their finer
forms, and not a few, as unrefined as ever; ſtill in the ſame
manners, ſtill in their old natures, in <hi>Eſau</hi>'s, <hi>Cains</hi> and <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels</hi>
natures, murdering <hi>Abell,</hi> ſcoffing at <hi>Iſaac,</hi> hating, yea,

hunting <hi>Jacob,</hi> even from the very Prelatick party that refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
moſt immediatly from the thick fog of Romiſh falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip,
to the Presbyterian whom they perſecuted, from them
to the Independants whom they perſecuted, from them to the
Baptiſts, whom they perſecuted, and from them to the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
all which ſorts though they are mad againſt each other,
yet as to the true tremblers at the word of God, and Saints of
the Lord in ſubſtance, not ſo much in ſhew, forme nor ſhadow
and things without, they all now come againſt theſe with one
open mouth, and as <hi>Edom, Amelek, Moab, Ammon, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
Iſraels</hi> fleſhly kindred againſt him, even ſo all they that
were formerly fighting, quarrelling, and diſputing againſt
each other, now leave the battell they have among themſelves,
and even make one head againſt the Quakers, as they call
them, whom they all perſecute with lyes and revilings, and
hatreds, and hard cenſures, and all the harſh uſage, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
that poſſibly they can, ſtumbling at every ſtraw, to the
breaking of their own necks, that they find amiſs among
them, magnifying every mole-hill, even every ſmall matter,
and ſome things that they have but by hear-ſay, and ſome
things that they are miſtaken in by meer miſ-repreſentation of
them, and ſome things that are flatly falſe too, and in truth
juſt nothing, to make them, (even them among whom many
(if many, as we know many will do, prove worſe then nought)
are glorious with the glory of Chriſt upon them full of grace
and truth, which was a glory ever unſeen to the world,) as
odious as they can, even as the Divell himſelf, in the eyes one
of another: The end of all which disjointed yet joint baiters,

they hate, yet they can neither hit nor hurt, they being as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
as they are obſcure, having one life more then the world,
who may take away that of the body, can either touch, or
come neer ſo as either to live in it, or kill them out of it, hid

from the dead in their own conſciences as a witneſs for God
for ever and for ever againſt them, according to that true
and moſt plain prophecy that went before of old of theſe
times, theſe men, and this matter, 2 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 13. which who
ſo reads ſhall find it more lively now upon the Stage then
ever, and laſtly to be conſuming a while by the Spirit of his
mouth, ſpeaking now here a little, now there a little, to them
out of the mouth of Babes and ſtammerers, and at laſt to be
utterly deſtroyed by the brightneſs of his coming) now then
if theſe ſhall be ſtill the beſt fruits of your faſts, that Gods
innocent ones, his pretious ones, his anointed and holy
ones ſhall be hunted by you, as a Partridge upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and you abide ſtill under new names, and notions the
old men, in the old earthly, ſenſuall, cruell, wrathfull, and
malicious nature in enmity againſt them that are created
after Gods own Image in Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs of
truth, and are brought forth into his own divine nature;
<hi>Then hear the word of the Lord ye Rulers of</hi> Sodom, <hi>and give
eare to it ye people of</hi> Gomorrah, I will hide mine eyes from
you, ſaith the Lord, and have no reſpect to your offering,
though it ſeem to the outward eye (as <hi>Cains</hi> might do) more
gay and coſtly then that of <hi>Abell,</hi> I will ſtop my ears and
not hear your voice, though it be as the voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaith
the Lord, whilſt your hands are the rough hands of <hi>Eſau,</hi>
wherewith you cruelly and courſely handle your brethren
and oppreſs them; yea all your ſervices ſhall be but a ſmoake
in my Noſe, as a ſtink in my Noſtrills, ſaith the Lord, I will
ſpread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your ſolemn
meetings, and you ſhall be taken away with it, and howbeit
you may reforme many things as <hi>Joſiah</hi> did, in whoſe dayes
yet I raiſed up my Prophet <hi>Zephany</hi> to warn them, and
threaten them in my name to conſume them, becauſe all
things were not yet as they ſhould be, and the names of the
Chemarins with the Prieſts were continued, ſo will I bring
a conſumption upon all your earthly joy and glory, ſaith the
Lord, and curſe you and all your bleſſings, if you do my
work, even the work of Reformation negligently, and but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114679:19"/>
by the halves, even the Reformation of your own perſons,
which in the firſt place I look for from you that are the

the Reformation of the Nations, wherein ſtill they are

ſaith the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, thus ſaith the Lord, take heed what ye do
in this day; the new wine is in the cluſter, ſee that you hurt
it not, for a bleſſing is in it; there is a people gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
whom I am redeeming from among all people, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
kindreds and tongues, and taking one of a family,
two of a Tribe, and bringing unto Sion, who are asking the
way thereunto, with their faces thitherward, whom I will
lead thither with many ſupplications, and tears, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings,
as blind ones by a way they know not, in a ſtrait way,
wherein yet their feet ſhall not ſtumble, for I am a God
unto them, ſaith the Lord, by the way of the wilderneſs,
wherein yet they ſhall not be weary, nor in want, nor in
fear, nor miſcarry, nor loſe their way that wait on me, for
I will be with them to refreſh them, ſaith the Lord, with Bread
from Heaven, and water out of the Rock, and to overſhadow
them with a Cloud, and go before them in the likeneſs of a
flaming fire, ſo that they ſhall eat the ſame ſpirituall meat,
and drink the ſame ſpirituall drink, as the Fathers of old, who
drank of the ſame Rock that followed them, which Rock
was Chriſt, and ſhall paſs to their reſt under the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,

ever they are, and all people make a noyſe and roare againſt
them, like the roarings of the Sea, and as the noyſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waters, yet will I get them praiſe and ſame in every Land,
wherein they have been put to ſhame, and every tongue
that riſeth up in judgement againſt them ſhall they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
and I that ſit in Heaven will laugh at the calamity of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114679:20"/>
thoſe that hate them, and mock when their fear cometh, yea I
will have them all in deriſion, and they ſhall be as my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have been among them a very proverb of reproach, and
I will Roar upon them out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and utter my voice from
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againſt them, as a Lyon, and the Heaven and the
earth ſhall ſhake, and I will overthrow the thrones of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and deſtroy the ſtrength of all the Kingdoms of the
Heathen, and be my ſelf a wall of fire about my people for
their defence, and the hope and ſtrength of my choſen ones
in the day wherein I do this, ſaith the Lord God; yea I will
never reſt till I have made all their foes their footſtool:
and howbeit the powers of the earth are of me, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſake to me-ward are to be obeyed, and not reſiſted,
and have been obeyed and not reſiſted in things not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to my own commands, by my holy ones, that have ever
ſuffered as evill doers under them, of whom they ought to
have had praiſe, yet if that which was once mine own out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ordinance for the puniſhment of evill doers, and to be
a terrour to evill works (as Rulers are ever away when
they are as they ought to be) continue to be ſo abhominably
perverted as in the pride and ſtoutneſs of their hearts, making
their own luſts and not my light their Law, to be a terr our
unto works and ways that are truly good, I will hold my
peace now no longer, ſaith the Lord, as concerning this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
which they ſo prophanely commit, and do dayly againſt
my choſen; but will utterly ſubvert and overturn them, and
bring the Kingdoms, and Dominions, and the greatneſs of
the Kingdom under the whole Heaven into the hands of the
holy ones of the moſt high, and give unto my Son and his
Saints to raign over all the earth, and take all the Rule, and
authority and power that ſhall ſtand up againſt my Son in
his Saints, and put it down among all the reſt, as one of his
great enemies under his feet, ſaith the Lord; for though the
world take no delight in them, yet I take pleaſure in my
people, ſaith the Lord, and I will beautify my meek ones
with ſalvation, and I will put my high prayſes into their
mouth, and a two edged Sword into their hands, and they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114679:21"/>
ſhall execute vengeance upon the Heathen, and puniſhments
upon the people, and ſhal bind their Kings in Chains, and their
Nobles in fetters of Iron, and execute upon them the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that is written in my eternal decree, and unchangeable
Counſell, ſaith the Lord: this honour have all my Saints, this
is the heritage of my ſervants, ſaith the Lord, &amp; their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
and their reign their ſalvation, and redemption, and
all their dignity is of me onely; and of me onely, and not of
themſelves, ſhall they acknowledge it to be, ſaith the Lord
God Almighty, who is now doing all this his holy will, and
good pleaſure, and who is he that ſhall ever diſanull it?</p>
