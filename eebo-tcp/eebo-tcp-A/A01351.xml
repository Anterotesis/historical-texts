            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Yes, and I had a proper inuention in a ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. I tolde her, that when this childe commineth to the age of xxii. yeares, there should be great warres bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Emperour, and the Turke, and it should fall to his lot to atchiue many notable Steatagems, againste the <hi>Machometicall</hi> Emperour, by meanes wherof his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry should be aduaunced throughout all Christian Regions and especially within this Nation.

               <p>Yes mary was shee, and there beginneth the sporte.

               <p>Nay. I am not so simple but I can respecte the person, for I met with some women, that I knew loued their husbands full well, and for them I had other deuises. I will flatter some of them in their children sayinge, that as they are of amiable counteuance, and of faire feature, so there are manifest tokens in their faces of wisdome, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlynes grace and good fortune, and what Parent will not delight to heare this of their children, and for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes themselues, I haue a thousand pleasing inuentions in this head of mine.</p>

I heard one say of late, that all worne in the Courte, is not payde in the Cittie, but let the Marchaunt looke to that, and as for the poore Husbandman who toyleth for the liuinge not <note place="margin">Note this poynt.</note> onely of himselfe and his owne family, but also of the com mon wealth, findeth the coste of your brauery in his fines and rentes, but the best is, where as hee was wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitace himselfe in your kitchin, by surfeiture, now hee is moderated, and may returne from thence with a good appetite, for your Beefe is on your backe, and the rest of your wonted victuals conuerted by strange Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis into Breeches, and brauery. But as for my Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse your wife, I wil not say shee weareth in her Kirtle the poore mans Oxe, nor in her Ueluet gowne the Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowtes stocke. If these be the fruites of flattery, for <note place="margin">Vincit veritas.</note> Gods sake, sir, learne some newe trade of fresher fashion, and study the arte of Trueth, which God will prosper: for
<pb facs="tcp:20357:19"/>
Trueth in the ende shall preuayle, and so shall God bles your store and encrease, both in the fielde, and in the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, in the House and in the Barne, when brauery shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be turned to beggery, and beauty to baldenesse. And as touching your politicke practice at your first entry into <hi>Fortunes</hi> Courte, I say no more, but wish that as many as <note place="margin">All is well that endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</note> loue flatterers tales had <hi>Midas</hi> eares.

of thy secte. And now I cannot choose but declaime against all thy practises, as thou hast particularly recited them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mée. And first to begin with. Wheras thou hast ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged thy returne from grauity to knauery, from holynesse to hollownesse, from light to darkenesse, from trueth to lyinge, and from sincerity to flattery, for this thy notable apostacy, thou deseruost to bée baffolde here on earth, and to bee enstalled the Archdeacon, or rather Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuill of <hi>Plutos</hi> infernall Court.

And vnto the vngodly sayd God, how darest thou take my lawes in thy mouth wheras thou hatest to bee reformed, for when thou sawest a théefe thou consentedst vnto him, and hast layde downe thy portion among the adulterers.</p>
               <p>And also thou hast read <hi>Saint Paules</hi> rules vnto <hi>Timothi,</hi> as touching the framing of his life to his doctrine, and his workes to his wordes, that in the function of his ministery might bée found no faulte. Then wilt thou say, oh that I had so directed my life by the lyne of Gods woorde, that I might boldly and truly haue saide with our Sauior Christ, <hi>Quis ex vobis potest me arguere de peccato?</hi> But all to late shall it then bee, excepte while thou hast space thou call for <note place="margin">Man can not bleare the eyes of God.</note> grace, and without dissimulation turne vnto God, whose eyes thou canst not bleare with all thy cunning in Adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because hee is <hi>scrutator cordis,</hi> the searcher of the very hart of man and will not bee deceiued by any art of glosing wordes &amp;c. Now where as thou hast practised to bee bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred vp by the countenance of worshipfull Gentlemen, I must needes note, that many noble men &amp; gentlemen are by thee and thy sect vehemently abused. For thou hast ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb facs="tcp:20357:37"/>
thy insinuation towardes them, by meanes wherof they commit credit vnto thee, and such is thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, that whether they bee inclined to to vertue or to vice, all is one to thée: So that if they bee couetous, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioners, prowde, voluptuous or blasphemers of Gods holy name, they are not by thee rebuked, but such shall dye in their owne sinne, and their blood shalbe required at thy handes, and also (as I haue heard of thee) thou haste honest <note place="margin">Ezek. 33.</note> termes to cloke these forenamed vices. First, couetousnes is thrifte: extorcion, good husbandry: pride is clenlinesse <note place="margin">Clenly terms for filthy faultes.</note> lechery, a spurt of youth: and swearing is lustinesse &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Simony,</hi> it is but honest consideration, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou, and simple Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> with Sir W. the Weauer, and Sir <hi>T.</hi> but lately a Tinker, with <hi>

And now to conclude with thy sinister and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable practise in the Prouince of <hi>M.</hi> wherof thou sayest <note place="margin">God graunt this may bee done with speede.</note> thou art ashamed. Consider the premisses, and liue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after like an honest man (if thou canst) and that shalbe the best plaister to cure that scar, which otherwise will neuer bée healed, &amp; beeing once whole &amp; sound with continuance of that salue, thou maist then boldly shew thy face, which is, as yet so blemished, and alwaies regarde these wordes, <hi>veritas nonquerit angulos.</hi> Truth seeketh out no corners, nor searcheth for coulorable shiftes.</p>
