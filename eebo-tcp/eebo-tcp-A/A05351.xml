            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3523:7"/>To the second presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derers alleaged, in that he was not so solemnely bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, as was conuenient: it is answered, that his body was honourably enbalmed, seared, and interred bysides king Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes the v. her Graces father, and was accompanied to that place with Iustice Clarke, the Lorde of Traquar, and many other Gentlemen of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ceremonies in dede were (against her Graces wil) the fewer, bycause the most part of her Councell were Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, who could abide no cere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monies, &amp; some of them had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore interred their owne Noble parents without accustomed solemnities and ceremonies. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But it had bene no harde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for her Highnes, neyther wanted she wisedome and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3523:7"/>
if she had bene guiltie of his death, to haue cloked the same with solemne funeralles: which hath ben, &amp; is a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vsual &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in such cases.</p>
               <p>The two simple presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the Aduersaries being thus truely answered, I will now lay foorth certaine others on the other side of farre more weight, to shewe, that it was neither likely, nor almost possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that her Highnes could be consenting to that foule mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of her dere husband.</p>
               <p>First, bycause that Sexe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> generally abhorreth by nature suche horrible murder, it could not possibly be, that of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women her Highnes (who had alwaies before appeared to be of a most mude, courteous &amp; honourable nature, seeking by wonderfull clemencie &amp; mercie
<pb facs="tcp:3523:8"/>
to winne the harts of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (of whom she had before pardoned some more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once) could by any likelyhod fal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sodaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heigth of so excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertue, as she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed for through Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to the depe pit of such hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible synne and crueltie: as to murder her owne husband, a noble and goodly yong Prince whom shee so tenderly loued. For that as good men assisted with Gods grace, doo dayly rise as it were by degrees from vertue to vertue: so no man becommeth vpon the sodaine, of excellent vertuous, extreme vitious, but descendeth rather by diuers stepps from worse to worse, before he come to the hiddeous bottomme of suche vnnaturall crueltie, as vnneth a Tygre, or any other sauage
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3523:8"/>
beast would haue vsed towarde her make.</p>
               <p>Secondly if her Highnes had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> bene desirous to haue bene rid of him (wherof there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie) she had good &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meane to haue compassed that by ordinarie course of law, for the murder of her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, in whose body his dag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger was founde sticking. For though he were her Graces hus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>band, yet was he in an other respect her subiect, and vnder her lawes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly she wold not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> so much as to be diuorced from him, whervnto diuers of her Nobilitie earnestly aduised &amp; persuaded her: to whome she modestly and louingly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that she would in no wise so doo. For though he were yet yong, and somewhat loose,
<pb facs="tcp:3523:9"/>
for want of experience and stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wisedome: yet shee nothing doubted, but he would in time proue a noble, wise and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Gentleman, and that she should with her dutiful and louing behauiour toward him sone winne &amp; reduce him from those smal ouersights, which his tender mynde corrupted with euil counsel, had fallen into, whereof she sawe in him alreadie a modest mislyking, and thereby great cause to hope as she did. But that euery way how so euer he should at any time forget him selfe, yet shee would neuer wittingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit thing, whereby shee should on her part, seeme in any res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect vnmindefull of her dutie toward him, whome shee did and would hartely loue, not doubting of the like in time
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3523:9"/>
at his hande toward her.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and not impertinent to this weightie case, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the Rule of <hi>Cassius,</hi> in examinyng and consideryng, <hi>Cui bono</hi>? whiche in suche coniecturall causes may geue great light of the truth, by noting, whether parte, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser, or els the accused, were like to take moste benefit by the fact.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes could gaine nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but the heauy displeasure of God, and perpetual infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to her personne: without the hasarding whereof she had good and orderly meane, by due course of lawe, to haue bene ridde of him, had she bene so disposed. But by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patche of him in that sorte, the
<pb facs="tcp:3523:10"/>
Earle Murrey gayned first to be reuenged of him for reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from him, and disclosing to the Queene his moste traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conspiracies and vnkind practises ageynste her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: to whome the sayd Earle was for her great liberalitie &amp; bountifulnes towarde him so singulerly bound.

               <p>This is (say they) in the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al the world such a testimonie ageynst her, as there is nothing to be said vnto it.</p>

Whereof their owne letters, handes, and seales re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine witnesses voide of all suspicion.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing answered these two their chief &amp; principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to wit, of the letter &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pretensed mariage: I wi lay forth before you certeine cleare proufes and notorious testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3523:20"/>
of her innocencie of that case of the murder.</p>
               <p>First vnderstand you, that a serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Earle Bothwel being executed for the murder, confessed in the hearing of fiue thousand people and mo, that Murrey and his Complites were the principal counsailers and assisters with his master in that murder, and that so his master had tolde him: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed also to haue sene the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures, wherein the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators had bound them selues eche to other, to make away the Lorde Darley vpon the first opportunitie that might be offered.</p>
               <p>Also Iohn Hay of Tallowe, Pourie, Dugglish and Paris being al put to death, for that they were the executioners of that murder, did al and euery
<pb facs="tcp:3523:21"/>
of them seuerally at their death, protest vpon their consciences, as they hoped to be saued at the latter daie, that not onely the Queenes highnes was vtterly innocent and vnwitting of the Lord Darleys death, but that the same was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted chiefly by the counsel, inuention, and drift of the Earle Murrey, and some others, whose names I spare for iust respectes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Lord Harris, a stout, graue, &amp; faithful Noble man (who was at the first made priuy to the deuise, &amp; after vpon good causes to long to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersed in this letter) withdrew himself from any farther action or dealing in the matter, tolde an Earle yet liuing, to his face euen at the Earles owne table, <hi>nulla circuitione vsus,</hi> that the saide Earle was of counsell to

the murder of the Lorde Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</p>
               <p>And afterward at Yorke did the like openly in presence of the English Commissioners, to the face of Murrey, and of the other (whose name I will forbeare to expresse, in hope of his repentance) and there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested, that he well knewe, the Queene to be vtterly giltlesse and innocente of the matter, nobly demaunding the combat of them both in that quarrel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hauing nowe laid and raised so farfoorth the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their building, that they thought the worlde blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the mistes they had cast, would iudge they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in their doings: then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded they to open rebellion,

taking armes, and assembling people agaynst their Queene, whome they falsely charged with diuers crimes without care of their conscience, alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, the offense of God or regarde to any other honest or duetiful respect, being caried hedlong with a furious desire only to that end, wherto their restlesse ambitious heads had so longe before bended their Macheuelian practises.</p>
               <p>The Queene seeing this, assembled likewise a strong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of her faithful subiects, to represse these Rebels.

               <p>The said Earle Murrey then hauing brought his reckenings to this passe, presently without shame or farther cunctation, boldely vsurped and intruded himselfe into the gouernement of the Realme, for the whiche his ambitious and traiterous mind had so long and so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily thirsted.</p>

some order, diuers other things that went before: which when you haue redde, and aduisedly considered the same, you shall (I doubt not) easily be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to thinke, that those direct testimonies succeeding against Murrey and the rest of his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>federats, were like inough to be true, &amp; so are in dede founde to be, and daily more and more confirmed by Time the mother of Truth.

               <p>The first and original cause was the greate and exceeding ambition, which appered who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to possesse the lewd minde of the said Murrey, aspiring gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to the Croune &amp; gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of that Realme: of which his inordinate ambition if any man doubt, let him first know, that he was so far blinded ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that he was not ashamed to make open and direct sute to the Queene in the time of her first widowhood, to intaile the Croune of Scotlande to him, (though he were illegitimate and vncapeable therof) &amp; to the blood &amp; name of the Stewards, dissuading her in all he might, from all maner of mariage. Which things are wel knowen to most of the Nobilitie of that Realme. But when he saw that deuise would not take place, for that the Queene being yong, &amp; hauing no childe, desirouse (as was both natural &amp; dutiful for the quiet of the Realm) to leaue an heire of her owne bodie to reigne after her, if so it should

But the mariage being sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, before he could conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly execute that his diuelish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente, and the same (as God would haue it) being disclosed: so greate was his malice and ambition, that not being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Close therefore no longer your eies so obstinately against Gods wonderful worke. You plainely see, that whome you would spot and defame, God wil haue cleared and shewed to be guiltlesse: whome you with armed forces did imprison and restraine, God set at libertie without any other hande or meane, then of her owne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; policie: &amp; whome you her subiectes &amp; vassalles would dispossesse of a meaner king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3523:60"/>
vnto whiche shee was borne, God wil haue aduanced by strangers to a farre greater and more ample Dominion.</p>
            <p>If this much you see not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then the blindnes of heart you are entred into, and see the plaine reprobate sense, vnto which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iustice of God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered you ouer: &amp; if you see it, and wil yet persist in it, though Gods grace faile you, let yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is humaine to fall and to erre, but it is diuelish to persist and continue. It is no shame to returne from euill, but the shame is to defend euil, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to rest therein. You haue forsoth examples inough, that inuincibly do proue, that there is no time past for your reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, if you wil. For many are there yet liuing emong you, that once were parties with you, whome Gods grace and their owne honours and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms haue brought to see their error, and to refourme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same: whereby they are euery waie restored both to their Princes fauour, and to their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the iudgement of al men. Feare not therefore, nor
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3523:61"/>
forbeare not any longer to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their example, and to take that safe waie, that they haue troden before you, which is safe and assured for your selues pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, for your families &amp; suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions to come, and for your soules eternally.</p>
            <p>If you thinke the weight of your crimes to bee more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, then can easily be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: behold your Soueraignes clemencie, that singularly shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth emong and aboue al other her princely vertues, wherwith she is abundantly adorned. I nede not in this to spend many woordes, the examples thereof are so many, so fresh, and so suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently testified by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many of your selues, vpon whome she hath exercised and put in vre the lesson of the Gospel,<note place="margin">

to bee of forgeuing offenders, that doe in time duely seeke it.</p>
            <p>Neither are you ignorant, that of herself she is both grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of nature, and wise in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: by both which shee must of necessitie be induced, both har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to forgiue them that nowe hartily turne vnto her, and to see that the state of her Realme, and of her owne person also are presently suche, that as it were in dede no policie for her to doe otherwise, so may your fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and seruices now stand hee in such steade, as may iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the pardon you craue, and bind her in honour to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them for euer.</p>
            <p>If Gods holy woord (which you pretend to adore) do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly threate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a terrible reuenge to them that greue and oppresse the widdow or orphane (wer

            <p>Finally beholde, what hath
<pb facs="tcp:3523:63"/>
bene the euent and successe of al such seditious conspiracies in all times and ages before your daies. Peruse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Histories both of your owne, and of all other Countries. And if you litle esteeme the memorie of things farre past, behold the experience of these present daies. Loke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Countries and Nations neare adioyning vnto you, and you shal find, that none of them hath escaped from rebellion &amp; intestine sedition within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of your owne memories, nor that yet they are cleerly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the dregges of the same. And what hath (I praie you) ensued theron? They haue kept in dede a great stur for a time, but what haue the Authors and mouers gained thereby, other then their owne vtter ruine &amp; infamie for euer? And what is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3523:63"/>
become of that they haue stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for? When they haue long contended mutually emonge them selues, and when ech hath spilled much of others blood, and many an honest man dead in the quarrell: the matter for the moste parte remaineth as it was, and litle or nothing bring they to passe of the huge altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that thei attempt, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shal, therof assure you.</p>
            <p>For the Maiestie of God that is euer one and the same, neuer prospereth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnlauful attempts of Subiects against their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, enterprised by priuate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Let Machiauel saie what he list, &amp; beleeue him who wil: ye that are his disciples, to your owne perditions you shal find the ende as I tel you. For bysides that Diuine authoritie so promiseth it, and worldly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb facs="tcp:3523:64"/>
so teacheth it, very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son also sheweth, that it can be none otherwise. For where the foundation is faultie &amp; hollow, the more weight that is heaped and builded theron, the soner it bringeth the whole to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And what hath ben the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of al these your garboiles, oth your selues do know, the world seeth, and I haue briefly told you, as this place wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte. Whervpon to build and heape on, any more of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kind of stuffe, you shal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Al men that haue either lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wit or common sense, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering daily more and more the infinite calamities, and the very gasping death, as it were, of their whole Nation &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey

            <p>If stil you depend and hope vpon other Princes assistence: that wil but deceiue you. For as it is not vnknow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
