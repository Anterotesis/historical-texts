            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Insomuch that my principles grew authenticall, and I so famous, that had I not beene crost by those two peeuish Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, I might at the nexte Midsommer haue worne Doctor <hi>Stories</hi> cappe for a fauor. For I trauelled almost throughout all England, admired for my ingenious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie: till comming about Exceter, I began to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise my art, and drawing in a Tanner for a tame Conie, assoone as he had lost two shillings he made this replie. Sirha, although you haue a liuery on your backe, and a cognisance to countenance you withall, and beare the port of a Gentleman, yet I see you are a false knaue and a Conny-catcher, and this your companion your setter, and that before you and I part Ile proue.</p>
            <p>At these wordes Conny-catcher and Setter, I was driuen into as great a maze, as if one had dropt out of the clowds, to heare a pesant cant the wordes of art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to our trade: yet I set a good face on the matter and asked him what he ment by Cony-catching. Marry (q. he) althogh it is your practise, yet I haue for 3. pence bought a litle Pamphlet, that hath taught me to smoke such a couple of knaues as you be. When I heard him talke of smoaking, my heart waxed cold, and I began to gather into him gently. No no sir (q. he) you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not verse vpon me, this booke hath taught me to beware of cros-biting:
<pb facs="tcp:6151:3"/>
And so to be breefe he vsed me curteously, and that night causd the Constable to lodge mee in prison, &amp; the nexte morning I was carried before the Iustice, where likewise he had this cursed book of Cony catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so that hee could tel the secretes of mine art better then my selfe: whereupon after strict examination I was sent to the gaole, &amp; at the Sessions by good hap &amp; some friend that my money procured mee, I was deliuered. Assoone as I was at liberty, I got one of these bookes, &amp; began to tosse it ouer very deuoutly, wherin I found one art so perfectly anotomized, as if he had bene prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner in our facultie forty winters before: then with a deepe sigh I began to curse this <hi>R.

But see the sequel, I smoothered my sorrowe in silence, and away I trudged out of Deuonshire, &amp; went towards Cornwal, &amp; comming to a simple Ale-house to lodge, I found at a square table hard by the fire halfe a doozen countrie Farmars at cardes. The sight of these penny-fathers at play, draue me straight into a pleasant passion, to blesse fortune that had offred such sweet opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise my wits, &amp; fil my purse with crowns: for I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted all the mony they had, mine by proper interest. As thus I stood looking on them playing at cros-ruffe, one was taken reuoking, whereat the other said, what neighbour wil you play the cony-catcher with vs? no no, wee haue read the booke as wel as you. Neuer went a cup of small beare so sorowfully down an Ale-knights belly in a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty morning as that word stroke to my hart, so that for feare of trouble I was fain to try my good hap a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Setter, is to draw anie person fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to drinke with him, which person they call the conie, and their method is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the man they aime at: if a gentleman, marchant, or apprentice, the cony is the more easily caught, in that they are soone induced to plaie, and therefore I omit the circumstance which they vse in catching of them. And because the poore countrie farmer or yeoman is the mark which they most of all shoote at, who they know comes not empty to the Terme.

The coni-catchers apparelled like honest ciuel Gentlemen, or good fellowes, with a smooth face, as if butter would not melt in their mouths, after dinner when the clients are come from Westminster hall, and are at leasure to walke vp and downe Pauls, Fléet stréet, Holborne, the strond, and such common han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places, where these coos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The countrie man seeing a man so curteous he knows not, halfe in a brown studie at this strange salutation, perhaps makes him this answere: syr al our frends in the countrie are wel, thankes be to God, but truly I knowe you not, you must pardon me.

What goodman Barton, how fare all our friends about you? you are wel met, I haue the wine for you, you are welcome to towne.

Indéed syr, saith the Farmer, are you such a mans kinsman, surely syr if you had not challenged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of me, I shoulde neuer haue knowen you, I haue cleane forgotten you, but I know the good gentleman your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syn well, he is my verie good neighbor. And for his sake sayth the verser, wele drinke ere we parte, happily the man thankes him, &amp; to the wine or ale they go, then ere they part they make him a conie, and so feret claw him at cards, that they leaue him as bare of monie as an ape of a taile.

If the poore countrima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> smoke them stil, and wil not stoup vnto either of their lures: then one, either the verser, or the setter, or some of their crue, for there is a fraternitie betwixt them, steps before the cony as he goeth, &amp; lets drop twelue pence in the high way, that of force the conny must see it. The countriman spying the shilling, maketh not daintie, for <hi>quis nisi mentis inops oblatum respuit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> but stoupeth very mannerly and taketh it vp: then one of the conny catchers behind crieth halfe part, and so chalengeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they spy y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman to be of a hauing and couetous mind, then haue they a further policie to draw him on: another that knoweth the place of his abode, méeteth him and saith, sir, wel met.

Why sir saith the verser, if you wil sit down you shalbe taken vp for a quarte of wine: with al my heart saith the barnacle, what wil you play at, Primero, primo visto, Sant, one and thirtie, new cut, or what shalbe the game? Sir saith the verser I am but an ignorant man at cards, &amp; you haue them at your fingers end, ile play with you at a game that hath no deceit, called mumchance at cards, and it is thus: you shal shufle, and ile cut, you shal cal one card, and this honest yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shal cal another for me, and which of our cards comes first shal win, here you see is no deceit, and at this ile play. No truely saith the Conie, me thinkes there can be no great craft in this. Wel saith the barnacle for a pint of wine haue at you: so they play as before, fiue vp, and the verser winnes. This is hard luck saith the barnacle, and I beléeue the honest man spies some card in the bottom, therefore I will make this, alwaies to prick the
