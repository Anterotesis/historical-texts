            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HIS MANY
WAIES ENDEERED
friend Maister Robert Keysar.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, this vnfortunate child, who
in eight daies (as lately I haue
learned) was begot and borne
soone after, was by his parents
(perhaps because hee was so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
his brethren) exposed to the
wide world, who for want of
iudgement, or not vnderstanding
the priuy marke of <hi>Ironie</hi> about
it (which shewed it was no of-spring of any vulgar
braine) vtterly reiected it: so that for want of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it was euen ready to giue vp the Ghost, and was in
danger to haue bene smothered in perpetuall obliuion, if
you (out of your direct <hi>antipathy</hi> to ingratitude) had not
bene moued both to relieue and cherish it: wherein I must
needs commend both your iudgement, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and singular loue to good wits; you afterwards sent
it to mee, yet being an infant and somewhat ragged, I
haue fostred it priuately in my bosome these two yeares,
<pb facs="tcp:4772:3"/>
and now to shew, my loue returne it to you, clad in good
lasting cloaths, which scarce memory will weare out, and
able to speake for it selfe; and withall, as it telleth mee,
desirous to try his fortune in the world, where if yet it be
welcome, both father and foster-father, nurse and child,
haue their desired end. If it bee slighted or traduced, it
hopes his father will beget him a yonger brother, who
shall reuenge his quarrell, and challenge the world ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of fond and meerely literall interpretation, or illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
misprision. Perhaps it will be thought to bee of the
race of <hi>Don Quixote:</hi> we both may confidently sweare,
it is his elder aboue a yeare; and therefore may (by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his birth-right) challenge the wall of him. I doubt
not but they will meet in their aduentures, and I hope the
breaking of one staffe will make them friends; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they will conbine themselues, and trauell through
the world to seeke their aduentures. So I commit him to
his good fortune, and my selfe to your loue.</p>

               <l>The Lords and Ladies now abroad for their disport and play,</l>

company in baskets. Remember then whose cause you haue
