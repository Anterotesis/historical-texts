         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Goodneſs of God, which
inclined him to create ſo great
a number of Beings, of whoſe
Service he could have no want,
having all Perfections contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his own Nature, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to it, moved him, ever
ſince they did exiſt, to preſerve them.</p>
            <p>Among the Creatures of ſeveral Kinds and
Ranks which God brought into the World, to ſome
he gave a Capacity to diſcover his Being, and that
he was the Maker of all things, and did conſerve


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94888:5"/>
and govern them; who by conſidering the Works
of his Creation, and either viewing them ſingly,
or comparing them together, muſt diſcern Wiſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
Exact Order, Mutual Fitneſs and Subſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
one to another, every where among, them,
and thence neceſſarily conclude, that the Author of
all theſe Productions is endued with Infinite Power,
Wiſdom, and Goodneſs; and that it is moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
for them who have receiv'd ſo Noble a
Nature from him, to reverence, love, and honour
him for it.</p>
            <p>But what he did enable his Creatures to find out
by their Reaſoning Faculties, he has manifeſted
more fully to them by Revelation; as well what
concerns the Excellency of his own Nature, as what
relates to them, and their Dependency upon him.</p>
            <p>He has taught them, that he is their Sovereign
Lord, of whom they hold all, and that it is their
Duty to worſhip and praiſe him for his Loving-kindneſs;
that as he only can furniſh them with
the common Supports of Life, ſo they are to pray
to him for them; that as he will reſcue them out of
danger, ſo they ought humbly to recommend
themſelves to his Care and Protection; and after
he has made a way for their Eſcape, heartily to
return him Thanks for their Deliverance.</p>
            <p>Thus to be grateful to our Principal Benefactor,
is not only agreeable to Natural Light and Juſtice,


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94888:5"/>
but the great Law of our Religion. <hi>I will deliver
thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Text theſe Two Propoſitions are plainly
contained.</p>
            <p>(1.) That Deliverances are from God.</p>
            <p>(2.) That it is our Duty to glorify and honour
him for them.</p>
            <p>In treating of the firſt, I will ſhew (1.) That
all Deliverances are from God.</p>
            <p>(2.) That ſome are more evidently ſo, as having
the plain and viſible Marks of his Hand impreſs'd
upon them.</p>
            <p>(1.) That all Deliverances are from God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I enter upon the Proof of which, I would
premiſe (1.) That this Aſſertion does not imply,
That God will deliver us, if we do nothing our
ſelves towards obtaining our Safety; he has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that his Grace ſhall attend and promote our
honeſt Endeavours, but gives no ground to the
idle and negligent to hope for his help, who will
make no uſe of their Natural Powers derived from
him for their own Preſervation.</p>
            <p>(2.) Neither from hence does it follow, That
God will encourage men in the pains they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
take to get out of Trouble, if they do not
humbly addreſs to him for his help; <hi>The calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in the day of trouble,</hi> being the expreſs Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon which he will deliver us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94888:6"/>
(3.) Nor though men pray vehemently to God,
have they the leaſt reaſon to expect he will fetch
them out of thoſe Dangers they have run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into, by being engaged in any wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
Should Robbers, Pyrates, Murderers, Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines,
Traytors to their King and Countrey, pray
for the Succeſs of their Villany, and that they may
eſcape the Stroke of Juſtice, God would be ſo far
from granting their Petitions, that he would take
their Prayers for a new Injury and Affront, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
their Sacrifice as much as their Sin.</p>
            <p>4. Neither are theſe things to be ſo ſtrictly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
as if the wicked ſhould never eſcape out
of any danger; for they ſometimes may call upon
God, and he may have ſo much regard to their
Prayers, as to take them out of the hands of their
Enemies, who may be worſe than themſelves, to
induce them to repent, and return to him and their
Duty; they may humble themſelves before God,
and he defer the Calamity to a further time, which
he had threatned to bring preſently upon them:
Thus upon the Humiliation of <hi>Ahab,</hi> who did
evil above all that were before him, God delays
the Execution of the Judgment he had denounced
againſt his Houſe, unto the days of his Son.</p>
            <p>Moreover, very bad men ſometimes do deeds of
Charity and Mercy, and God ſuffers their few Good
Works for a ſeaſon to cover their many Evil ones,


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94888:6"/>
ſo that they are not always brought immediately
to Light and Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>God alſo may permit the Wicked to ſucceed in
their Evil Deſigns in order to correct and reform
his own People, when they truſt more in the Arm
of Fleſh, than in God their Saviour; and when
upon any loſs, or diſappointment, they grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
and ungrateful, and do not retain a due ſenſe
of his great and manifold Mercies.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Wicked often do proſper, and are
ſuffer'd to climb high, not out of kindneſs to
them, but that their fall may be the greater; and
that the Divine Vengeance may be the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
in their final overthrow.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I proceed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
That Deliverances are of ſeveral ſorts, both
with reſpect to them for whom they are wrought,
and with reſpect to the Evils from which they ſet
us free.</p>
            <p>Some are confined to ſingle Perſons, or reach
but to private Families, or Towns; and ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to whole Countreys and Nations, indeed to
all the Race of Mankind, as that Tranſcendent
Deliverance in the Redemption of the World by
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And as the Redemption
Chriſt did purchaſe for us with his Blood was the
moſt comprehenſive, taking in the whole Stock
of Men; ſo was it the moſt valuable, as reſcuing


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94888:7"/>
us from the power of Sin, which brought the
Wrath of God upon us; and from the wages of Sin,
everlaſting Puniſhment, which is the greateſt of Evils.</p>
            <p>As to ſingle Perſons, God guards their Souls
againſt the Deſigns of their ſpiritual Enemies, the
World, the Devil, the Fleſh, either by keeping
them out of the way of the Tempters, or by
enabling them to overcome their Temptations,
ſo as they ſhall not be hurt, or led captive by them.
It is alſo to the Goodneſs of God that particular
men owe the preſervation of their Health, Life,
Reputation, and Eſtates: He defends their Lives
from the malignity of Diſeaſes, from the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
of Oppreſſors, who would kill, that they
might take poſſeſſion; from the malice of their
cruel Enemies, that thirſt after their blood; and
from a vaſt number of dangerous Accidents, which
are not to be imputed either to their own folly, or
the ill will of other men.</p>
            <p>He alſo protects the Reputation of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and delivers them from the Slanders of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lips; he ſecures mens Eſtates, not only from
the Aſſaults of Robbers and Thieves, but from
the violence of Fires, Tempeſts, and Floods, and
from all other Caſualties.</p>
            <p>But though there is no Creature ſo ſmall and
inconſiderable, that God does not take care of it;
yet for the moſt part, the Acts of his Providence


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94888:7"/>
are more apparent and diſcernable in the ordering
and management of the greater portions of the
World; his hand is more viſible in the government
and diſpoſal of Countreys and Kingdoms, than of
particular Places and Families; of Kings, and
Men in Authority, than of private Perſons; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their ruin, when they turn their hearts
from the Lord their God, and give themſelves
up to commit evil; or in their Preſervation, when
they do that which is right in his eyes, and keep
the Covenants and Statutes which he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them.</p>
            <p>And it is to the extraordinary Providence of
God, that we are beholden for this joyful Occaſion
of aſſembling our ſelves together, who hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
our King from the hands of cruel and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Men, that had conſpired to Aſſaſſinate and
Murther his Sacred Perſon; and preſerved our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from an Invaſion, for which all things were
prepared and made ready by a Powerful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
with deſign to conquer our Countrey, and
to bring that Bondage and Slavery upon us, under
which his own Subjects do labour and groan.</p>
            <p>Had God, juſtly incenſed by our Iniquities, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
theſe Helliſh Plots to have taken effect
againſt the Perſon of our Dread Sovereign, and
the Land of our Nativity, it is not eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Fears, Horror, and Confuſion with


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94888:8"/>
which we ſhould have been overwhelmed; nor
the Rage and and Cruelty with which our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
would have follow'd their Blow to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a full Conqueſt, and made us compleatly
miſerable.</p>
            <p>We could with no reaſon have expected the
leaſt degree of tenderneſs, or pity from them,
who had ſo far diveſted themſelves not only of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but Humanity it ſelf, as to murther the
Father of their Countrey, under whoſe Protection
they for many years had lived ſafely; neither
ſhould we have had more ground to hope for
favour from that Prince, by whoſe Arms we were
to be invaded, who in his whole Conduct ſeems
to have greater regard to the
amplifying of his<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Who has ſuffered ſo many things to be ſaid of him, not only full of rank Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but which ſavour much of Blaſphemy; viz.</hi> Viro immortali, <hi>p.</hi> 42.

in the days of our Fathers to ſuch horrid impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
did govern theſe wretched Men in the Preſent
Plot? which in ſome reſpect does exceed that

Life of the King was to be taken away by


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94888:10"/>
Wicked Traytors at home, there was an Army
in readineſs to have made a Deſcent upon us
from abroad, ſufficient not only to deſtroy the
Lords, and the Commons, who repreſent the
People, but the People themſelves; and there
is great cauſe to think they would have made
the Sword drunk with Blood, before they had
put it up.</p>
            <p>It is moſt unaccountable how any Proteſtant
ſhould have been concern'd in it; and yet it
cannot be denied, that ſome there were of that
Religion, and Church, which abhorreth ſuch
Doctrines; they were of that Church, but had
departed from it, before they did engage in theſe
Horrible Deſigns.</p>
            <p>I ſay, it is unaccountable, ſince in the time
of the late King they wiſh reſtored, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the Laws, the Rights, and the Liberties
of the Nation, were in a manner all ſubverted;
and the King, on whoſe Power all their hopes
of reſtoring him are built, is one that cauſed all
his own Proteſtant Subjects, who would not
forſake their Religion, to be impriſoned, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht,
or put to death; by which Severities he
hath rooted them out of their Native Soil, and
left no appearance of them in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>

Is it to be thought he would treat Strangers
more tenderly than he has done his own People?
or that he would tolerate the Exerciſe of the
Reformed Religion in this Kingdom after he
had conquered it, who has extirpated it in his
own, where his Subjects had a right by Law to
enjoy it, and were not guilty of the leaſt undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Behaviour to provoke him to violate their
Rights?</p>
            <p>And here I ſhould have thought it neceſſary to
do an Act of Juſtice to our Religion, in renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and diſavowing the late Proceedings of
thoſe Clergy-men, who abſolved two Perſons that
were condemned for Treaſon, and at their
death ſhewed no tokens of Repentance for that
Deteſtable Crime, as being contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and ſcandalous to all good Chriſtians in her

far as can be in the preſent Circumſtances, by

with the hearty Concurrence of the reſt of the

            <p>Indeed a little conſideration and thought will

            <p>And theſe Notions which the Pagans had of God
did reſult form the Idea and Conception of a
Being infinitly perfect; for if God be Almighty,

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94888:14"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I proceed to ſhew that ſome Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are more evidently from God, as having the
plain and viſible Mark of his hand impreſt upon
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The glory of thoſe Deliverances more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
are to be given to God which happen to Men
without their own Wiſdom and Contrivance, and
where they had uſsed no precautions againſt them:
When at the ſame time Men arrive at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of their danger, and of their deliverance, there
can be no boaſting of their own foreſight, nor place
to praiſe the Scheme of Policy formed by themſelves.
God often ſurprizes his People with great Mercies,
of which they had not the leaſt expectation, that
they may not have ſo much as a pretence to thank
any but him for them.</p>
            <p>So our Preſervation from the late horrid Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
is not to be imputed to the Wiſdom of our
Counſels, but to the Providence of God, which ſo
awakened the Conſciences of ſome of the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
that they made a voluntary diſcovery of it.
And that which ſhould more deeply affect us with
our Eſcape, and engage us to give God greater
Thanks for it, is,<note n="*" place="margin">Ut tanta repentè mucatio non fine Deo videretur. <hi>Saluſt.</hi>
               </note> That this execrable Plot was
ripe for Execution, and the Blow ready to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
when, by his Mercy, it was detected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94888:14"/>
2. Thoſe Deliverances are to be looked on as
coming more immediately from God, which we
receive after no hope was left of flying from the
Miſchief which was imagin'd againſt us: When al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
we might foreſeee the Storm, yet we had no
power to ward againſt it, or to put it by. Tho'
we might know out danger, yet it was too big
for us, we were not able to deal with it; the little
Strength we had to defend out ſelves, bearing no
Proportion to the mighty Force of the Enemies who
intended to aſſault us: Now to be ſaved after Men
had deſpaired of a Deliverance, and when their
Adverſaries were ſecure of a Conqueſt, muſt be
owned to be the viſible Work of the Lord of
Hoſts.</p>
            <p>It is the wiſe Method of Divine Providence,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Stobae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p. 581.</note>
often to let us miſcarry in thoſe Deſigns of which
we were ſure and confident, and to bring thoſe
good things to paſs of which we had no hope;
both to convince us of our own Infirmity, and to
induce us upon all occaſions to addreſs out Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
unto him, who is able to ſave us in our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Diſtreſs. Thus his People of Old, <hi>when in the
time of their trouble they cryed unto him, he heard them
from heaven, and according to his manifold mercies, he
gave them ſaviours, who ſaved them out of the hand of
their enemies,</hi> Neh. 9. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94888:15"/>
This was our Condition before the late happy
Revolution, when much Endeavour was uſed to
ſuppreſs our Holy Religion, and to diſcountenance
thoſe who profeſt it; when our Laws, that guard
our Lives and Properties, were diſpens'd with, and
the Yoke of Popery was ready to be ty'd on our
Necks, and we ſaw no way of eſcaping, then, God,
in his Goodneſs, was pleas'd do make His preſent
Majeſty the great Inſtrument of our Preſervation.</p>
            <p>(3.) The Providence of God is very apparent in
theſe Deliverances which are brought to paſs by
the Diſappointment of our own Counſels and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
which, had they taken effect according
to our Minds, wou'd have prov'd of dangerous
conſequence to us; for ſo little do we ſee into
things, that God often ſaves us, by fruſtrating the
very Deſigns we had laid for our Preſervation.</p>
            <p>And this holds as well in the Private Concerns
of particular Men, as in the Publick Affairs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
There is hardly any good Man, but in the
Courſe of his Life, has found reaſon to thank
God, for having deny'd him the things he had moſt
ſet his Heart upon; he being ſenſible that much
of the good Circumſtances of his preſent Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is owing to his former Diſappointments: Nay,
upon due Conſideration, wiſe Men are ſatify'd,
that if they had had their Will in Matters that


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94888:15"/>
once they eagerly purſu'd, it wou'd have undone 'em.
And the joyful cauſe of our preſent Solemnity is
an eminent Inſtance of God's Mercies of this kind;
for one Branch of our Deliverance is fully due to
his Providence, which wou'd not permit us to put our
own Counſels in execution; for had our Fleet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd
the Expedition, that was according to Human
Underſtanding, prudently deſign'd, the Paſſage
wou'd have been laid open for the Army that was
in a readineſs to invade us; and there were but few
Forces left then in the Kingdom, either to have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
their Landing, or to have put a ſtop to their
Progreſs.</p>
            <p>(4.) We may manifeſtly diſcern the Hand of
God in thoſe Deliverances which proceed from
Cauſes over which we have no power. Of this
ſort are all thoſe that are produc'd by the Wind,
or the Sun, or the Rains, or the Frost, or other
remarkable Changes of Weather. Hiſtories of all
Ages do teſtifie, that the greateſt Victories both by
Land and Sea, have had their great Turn from
thoſe things that were quite out of the command
of the Mighty and the Proud, and were entirely
directed by the Wiſdom of Providence.</p>
            <p>Seafaring Men oblige themſelves to perform
their Voyages to ſuch Ports, and by ſuch times,
if the Wind and Weather favour them; that is,


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94888:16"/>
if God pleaſes. And what is expreſly contain'd in
their Contracts, is imply'd, and ought to be own'd
in all Enterprizes relating to Affairs of higheſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and under the conduct of the wiſest Men.</p>
            <p>Under the former Head of this Diſcourſe, we
conſider'd our Deliverance, as proceeding from a
Diſappointment of the Methods that were taken
for our Defence; and here we obſerve, that that
Diſappointment was caus'd by the Winds, and at
that time alſo when we apprehended they blew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, and in favour of our Enemies; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that if we had had them in our own keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and cou'd have made them move according
to our mind, we ſhou'd have been expos'd to the
utmoſt hazard of being over-run by a foreign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if we have no command over many of
thoſe Cauſes which bring of ſtop Victories, and that
contribute to the ſafety or deſtruction of Kingdoms;
and if we had any Influence, might often uſe it to
our own diſadvantage, let us look to God, from
whom comes our help; Let us adhere to him in
all the Changes of Life, to whoſe<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Iambl. de Sect. Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag.</note> Goodneſs and
Power, we muſt attribute the Beginning, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſe;
and the Accompliſhment of all our Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Deſigns; let us beg his Guidance in our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
and his Bleſſing upon them, without
which they will come to nothing; and glorifie him,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94888:16"/>
as for all his Mercies, ſo particularly for this our
Deliverance.</p>
            <p>We come now to conſider by what Actions we
ſhall glorifie God acceptably for theſe his gracious
Diſpenſations, and make ſuch Returns as will
pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>(1.) We glorifie God by a ſincere acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that he, as has been prov'd, is the Author of
our Preſervation, and that it was the Work of his
Providence that our Enemies were diſcover'd, and
put to ſhame, and that we have eſcaped out of
the Snare they had laid for us. We muſt with
thankfulneſs confeſs, that all our own Cares and
Projects wou'd not have been ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
us, had not God appear'd on our ſide; and
that with leſs Preparations our Enemies might have
deſtroy'd us, had not he fought againſt them.</p>
            <p>God is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of the
ſaints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are
round about him. In thy name ſhall they rejoyce all the
day, and in thy righteouſneſs ſhall they be exalted. For
thou art the glory of their ſtrength, in thy favour our
horn ſhall be exalted For the Lord is our defence,
and the Holy One of Iſrael is out King, Pſal. 89. 7, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>(2.) We honour God by ſtirring up in our minds
a true Senſe of the Mercies we own he has done
for us: We glorifie him when we reflect upon his


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94888:17"/>
Works with Pleaſure and Joy, and have entire ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in his adminiſtration of the Affairs of
the World; when we heartily believe his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be Wiſe and Merciful, and that the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
Diſpenſations will turn to, and end in, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his faithful Servants. There muſt be
an agreeableneſs in all the Motions and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Hearts, to the ſenſe we have of God's
kindneſs. After ſuch large Experiments of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and Care, we ought not to diſtruſt his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in any future Difficulty or Danger; and
when any unreaſonable Fear begins to lay hold
of us, we muſt endeavour to baniſh it, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on the great things he has done ſor us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>Neither ought we to repine at the Expences
which are neceſſary for the defence of our
Country, nor to murmur at Grievances which the
wiſeſt Governments have never been able wholly
to prevent; ſince how great ſoever they ſeem to
us, they bear no Compariſon with the wonderful
Mercies we have receiv'd.</p>
            <p>(3.) We glorifie God when we are not content
only with cheriſhing a ſecret Senſe of it in our
Souls, but when we teſtifie before Men what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
Kindneſs he has ſhewn to us; when we lay
hold of every opportunity to publiſh it to others,
that our Friends, our Neighbours, and all good


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94888:17"/>
People, may rejoyce together with us, and hence
be encouraged to truſt in God, and to caſt their
Care upon him.</p>
            <p>But the higheſt Teſtimony of Publick Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
is, to aſſemble our ſelves in the Houſe of
God, and with united Hearts and Lips, to ſet forth
his Praiſe. And if we do bring Minds fill'd with
Love and Gladneſs, our Chriſtian Sacrifice will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
up into Heaven with a ſweet ſavour, ſuch
as God will graciouſly receive: And the Angels,
who ſhew ſo much Joy at the Converſion of
Sinners, will be much more delighted with the
Triumphs of the Saints, in aſcribing Glory to
God.</p>
            <p>(4.) We glorifie God by endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in our Memories theſe Deliverances of his,
whereof at preſent we have ſo lively a Senſe: So
that neither Buſineſs nor Pleaſure, nor length of
Time, may wear them out of our Minds. It will
paſs for a true Mark of the Honour we have for
God, that his Favours have made ſo deep an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
in us, as will laſt all the Days of our
Life: And when alſo we convey the Hiſtory of
them down to our Poſterity, and afford them
Matter of Thanks to render to him for the
glorious Works of his Providence done not only
in their own time, but in the Days of their
Fathers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:94888:18"/>
               <hi>Thus</hi> what the people of Iſrael had heard, or known,
or their fathers had told them, they were bound not to
hide from their children, but to ſhew to the generations
to come, the praiſes of the Lord; and his ſtrength, and
his wonderful works that he had done, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to come might know them, even the children which
ſhould be born; who ſhould ariſe and declare them to
their children; that they might ſet their hope in God,
and not forget the works of God, but keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<hi>Pſal. 78. v. 3—7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(5.) We glorifie God by our humble Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that we did not deſerve the great and many
Deliverances he has wrought for us; but that
they were wholly due to his infinite Goodneſs,
Such a ſincere Acknowledgment cuts off all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Right to his Mercy; and the more we
exclude our own Merit, the higher we exalt God's
free Grace. And ſurely it much enhances the
Kindneſs manifeſted in our preſent Eſcape, that
God has ſnatch'd us, an ungrateful People, from
the Brink of Ruin, who are ſo far from having
any Claim to his Favours, as having ſerved him
better than others, that we muſt aſcribe it to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodneſs and Mercy, that the open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs,
avowed Irreligion, monſtrous Unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſo many amongſt us, have not yet provoked
him to give us up, not only to our Luſts, but to
the Fury of our bitter and implacable Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:94888:18"/>
(6.) We glorifie God by letting the Mercies he has
beſtow'd on our Country incline us to Love and
Charity, and to be reconciled to one another. It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to imitate the Examples of thoſe we have in
the higheſt eſteem; and if we really honour God in
our Souls, we ſhall ſtrive to do like him in all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
wherein Creatures can copy after their Creator.
By forgiveneſs of Injuries, by healing of Breaches,
and renewing of Friendſhips, we do that good to
one another, which God has extended to us all, and
make our Behaviour much to reſemble his.</p>
            <p>No courſe like this, will fix and continue his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
among us, and encreaſe our ſtrength to reſiſt
our Enemies. As nothing will more diſcourage and
ruine the deſigns of wicked Men againſt us, than
the firm Union of our Minds, and Affections, ſo
nothing has given ſo much life to their hopes of
making an eaſie Prey of us, as our Diviſions. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then the extraordinary care God has had of us,
ſhould diſpoſe us to lay aſide all private Animoſities,
and Self-ends, and heartily to join together in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of the public Good.</p>
            <p>We cannot but be ſenſible how much our King
and our Kingdom have been under the peculiar
Care of God. How oſten has God preserved his
Majeſty's Life, not only in the day of Battle from
open Enemies, but from the execrable Conſpiracies
of bloody Men, who would ſecretly have murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94888:19"/>
him? The very Winds that now detained our
Ships for the neceſſary guard of our Coaſts, did
not long ſince lock up the Fleet of our Enemies,
when they had framed a deſign to burn ours in
the Harbour, and to cover the Deſcent they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make upon us.</p>
            <p>And will not now every private Man thank God
heartily on this Day for his ineſtimable Mercies, when
by his Thankfulneſs, he will not only <hi>workout his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
but effectually contribute to the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Happineſs of the Country where he lives ?
Shall we not praiſe God with all our Soul, when the
ſo doing will not only purchaſe us a Reward in
the other World, but is attended with preſent Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
and is the way alone to ſecure to our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God's Aſſiſtance and Protection in future times?
To render Thanks to the Lord for his loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
will give Cheerfulneſs to our Spirits, when
things have an ill Aſpect; Courage to our Hearts,
and Strength to our Hands in the greateſt danger;
and tho' all Men, Pagans as well as Chriſtians are
convinced that there can be no acceſſion to<note n="*" place="margin">Veterum ſanctiſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum hominum exempla ſecutus: Illi enim, quod ali<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> menta, patriam, lucem, ſe devi<expan>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94888:19"/>

            <p>And things being ſo, ſhall we not think our ſelves

to contribute what we can to maintain that
Cauſe, which God has been pleaſed to make ſo
much his own ? Should we not be all ready to join
our Heads, our Hearts, our Hands, our Affections
and utmoſt Endeavours to ſerve his Majeſty for our
own Preſervation ? Should we not above all things
every one do his Part, when God has been graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
pleaſed, as it were without our asking, to ſhew
himſelf on our ſide, now to engage him to continue
with us? which is impoſſible otherwiſe to be hoped
for, than by promoting a general Reformation.</p>
            <p>Which if any one is yet to begin, that has any
Generoſity in him, from whence ſhall he chuſe to
date it, rather than from ſuch a day as this, a day
when we are to thank God for ſuch extraordinary,
ſuch wonderful Deliverances, as we have not ſeen
the like given to any other People, the common
Deliverance of our King and our Nation, of our
Bodies and our Souls; and not only of our ſelves,
but of our Poſterity. Surely whoſoever has any
ſenſe of Gratitude moving in him, cannot but feel
it move powerfully in his Heart at this time, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God, as he demands it in our Text, <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

Now to join our Prayers together with our Thankſgivings,
<hi>May God be graciouſly pleaſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the King's Perſon, which has been ſo often expoſed

guarded againſt ſo many Swords, and ſo many Bullets,
in the Field, and in the Frenches; never to be taken off
by Poiſon; or fall by the vile Hand of any barbarous
Aſſaſſine; may all his People Love and Serve him;
and may he long live to defend the Eſtabliſh'd
Church, the Laws and Rights of theſe Realms; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

World, upon good and laſting Foundations: And in the
end, for all his Righteous Labours, may he receive a
Crown of Glory.</hi>
