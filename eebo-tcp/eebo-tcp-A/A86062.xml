            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THat thou may'ſt profit by thy hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or reading of Sermons: There is a neceſſity of more Paſtors and Teachers, to open and apply the Word, than one: Thou muſt act the part of a Paſtor and Teacher unto thy ſelf, and thine own Soul. The Miniſters Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation without thine own, will be to little or no purpoſe. When there is the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Word to the heart by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; and the Application of the heart to the Word preached, by ſerious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; when (I ſay) both theſe meet and ſtrike one upon the other, there will, by the help of the ſpirit, (who is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to promote his work) be ſome ſire ſtruck, and a kindling of ſome good things in our
<pb facs="tcp:152658:3"/>
Souls towards the Lord our God; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on theſe things, ſaith the Apoſtle, that thy profiting may appear. Reader, if thou wouldſt meditate well on this plain Sermon, and ponder with thy Heart and Soul on theſe plain truths that are here laid down; thou wouldſt doubtleſs find them to be bleſſed for thy Spiritual and Eternal advantage: but without this, all will prove but empty words, and the whole Diſcourſe, but as ſo much water ſpilt upon the ground. This Sermon was calculated for a plain Countrey Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory; ſuch as it is, I mean rude, rough and unpoliſht as it is, I let it go: Being importuned by the earneſt deſires of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons, eſpecially thoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the preaching of it, to ſend it forth. And indeed, to tell you the truth, if I had never ſo many poliſhed ſhafts in
<pb facs="tcp:152658:3"/>
my Quiver (as I have none) I ſhould not care to draw them out in my Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al work: being convinced in my Soul and Conſcience, that there is very little work done for God or Mens Souls this way. I don't at all affect to tickle means ears with pleaſing Eloquence, or to humour their fancies: Though the flaſhy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of our Age (whoſe Religion lies all in their fancies, memories or minds, for there is little or nothing of it in their hearts) like nothing elſe; I am ſure that God in the Scripture doth not labour to pleaſe mens ears, nor to adorn his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a curious garment of words; but repreſents the matter it ſelf to the Souls of men, as that which is worthy of all acceptation. The things of God need no humane Eloquence to commend them: Painting ſpoils Native Beauty,
<pb facs="tcp:152658:4"/>
and external Ornaments would disfigure ſome things that are of themſelves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned and Lovely. It's that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which the world counts fooliſh, and which men being vain in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ready to deſpiſe; that is made mighty through God for the caſting down the Devils Kingdom, and the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the Kingdom of Chriſt in the Souls of men. If God would pleaſe to bleſs theſe plain things for the good of any poor Souls, then I ſhould eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all the exceptions of the Curious, and ſlight all the cavils of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. That the Lord may water theſe Seeds with his Bleſſing, ſhall be my Prayer.</p>

            <p>THIS Text was bequeathed unto me and you (as I may ſay) by the laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Deceaſed <hi>Friend,</hi> both mine and yours; which the Lord can make more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to us, than thouſands of Gold and Silver: And I am ſure it was the earneſt deſire of her that left it, that it might be bleſt to us all for our everlaſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt verſe</hi> of the Pſalm, the ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> lays down a Conſolatory Propoſition for the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, to cheer up and refreſh their Souls withal in their darkeſt and moſt cloudy ſeaſons of trouble and affliction<hi>—Truly God is good to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>even to ſuch as are of a clean heart:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, though God may ſeem by his Providence to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ways of men, and the worſt in the view and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152658:5"/>
judgment of ſenſe may ſeem to proſper moſt, and the beſt be of all men the moſt miſerable; yet for all this, I am ſure that this is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, <hi>That God is good to his</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and will do them good.</hi> Then to come near to the Text, he tells us that <hi>God will guide them,</hi> v. 24. <hi>by his counſel, and hereafter will receive them to his glory.</hi> He ſpeaks indeed in the <hi>ſingular number</hi> as of himſelf, but you are to underſtand him in what he ſays, as perſonating all the People of God: Therefore it muſt needs be well with the People of God here, ſince Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth guide and direct them; and it ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go well with them hereafter, ſince Infinite Glory then ſhall crown them: Which bleſſed Eſtate the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt eſteemed above all that this world can afford, becauſe God in that eſtate will be all in all, in the faith, hope, and expectation of the enjoyment of him for ever, knowing that in him he ſhall inherit all things, he incourages and comforts his Soul in his preſent troubles; <hi>verſe</hi> 25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And what is there upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee?</hi> The words, you ſee, are an Interrogation, which here hath the force of a Negation: Thus, there is nothing, Lord, in my Judgment, either in Heaven above, or on the Earth beneath, that is of any real worth and value to me, or affords any comfort to my Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thy ſelf. Now the doctrinal Obſervation which I ſhall draw from hence is this,</p>
            <q>Doct. <hi>That God is the All of a gracious and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Other things to him are but as Cyphers, that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing, are but as ſhadows, which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152658:5"/>
in ſhew, but nothing in ſubſtance; the things that the men of the world court and adore, the Trinity which the world doth worſhip, which are earthly pelf, ſleſhly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and airy honour, <note place="margin">Haec tria pro trino numine mundus habet</note> are nothing, leſs than nothing, and vanity in compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pariſon to him, unto ſuch a Soul. Take this in two or three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This gracious Soul ſees all things in God: I am God All-ſuſſicient,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and I ſee thou art ſo, ſaith this Soul to God. In thy breaſts are all things (as the Hebrew word imports) out of which we may draw, and ſuck every thing that we need, either for the vile Body, or the precious Soul; he ſees by an Eye of Faith, and the Viſion of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned mind, that all things are in God <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, eminently, virtually, ſuperlatively;</hi> according to what we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>He that overcomes ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God.</hi> The carnal heart makes nothing of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 4. He is not in all his thoughts; God is not worth his thinking of; he Idolizes God, as if he were <hi>nothing in the world,</hi> and he Deifies the Creature, making that a God: He ſees nothing in him, no excellency at all why he ſhould deſire him; He prefers the dung and droſs of the world before him, and is a lover of theſe things more than God; theſe broken Ciſterns that hold no water, he prefers before the Fountain of living waters. But the gracious Soul ſees all things in him, and that all things which we can deſire <hi>are not to be compared to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:152658:6"/>
2. <hi>He accounts nothing miſery but to be ſeparated from God.</hi> There is no ſorrow, ſaith this Soul, to this ſorrow; all other ſorrows laid in the ballance he ſinds but light. He had rather chuſe to beg with God, than to reign without him: He had rather die with God, that is, in the Arms of his Mercy, and in the Boſom of his Love, than live without him, in the affluence and confluence of all creature comforts, enjoyments and delights. <hi>Hîc ure hîc ſeca,</hi> ſaith this Soul, Burn me Lord, wound me, rend and tear me with the <hi>Briers and Thorns</hi> of the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous afflictions, for this do I chuſe, and this is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more eligible unto me, with the enjoyment of thy ſelf, than to live without God in the world, in the Sun-ſhine of all its favours, and to bathe my ſelf all my days in the River of its pleaſures and delights. Much rather would this Soul be with <hi>Job</hi> upon the Dung-hill, groaning under the burden of all his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; or with <hi>Lazarus</hi> at the Rich man's door, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all over with Sores and Ulcers from the crown of the head to the ſoles of his feet, than to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God.</p>
            <p>But you may ſay, Are not theſe things miſeries? Surely they are; for a Poor creature to have no ſoundneſs in his fleſh, and to have no reſt in his bones, to be chaſtned with pains, to be feeding on Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and drinking the waters of Gall all the day, and all the night long to be pinched with Poverty, to lie upon the wrack of continual pains, to be always under griefs and groans; are not theſe miſeries?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, they are <hi>mala &amp; miſeriae in ſe,</hi> but not <hi>ad hominem iſtum;</hi> I mean, that they are evils and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152658:6"/>
miſeries in themſelves, and ſo they are to all others, but not to that man that hath the Lord for his God: Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2. <hi>We glory in tribulations, having peace with God:</hi> Tribulations are to us no tribulations; all our maladies are now turned into medicines, our croſſes into comforts; all theſe things ſhall work together for our good. God's People ſhall gather Grapes of all their Thorns, and Figs of all their Thiſtles: All their bitter Waters of <hi>Marah</hi> ſhall be turned into ſweet Wine unto them: God will comfort them in all their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, for he will not leave them comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, <note place="margin">John 10. 18.</note> but will come unto them: The fruit of all ſhall be the taking away their ſin, and the making them partakers of his holineſs: When they fall into the Waters of Affliction, it's that they may be waſhed there; when they fall into the Fire of Tribulation, it is, that they may be purged there: With theſe God <hi>proves them that he may do them good in the latter end:</hi> All ſhall work for the increaſing their Grace, and preparing them for Glory, and the adding more weight of Glory to their Eternal Crown. Theſe are <hi>reſtraints</hi> to them from doing evil; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Spurs</hi> to them, to provoke and excite them to good. In a word, there is no evil befals any one that hath an intereſt in God, but what ſhall be turned to a far greater good, than that is an evil; therefore under all, they ſhould with <hi>Habakkuk, joy in the Lord, and rejoyce in the God of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He accounts nothing bleſſedneſs and happineſs but to be united to him;</hi> to be one with him, and to live

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152658:9"/>
that <hi>can ſeparate between him and his God;</hi> and that can make a partition wall between him and his great All. He fears ſin more than ſuffering, and will chuſe it rather than iniquity; becauſe ſuffering doth not ſeparate between the Soul and God. He fears ſin more than poverty, than ſickneſs, than death it ſelf, for none of theſe can ſeparate between the Soul and God. He knows what is expreſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 35, &amp;c. <hi>That tribulation, diſtreſs, perſecution, famine, nakedneſs, peril or ſword; neither height nor depth, death or life,</hi> i. e.

Sin is againſt God, ſuffering is only afflictive to the Creature. It's ſin only that cauſes God to hide his Face from us, and to ſet his Face againſt us.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

Servant following two Gentlemen, but unto which of theſe the Servant belongs, we can't tell, until they part aſunder, and then the Servant will go with the one, and leave the other.

               <p>Every one of theſe is a <hi>Well of Salvation,</hi> out of which with the Bucket of Faith, we may draw out abundance of the Waters of Conſolation to chear our Hearts withal in our greateſt troubles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God is the Believers ſtrength:</hi> From God he hath ſtrength, 1. <hi>To bear his burdens.</hi> Alas! with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſtrength of God, we ſhould faint in the day of adverſity, becauſe our <hi>ſtrength is ſmall:</hi> God puts underneath his everlaſting arms, and enables them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152658:15"/>
to bear: He ſtrengthens them with <hi>all might by his Spirit in the inward man;</hi> and helps to undergo the miſeries, infirmities and burdens, that are upon the outward man, therefore by Faith we ſhould caſt all our burdens upon him, for he hath promiſed to <hi>ſuſtain us, Pſal.</hi> 55. 22. He will give us ſhoulders ſuitable to our burdens, or elſe ſuite our burdens to our ſhoulders.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From God he hath ſtrength to do his Duties:</hi> As he gives <hi>ſhoulders</hi> for every burden, he hath for us to bear, ſo he gives <hi>hands</hi> for every piece of work he hath for us to do: Alas! Without him we can do nothing, as the Hand can do nothing without the Head, the Body can do nothing without the Soul; no more can we do, without the ſtrength of God: Therefore where ever there is a command that finds us work, there is always a ſuitable promiſe to find us ſtrength: <hi>I will cauſe you</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>to walk in my ways, my grace ſhall be made ſufficient for you:</hi> God doth not deal with us as the <hi>Egyptian Taskmaſters</hi> did with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who required Brick, but would give them no Straw: God doth not require Duty and Service of us, and leave us to get ſtrength to do it, where we can; no, but is pleaſed <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> to <hi>promiſe,</hi> that he will <hi>give</hi> what he doth <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> and that his <hi>Spirit ſhall help our infirmities,</hi> and that he will ſtrengthen us unto the performance of every good work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>From God he hath ſtrength to overcome his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</hi> Were it not for the power of God reſting on them, and working in them, theſe Sons of <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:152658:16"/>
would be too hard for them; theſe mighty <hi>Philiſtines</hi> would certainly vanquiſh and overcome them. Therefore he goes out againſt them in the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did againſt that <hi>Philiſtine Giant,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 45 knowing, that in his own ſtrength he cannot prevail; therefore he begs of God to teach his <hi>hands to war,</hi> and to ſtrengthen his <hi>fingers to fight,</hi> that he may be avenged on the Enemies of God, and of his Soul, and be made more than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour in and through the ſtrength and power of Chriſt Jeſus: It's from the Spirit and ſtrength of Chriſt, that any Soul is enabled to mortifie the deeds of the fleſh; without this ſtrength, inſtead of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying our luſts, our luſts, to be ſure, would morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, and lead us captive as it were bound hands and and feet, and triumph over us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>In God is his ſtrength to ſtand it out againſt, to reſiſt and to overcome Satan's Temptations.</hi> The Tempter is ſtrong, and we are weak; he did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Man when he had no ſin, and gave him a ſad fall; even then, when he was in the <hi>rectitude</hi> of his Nature, when there was nothing within to take the Tempter's part: But now he hath much more power over us, becauſe we have a party within us, that upon every occaſion and temptation, is ready to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us,</hi> and to deliver us up unto him. So that if we be not kept by the <hi>power of God through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, unto ſalvation,</hi> we ſhall undoubtedly come ſhort of the Kingdom of God: We have not only <hi>fleſh and blood, but principalities and powers</hi> to wreſtle withal. How ſhall we quench the fiery Darts of the Devil? How ſhall we reſiſt his ſtrong Temptations, when
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152658:16"/>
we are weak <hi>as Water,</hi> if we be not <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> and be not ſtrengthned <hi>by the hand of the mighty God of</hi> Jacob? But God tells us, that we have more with us, than we have againſt us, though the <hi>Gates of Hell,</hi> and all the Power and Policy of that Kingdom of Darkneſs be engaged againſt us. He hath aſſured us that he will be with us, and ſtrengthen us, and that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt us.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>How they came to have this goodly Portion,</hi> and to be inſtated in ſuch an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> which is <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, undeſiled, and that fadeth not away.</hi> For anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Negatively, 1. <hi>They were not born to it.</hi> Some among men are born to great Portions, and large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances; theſe are their birth-right, and <hi>intailed</hi> upon them as being the <hi>lawful Heirs</hi> of ſuch and ſuch perſons: But the Lord knows, that we are all baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, becauſe born in ſin: <hi>Our Father was an Amorite, and our Mother an Hittite;</hi> and ſo we are become an accurſed generation, and are Heirs of nothing but Wrath and Hell: We did no ſooner <hi>live,</hi> but we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152658:18"/>
deſerved <hi>to die;</hi> and no ſooner did we ſee the <hi>Light,</hi> but we deſerved that God ſhould give us our Portion among Devils and damned ones, in the Kingdom of <hi>Darkneſs:</hi> In the Womb we were like the <hi>Cockatrice Egg,</hi> fill'd with deadly Poyſon, and ſince we came thence, we have been like the <hi>troubled Sea,</hi> caſting forth myre, filth and dirt. As we are <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> if God ſhould pay us our Portion that belongs unto us, it would undo us for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They did not get this Portion by their own induſtry, labour and diligence.</hi> Sometimes among men the diligent hand makes rich; and perſons born to nothing come to acquire great things, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for themſelves large Revenues. But ſo it is not here; this Portion was not acquired by us in this way. Alas! what were we able to do in order to this, whoſe hearts are deceitful and deſperately wicked above all things? as God, who knows us infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we know our ſelves, witneſſeth of us. We have nothing within us to principle any one good action: If the Tree be bad, ſo muſt the Fruit of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be. If we would attain to this of our ſelves, we muſt firſt pay the debt which we owe to Juſtice for our ſin; and then we muſt perform that ſinleſs and unſpotted obedience which the Law demands. Both which all the men on Earth, and I may add, all the Saints and Angels in Heaven, are not able to do. Thus negatively.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And Poſitively. <hi>We are born again to it,</hi> by the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten us again unto a lively hope by the Reſurrection</hi>

                  <hi>a man to whom God hath given Riches, Wealth, and Honour, ſo that he wanteth nothing for his Soul of all that he deſireth; yet he hath not power to eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> By reaſon of inordinate Love, diſtruſtful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the incumbrances of earthly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they hinder themſelves of the injoyment of what they have; and ſo they are Poor in the midſt of their Riches, and Beggars in the midſt of their Abundance. There is as it were a <hi>Spell</hi> ſet upon their Eſtates, ſo that their <hi>Wealth</hi> ſays to them, Touch not, taſt not, handle not. They are like the Dog in the wheel, that toils all the day to Roaſt meat for others eating. Truly many of Gods own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple live exceedingly below their allowance, they live, as if they had nothing, were worth nothing, when they have a rich Portion; they have it, but they do not uſe it: What comfort, what joy, what peace which paſſeth all underſtanding, might they find in it, if they would live <hi>by Faith</hi> upon it?</p>

Oh get this portion! I told you before, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152658:19"/>
it is not procured by our indeavour, we can't pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it by all that we are able to do; but this is procured by another; there is a near Kinſman of ours, that hath redeemed this morgaged or loſt Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is, Jeſus Chriſt; the right of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did belong to him, and he hath done the part of a Kinſman for us. Now if we will come to him as poor, miſerable and undone Creatures, and take this Inheritance thankfully out of his hands; if we will receive it, in his right, and ſubmit to his terms, which are as reaſonable as can be deſired; then this Inheritance is our own, and God will become our Portion again. Oh, get this Portion, or you get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; get this Portion, and you get all; this Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will make you happy in Life and Death.</p>
               <p>If God be your Portion, if your Poſſeſſions are lower he will heighten the Fruition: He can croud in abundance of <hi>comfort</hi> in <hi>a little</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He can make a ſingle Diſh out-vye a Feaſt, and the meaneſt fare, ſuppoſe a Dinner of green Herbs, to be ſweeter and better than a ſtalled Ox. With God a ſmall Stock, will be more comfortable and ſatisfying than a large Revenue. Or if he ſuſſer us to be bereaved of all, he himſelf will be inſtead of all. He hath taken to himſelf the names of all things needful and comfortable, to intimate to us, that he alone ſtands for all they ſignify or are worth. Therefore he is called a Portion, an Inheritance, an Habitation, high Tower, Shade, Strength, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, Friend, Father, Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To let us know that all theſe are nothing without him, and that he can be all without theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Oh then, make ſure of this portion: and he will be your God in Life, in Death, and after Death to all Eternity.

By the ſight of his eye, he had ſeen an end of many humane perfections; and by the ſight of his mind he had ſeen an end of them all; ſome he had ſeen already ending, and he ſaw of neceſſity that all muſt end. But the Godly man hath an everlaſting Portion, a Portion that ſhall ſurvive all the Viciſſitudes, and changes of time: <hi>in fatal period</hi> ſhall ever come to put an end to their injoyment of this Portion, to denude or rob them of this precious treaſure.</p>
