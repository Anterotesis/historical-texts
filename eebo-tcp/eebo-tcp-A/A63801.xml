            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Monthly Observations,</hi> For the preserving of HEALTH, &amp;c.</head>
            <p n="1">1. OBserving the multitudes of <hi>Distempers</hi> and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing <hi>Diseases</hi> People bring upon themselves for want of a due regard to proper <hi>Foods</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> hastning <hi>Death</hi> by the <hi>Errors of their Lives,</hi> and digging their <hi>Graves</hi> with their own <hi>Teeth;</hi> I thought it might be no <hi>worthless Service</hi> to present the Publick with a few homely Notes and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not that I would invade the Learned <hi>Physicians</hi> Province, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35354:5"/>
whom it appertains to prescribe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et for particular Persons according to each ones Constitution, Exercise and Disease, that he may happen to labour under, or be inclinable unto; but that which I aim at is, only to lay down some <hi>General</hi> Rules and Animadversions, which well practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed would render most Persons Lives abundantly more <hi>Comfortable</hi> then now they are, and conduce not a little to the prolonging of their Days.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis strange that any that boast themselves Rational Creatures, and pretend to wear <hi>Brains</hi> in their Skulls, should be so inquisitive after, and affected with remote matters, that nothing concerns them, spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precious time in <hi>Tales</hi> and <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> Smoaking <hi>Tobaco,</hi> Drinking and finding their Neighbours <hi>Faults</hi> out, and a Thousand other Impertinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whilst' at the same time they neglect matters that highly imports
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35354:5"/>
their own <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Healths,</hi> the nearest Concern (next that of their <hi>Soul)</hi> which all wise People will, and those that are otherwise ought to regard.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis evident that as <hi>States</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by Importation and Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so our <hi>Bodies</hi> by Aliment or Food received, and gross Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or insenciable Transpirations, which carry off those Drugs and Fumes that remain after Nature (the best Chymist) has separated the pure nourishing Particles of what was Eat or Drunk, from what therein is Impure, Useless, and consequently Prejudicial.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence it follows, that as the only end of Eating and Drinking is but to furnish or <hi>Replenish Nature,</hi> under her continual Expences, with apt materials to suport our Bodies, in a due healthful Posture, such as may render them fitest Instruments for our Souls to exert their noble
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35354:6"/>
Functions by; so if we ingurge too much Food or Liquor in quantity, more then can be regularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, or such as is Inimical to our Natures or particular Constitutions in <hi>quallity,</hi> either of th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se must needs disturb the Harmony and mutual Traffick which ought to be in the <hi>Microcosm</hi> (or Little World, the Humane Body) whence will follow <hi>Crudities, Obstructions,</hi> dark <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Vapours,</hi> and a whole Troop of <hi>cruel Diseases,</hi> brought up in the Rear by that Meager, but resistless King of Terrors, <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. This being obvious to every Bodies Reason and Sences, one would think there should need no great pains be taken to perswade People to be kind to themselves and not violate their Healths; and accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their Deaths by immoderate feeding, especially on Meats <hi>Improper</hi> or <hi>Pernicious;</hi> but such is the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany of <hi>Custom;</hi> such the Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35354:6"/>
of <hi>ill Examples;</hi> so powerful the Thorns of <hi>a debauched Pallet;</hi> and so gross the <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or obstinate <hi>Folly</hi> of the greater part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that no Remonstrances of <hi>Reason,</hi> no Tortures of <hi>Diseases,</hi> neither the Fear of <hi>God,</hi> who injoyns us Temperance, and to subdue or keep under (not <hi>pamper)</hi> our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor respect to our own wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, nor the Terrors of <hi>Death</hi> it self, can restrain them from their dear Excess; so that if things were rigorously Examined, unless the plea of <hi>non compas mentis</hi> shall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Inquest, most of our <hi>Graves</hi> might have Stakes drove into them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And tho the <hi>Beastly</hi> (and yet why Beastly, some Beasts are not naturally inclinable to it, but by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, rather therefore the <hi>Odious)</hi> Sin <hi>Drunkenness</hi> be deplorable, rife &amp; frequent amongst us, yet I dare say her <hi>demurer Sister Gluttony</hi> destroys an Hundred Persons to her One, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35354:7"/>
therefore ought the more strictly to be watch against. But my Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not <hi>Satyre,</hi> yet I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to premise thus much to Rouz People, if possible, out of their Stupidity, that they may hearken to the Voice of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinate from the paths of <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Moderation,</hi> which is the first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept towards the attaining Health both of Body and Mind.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Such therefore as would be Wise, ought to beware of all those things which their irregular Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites too earnestly desire and pursue, and upon which they cannot Feed without being afterwards convinced that they were grateful to them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their <hi>Hurt,</hi> of this sort are all Costly, Compounded, Luscious, Meats and Strong Drinks; therefore frequent use of <hi>Flesh,</hi> and such <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,</hi> must be Hurtful rather then Beneficial to Health; of which this may be a very good Argument, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:35354:7"/>
Since Health is undoubtedly <hi>best preserved</hi> by those <hi>means</hi> which must naturally <hi>restore</hi> it when Lost; therefore since <hi>Abstinance</hi> from Flesh and strong Liquors, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prescribed by the Learned in most Diseases, the Consequence then to conserve Health must be a <hi>spare, thin, clean Diet,</hi> and no <hi>Flesh,</hi> for Temperance and Cleanness in quantity and quality of Meats and Drinks not only make People Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but Ready, Vivacious and Quick in the discharge of all the Actions necessary to Life, and conserves the Mind in Serenity, Accuteness and Vigour, and all the Offices of the Body in a due Tone, Strength and Agillity. But on the contrary, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance</hi> and <hi>Superfluity</hi> beclouds the Mind, dulls the edge of the Apprehension, and brings upon it an <hi>unmanly Languor,</hi> bearing down all the noble Faculties of the Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ignorance and Stupidity, and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35354:8"/>
Body it renders Diseased, Feeble, Unactive and Burdensome, and what great matters can be expected from the Imtemperate; whose Members are Oppressed, Joynts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled, Sinews Relaxed, and Brains Beclouded with Fumes and Vapors, and all by reason of their Eating and Drinking strong Drinks and rich compounded Foods to Excess.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But to approach somewhat nearer our present Subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In those Months of <hi>March, April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> all People, both Young and Old ought in a especial manner to consider the Crudities, Obstructions, Coughs and Stopages the Winter, and the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Foods and Drinks then used, may have caused by the Humidity of the Air, Closeness of the Season, want of the warming and sweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Sun; and especially the free and frequent feeding on Fat Gross Succulent Foods and Strong Drinks, that have Wounded so deep,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35354:8"/>
that the best of Medicines prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, and the rather, because the same course of Life &amp; Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is continued, as was the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Disease; therefore these following Rules will be of great use, not only to prevent Diseases, but also to make those Distempers more tollerable and easie to be cured that have invaded Nature already.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Of the Opperation of strong Drink, Wine and Spirits on such People as are Naturally apt to be Fat, and subject to Stoppages and Coughs, and how pernicious such Drinks will prove to most People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that find themselves naturally subject to Diseases of the Breast, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Fatness or Flegmatick Gross Humors, as <hi>Coughs, Stoppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> and <hi>Narrowness of the Passages,</hi> whose Bodies are apt to be Swell'd, and puffed up with <hi>Phlegm</hi> and <hi>evil Iuces;</hi> all such People, I say, ought to be very moderate in the quantity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35354:9"/>
they take of strong spirituous Drinks; for the frequent use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of does mightily increase the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention Diseases, and indeed that Constitution is rare, that it does not hurt, for these Liquors so highly prepared by Art, not by Nature, and by the several Artificial Operations, the spirituous parts are made <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> by which means the Stomach and natural Heat or separative Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hath nothing to do when such Drinks are poured into the Vessels, the Work being done to their Hand, so that the spirituous parts do with a quick &amp; powerful motion penetrate, and force their way through all parts of the Body, and dry up that fine, sweetning, cooling, moist Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, or Radical Humidity; by which means the pure Spirits become thick, and as it were suffocated, and hindered in their free Egress and Regress, as is also the Circulation of the Blood, that <hi>Chariot</hi> wherein
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35354:9"/>
the Life of Nature Rides, and if once stopt, the whole must needs fall into great Disorders; and on the other side, the Gross, Sharp, Keen, Astringent Juces and Particles of such strong Drinks do by their weight force their way downwards into the Passages, as into Uiriters and Bowels; but before they pass away they do for the most part occasion some signal Evil in the Body, if they find any matter or quality there capable to be wrought on, whence many times proceed <hi>Fluxes, Griping Pains, Gravel Stone,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inconveniences, according to each Mans Constitution; so that it does not only weaken all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Stomach; but (which is worst of all) the common drinking thereof does powerfully contract the Breast and Vessels thereof, because they separate so soon, and pass away, whereby it makes Nature <hi>Idle,</hi> which is an Infirmity not to be removed by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35354:10"/>
Medicines, but only by regular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and proper Meats, Drinks and Exercise, which are great supports to the Health and good Condition of Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All gross <hi>succulent</hi> Foods do deprave Nature, and increase Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Obstructions. For <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish</hi> are Foods not only Gross, and liable to Corruption, but in their own Natures are Moist, Cold and Flegmatick, and therefore they generate in the Body, not only the <hi>Diseases,</hi> and promote the <hi>Passions</hi> the Creature was sub<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'Tis also to be noted that Rich Compounded Foods, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use of strong Drink do not only Generate Compounded. Diseases, but put nature as it were on a fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if it were in a <hi>Feavor;</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35354:12"/>
troubled with <hi>Fumes</hi> and other <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,</hi> which do also show that the Passages and Vessels of the Stomach, are not only narrow, but many Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Obstructions, that the windy substance, that is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generated, are occasioned; which does rarely happen to Persons that have strong natural Heats, in whom the Passages and Vessels of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach are large enough for all sorts of Humours, both Good and Bad, to pass in and out, and circulate free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from one part to another, which renders all such Persons Healthful, Active and Lively.</p>
            <p>'Tis also to be known that the <hi>Radix,</hi> or true cause of the Diseases, called <hi>Vapours, and Fainting or Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Fits,</hi> is the forementioned Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in Meats, Drinks and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, which will better appear if we consider what sort of People, <hi>viz. Women</hi> are most subject to such Diseases; for we generally find
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35354:12"/>
them to be not only naturally of tender weak Spirits, small Vessels, narrow Passages, and but weak Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions; but such whose Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bringing up has been <hi>Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly Nice,</hi> and <hi>Irregular;</hi> such as Live Easily, Fare Deliciously, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Labour or proper Exercise; such as scarce can get themselves Drest before Dinner, and snort out more then half their Life in soft and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm Beds, which course cannot but contract the Vessels, and mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infeeble all parts of the Body; so that then the Blood <hi>(Natures Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samick Fountain)</hi> is thickened, their Spirits dull and impure, and each part sympathizing in the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief on every petty Accident, as <hi>Love, Hate, Fear, Anger, Grief, &amp;c.</hi> the Spirits being so debilitated are I resently Wounded, and all the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liports of Nature Swells, or seems to be Closed, which hinders Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration and Breathing, and then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35354:13"/>
in a moments time they fall into <hi>wild agonous Fits,</hi> and all the parts tremble and are disordered; which Diseases Country Women of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, that live on mean simple Foods and small Drink, are very rarely afflicted with; but when I consider how Impurdently most People Live, what Disorders they commit, how Hetrogenious their Foods and Drinks are, together with the many other idle Habits and secret Wounds they give Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Nature, by visiting too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Shades of Venus,</hi> which quickly makes the strongest Nerves to Bow, and is the chief Cause and Original of most <hi>Consumptions,</hi> especially in the <hi>Males.</hi> I say, when we consider all this we need not wonder at the multitude of Tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Diseases abroad in the World; but rather admire People are so Well and Healthful as they appear to be. What an <hi>Hodg-potch</hi> do most that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35354:13"/>
have Abilities make in their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, which must wonderfully oppress and distract Nature: For if you should take <hi>Flesh</hi> of various sorts, <hi>Fish</hi> of as many, <hi>Cabbages, Parsnops, Turnops, Potatoes, Must<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Butter, Cheese,</hi> a <hi>Pudden</hi> that contains more then ten several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredents, <hi>Tarts, Sweet-meats, Cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and add to these <hi>Churries, Plums, Currans, Apples, Capers, Olives, Anchovies, Mangoes, Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are, &amp;c.</hi> and jumble them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one <hi>Mass,</hi> what Eye would not loath, what Stomach not abhor such a <hi>Gallemaufry?</hi> yet this is done every Day, and counted <hi>Gallent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</hi> To teach this mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Art <hi>Books</hi> are Written, and to practise it <hi>French Cooks</hi> are Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if we had not natural Folly and Vanity enough at home, but must learn it <hi>by Art,</hi> and from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations; in the mean time how is poor Nature Captivated?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35354:14"/>
how doth she Groan in a Language, severely to be felt, tho not heard? Therefore if you would avoid those Torturing Diseases and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, observe the following <hi>Rules;</hi> always remember, that most Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are contracted through Excess and inordinate Living, nor does any thing preserve the Body in Health, or the Mind in perfect Freedom, so much as <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Temperance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let not a little Trouble, thwarting your unruly Appetites, or fond Humours, depraved with ill Customs and Wantonness, divert you from getting your selves possest of this Jewel <hi>Temperance,</hi> that true <hi>Phylosophers-Stone,</hi> which turns all into the <hi>Golden Elixir</hi> of <hi>Health, Content</hi> and <hi>Serenity;</hi> since we see none of the little perishing Goods of this World are to be had or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without Trouble and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:35354:14"/>
2. Neither Meats nor Drinks are to be taken that are too strong for each Mans particular Nature or Constitution, which for the most part are such as are compounded of many Ingredients of contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; but let Nature always be stronger then the Food, which will be sure to prevent <hi>Surfeits,</hi> and a Thousand other Inconveniences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As you are not to accustom your selves to the frequent eating of Foods that are <hi>over Fat,</hi> for the Reasons aforesaid; so neither ought you at any time to Eat or Drink of any thing whatsoever <hi>to Dulness,</hi> especially if compounded with rich Ingredients; for the same will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly sow the Seeds of Grievous Diseases: Therefore if any healthy Person feel himself oppressed after Meat, he ought to consider the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof, and thenceforth make abatement in the quantity, or alter the quality; do not most People
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35354:15"/>
find themselves before Eating and Drinking Quick, Lightsome and full of Spirits, provided they have not fasted too long? but after their Meales (because they make them Immoderate) they are generally sensible of a cloging Heaviness and dull Indisposition, which is a certain <hi>Index,</hi> that the necessity and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of Nature is exceeded either in quantity or quality, since the true intention of Food is to Refresh and Support Nature, and not to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and Incommode her.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But the greatest Snare in Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking (and therefore the <hi>Psalmist</hi> teaches us to pray, <hi>That our Tables may not be our Snare)</hi> is when Meats and Drinks are not Simple but Compounded, whereby the liquorish pleasures of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late is prolonged many degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the necessities of Nature, and indeed beyond the concoctive abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Stomach, whence many
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35354:15"/>
People over-charge <hi>This,</hi> whilst wantonly they gratifie <hi>That,</hi> and so heap up Crudities, Noxious Juces, Torturing Diseases, and in the end Death it self.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Moderate <hi>Fasting</hi> is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means to preserve both the Body and Mind in Health and Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for it cleanseth the Stomach by digesting and removing the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions that lie in the Passages, and also purifie the Blood; and then how sweet, how agreeable is every mean wholsome thing to the well prepared Stomach? such sober Persons feel and taste the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant opperation of the divine hand in all things, their Bodies are delight ed with that which is Natural, Clean and Innocent, their Minds satisfied, their Beds easie, their Sleep Sound; they are not subject to dull Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, nor molested with Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, nor are their Stomachs or Bowels oppressed with Fainting
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35354:16"/>
Fits, or Windy Griping Humours; they rise as Early, and no less Fresh then the Morning <hi>Sun,</hi> Blyth and Merry as the <hi>Lark,</hi> and are fit for all Exercise, either of the Body or the Mind; their radical moysture flowes freely through every part, like a pleasant gale of Wind over the Sun-parcht Mountains, which moderate the central Fires, that they burn not violently: In a word, proper Fasting is the best <hi>Physician,</hi> &amp; preserves Health far beyond their Evacuations, it has an accult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the digestive faculty and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat is never Idle; therefore when the Stomach and Vessels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are not filled with superfluity of Food, and often Eatings and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it draws away all the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous matter that furs and stops the Passages, and which otherwise is apt to cause Coughs and shortness of Breathing, and sends troublesome Fumes and Vapours into the Crown.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:35354:16"/>
6. Therefore be careful that you do not Eat or Drink between Meals; or before the former Foods and Drinks be perfectly Concocted; nothing more obstructs Nature and hurts the Blood, keeping the Body as it were in a continual Feavour, for the fresh Juces of those too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent supplies of Foods and Drink do obstruct the Passages and dulls the Spirits, that they cannot pass freely in their due order and circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whence Windiness and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities are generated, which is the principal cause of the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispositions many People are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Foods ill dressed destroys Health, especially <hi>Flesh,</hi> whilst some will wantonly eat it half Raw, and all Bloody, which looks Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; and others will have it so over-prepared that no good Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be drawn from it, both which doth generate bad Blood, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35354:17"/>
cause a lumpish heaviness to possess the whole Body, because the lively, brisk, aiery, fine Spirit in such Foods is destroyed in the Preparation.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Meats and Drinks ought not to be taken together, that are of a <hi>contrary Nature</hi> in themselves, or disagreeable to any Mans particular Constitution, because such Foods do secretly, yet powerfully, wound simple Nature with many Diseases and Infirmities before she is aware, or can arm her self against their Assaults; but let them be simple in their kind, agreeable to the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and as near as may be equal in their parts, which will breed good Blood, and pure brisk Spirits, and they always make the Body Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and Agile.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Forbear the frequent eating of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish</hi> without distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and regard had to the Season, and to their Cleanness or Unclaen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at that time, and to the manner
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35354:17"/>
of their being killed after they are taken, whether it be a Wound which may cause the free Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the original Properties of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> which is seldom done, especially in <hi>Fish</hi> and <hi>Fowles,</hi> but the same are for the most part Suffocated or Strangled, or Die them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, whereby the pure Spirits and sweet Vertues (by the Agony the poor Creatures are at the departure of their dear Lives) are fixt or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; for the orginal Venoms in which al Life consists, are then so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly agitated that they immediately suffocate and swallow up the pure Spirits and sweet Oyle, if there be not a Wound made whereby those raging Poysons may freely pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the vehicle of the Blood; for this reason, experience shews that all Flesh, as of <hi>Fowles</hi> or <hi>Fish,</hi> or the like, that are Strangled will not eat so Sweet and Pleasent as others that have a Wound made
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35354:18"/>
and Bleed plentifully, but will have a stronger and grosser Taste and Smell, nor will it breed so good Blood or Nourishment as the other, but the best of them is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that of Vegatations, which are more easily and more friendly obtained.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Let your ordinary Drinks be mild and friendly to Nature, neither Strong, Stale, Hard, or Sour, nor yet too new, nor such as most of the small or nine Shilling Beer is, that is Brewed in <hi>London, viz.</hi> that runs off those Grains that the strong Ale and Beer has drawn forth all the sweet Qualities and good Vertues, and there remains only a Sharp, Sour, Astringent, Stinking Quality behind, which the hot Water or Liquour extracts; and then to give it a Taste, they Boyle it Lustily with the <hi>Hops</hi> that have been boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several hours in the strong Beer, which have drawn forth all whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35354:18"/>
qualities, and there are no better Vertues Extracted from them then the Water or Liquor did from the Graines, and tho they do put some Ale amongst this small Beer, to help it, or to hide the ill Taste or Qualities; but when such Drinks come into the Stomach those Sharp Sour, Stinking Properties cannot be hid from Nature, nor their pernicious opperations, the frequent use of such Drinks do hurt the Blood, and Generate the Scurvy, and many other Diseases that are breed by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and unnatural Drinks, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially taken in too great quanties; for it not only heats the Blood, when strong; but it keeps it as it were in a continual firment, precipitating People into <hi>Feavors, Dropsies, Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping pangs of the Bowels;</hi> and it also contracts the Vessels of the Stomach and Passages, dulling the Appetite, by weakening the Natural heat, as woofull experience doth daily
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35354:19"/>
testifie to the great ruin of the Body, Soul, Estate, and Reputation, and many times Starving a Wife and poor innocent Children.</p>
            <p>Of all Drinks, <hi>Water</hi> hath the first place, even as <hi>Bread</hi> of Foods, the Creator of all beeings having endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Element with many secret and admirable Vertues, it being pure and clean in its own Nature, and the chiefe thing by which all Exterial things are Purified, Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Cleansed; and tho <hi>Weak as Water</hi> be a vulgar Proverb, yet I must tell you, that Water is more strong &amp; sublime then most imagin, for it contains a most Ravishing and Excellent Spirituous Balsamick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whence proceeds that pure, sweet refreshing quality, whereby it hath power by its innate <hi>Vertue</hi> to digest and purifie all sorts of Foods. Likewise in Preparations it is so innocent and friendly that it dissipates the gross flegmatick Bodies,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35354:19"/>
and preserves and keeps living the more essential spiritous parts, it is not only the most plentiful and truly pleasant of all Drinks, but supplies with its friendly Moysture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves Thirst beyond all other Liquors or Juces; it is simple and endued with such equallity, that it insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates its Virtues into all parts of the Body in an insensible way, it makes no noise, nor causes any Tumults in the Brain, nor awakens any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equallity in the Body, but imparts its meek Life as it were in Silence, and may deserve the Name of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> a thing that God and his Hand-Maid Nature have befriended with all the united Vertues both in the Vegitable and Animal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, it being the Radix of all moist Nourishment, which mixt or incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated with any kind of Juces ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them fit and profitable for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>The best and most agreeable sorts
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35354:20"/>
of Water for common use and Drinking are <hi>Rain, River</hi> and <hi>Spring,</hi> but especially the two first, because they are not only impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the sweet Influences of the Celestials and airry motions of the Elements; but their running through and upon the Surface of the Earth, does thereby draw forth a saline Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a mild opening Quality, which renders it more Homogenial then <hi>Pump-Water,</hi> or such as stand without motion; and altho it be our custom to drink <hi>Beer, Ale, Wine,</hi> and other strong Liquors, yet it would be very beneficial and Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to most People to accustom themselves to the drinking of a Pint, or half a Pint at Night, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going to Bed, and likewise in the Morning; it is good to cool, wash and refresh Nature; it is also good for some Complexions to drink after Meals, especially for those that are subject to Fumes and Vapours,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35354:20"/>
if Bread be tosted hard and put into it, letting it stand a quarter of an hour, and then drunk off, there being no sort of Drink made by Art so friendly and capable to digest and cleanse the Passages from Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Water, and I am confident, if People use themselves every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drink half a Pint, a Pint, or a Quart of good Water (such as each Person shall find most agreeable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Waters have various oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on several Constitutions) they would find as much Benefit, if not more, then by going to the various Wells so much cried up for their Vertues.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Bad Air</hi> does further and increase all Distempers, for that being an Element, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Suck and Feed on, when it is corrupt conveys unwho some fumes into the Body impairs the Longs, those Bellows of Life; and infects the whole Mass of Blood;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35354:21"/>
therefore proper and good Airs are of great benefit to Health; I say <hi>Proper</hi> as well as <hi>Good;</hi> for every sort of Air, tho in its self good, is not healthfull, for some People; because there is as great a variety Air, as there is in Complexions, and what is profitable for one, is not so for an other, and to find out this Secret, there is no better way then for such as want agreable Air to Travel out of one place into an other, by which they may be capable to find out that which is most sutable for them, for as in the best Airs some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Languish under various Diseases, for want of a change, so in the worst of Airs many are very Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and perhaps better then they would be in finer or thinner Airs, as many that Live in the thick Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherous steems of <hi>London,</hi> are very Healthy; and Live to great Ages: And as every bad Air is not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to all Persons, so on the other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35354:21"/>
side all good Airs are not profitable to some sorts of Constitutions; but change of Airs to most People proves beneficial. And therefore Travelling is very Healthful and good, especially for some People, whose qualifying Properties and Spirits of Nature are unequal; but this not being known, many remove out of one Air into an other in vain, or to their Prejudice.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Forget not to use proper <hi>Exercises</hi> in open Airy places which will prevent many Diseases and Weaknesses, especially in Fat, Corpulent, Phlegmatick Persons, that are for the most part troubled with <hi>Coughs,</hi> and <hi>Stoppages of their Breasts and Lungs.</hi> Let such walk as much as they can by running Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers two or three hours Morning and Night, for the Air by such run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Water is more penetrating, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating and digesting all superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then elsewhere; nor are there
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35354:22"/>
any Persons more Strong, Healthly or of better Stomachs then those whose Imployments are near Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Streams, especially if the Banks and Ground adjacent be dry and somewhat elevated, as in many places it is. Let the fattest Punchenelloes but use to exercise themselves as aforesaid, and eat clean Foods, with middle Ale or Bear, and once or twice a day drink a good draft of Water, especially Morning and Night, and it will in a little time level their Mountainous Paunches, and waste all superfluous offending matter, so great is the power of clean, simple, natural Meats, Drinks, Exercises and Airs.</p>
            <p n="13">13. When you eat any sorts of strong Fat Foods, as <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cheese, Bread</hi> and <hi>Butter; Pudden, Pancake,</hi> or any solid Foods, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Flesh,</hi> remember that you eat <hi>Herbs</hi> with them, simply without either <hi>Salt, Vinegar</hi> or <hi>Oyl,</hi> only
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35354:22"/>
wash them, <hi>viz. Parsly, Sorrel, Spinage, Sage, Corn-Salet,</hi> the Leaves of young <hi>Colworts,</hi> you may mix two or three sorts together, or any one of them, they mightily cleanse and help Concoction, warm the Stomach, and cheer the Spirits much better then if you put <hi>Oyl, Salt</hi> and <hi>Vineger</hi> to them, a little custom will render them pleasant and delightful.</p>
            <p>Of which clean simple Foods we come now to Discourse of more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and since those that are <hi>Liquid,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Spoon-meats,</hi> are chiefly to be regarded, I shall here set down such of them as are most proper for the <hi>Spring-Season, viz.</hi> in the Months <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> of all Liquid Clensing Foods or Spoon-meats <hi>Water-Gruel</hi> deservedly claims the first place, and is without doubt the best of all others, either simple or compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any particular Herb or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35354:23"/>

much Boyling of <hi>Pottages,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Gruels</hi> made of <hi>Flowre,</hi> does in a manner destroy all the wholsome, cleansing, opening, cooling, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating Vertues; because it too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently opens the Body of the water, and sends the fine spirits flying to <hi>Iapan,</hi> or else suffocates them, for this Reason, Water once boyled, and then put into a Vessel, and kept, will Stink, and never be sweet nor good for any use afterwards, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Water that has never been at the fire, being put into a like Vessel, will indeed stink, as well as the other, but then it will recover its self, and be sweet again afterwards, and as good as ever; this shews, that in boyling, Water loses its fine Spirituous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative quality, nor does the boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing less impair the lively vertues of the <hi>Flowre;</hi> therefore we conclude it not fit nor convenient to boyl <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> or <hi>Gruels</hi> after the common manner such being good neither for

               <p>There are many other brave wholsome foods (far better then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>Fish)</hi> to be eat in the <hi>Spring,</hi> as <hi>Sallads,</hi> both Boyled and Raw; this being the principal time of the Year for the eating of <hi>Herbs, viz.</hi> in the Month of <hi>March April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> for by the Approach of the Sun, and the sweet Influences he now scatters through our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere, all the vegitations are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with lively and powerful ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, more then at any other time of the Year, and it would be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of English people, if they did eat more of them, and less <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish,</hi> nor is it to be doubted, but the first Instituters of <hi>Lent</hi> might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

Fountain of central heat in all things) has a powerful Influence, and gives a lively motion to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable thereof, so that if we will but put to our helping Hand, and observe the good Rules of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Cleanness and Order in Meats, Drinks and Exercises, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Evils and Diseases may by the blessing of the Lord be avoided.</p>
               <p>The Foods most proper for this season are the Gruels and spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats before mentioned, with Bread Butter and Cheese, but the two fast ought to be eaten sparingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are Fat Strong Bodies, too great quantities thereof may do injury to many Constitutions.</p>

if they will incorporate with those hard substances as is most manifest, how much more must they be imbib'd by soft Beds, where People lye long, Warm and Sweating, and where the Air cannot come with its refreshing Influences, to cleanse &amp; purifie those grosser Excrements, the Vehicles (or Lodging) of malignant Spirits, that are continually breathed forth by infirm Persons, and of all others <hi>Feather-Beds</hi> are more dispossed to entertain and welcome such unclean fulsome Vapours; therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all People, especially such as are Young, to be careful who they lye with, or after, all Diseases being catching at one time or other; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over hot, soft <hi>Feather Beds</hi> are for the most part in themselves. Unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, because they keep the Body too hot, and infeeble the Loyns; whereas hard clean Beds, <hi>viz. Quilts,</hi> or <hi>Straw,</hi> or <hi>Flock-Beds</hi> (but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Straw)</hi> are much more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable as to Health.</p>

2. The principal Cause that so many <hi>Children,</hi> especially <hi>Young Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of this Nation, are deformed by crooked and disorderly growing, is, <hi>1st,</hi> By reason of their hard Swathing in their Infancy, for who ever saw a <hi>Black</hi> (who use no such binding) Crooked. <hi>2dly,</hi> This is encreased when they grow up by the tyrany of foolish pernicious Fashons, over strait Lacings, hard Bodies and stiff Stays (invented only for Mischief, and the consumption of <hi>Whale-Bone)</hi> all which their weak Bones and tender Nerves cannot endure without great prejudice; besides it straitens the Breast and the Vessels of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and lays Foundations for <hi>Asthmas, Phtysicks, shortness of Breath, Green sickness,</hi> and forty other <hi>Malla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. 3dly,</hi> When they come to be about six or seven Years old, they are generally put to <hi>sowing</hi> or <hi>working</hi> of <hi>Samplers,</hi> as they call it, where
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35354:49"/>
most of them are kept by an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Impertinent Mistriss, as hard to it, as if they were to get their Bread before they eat it, five, six, seven or eight hours in a Day, are they there keep sitting in a mopish still Posture, with their Heads downwards, leaning on their Breasts, and all their Limbs crumpled up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most like a <hi>Hedge-Hoggs.</hi> This makes many of them dull, Sleepy and Heavy all their Life after, by that base, early contracted Habit; others to ease themselves lolling or leaning on one side, hold their Necks awry, get a trick of lifting up one Shoulder half a Story higher then the other, and a Thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ridiculous Postures, which by time becomes natural, and then the <hi>Swing</hi> is thought of, and the <hi>Steel-Bodices</hi> sent for, which certainly concludes the Work, &amp; renders their Crookedness yet worse, and indeed altogether incurable; whereas, had
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35354:49"/>
these Children been Educated with change of Imployments or Learning, <hi>viz.</hi> one hour, or an hour and an half to <hi>Sew,</hi> the <hi>next</hi> to <hi>Read,</hi> or <hi>Write,</hi> or learn <hi>Languages;</hi> after that to play on the <hi>Musick, Sing</hi> or <hi>Paint,</hi> to go in a handsom Posture, their Schooling would not only be much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and delightsome to them, but they would be more Airy, Brisk and Healthy, and learn more in one hour, then they do in several Days by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept thus dully to one thing so long day after day, as it were stupifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there Sences, procuring many other Diseases, besides <hi>Crookedness</hi> which is always accompanied with many other inconveniences, which all careful prudent Mothers ought to consider, and study to prevent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The best Exercises that I have observed against <hi>Consumptions, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Breath,</hi> and all kind of <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of the Stomach and Breast</hi> are those that most Imploy the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35354:50"/>
                  <hi>Arms,</hi> and open the <hi>Chest;</hi> therefore for Women to rub Tables for one hour every Morning tell they sweat would not be amiss; for Men any sort of Labour on the Water, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially Rowing in Boats with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men, does effectually open and remove all Impediments &amp; Diseases of the Brest and Stomach, at once it strengthens the Muscles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the Passages, or if any find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves inclinable to it, the Exercise of Shooting at Butts, in a long Bow is very commendable, such Exercises have cured many Consumptive Asth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical People, when they have been given over by the <hi>Doctors,</hi> for as the walking in proper Airs gets a good Appetite so the drawing the Bow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Breast and removes Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</p>
               <p>But I have already exceeded the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits I proposed to my self in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: Those that shall observe the Rules herein laid down of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35354:50"/>
choice of Diet &amp; due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will, I am more then confident, find great benefit thereby; therefore I shall not Trouble my self to make any Apology to any, who having their Eyes blinded by the Dust of Custom, and Tradition, may be apt to condemn or flight these Advices as useless <hi>Chymeras;</hi> sure I am what I have deliver'd is agreeable to undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised Nature, and whosoever shall Act accordingly will find the benefit, but without practice all precepts are vain, or at least fruitless; unless it be to remain as Monuments to reproach those conceited Fools that dispise and neglect them. What I have here candidly, and in a simple plain fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner delivered, I leave to Gods Blessing and the practice of all prudent Lovers of their Health, and humble Followers of Nature in her easie and Innocent Methods.</p>
