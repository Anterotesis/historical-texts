            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N THE</hi> borders of <hi>Bresse</hi> not farre from <hi>Burgundie,</hi> there is a Towne of greate antiquitie called <hi>Colonie,</hi> with a castle adioyning thereto, sometime of verie greate strengthe, in respect whereof, in the time of our forefathers, it was called in the vulgar tongue, the fortresse, that is to say the bulwarke or defence of all the countrey about it. The <hi>Lordes</hi> of that towne and castle, were after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed maner of their auncetors, called the <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Colonie,</hi> but afterward the name was corrupted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> &amp; they were called the <hi>Lordes</hi> of <hi>Colignie.</hi> It is an old opinion among the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there, and it disagreeth not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Caesars</hi> writings, that it is the same place wherein <hi>Caesar</hi> at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall with his armie in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> heard the <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> of the <hi>Burgonions</hi> &amp; <hi>Niuernoys</hi> complayning of the <hi>Svvitzers</hi> for comming into <hi>Fraunce</hi> with an armie, and for wastinge their countrey.

mount</hi> vnto this day, and the towne hard by it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cesaree.</hi> This is certeine, that the Lordes of <hi>Colignie</hi> had verie greate lands and possessions in old time in that countrie, &amp; that the Townes of <hi>Nau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tua</hi> and <hi>Mouluet</hi> and all the territories of those Cities were vnder their iurisdiction. Whereof manie other things are a record, &amp; specially the standard of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which beare the name of <hi>Colignie</hi> measures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto this day, in the Townes, villages and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors thereabouts, and are receaued from that <hi>Coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnie</hi> by the inhabitants of those partes, The armes or cognisance of the howse of <hi>Colignie,</hi> which they giue after the auncient maner of noble and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full families, is a crowned Eagle: and it is certeine that that howse had the right of souereintie, (which after the custome of antiquitie is called Royalties) so as they had power of life and death ouer the folke of their seniorie, with authority to pardon such as were condemned to die, and to coyne money stamped with the marke of the crowned Eagle, and to rayze taxes and subsidies vpon their tenaunts and fermors when neede required. Therfore according to their so great abilitie, they fownded a greate nomber of Religious howses whome they indewed with verie greate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes: among which was the Abbey of <hi>Marent,</hi> situate in the Earldome of <hi>Avvssone</hi>: the Abbeys of <hi>Momerline</hi> and <hi>Shelliom</hi> in the Countrie of <hi>Bresse</hi>: and <hi>Colignie</hi> in <hi>Burgundie,</hi> all which they indewed with like priuiledges and fraunchizes, as the house of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignie</hi> it self had: &amp; so did they also to diuers townes,

as <hi>Treffort, Iasseron, S. German, Damberie, Ambur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pounsignie</hi> whose inhabiters hold still the right giuen to them by the Lordes of <hi>Colignie,</hi> euen vnto this day.</p>
            <p>In the Abbey of <hi>Marent</hi> are certeine auncient Registers that make mencion of <hi>Hubberd</hi> of <hi>Coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnie,</hi> who in the yeere of our Lord a thousand a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and sixandfortie, accompanying the Emperour <hi>Conrade</hi> the thirde then going with a greate armie into the East to recouer <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> came home again for certaine causes, and preparing himselfe soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to returne thither, caried with him fiue Sonnes, <hi>Gvvirik, VVilliam, Hubberd, Gvvy, Dalmace,</hi> and <hi>Bernard.</hi> By the same Registers and by the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Registers of other Abbeyes, it appeareth that <hi>Gvvirik</hi> had a Sonne called <hi>Hubberd</hi> which was Lord of <hi>Colignie</hi> and <hi>Andelot,</hi> who had issue <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medey,</hi> the father of <hi>Steuen,</hi> who had issue <hi>Iohn,</hi> and he another <hi>Steuen,,</hi> and he another <hi>Iohn,</hi> of whome came <hi>Iames,</hi> and of him <hi>VVilliam</hi> which obteyned the Baronie comonly called <hi>Mount S.

            </p>
            <p>Of this <hi>VVilliam</hi> descended <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of <hi>Iohn, Iasper</hi> the father of this our <hi>Iasper.</hi> For this pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre of that noble and renowmed howse conteyninge welneare fiue hundred yeeres, is kept safe in Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and in the wrytings of the same familie. <hi>Iasper</hi> the father of this our <hi>Iasper</hi> florished vnder Kinge
<pb facs="tcp:17736:4"/>
               <hi>Frauncis</hi> the first, and had to wife <hi>Loys Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> the sister of <hi>Annas Memorancie</hi> high Cunstable of <hi>Fraunce</hi>: and because he had a howse in the Castle that standeth by the Towne of <hi>Shatilion</hi> he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lord <hi>Shatilion,</hi> by meanes whereof the same syrname is conueyed to his children and posteritie. Of this mans prowesse, <hi>Martine Bellay</hi> a valiant gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wrate the french stories of his time, giueth a notable testimonie. For in the second booke of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries, he writeth in maner to this effect.</p>
            <p>In the yeere of our Lorde 1522, the Admirall <hi>Bonniuet</hi> had taken <hi>Fontarabbie</hi> in the Marches of <hi>Spayne.</hi> But assoone as he was returned into <hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> &amp; had brought home his power with him: the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes</hi> fell too beseeging of the Towne with a great armie. By which seege when the Townsmen were brought too extreme penurie of all things, for it had continewed about twelue moonethes, and it is certein that a great nomber perished through famin for want of foode, so that the matter stoode in greate extremitie: the King hauing intelligence therof, commaunded the Marshall <hi>Shatilion</hi> too leuye an armie in all haste, and too go too the reskew of them that were beseeged. The <hi>Shatilion</hi> hauing mustered his armye, sped him thitherward in all haste. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeit when he came neere <hi>Bayon,</hi> he was taken with a sore siknesse, wherof he dyed, too the greate losse of the Realme of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> For he was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great experience in Martiall affaires, and caryed greate countenance of authoritie with him. Thus much
<pb facs="tcp:17736:4"/>
sayeth <hi>Bellay.</hi> This <hi>Iasper</hi> died in a towne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Ax</hi> the sixth of August in the yeere 1522. leauing behynd him three sonnes, <hi>Odet, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper</hi> and <hi>Frauncis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching <hi>Loyse</hi> his wyfe, this is woorthie of rememberance, that hauing led a holie lyfe, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as shee was counted an example of woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod, and was Ladie of Honour (as they terme it) too Queene <hi>Helenor</hi> wyfe of King <hi>Frauncis</hi> the first: at her death shee gaue this record of the trew and pure religion which shee had imbraced. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as shee had this saying of <hi>Dauids</hi> Psalme alwayes in her mouth, <hi>And his mercie indureth from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too generation towards them that feare him:</hi> shee warned hir eldest sonne <hi>Odet Shatilion,</hi> which was then alredye made a Cardinall, and vtterly forbade him too suffer anie sacrifyzer or massepreest too come in her presence, telling him that it was reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vntoo hir by Gods singular benefyte, bothe how shee should woorship him after a godly maner, and also how shee should depart out of the prizon of this bodie, vntoo the heauenly countrie. Shee deceassed at <hi>Paris</hi> the yeere of our Lord .1547. in the house which is now called <hi>Memorancie</hi> house. <hi>Odet</hi> the eldest of hir sonnes, was in the .xvj. yeere of his age created Cardinall, (as is sayd afore) by Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the seuenth, (who thought the noblenesse of that howse fit for the stablishment of his owne estate in <hi>Fraunce</hi>) and rewarded with very great and riche benefices by the King. By meanes wherof, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

sonne, whose name was <hi>Iasper</hi> (as I said afore) obteined the prerogatiue that was dew too the eldest sonne. This <hi>Iasper</hi> was borne the yeere of our Lord 1517. the .xvj. day of Februarie, whom for the woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull towardnesse of vertew and witte which he shewed being yet a chyld, his moother after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease of his father, cawsed too bee brought vp in ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from his tender yeeres, putting him too schoole to Master <hi>Nicolas Berald,</hi> who bare the cheef fame for lerning in those dayes through all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him moreouer too bee trayned vp in feates of armes, by the skllfullest teachers and maysters of Chiualrie that shee could get.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iasper</hi> being trayned vp in such instructions, when he came to the .xxiiii. yeere of his age, shewed woonderfull forewardnesse in the seege of <hi>Bains,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeged by King <hi>Frauncissis</hi> eldest sonne, comonly called the Dolphin. <hi>Bellay</hi> in the tenth booke of his Historie, reporteth that about the yeere of our Lord 1543, he was striken in the throte by his enemies with a pellet of lead, as he aduentured too neere the diche. The same yeere when woord was browght too the King, that the state of his affaires in <hi>Piemou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> was such, as it was lyke that they should come too a pitched feeld with their enemies, he craued leaue of him, and ryding thither in poste, gaue greate proofe of his prowesse in that battell (which is comonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the battell of <hi>Cerisoles</hi>) as the same <hi>Bellay</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the sayd tenth booke of his commentaries.

the sonne of King <hi>Frauncis,</hi> did put him in cheef authoritie. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Annas Memorancie</hi> the Uncle of <hi>Iasper,</hi> was General of the men of armes, he gaue this man the charge of the Frenche footemen: which office is in the comon language called the <hi>Colonell</hi> of the footemen. He behaued himself in such wyze in that roome, as he purchaced himself great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion for his Iustice, Ualeantnesse, and wisdome within feawe moonethes after, and got the good willes of all the people of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> For wheras erst it was growen intoo a moste wicked custome, that the souldyers myght ronne gadding euery where vnder their antsignes, and make hauocke and spoyle of all things: <hi>Iasper</hi> tyed them too streyter orders of warlyke disciplyne, therby too restreyne their ouer-licentiowse dealings, and specially too represse the libertie of their cursed swearing and blasphemie: wherthrough the seede of trew godlinesse and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion appeered alreedie in his hart. And forasmuch as those lawes or orders were verye wel lyked of all good men: shortly after, they were proclaymed by the Kings commaundement and in his name, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in the booke of the Kings lawes. About the same time the same King aduaunced him too the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is now vtterly imbaced, but at that tyme was counted a roome of greate estimation, namely too bee one of the Knyghtes of the order.</p>
            <p>At the same season there fell a grudge betweene <hi>Henrye</hi> King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and <hi>Henrye</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for the Towne of <hi>Bullen.</hi> Therfore when the
<pb facs="tcp:17736:6"/>
King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> distrusted the <hi>Inglishmen,</hi> he betoke the ordering of that Countrie, and almoste of the whole matter to the <hi>Shatilion.</hi> Uppon the receyt of which commission, he went immediatly intoo <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> whither King <hi>Henrye</hi> had sent his hoste too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seege the Towne, and by singular pollicie bwilded a forte neere the Towne, which myght bee bothe a defence too the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and a greate let too keepe the townesmen from issewing owt. That forte is yet still called the <hi>Shatilion,</hi> of the bwilders name: and it was a greate furtherance too the winning of the Towne. Therfore it was not long after, ere the <hi>Inglishmen</hi> began too treate of composition: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the making wherof was committed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Shatilion,</hi> and too his vncle <hi>Mounsyre de Rochepote.</hi> When he had dispatched these matters, he returned too the Court, and within feawe yeeres after was made Lord Admirall of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which is counted the cheefest dignitie within the Realme, bycause he hathe the cheef rule of the Sea that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vppon <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and the charge of the Kings Nauie and of all his seamen and seamatters. Also the King made him his Lieuetennant of two shyres, that is too wit of <hi>Picardie</hi> and of the Ile of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> inhonoring him furthermore with the Capteinship of the men of armes, and making him one of the Lordes of his priuie counsell.</p>
            <p>The next yeere following which was the .1554. the Emperor of <hi>Germanie Charles</hi> the fifth, &amp; <hi>Marie</hi> Queene of England ioyning their forces togither,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:6"/>
made sore and sharp warre vppon <hi>Henrye</hi> King of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> The <hi>Shatilion</hi> was chozen by the consent of all good men, as the onely man that was able to resiste so greate enemyes by his prowesse and polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Therefore the ordering of that moste sharp and terrible warre, which concerned <hi>Picardie</hi> moste of all, was committed by the Kinge to the Admirall, that he shoulde rayze a power and gouerne the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Lovvecountrie.</hi> Through the li<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>king toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the forces of so mightie enemies, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that was had of the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> who was renowmed ouer all the world, the whole realme of <hi>Fraunce</hi> was striken in greate feare, bycause the King was vtterly vnprouided both of money and of other things needeful for the mayntena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of warre, and no man dowted but that <hi>Fraunce</hi> was likely to goe presently to wrecke, consideringe the greate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of all thinges. Whereof when the Admirall had both aduertised the King, and communicated it to his freendes, he thought it best to salue the matter with somme truce. The King and his Counsell ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well of this his deuyse, committed the handling of the matter to him, and he w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in fewe dayes brought it to passe to the incredible ioye and gladnesse of all the Realme, and to his owne singular prayse for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of his countrey, bicause the condicions of the truce were both honorable and very profitable to the Realme.</p>
            <p>About the same time the <hi>Guyses</hi> of the howse of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> which made their vaunt that the kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:17736:7"/>
of <hi>Sicilie</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> belonged to them of right, and that it was wrongefully wrested from them by the <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> made the King beleue, that nowe of late yeares they had wonne the heartes of the moste part of the nobilitie of <hi>Naples,</hi> partly by liberalitie &amp; partly by fayre promises, and that by their meanes the King should haue easy enterance into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realme, so that if he would graunt them a part of his power, it would come to passe, that those kingdomes shoulde in short time be brought vnder his Dominion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any greate truble. Thus through counsell of the <hi>Guyses,,</hi> the truce that was sworne a fewe monethes before, was broken to the greate dishonour of the frenche nacion: which falsehod the Admirall tooke greeuously and sore to harte, oftentimes protestinge that such periuries had alwayes bred mischief in the end, and that God had in all ages bene a most seuere reuenger of such forswearings. To the furtherance whereof, he was compelled by the Kings commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, to fall to practises of warre in his prouince, against the peace &amp; against his owne promise. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outof sprong first priuie hartburning, afterwarde an enterance to the open hatred y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was betwixt them. Also this was a furtherance thereof, that wheras the King had grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted a combate betweene two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the borders of <hi>Picardie,</hi> although the Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> was then present, yet the <hi>Shatilion</hi> thought it stoode him on hand so to deale, as he himself might be chiefe vmper in the matter, bycause the chalendge was to be performed in his prouince. Moreouer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb facs="tcp:17736:7"/>
cause of the <hi>Guyses</hi> hatred is reported to be this: that wheras in their youth they had ben linked together with singular familiaritie, insomuch that to testifie their frendship with all, they went appareled in like rayment: the Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> asked the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralls aduice how he liked of his brother the Duke of <hi>Aumalls</hi> intent, in purpozing to marrie the <hi>Senes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall</hi> of <hi>Valentinoes</hi> dawghter, who was highly in King <hi>Henries</hi> fauour, and as highly diffamed among good men. To whome the Admirall answered, that he made more account of an ynch of good name, then of neuer so greate riches: which saying of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals the Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Aumall</hi> tooke in greate displeazure, as though it had bene spoken to barre the howse of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> from greater power preferment and preheminence.</p>
            <p>Howbeit when the Kinge was aduertized that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> leuied men of warre in the frontiers of the <hi>Lovve countreis,</hi> and that their forces assembled into one place: he thought it moste for the safetie of <hi>Picardie,</hi> to send the Admirall thither out of hand w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an armye, whome we haue shewed alreadye to haue btn the Lieuete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nant of that <hi>Countrie.</hi> He had scarsly marched two dayes iourney, but he was certified by his espialls, that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> were minded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seege <hi>S. Quintines</hi> a towne of <hi>Picardie</hi> not vnrenow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and to batter it out of hand with greate store of dubble Canons. Therwithall he had worde sent him by <hi>Brullio</hi> the Captaine of the Castle of <hi>Ham,</hi> that as soone as the townesmen had tydings therof, ther
<pb facs="tcp:17736:8"/>
rose such a feare throughout all the Citie, that many housholders left their wiues, children and all other things behind them, and tooke them to flight. When the Admirall hearde that, yet he thought it meete to conceale it among his men of warre, and pretending greate lustinesse of corage, marched on in great iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys towards <hi>S. Quintines.</hi> When <hi>Iernacke,</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarche</hi> whome the Admirall had made Lieuetenna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the men at armes disswaded him from it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wordes, declaringe vnto him that the towne was nether well fortified nor well vitteled, and moreouer that the townesmen were striken in feare, &amp; a greate power of the enemies would be come thither before any thinge coulde be prouided for the defence of the towne, &amp; therfore it was more for their commoditie &amp; praise to maintaine the warres in the open field, than to studye howe to saue them selues cooped vp within walls: the Admirall beinge no whit moued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those words of theirs, continued in his purpozed exployt, declaring to them, of how great importance y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> towne was, both to the puttinge backe of the Spanish force from the destruction of his countrey, &amp; to the safetie of his prouince: &amp; how greate occasion of speache he should giue to spiteful and malicious persones, if he shoulde alter his purpoze. The next daye worde was brought him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the most part of the sowldiers which were appoynted to him by the Kinges commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the defence of the towne, and whome he had sent one night afore him to cheere vp the harts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> townesmen, had hid them selues in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next woods for
<pb facs="tcp:17736:8"/>
feare, and were slipt euery man home too his owne howse by bywayes. That day therefore there folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him no mo but a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred &amp; twentie, whom six score mo followed the next day. Wherof the enemyes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by their skowts, came too the towne in haste, &amp; diuiding their woorks, began too make a trenche abowt it. When they had taken certein lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cotages in the suburbes, and drew neere too the dyches with their wynding trenches: the Admirall making a salye owt vppon them, commaunded fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and fyrebronds too bee thrust intoo those how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and set them on fyre, wherby he draue the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie further of. The next day when he had vewed all partes of the towne, and found no bulwarkes, no rampyres, no towers of defence: he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too distrust the towne, and too bee afrayd of long seege. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, forasmuch as the cace stoode so with him, that he was driuen either too defend the towne, and too stoppe the rage of the enemies from the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his countrie, or else too dye manfully in the quarell: looke what was possible for him too deuyze and bring too passe by care, trauel and watching, he did it: not ouerslipping anie thing in making of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, in cutting of trenches, and in rayzing vp rampyres euerywhere. And too the intent too giue example of peynfulnesse and trauell too the townes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and too his sowldyers, and too the Gentlemen that came with him: he was the first man that did set hand too the woorks, and neuer departed from them til they were ended. Whyle he was in this perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:9"/>
soodeinly vnlooked for, newes was brought him that <hi>Mounsyre d'Andelot</hi> his brother (of whom me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made afore) was comme intoo the towne, and had browght about .500. sowldyers with him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes this, the King being aduertized from him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too how greate perill the Towne seemed too bee browght, commaunded the Constable too hye him thither with certein Gwidons of horsmen, &amp; too car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in vittells with him, and too fortifye the towne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a greater garrison. But the <hi>Spanyards</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passing him with a greater companie of Launceknyghts, &amp; with a great power of footemen, ouercame him in battel, and tooke him prizoner, and hauing made a greate spoyle of his men, draue the rest backe agein further intoo <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Uppon the report of which newes in the towne, such a feare strake into the harts of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Admirall could scarce doo any good with his incoragements. Being moued with sorrowe herat, &amp; greeued with so greate perill of his countrie, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his people toogither, and told them that more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was too bee had of their countrie then of life: and thervppon he tooke an othe of them all, as well the townesmen as his souldyers, that it should bee death for any of them too make mention of yeelding, and that it should bee lawfull for euery man too kill such a one vnpunished. He himself tooke the othe first of all. The <hi>Spanyards</hi> being puffed vp with so greate a victorie, returned too the seege of the towne, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer left beating of it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greate ordinance by the space of .20. dayes toogither, and moreouer made wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:17736:9"/>
trenches about the walles, wherin too comme couertly and priuily to the ditches. When the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral saw that the most part of the wal was cast downe with the continuall batterie, and a greate breache o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen into the towne, and the enemies readye to giue the assault: he incouraged his souldiers to abide that one brunt, saying that if they foyled their enemies at that time, they would not be ouer hastie to aduenture againe: and therupon he him selfe stoode to defence where he sawe the breache wydest, assigninge the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the towne to his brother and to the rest of his friends to defend. The enemies beholding so strong a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terforce on that side, assaulted the towne on two other sides. Whereof when tydinges was brought to the Admiral, he left such as he trusted best at his standinge, and hyed him to the nexte, where he found his men driuen away, and the place gotten by his enemies, and a part of the Citie pestered with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men. There was with him a noble yong gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>Auentignie,</hi> whome he had brought vp in his house of a child, and a page, and a child of a noble howse that bare his iauelin, which were suddeinly assayled and inclozed about by certaine <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who hauing knowledge of the Admirall, tooke him prizoner, and after the winning of the towne, conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to <hi>Antvverp:</hi> where being attached with sore sickenesse and vexed fortie dayes with an agewe, at suche tymes as his fitts lefte him, he commaunded a Byble to be brought vnto him, to ease the griefe and sorrowe of his minde with reading of it. And he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
<pb facs="tcp:17736:10"/>
so much vpon it, that he began from thensforthe to haue a taste of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pure religion &amp; trew godlinesse, &amp; to lerne the right maner of calling vppon God.</p>
            <p>When he had payed fiftie thousand pound for his raunsome, and was come home agein frome captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hauing gotten some leyzure, and being weery of the broyles of the Court, he set his mynd earnestly thensforth vppon Religion, &amp; by the Kings permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion gaue ouer his Colonelship of the footemen to his brother <hi>Mounsyre d' Andelot,</hi> &amp; his Lieuetennant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Ile of <hi>Fraunce</hi> too his Neuew the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal <hi>Memorancie,</hi> his sisters sonne by the Cunstable. And it was not long after ere he sent a familiar free<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of his too the King, certifying him in moste humble wise, that he was mynded too giue vp his charge in <hi>Picardie,</hi> &amp; beseeching him too looke wel about him too whome he committed it. The King answered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he thought this sewt of his very straunge, and that he delt not wizely in dispossessing of him self of so many roomes and offices at once. From thensforth manie began to suspect the Admirall that he had chaunged his religion, and in deede he shewed a mynd vtterly voyd of all ambition and desyre of authoritie.</p>
            <p>Within a while after, King <hi>Henry</hi> dyed, and his sonne <hi>Frauncis</hi> succeeded. This <hi>Frauncis</hi> had taken too his wife <hi>Mary</hi> Queene of Scotts, the dawghter of the Duke of <hi>Gvvysis</hi> sister, by reason wherof the howse of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> grew in greate fauour and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the King, and oftentymes bragged to him of the kingdome of <hi>Ingland,</hi> which they affirmed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb facs="tcp:17736:10"/>
too their sayd kinswoman, so that in the Court they were comonly called the Kings Uncles. The Admiral knowing their cruel, barbarous, and feerce nature, and perceiuing that they woulde neuer desist from troubblesum deuyses, and specially that they would most eagrely persecute religion, stacke to his accustomed purpoze, and determined to giue vp his liefte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nantship. Heruppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he brake his mind to <hi>Levvis</hi> of <hi>Burbon</hi> a Prince of the blud royal, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>only called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince of <hi>Codey,</hi> who had maryed his sisters dawgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, counselling him to sew to the King for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> charge.</p>
            <p>So the Admiral being discharged of diuers cares, and set free from a nomber of affayres, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his godly mynd from the study of religion, kept himself at home in his castle of <hi>Shatilion,</hi> and that so much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> willinglier, bycause his wife <hi>Sharlot de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall</hi> a woman of a noble &amp; auncient stocke, was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully giuen to the following of godlinesse, (which he tooke too be a singular benefite of God) insomuch that she euen incoraged hir husband too forsake su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persticion and the worshipping of Idolls, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the christian religion w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his whole hart. When the Admirall perceyued that she delt often and very earnestly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him in the matter, he himself also deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to deale earnestly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her at once. And therfore he told hir in many words, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in all his life he neuer sawe or hearde of any man eyther in <hi>Germanie</hi> or in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> but he was in daunger too be ouerwhelmed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great miseries and calamities, if he imbraced the religion any thing earnestly: and that the Lawes of
<pb facs="tcp:17736:11"/>
King <hi>Frauncis</hi> the first, &amp; of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, being looked to most streightly in all Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, commaunded that all such as were condemned of that Religion, should be burned quicke in publike places, and all their goods be forfeyted to the King: and yet neuerthelesse he trusted that his heart was so settled, as he should not refuze the comon cace of all the protestants, nor fayle of his dewtie. Shee answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the cace of the protestants of that time, was none other then the cace of the true Christians of all ages had bin: nether dowted she but it should be the same still to the worlds end. When they had plygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their faithes on both sides ech to other, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall began by litle and litle to frame his household &amp; familiar freends to the knowledge of God by godly speeches, and to deliuer them not only the holy bible, but also other books written of religion in french, to reade, forbidding them all swearing &amp; blasphemous banning, comonly vsed in the Realme of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> but specially among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Courtiers. Moreouer he set godly gouerners and teachers ouer his children, so that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few monethes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> howse of <hi>Shatilion</hi> was of a new hewe and his other two brothers, <hi>Odet</hi> (whome I haue shewed afore to haue bin made a Cardinall) and <hi>Mounsyre d'Andelot</hi> were greatly inflamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by that example. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admirall had alwaies euen from his yong yeares, bin trayned vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zures and corrupt manners of the Kings Court, and he was not thought to haue bin cleere of that infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Notwithstanding, when he once began to haue a
<pb facs="tcp:17736:11"/>
taste of the trew religion, there appeered sodeinly so greate an alteration in his life and conuersation, as a man might easily perceaue the force of Gods spirit in that so sodein chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, &amp; find this saying of Christs too bee most trew, that they which are indewed with Gods spirit, are after a sort borne ageine and made new men. And this seemeth worthy of memorie, that befell him before he durst prepare too the Christian feaste and Sacrament of the Lordes supper. He had oftentimes talked with al the best learned Ministers of the Frenche Churches, not only of transsubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (as the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> terme it) but also of consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation: &amp; like as the nature of mans witte is too seeke some locall and bownded presence of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head too be worshipped in some certeine places, after which sort God exhibited his presence in old tyme in the arke of the couenant: so the Admirall required a certeine mingled presence of Christs body flesh blud and bone in the breade and the wyne. At length when he had bin at a Sermon that was made priuily to a fewe in the towne of <hi>Vateuille,</hi> at the end wherof the Lords supper was to be ministred, he besought such as were present, that they woulde not be offended at his infirmitie, but pray to God for him, and therwith all he requested the preacher to treate a litle playnli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the misterie of the supper. Then the preacher spake to this effect: namely that of the Lords supper there were two parts: the one humane and naturall, which is seene with the eyes of the bodye, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diuine and heauenly which is seene with the eies
<pb facs="tcp:17736:12"/>
of the minde: and that the first consisted of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or giuer, and of breade and wyne, &amp; furthermore of the eating &amp; drinking of them, whereof the whole action was performed after an humane and naturall maner: and this other consisted of God the giuer of it, &amp; of the whole frute of the crucified, requickened, and glorified body of Christ, which frute God gaue in the supper, &amp; moreouer of the faith &amp; beleef wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd frute was receyued of Christians, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole action wherof was misticall, &amp; performed after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, heauenly, &amp; supernaturall meane. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more that forasmuch as the same action was ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not for the bread &amp; wynes sake, but for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mannes sake, &amp; was to be referred too that end: it was in vaine to be ouercurious in seeking whether any thing be mixed in the bread, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread, vnder the bread, within the bread or about the bread. The bread and wine belonged to the outward dooing, like as water and the dipping in it, do in Baptim. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mindes of men ought too be lifted vp too the heauenly and inward action, &amp; to consider what God woorketh in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sacrament, which thing <hi>Paule</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in these woords. Is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread which we breake the parttaking of Christs body? &amp; they must cry out with him, It is a secret misterie, importing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of Christ and his Churche. And finally it is very trewly sayd of <hi>Austin</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to eate the meate which perisheth not, but abideth vnto euerlasting life, is too beleue in Christ. Why preparest thou teeth &amp; belly? beleeue, and thou hast eaten. And agein: prepare not

thy iawes, but thy hart. That is it wherewith that supper is to be eaten. Behold, wee beleeue in Christ, whom wee receyue by fayth. By which woords the Admirall being taught, gaue thanks first to God and secondly to the congregation, determining with him selfe too be present at the communion as soone as it should be ministred agein, and too be made parttaker of that most holy misterie. Whereof when the fame was blowen abrode ouer all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> it is wonderful to say how greate ioy and comfort all the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conceyued. For although that vntoo that tyme the followers of the reformed religion were afflicted with most rigorous edicts of the Kings, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall persecutions and punishments of the iudges and Iusticers of the Realme, so as they were fayne too keepe priuy assemblies after the maner of the primitiue Churches: yit was religion maruelously spred abrode throughout all the Shyres of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> whereof a man may see many records in the Edicts or Proclamations of King <hi>Henry,</hi> &amp; of King <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the second, who make complaint in them, that the more labour they tooke after the example of <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the first, in repressing the religion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more it kre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth foreward from day to day, sheading it selfe into all parts of the Realme, and growing still stronger and stronger.</p>

away with, now when as the Prince of <hi>Condey</hi> seemed to aly that waye, and there was so me likely hode that his brother the Kinge of <hi>Nauarre</hi> woulde make some stirre ere long after: the howse of <hi>Guyse</hi> thought it most expedient, that the King shoulde call an assembly of the noble men at the towne of <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynbleavve,</hi> to knowe how euery man was minded concerning religion. When the day of that meeting came, which was the xxiiii. of August 1560. and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the King desired such as sate in counsell with him to say their iudgements: the Admirall rysing out of his place, and comminge honorably vnto the Kinge, did put vp two supplications intitled after this manner: <hi>The supplication of such as vvorship God rightly &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, throughout diuers prouinces of this Realme.</hi> Both the bookes were deliuered too <hi>Mounsyre de l'Avv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bespyne</hi> the Kings Secretarie, to reade them alowd as they were written. This deede of the Admirals, for the straungenesse of the matter, and in respect of the former tymes that he had past, and of the Kings mind which was most extremly bent against religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of the great authoritie of the house of <hi>Guyse,</hi> seemed somewhat with the boldest, both to the King and too the whole counsell. The effect of the bookes was this: That the godly and right worshippers of God taking the opportunitie of that tyme, besought the Kinges maiestie most humbly to extend his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and gentlenesse towards the greatest nomber of his subiects, who hauing thitherto bin combred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many distresses, had abidden many miseries &amp; bitter
<pb facs="tcp:17736:13"/>
brunts for religions sake: beseeching him most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, too vowtsafe too take intelligence of their cace, and too admit the holie scripture too the iudgment of so greate controuersies: for therby he should eaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue how greatly they abhorred, not only he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, of which cryme they had bin accuzed of late yeeres, but also sedition: forasmuch as in the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extremitie of all their mizeries, they mynded not too resort too violence and force of armes, but too the only clemencie and goodnesse of the King. Wherfore it myght pleaze his maiestie too inhibit the iudgments that were woont too bee executed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, wherthrough no part of his Realme had escaped theis former yeeres, vnimbrewed with the blud of his subiects, by reason wherof their state had thithertoo bin miserable, forasmuch as they were driuen too pleade their cace before such iudges, as being the Bishop of Romes benefyzed and feede men, did rather beare the persones of aduersaries than of vpryght iudges or indifferent vmpers: and therfore they prayed him too haue an eye to the greate number of the calamities of his freendes and leege people, which had alwaies acknowledged him for their King and moste mercifull Lord, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly and godlily honored him according too Gods commaundement, and would not refuze too spend their lyues herafter for the mayntenance of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, if neede should requyre: in respect wherof it was good ryght, that seing God had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted them too his charge and trust, he should defend them from

the ouermyghtinesse &amp; crueltie of their aduersaries: And their humble petition was, that thensforth they myght with his good fauour openly woorship God in publicke places, &amp; be instructed in the knowledge of trew godlinesse by their preachers, and inioy the Sacraments that God hath ordeyned, leaste for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of being knowen, their religion myght any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger lye ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too the malicious speeches of their aduersaries, bycawse of their secret meetings.</p>
            <p>Uppon the reading of theis bookes, euerye man vttered his opinion, howbeeit their talk was not so much of Religion, as of the greate dette wherwith they complained that the king was in maner oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and ouerwhelmed. But the Admirall spake ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things verye boldly, specially concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men of warre which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> howse of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> had gathered too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in the hart of the realme, vnder colour of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the kings persone, as thowgh the King were in a straunge countrie, and not in his owne dominion, and therfore needed so great a garde for the safety of his persone. Saying that the name of king was of so great preeminence in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> that any herault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commission in the kings name, was able too appeaze anie vprore without further trubble. It is certeine that this speeche of the Admirals sank verie deepe intoo the stomacks of the <hi>Gvvisians,</hi> &amp; that it kindled their hatred ageinst him the more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Dyuers other were of opinion, that it were moste conuenient too summon a generall assembly of the whole Realme, which they comonly terme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="tcp:17736:14"/>
of the States: and it was shewed, specially by <hi>Marilliak</hi> archbishop of <hi>Vien,</hi> &amp; by <hi>Michaell de l'Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitall,</hi> Lord Chauncelour of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> whose autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie bare greatest sway at that tyme, that the same had bin the most auncient and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinewall custome of the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and yitnotwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding had bin omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the space of .87. yeeres, through the slaunders of certein flatterers.</p>
            <p>About the same tyme dyed king <hi>Frauncis</hi> the second, and his yoonger brother <hi>Charles</hi> the nyneth being abowt ten yeeres old, succeeded him, &amp; byand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the old petition of Summoning a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel was renewed. Untoo that tyme <hi>Katherine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cee</hi> the kings moother, a <hi>Florentine</hi> borne, had liued in such state as Queenes are woont to doo in their widowhoods, that is too wit, as a commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of hir owne women, &amp; a keeper of the persone of hir sonne: but in no wyze admitted too haue too doo with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the state: and at that poynt was shee hild most streytly by the <hi>Gwisians,</hi> as long as they bare cheefe sway. Now forasmuch as at this tyme it seemed that the nobilitie of <hi>Fraunce</hi> woold not any longer indure the burnings, tormentings, and other punishments that were woont too bee executed vppon the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and therfore it was too bee dowted least some new commotions woold ryze therof: bycause the Queene moother prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded a mynd not ildispozed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The Admirall labored by all meanes possible, &amp; at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth brought it to passe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as a companion &amp; partaker of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great charge of

gouernment, with <hi>Antonie</hi> King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> too whom the Protectorship of the Realme was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Which deuyce of his, there were many men that loued well their countrie, which mislyked, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing by the hystories of all ages, that the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Realme was neuer yit committed to Queene Mothers, specially if they were straungers borne, but it was too the vndooing and destruction of the commonweale of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and a cause of ciuill discord.</p>
            <p>When the day of the Generall Counsell came, he that spake in the name of the Nobilitie, did in the end of his Oration offer vp a booke of supplication too the Kings maiestie, requesting that the pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (which they terme comonly the reformed Re:ligion) myght lawfully bee haunted and exercyzed openly in publicke places. Her against stoode vp an aduersarie called <hi>Quintin,</hi> a Doctor of the Canon law, and a professor of it in <hi>Paris,</hi> who (not making, but rehercing in wryting, a verie long oration in the name of the Clergie, not without pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting of somme preests that stoode redie at his elbowe, too whisper him in the eare when he was at anie stoppe): was so bold as too say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all such as demaunded publicke places too exercyze religion in, were woorthie too bee punished as traytors and fauorers of newfownd religion. Wherof when the Admirall had complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned too the kings Counsell: <hi>Quintin</hi> being afrayd, confessed that he had not spoken any thing of his owne head at that tyme, but only reherced the booke
<pb facs="tcp:17736:15"/>
as it was deliuered him in wryting by the Clergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, offering himself redie too protest and avow in the same open assembly before the Kings Maiestie, that he ment not any thing at all of the Admirall: which thing was doone within a feawe dayes after, and so the Admiralles demaund was satisfyed. At the last, all Magistrates of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and all that had commission too execute Iustice, were commaunded by the kings authoritie, that they should out of hand dismisse all such as were held in ward or prizon for religions sake: and they were streytly forbidden too molest any man herafter for religion. As towching the publicke places where it should bee lawfull for them too haue Sermons, the determination therof was put ouer too another Generall Counsell, which was appoynted too bee at <hi>Ponthoyse</hi> a towne of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie,</hi> but not performed. The moneth of Ianuarie next insewing, a meeting of all the Princes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men of <hi>Fraunce</hi> was summoned too bee at <hi>S. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and there by the aduyce of certeine counsellers of euery Parlament, an Edict was made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings authoritie, &amp; proclaymed throwghowt all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> that it should bee lawfull too exercyze the religion in the Suburbes of all Townes.</p>
            <p>When this Edict was published, and the realme seemed too bee setled in quietnesse, and the comon weale too haue taken somme breth ageine, so as Sermons began too bee preached peaceably and quietly in the suburbes almoste of all great townes, yea and euen of <hi>Paris</hi> it self: newes was browght that
<pb facs="tcp:17736:16"/>
the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse,</hi> who had at that tyme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen himself intoo <hi>Shampayne,</hi> had made a slawgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about .200. men at <hi>Vassey,</hi> as they were at a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vpon trust of the authoritie of the kings Edict, and were singing of Hymnes after the end of comon prayer in a certein berne. The Duke of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> is reported too haue executed this butcherly crueltie, vppon presumption of the new frendship of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whose weake mynd he had drawen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too him by warranting him the kingdome of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> and bownd him vntoo him by manie other promises. Therfore presuming vppon that trust, within feawe dayes after, he came too the Court, accompanied with his brothers and with a greate trayne of armed men: and there tooke the yoong king and his moother, who seemed too shunne that violence with greate lamentation and weeping, whom he conueyed first too <hi>Melune,</hi> and anon after too <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that tyme the Queene Moother sent messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers oft tymes too the Admirall, and also wrate with hir owne hand too the Prince of <hi>Condey,</hi> that he should succour hir and hir yoong children, and haue a care of the welfare of the realme. The Prince being moued with theis things, and moreouer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by the intreatance of moste of the noblemen of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> determined too put on armes, and too make warre vppon the howse of <hi>Gvvyse,</hi> too set the King at libertie: protesting oftentymes openly, that he feared not the slaunderous speeches of some men,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:16"/>
as thowgh he ment too inlarge the religion by force of armes, or too make warre ageinst the king being a chyld. For a general assembly of the whole realme had bin hild at <hi>Orleance,</hi> wherin bothe the comons and the nobilitie had requyred the reformation of Religion, and afterward an Edict was made in that greate assembly, that it should bee lawfull too exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyze the same in suburbes and villages. And what ryght in the kingdome of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> had the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> being borne in <hi>Lorreine?</hi> Or vppon what grownd should he presume, too execute such crueltie vppon the kings subiects? Finally, there was no good too bee doone ageinst force but by force: and therfore he himself did not moue warre, but bi warre defend peaceable people ageinst warre made vppon them. Saying it was alredy bruted ouer all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and also reported intoo <hi>Germanie,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Nemovvrs</hi> at the prouocation of the <hi>Gvvisians,</hi> had with fayre woordes intyced <hi>Henrye</hi> the kings bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little chyld, (who since that tyme was created king of <hi>Poole</hi>) too haue conueyed him owt of the precint of the Realme: (which purpoze and drift the chyld bewrayed too his moother, and so that discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> matter was at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time in all mennes mouthes) &amp; that the <hi>Gwisians</hi> despyzing the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall assembly and of the king, executed butcherly crueltie at <hi>Vassey</hi> with extreme furie and pryde: layd violent ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king &amp; Queene moother, &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed them away ageinst their willes to <hi>Melune</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> as seemed moste for the <hi>Gwisians</hi> commoditie,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:17"/>
went intoo the borders of <hi>Germanie</hi> a little before, and requested certeine princes of <hi>Almanie</hi> too bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted intoo the nomber of the Protestants: Inuited <hi>Christopher</hi> Duke of <hi>Wirttemberg</hi> a prince of great corage and wisdome too <hi>Sauerne</hi> a towne next too <hi>Strawsborow:</hi> where the Cardinall of <hi>Loreine</hi> made twoo such Sermons openly in the Churche before the sayd Prince and a greate nomber of the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of the religion, bothe <hi>Germanes</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> as he perswaded verye manie, that bothe he himself and also his brethren imbraced the Religion, and were desyrous too professe their names among the protestant princes.</p>
            <p>When theis things were knowen, the prince of <hi>Condeyes</hi> enterpryze was so well lyked in manie places of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> that within feawe dayes dyuers Cities yeelded themselues too him, and ioyned with him in societie of the warre. Among those were <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance, Bloys, Towres, Burgis, Roan, Lyons, Vien, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia, Nemowrs,</hi> and <hi>Mountalbon:</hi> which were the beginners of the Ciuill warre, wherof the butcherly slawghter of <hi>Vassey</hi> is certeinly knowen too haue bin the cawse. Now when as on the part of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, the cheef charge of the warres was by comon consent of all men put too the Prince of <hi>Condey:</hi> soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly the Prince with lyke consent of all men, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered the charge of his gouernment too the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall: and for the singular opinion that was had of his Iustice, grauitie and wisdome, ordeyned him too bee his leeuetennant and deputie too rule in his sted.
<pb facs="tcp:17736:17"/>
Whyle these things were a doing, the Queene moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther began too treate of peace, for the dooing wherof she desired the Prince of <hi>Condey</hi> too come too her tent: and to graunte hir the vse of <hi>Boigencie,</hi> for a few dayes, which towne hath a bridge ouer the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> and therfore was (as shee sayd) most fit for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. The Prince vppon single promis made vntoo him, without taking of any pledges, but onely trusting to the faythfulnesse of his brother the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and too the promises of the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, went to their Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe. Only he desired y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queene, that the Cunstable, the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse,</hi> &amp; the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall of <hi>S.

Which thing being doone the garrison was withdrawen out of <hi>Boigencie</hi> and the towne deliuered to the Queene. Byandby shee manned it, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a communication, to outward showe of peace &amp; reconcylement, not only reteyned the Prince, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so tooke the towne and fortified it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the warre. With which trecherie the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall being sore moued, determined not to fayle in his dewtie towards the Prince, but went out of hand w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his horsemen to the Campe of his aduersaries, and strake such a terrour into them, that the Queene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince too be deliuered immediatly. And within a fewe dayes after, the Admirall leading his armie too <hi>Boigencie</hi> woone the towne by force, &amp; not without somme losse of his owne people, recouered

            <p>Abowt the same tyme, the Admiralls eldest sonne named <hi>Iasper</hi> being consumed with sicknesse, dyed at <hi>Orleance</hi> scarce nyne yeeres old, but of singular to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, which cawsed the Admirall too take his death very sore to hart, In the meane whyle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

in the Court, and <hi>Mounsyre Brosse</hi> the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> Lieuetennant, and a nomber of other Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were forthwith slayne. The Cunstable who was Generall of the feeld, and of very greate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, being taken prisoner by a valiant gentleman called <hi>VVilliam</hi> Steward of <hi>Vesine,</hi> &amp; being sought for by many souldyers that would haue slayne him, was notwithstanding saued by him, for that he was of kin to the Admirall, and for that the Prince of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dey</hi> was in perill, and so he was conueyed safe to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When things were thus grawen to a mischeef, &amp; all hope of peace was past, the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped himself neere to <hi>Orleance,</hi> and assayled it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sore on the one side: during which time the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall leauing his brother the <hi>Andelot</hi> behynd him to defend the Citie, tooke his iourney into <hi>Normandie,</hi> and beseeged the Castle of <hi>Caen,</hi> wherinto the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Elbevvf</hi> one of the Duke of <hi>Guysis</hi> brother, had in those feawe dayes retyred him selfe: who after the taking of the Citie, began too treate for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and deliuered vp the Castle with all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and furniture thereof into the Admiralls hand. There was at that tyme in the Duke of <hi>Gvvysis</hi> Campe a yong man called <hi>Iohn Poltro</hi> of the howse of <hi>Merey</hi> a man of good worship: who hauing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religion, &amp; bin familiar many monethes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condeyes</hi> side, did suddenly take a toy in his head at <hi>Lyons,</hi> to kill the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse,</hi> whome as the butcherly slaughterman of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:20"/>
and as the author of so greate mizeries, he was woont oftentymes too pray ageinst moste bitterly, in all his familiar talke. Therefore hauing alwayes this saying in his mowth, what skills it whither a man vse manlinesse or wylinesse ageinst his enemie? he determined too go intoo his Camp as a reuolter, and too hunt for opportunitie too accomplish his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce by hooke or by crooke. For were I bownd too him (quoth he) eyther by way of seruis, or by any kind of benefyte, or by any othe, nothing in the world should make mee too hazard my good name. But se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no bond tyeth me too him, why should I not imitate the prowesse of <hi>Sceuola</hi> in his enterpryze of killing King <hi>Porsenna?</hi> When <hi>Poltro</hi> had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good whyle in this mynd in the Dukes Campe, at length vppon occasion offred, he shot him throwgh the right shoulder with a pellet of leade, of which wound he dyed within feawe dayes after, and when he was once deade, peace did forthwith growe too ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without any stoppe, so as the Edict was renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and libertie of following the religion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vppon certeine conditions, throwghout all <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Wheruppon all men for the moste part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan too reason, that as <hi>Helene</hi> was to the <hi>Troianes,</hi> so the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> was too the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> the cawse of all the greate miseries that befell them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the warres were so suddeinly whist and extingwished by his death.</p>
            <p>Howbeeit within a feawe monethes after, when the Admirall came too the Court by the Kings
<pb facs="tcp:17736:20"/>
sending for him, there was a newe incounter stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp ageinst him by a woman. For the Duches of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> falling downe humbly at the Kings feete, sewed with manie teares for the reuendgement of hir husbands murther, whereof shee auowed the Admirall too haue bin the author and practizer. The Admirall perceyuing that, and smelling that that pageant was played by the motion of a higher force, too the end that he which could not bee ouercomme by battell, might bee intrapped by sum slightie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance: first shewed too the King and his moother and too all the whole counsell, that <hi>Poltro</hi> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that murther being alredy apprehended, had bin arreigned and executed for it, whither rightly or vnrightly it was no tyme as then to debate, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the cace stoode, as greate a cryme as it was, it had bin sufficiently, and more than sufficiently reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by the extreme punishment of the same <hi>Poltro,</hi> who was rent asunder alyue wyth charyots at <hi>Paris.</hi> Moreouer that they had such a condemned persone of him, as not only acknowledged the deede, but also glorifyed and vaunted of it, assuring him selfe that that mynd was put intoo him by God, so as he dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not but that he had doone acceptable obedience to God, and a singular and beneficiall good turne to his countrie, in ridding such a tyrant out of the world, as was alwayes raging, alwayes mad, &amp; alwayes thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of christen blud. If <hi>Poltro</hi> had vttered any thing ageinst him vppon promis of pardon, or intyced by fayer woords, while he was in durance in the comon
<pb facs="tcp:17736:21"/>
Iaile, he ought to haue bin kept aliue, like as he him self had requyred by many letters and messages, while <hi>Poltro</hi> was yet alyue in the comon prizon, that assoone as the warres were ended, he might haue bin examined of him by lawfull order of Iustice face to face, wheras now, seeing he is dead, nether his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession nor his deposition ought too bee of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in a cace of lyfe and death, specially ageinst a man of such state &amp; calling as he was in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Realme. Furthermore albeeit that he or any other of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie had neuer so much inuegled <hi>Poltro</hi> too that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: yit notwithstanding could it seeme any hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fault for an enemie to deale enemylike with his enemie? Had there bin any trewce at that tyme, or was the Admirall bownd too him by any couenant or othe? To what purpoze should Capteines keepe gards abowt them in their Campes, (but too looke too the safety of their persones?) To be short, though none of these things were: yit since that tyme peace had bin reconcyled, not only betweene the souldiers of both parts, but also much more betweene the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines and officers of the bands, too the benefyte of the comon weale, too the which publike benefite and ciuill concord, this newe kinde of quarreling was a hinderance. And if they would needes haue that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sifted out too the bottome: he also would request the King, that he on his syde might haue leaue too preferre iudytements agaynst them likewise. For it might bee easily proued, that the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> had executed vnlawfull crueltie ageinst the kings
<pb facs="tcp:17736:21"/>
subiects, &amp; broken all the holie decrees of the realme confirmed by the kings Edict, and also committed hygh treason by making warre of his owne priuate authoritie, and by vsurping the whole state of the realme: and finally had confounded all lawes of God and man, &amp; bin the firebrond of all the great broyles wherewith <hi>Fraunce</hi> had burned abowt 13. moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes.</p>
            <p>Uppon the heering of this oration of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralles, howbeeit that the same processe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed dyuers tymes by the <hi>Gwisians</hi> afterward, at length the king summoned the princes and nobleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his realme, toogither with his graue counsellers and men of cheefest authoritie, too meete at the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Molins.</hi> The Cardinall of <hi>Lorreine</hi> taking too him his brothers widowe, willed hir too speake for that parte: and therwithall gaue the Admiral leaue too answer what he could in his defence. When the matter had bin debated on bothe sides, the king by the aduice of his counsellers, demaunded of them whither there were any of that assembly, whom they thowght partiall and meete too bee remoued. They answered that they lyked well of all. Then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded agein, whither their desire was that he should doo them iustice in that cace, &amp; whither they woold promis too stand too his iudgment or no. When bothe parties had answered that they woold verye willingly stand too the kings determinacion: within a feawe dayes after, the .29. day of Ianuarie 1566, sentence was giuen woord for woord in forme
<pb facs="tcp:17736:22"/>
following. The King hauing herd bothe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parties, and considered the matter with his Counsell, and perceyuing that the verdites and opynions of his Peeres and Counsellers consented and agreed all in one withowt anie variablenesse: giueth definitiue sentence that the Admirall <hi>Shattilion</hi> seemeth cleere and giltlesse of the murthering of the Duke of <hi>Gwyse,</hi> and therof dooth vtterly acquit him. And therwithall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth his Attourney generall, &amp; all others too whom such matters belong, neuer to speake more of it. Furthermore he forbiddeth them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had bin the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie parties in that cace, &amp; all other his subiects, too bee so bold as too haue any speeche therof, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse all iudges &amp; ministers of Iustice, too suffer that matter to be called anie more in questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before them: giuing all men too vnderstand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath taken bothe the parties intoo his custodie &amp; protection: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giueth the parties streight charge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should thensforth liue quietly &amp; frendly vnder his obeisa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; not practyze any thing one ageinst another. If any of the kinsfolk, countrifolk, acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or frends of the aduersary parties do ageinst this Decree: he shal be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for giltie of hygh treason as a traytor too the kings person, in violating y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publik peace &amp; tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. And therfore it is his pleasure that this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be proclaimed &amp; inrolled in al his Courts of Iustice.</p>
            <p>But now must wee returne ageine to the dooings of the former yeere. Within a feawe moonethes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there happened a thing which (too my seeming) is not too bee let passe, bycawse it may bee a record
<pb facs="tcp:17736:22"/>
of a moste gentle and meeld disposition. There was a certeine gentleman called <hi>Hamberuillier</hi> borne of a woorshipfull howse, whom the Admirall had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteyned manie yeeres in howsehold very familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had vsed his seruis in his affayres of most credit and estimation. A letter of this mannes was intercepted in the Court, wherin he wrate too cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein whom it is not requysite too name at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that he woold within feawe dayes dispatch the matter that was inioyned him, and giue the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall a drink too cast him intoo a dead sleepe. When this letter was browght too the Admiralles hand, he sent for the partie, and willed him too wryte certein verses with his owne hand in a paper that was redie there: and when he had compared them bothe toogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he asked him whither he acknowledged the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too bee his hand or no. Which when he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, being conuicted of the wicked deede by his owne conscience, he kneeled downe byandby, and besowght his mayster of mercie. The Admirall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that he forgaue him, howbeeit vppon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that he should voyd his howse out of hand, and neuer comme in his syght more.</p>
            <p>Herafter wee must retyre backe too the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of the Court the last yeere. For within a feawe moonethes after the Proclayming of the peace, the Queene Moother determined too make a progresse too <hi>Baion,</hi> to see hir sonne in Lawe the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and too carrye hir sonnes thither with hir for a certeine purpoze, which being knowen too feaw at
<pb facs="tcp:17736:23"/>
that time, did afterward burst owt in tragicall eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. First therfore shee tooke hir iourney to <hi>Lyons,</hi> which vnto that tyme was in the power of the protestants, by reason of the multitude of Citizens and Countrie folkes that fauored the Religion therabowts. As soone as shee came thither, shee gathered toogither the <hi>Italian</hi> Carpenters &amp; Masons euerywhere, and commaunded a hold (which the <hi>Italians</hi> doo comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call a Citadell) too bee bwilded in all haste vppon the next hil, too ouerlooke the towne. A little before, the plage began too growe whot, &amp; had now cawght hold of the Courtyers: and yit the Queene could not bee perswaded too remoue hir children from thence, vntil shee had seene the fowndacion of the Hold laid. When shee saw that the plage was crept euen into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, Shee made one <hi>Mounsyre Lossie</hi> gouerner of <hi>Lyons,</hi> a cruell and barbarous man, and a most deadly enemy of Religion, appoynting him a garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of certein prowd and ruffianly souldyers, too vex the Citizens (which were giuen too religion) wyth continewall wrongs and despites. Afterward, which way so euer the king made his progresse with that greate trayne, intoo whatsoeuer Citie, towne, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, or Manour he was browght: woonderfull it is too report, but yit most certeinly knowen and talked of in all mennes mowthes, so greate a plage follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the kings traine continewally, that for the space of three moonethes toogither, he neuer lodged in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny howse, but the present perill of the plage draue him owt of it agein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17736:23"/>Whyle theis things were a doing, &amp; the Queene mother communicated hir deuyces with hir dawgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Queene of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and with the king hir hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes Ambassadours: the Marshall <hi>Memorancie</hi> (whom the king had left gouernour of <hi>Paris</hi>) was certifyed that the <hi>Gvvisians</hi> wrowght secret practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, too stirre vp the comons of <hi>Paris</hi> ageinst such as professed the trew and vncorrupted religion: and that the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrein</hi> woold bee there within a day or twayne with a greate trayne of armed men. It had bin forbidden dyuers tymes afore by the kings Proclamations, that no man should iourney with hargabusse or pistolet, or haue anie abowt him. When it was told the Marshall that the Cardinall and his companie were come intoo the Citie, armed with such weapons: by and by he went and met him with his garrison, and commaunded them too lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their weapons. Which dooing of his, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall and his brothers sonne the yoong Duke of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> taking in greate despyte and reproche, were herd oftentymes afterward too say, that that deede should cost <hi>Memorancie</hi> his lyfe. When this vprore was stirred vp in the Citie, where the Cardinall myght haue rayzed threescore thowsand armed men in one day too haue slayne <hi>Memorancie: Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> thought it good too call his freends abowt him, and specially the Admirall, who being accompanied with three hundred horsmen or therabowts, came too <hi>Paris</hi> the .22. day of Ianuarie: which thing did so scare the feeble harted people giuen woonderfully
<pb facs="tcp:17736:24"/>
too superstition, and cheefly the Preests, Moonks, &amp; the Canons of the Cathedrall Churche, that a great sort of them began too deuyze how too flee away, The next day <hi>Memorancie</hi> sent for the prouostes of the Parlament, and for such as bare cheef authoritie at that tyme in the Citie, home too his howse. Too whom in the presence of the Admirall, he spake of the Cardinall of <hi>Lorreines</hi> ouerbold and seditiows enterpryzes, and of the flocking toogither of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine Citizens, telling them that forasmuch as they had giuen it owt euerywhere, that the Admirall le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyed men of warre, and practized meanes too sacke that riche Citie, whyle the king was farre of in his progresse: he thowght it best too call him owt before them, that he myght tell them playnely what he mynded too doo. Then, I knowe wellynough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy (<hi>quod</hi> the Admirall) what things are spred abrode of mee by leawde and maliciowse persones, as who shoulde say, I sowght meanes too sacke this Citie, which is knowen too bee the cheef for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse of the Realme, and the Noblest lyght of all <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Theis kynd of dealings are meete for such, as chalendge I wote not what kynd of ryght too the succession of the Crowne, and beare the worlde in hande that certeine Dukedommes and Erldommes owght too bee restored vnto them. As for mee, I put yow owt of dowt, I clayme not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie maner of ryght too the Kingdome, nor too anie parte therof. And if I did, I beleeue there was neuer any Nobleman of <hi>Fraunce</hi> this fyue hundred
<pb facs="tcp:17736:24"/>
yeeres, that had so good oportunitie offered him too trubble the state. Yee remember howe greate occasion of settyng the matter abroche, I had at such tyme as the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> was slayne, and the Cunstable my prizoner at <hi>Orleance,</hi> if I had bin minded too rebell. But I neuer sewed more earnestlye too the Queene Mother, and too the Kings Counsell for peace, than when I was in my cheefest prosperitie. Who knoweth not that I sowght peace with moste earnest intreatance and sewte, at such tyme as a nomber of noble Cities had alredye put themselues vnder my protection, and manie mo bothe of <hi>Normandie</hi> and little <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> offred mee their freendshippe and societie vnrequested? Who knoweth not that wheras vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the conclusion of the peace, I myghte haue serued myne owne turne by ambitiowse crauing of roomes of authoritye and honoure at the Kings hand, yit I choze rather too get mee home, and there too leade a priuate lyfe modestly and quietly vntoo this day? But too let theis things passe, and too go forward with the things that wee haue in hand, being called by the Marshall <hi>Memorancie,</hi> I made haste too comme vnto yow: not of purpoze too make anie innouation or trubble in anie thing: but rather too quenche such broyles, as were lyke too bee stirred vp a late throwgh somme mennes ouerboldnesse. I thinke there is none of you all but he knoweth, how greate credit the professers of the purer Religion doo giue mee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17736:25"/>Surely a nomber of them being moued with theis straunge rumors, and put in feare throwgh the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiows deuyces and enterpryzes of the <hi>Gvvisians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort vntoo mee dayly, bringing letters intercepted, concerning the flocking toogither of certeine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capteines, which commaund their old souldyers too bee redye with their armour, that they may step foorth owt of hand whensoeuer neede shall requyre. What needeth manie woords? Certein letters were intercepted written intoo <hi>Normandie,</hi> and fathered vpon the authoritie of the Queene moother, a Copie wherof I bring yow here owt of myne owne cofers, and will reherce one poynt therof which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no fitter vvay too restore the Crovvne of Fraunce too such as haue ryght too it by auncient inheritance, and too destroy the hovvse &amp; ofspring of Valoys, than by killing all the Hugonotes vvhich are the vpholders therof. Therfore vvee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate their goodes, that the monny vvhich is made of them may yeeld vs armour and treazure. And if the Hugonotes go too lavv for it: the matter shalbe so handled in iudgment, as they shall haue smal list too make any sevvt for domages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besydes this, what shall I speake of the slawgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and robberies that are committed almost day by day? It is sufficiently knowen, that since the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayming of the peace, aboue .500. protestants haue bin slayne in sundrie places, and yit the magistrates haue not punished the murther of anie one of them. They that complayne of it too the king or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queene
<pb facs="tcp:17736:25"/>
moother, receyue nothing but words, or sum emptie sheete of paper, or els sum skin of parchment. Who knoweth not that a greate slaughter was made alate of the protestants, openly in the citie of <hi>Turon,</hi> yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> standerd and antsignes displayed, euen in the presence of him whom the Duke <hi>Mompaunser</hi> had sent thither to make peace? And yit for all this, it is said y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diuers of your clergime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are striken w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so great feare of this my comming into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie, that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sult how to forsake it, yit notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>standing, there is no place in al <hi>Fraunce,</hi> no towne so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, no hold, no village, where Preests dwell more safe and sure, or where they exercyze their ceremonies and massings more freely, then in mine owne manour of <hi>Shatilion.</hi> Uppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> making of this oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the company was dismissed.</p>
            <p>The next day came abowt a thirtie of the cheefe merchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Memorancy,</hi> and after them the Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> with the Chauncelour of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity and a great rable of Clergimen: to whom the Admiral speaking very courteously, bad them be all of good cheere, Also w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in a feawe dayes after, being brought into the Parlamenthowse, he confirmed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many words, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wished nothing more then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and quietnes of the Citizens, nor vndertooke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iourney vppon any other purpose, then that, requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them likewize, that the Citie might be ordered peaceably and quietly. When things were thus set at a stay, the Admirall at his returne home was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by his friends, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one <hi>May</hi> a man of bace calling which had a ferme not farer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> castle of <hi>Shatilion,</hi>

            <p>Ere long after, the Prince of <hi>Condey</hi> had a sonne borne, to whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King intended to be Godfather, &amp; to giue him his name, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> accustomed maner. But forasmuchas he could not wel do it bycause of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it pleazed him to giue the honour therof to the Admiral, willing him to cawse the infant to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed &amp; christened in his name: which thing was doone w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> exceeding great pomp &amp; royall preparation, as is
<pb facs="tcp:17736:26"/>
wont to be in Princes Courts. For at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feast, a table was laid for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admirall as if it had bin for the King himself, wherat he sat alone as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King is wont to do, &amp; was serued as a King, which dealing all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strewed to be a sure token of the Kings singular good will towards him.</p>
            <p>Anon after, tidings was brought that <hi>Ferdinando</hi> Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming with an hoste into nether <hi>Dutchland</hi> by the Spanish Kings commission &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, to suppresse the vprores that were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ther for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sake. Now forasmuchas he was to conuey his army by the borders of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral sitting w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Kings cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, desired that regard might be had of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and that a garrison might be sent thither for defence of the countrie, rather of <hi>Svvissers</hi> than of <hi>Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> lest perhaps sum broyle might be made for religions sake. And it was como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought at that time, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the said army of <hi>Svvissers,</hi> which consisted of six thowsand men, were for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoze than to withstand the Duke of <hi>Aluaze</hi> force, if he should attempt any thing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marches of <hi>Burgundie.</hi> But anon after, the Prince of <hi>Rochsurion</hi> a Prince of the Kings blud, wrate to the Admirall, desiri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to send hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priuily sum freend of his who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he might best trust, and he would bewray such things vnto him as did very greatly concerne his welfare, &amp; were not to be vttered to all mennes hearing. And so within a feawe daies after, the Prince of <hi>Rochsuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> being freend to the Prince of <hi>Condey</hi> by reason of his alyance too the Kings howse, bewrayed vntoo
<pb facs="tcp:17736:27"/>
him secretly, how consultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was had at <hi>Baion,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingwish the religion comonly called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to oppresse such as were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> professers therof: and that the hyring of the <hi>Svvissers</hi> vnder colour of fortifying the fruntiers of <hi>Fraunce</hi> ageinst the Duke of <hi>Aluaze</hi> power, was for the same purpoze.</p>
            <p>The same tyme the Admiral was aduertized both by letters and by woord of mowth at many mennes hands, that the armie of the <hi>Svvissers</hi> was conueyed into the borders of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and into the innermore part of <hi>Burgundie.</hi> Uppon knowledge wherof, first y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince of <hi>Condey,</hi> &amp; afterward the Admiral himselfe went to the Court, and told the King, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Counsell, that they sawe no sufficient cause to bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g these armies of <hi>Svvissers</hi> into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realm, except it were perchaunce to oppresse them &amp; a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other honorable howses, which professed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: neuerthelesse that the number of such as had professed themselues to be of the religion, was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it was comonly taken too be: whereof they had tryal in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last warres, &amp; therfore that if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued their enemies to attempt any innouation of things, they would be euen with them, and not suffer themselues to be murthered at those cutthrots ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: wherfore they prayed and besowght the Kings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, to be moued with compassion, eyther towards so many howses of honour and worship, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise towards his afflicted countrie, and the forlorne people of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being shaken of in the Court, &amp; vnhonorably delt with, and moreouer vnderstanding themselues to be
<pb facs="tcp:17736:27"/>
in great daunger of their liues, they tooke counsell, not to faile themselues &amp; so many christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> churches, specially at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> request of the most part of the nobilitie &amp; gentlemen, and at the earnest intreatance of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable sort of their good countrymen, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger able to abide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrongs, wherwith they were continually vexed at the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats hands. When they had determined vppon that poynt, forasmuchas they perceyued tkat the Kings name would beare a singular sway among the cities, and that therfore the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse</hi> had in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer warres indeuered to haue the King in his owne tuicion: they communicated their intent to very few, and tooke their iourney priuily to the court, to see if they could by any meanes conuey the King away from the custodie of the Queene moother and of the <hi>Gvvyses,</hi> that they might prouide for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comon peace and concord, by remouing vngracious counsell from him. But being bewrayed of one of their confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, they lost the opportunity of bringing that matter to passe: by reason wherof they were driuen to trye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter by open warre. When they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e at <hi>Paris,</hi> they mustred their adherents, &amp; found that there were on their side sumwhat lesse then a thousand horsmen, &amp; about a threehundred footmen. For the <hi>Andelot</hi> had caried away the most part of his armie with him too <hi>Poysye</hi> the day before, to cut of vittels from the <hi>Parisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by taking the bridg ouer the riuer of <hi>Sean,</hi> There went out of <hi>Paris</hi> fifteene thowsand footmen, and mo then six thowsand horsmen, vnder the Cunstable, who
<pb facs="tcp:17736:28"/>
ioyning battel with them was sore wownded, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within feawe dayes after. In that battell a man might haue seene the singular woorking of God in preseruing the Admiral. For wheras he rode vppon an ouerfeerce horse, that would not in any wise wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere be ruled, his muzrol brake asunder, &amp; his horse caried him twice through the battell of his enemies where they were thickest, and yit he was not hurt at all, notwithstanding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the pistolets discharged their shot at him on all sides, with one of the pellets wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his horse being hit, suffred him to bring him backe agein easly into his owne battell.</p>
            <p>After the receyuing of greate losse on both sids, but specially on the prince of <hi>Condeis</hi> side, the Kings armie was discomfited and driuen into the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and it seemed best to the prince and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to take their way into <hi>Lorrein,</hi> too the horsmen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wer sent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thither by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of certein Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germanie.</hi> For they saw it was needefull agein to impugne forreiners with forreiners. In that iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, being ouertaken by their aduersaries w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great power, wherof the Generall was <hi>Henry</hi> the Kings brother, then Duke of <hi>Aniow,</hi> afterward King of <hi>Polland,</hi> &amp; now King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who preassed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vppon their reereward, they oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued many harmes. When they came into <hi>Lorrein,</hi> whither <hi>Casimire</hi> the <hi>Palsgraue</hi> electors sonne was come before them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great host of <hi>Almaynes,</hi> there rose a new occasion of trouble and incombera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For there was owing to those <hi>Almaynes</hi> a certein tymes
<pb facs="tcp:17736:28"/>
wages, and there could no meanes be fownd to pay any peece of it, were it neuer so litle. Out of hand the Admirall found a remedy for that mischeef. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that all men as well the Rascalls &amp; Lackeys of the hoste, as the horsmen and the comon souldiers should be taxed by the poll, so farre foorth as euery mannes abilitie would beare. First of all the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral himself cawsed fiue hundred french crownes to be told out of his owne cofers. The like was doone of all the rest according to euery mans abilitie, and Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors were sent to euery band to gather it vp. And moreouer looke whatsoeuer siluer the Prince of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dey,</hi> the Admirall, &amp; the Counties of <hi>Andelot</hi> &amp; <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focawlt</hi> had of their owne, it was deliuered eueriwhit of it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Collectors. Thus in very small tyme there was gathered with the singular good will of al men, the summe of fowerscore thowsand pownds, &amp; it was iudged that by that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell of the Admirals, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole army was saued, which not only was persecuted by the aduersaries, but also threatened by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Germanes</hi> their leagefellowes and succorers. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the powers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Germanes</hi> &amp; <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were once ioyned togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Aduersaries returning suddenly backe, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in great iourneies vnto <hi>Paris,</hi> which thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <hi>He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs brother deemed to redownd to his greate dishonour.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Condeies</hi> men being now wel chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and full of good hope, went to beseege <hi>Sharters,</hi> which when they had beaten a good while w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greate ordinance, &amp; cast downe a peece of the wall, insomuch that the <hi>Andelot</hi> was now redye to haue led them to
<pb facs="tcp:17736:29"/>
the assault: suddenly the Kings Trumpetters came in poste, and sending a Herault, declared that peace was concluded. For commissioners had mette on both sides neere <hi>Paris</hi> for the same purpoze cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine dayes afore. Thus was the seege broken vp, &amp; the Prince of <hi>Condey</hi> dismissed his power. Whyle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admirall was kept occupyed at that seege, his wife (of whome mention is made afore) who in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the warres had gotten hir selfe with hir chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Orleance,</hi> being consumed with sore sicknesse, and vnable to beare out the brunt of it, departed out of this life. The Admiral being aduertized of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousnesse of hir diseaze, had left the Camp, and was gonne too hir in poste, and taking the best phisicions to him that he could get, performed the dewtie of a louing and faithfull husband towards hir. But when he sawe that the force of hir diseaze ouercame y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the phisicions: he commended hir departing sowle vnto God, &amp; withdrew himself into a parlour, whither a greate sort of his freends &amp; acquayntance came to him to comfort him, of whom many remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered that he vttered these words with great sobbing &amp; teares. Wherin haue I sinned, my God, or wherby haue I deserued that thou shouldest chastize me so sharply, and ouerlode me with so many miseries at once? Would God I coulde leade a holyer lyfe, and giue better example of godlinesse. O holy father, let thy mercifulnes looke vppon mee, and asswage these my sorrowes. Afterward being cheered by the godly talk of his freends, he commaunded his children too
<pb facs="tcp:17736:29"/>
be browght vnto him, &amp; told them that this so greate losse of their mother owght too bee a lesson too them, that there remayned no help for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the sonne, whervntoo they myght trust or leane: affirming that howses and Castles, were they neuer so strong and stately, are not giuen vs for dwelling places, but lent vs for bayting places, nor tyed too vs for euer by purchace and freedeede, but graunted too vs for a tyme vppon courtesie: and finally, that all things in this world are flightfull and transitorie, sauing only Gods mercie, whervntoo he woold haue them too commit themselues wholly, casting away all worldly helpes, and then should they not neede too dowt, but they should haue moste sure defence in the same. The next day he called <hi>Grelley</hi> his childrens schoolemayster, and told him that he must needes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne too the Camp, and he could not tel what should becomme of him there. Wherfore he warned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred him, too haue a care of his children, and too bring them vp in religion, godlinesse, and all good artes, as he had oftentymes charged him.</p>
            <p>As concerning his Ladie or late wyfe, shee had alwayes a singular and earnest zele too religion as is shewed afore, and was indewed with singular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie in bearing owt all calamities, as well hir owne as hir husbandes, so that it is truly auowched of many men, that looke what promis shee made too hir husband for the professing of Religion, (as I haue shewed afore,) shee performed the same moste holily too the full. There were dyuers vertewes and
<pb facs="tcp:17736:30"/>
gifts of nature commendable in hir, and specially her singular louingnesse and liberalitie towards the poore, and towards sicke folkes. Therfore inasmuch as shee continewally visited the sowldyers that were browght eyther sicke or wownded too <hi>Orleance:</hi> the Phisicions were plainly of opinion, that hir diseaze was cawght and bred cheefly of those ill sentes and stinking sauoures.</p>
            <p>After that the Peace was proclaymed by the sownd of Trumpets in manie places (as is sayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore): the Admirall had scarsly taryed three dayes at home, but he was certifyed from all partes of the Realme, bothe by letters and by messengers from his freendes, that the sayd Peace was not a Peace in deede, but a practis too renewe most horrible warre. For they perceyued so greate preparation for warres in all places, that if he looked not too it betymes, bothe the Prince of <hi>Condey,</hi> and himselfe, and all they that had bin Capteines in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> late warres, should bee intrapped and abandoned too the crueltie of their enemies. The tokens wherof were theis, the bringing in of garrisons intoo <hi>Orleans, Auxerre, Bloys,</hi> and the other yeelded Cities: the keeping of all bridges, passages, and foordes: the reteyning still of the men of armes in the hart of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and the keeping still of twoo Legions neere abowte <hi>Paris,</hi> vnder pretence of garding the Kings persone. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the knowledge of theis things, he thowght it moste for his safetie too withdraw himself intoo the towne of <hi>Tanlay</hi> too his brother the <hi>Andelotte,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:17736:30"/>
anon after to <hi>Noyers</hi> a towne of meetly good stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth in the Prince of <hi>Condeyes</hi> territorie, whither he had withdrawen himself a little afore with his wyfe and children and his whole howsehold for the same cawse. In that iourney there happened a thyng, which bycawse of the straungenesse therof, is not to bee ouerslipped. Not farre from the towne of <hi>Molins</hi> as yee go too <hi>Auxerre,</hi> there is a Lake: whervntoo when the Admirall was comme, a certein olde man of his companie named <hi>Gripper,</hi> a man skilfull by reason of manye long voyages by sea, and singularly faithfull and loouing towardes the Admirall, espyed a blacke clowd driuen with the wynd beating very vehemently ageinst that part of the Lake: whervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he began too warne the Admirall in the heering of a greate nomber, too put spurres too his horse, and too hye him apace too the next village, least they myght bee ouer taken with the tempest at hand. As soone as he had sayd so, thinking that the rest had beleeued him and followed after him, he hyed him on afore. He was scarsly owt of syght, but suddein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there arose such a storme as the Admirall was passing the narrow bankes of the Lake, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, not only men but also horses, were throwen downe with the whirlewynd, and dyuers hurt with the violence and weyght of the Hayle, and had much adoo to scape with their lyues. The wynd blew the Admiralles hat from his head, which could neuer be fownd agein when the tempest was ceassed. But one of his companie deliuered him another: nether was
<pb facs="tcp:17736:31"/>
he (for all that) hurt in any part of him sauing in his ancle, where the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dryuing of the hayle gaue him a good pretie pelt. Surely if the violence of the wynd had lyen ageinst the head of the lake, no dowt but that day had bin the last of the Admiralles lyfe and of all his companies. When the tempest was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layd, the Admirall hauing comforted his companie, sayd: I thanke thee O almyghtie God, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent miracle I deeme too foretoken, that wee shall shortly bee pressed, howbeeit not oppressed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie sorrowes.</p>
            <p>As soone as they were comme too <hi>Noyers,</hi> they sent often messengers with letters too the King, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him that they were daylye aduertized of traynes that were layd for their liues: wherfore they humbly besowght his Maiestie, too haue respect of his Countrie alredy tyred with twoo ciuill warres, and fynd meanes that the fyre which was kindled by the <hi>Gvvisians,</hi> might bee quenched, not with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, but rather with the safetie of his Realme, and with his owne wisdomme. And therwithall the Admirall directed letters too <hi>Margaret</hi> the dawgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the greate King <hi>Frauncis,</hi> and wyfe too the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> (whom he thought too bee of credit and authoritie too wey much with the Queene moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther), beseeching hir with all maner of intreatance, too deale so by hir authoritie, as shee myght turne away the tempest that was lyke by somme fatal mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce too fall vpon hir afflicted and forlorne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17736:31"/>When he sawe no roome left for peaceable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes, and vnderstoode that <hi>Tauanne</hi> (who anon after was made Marshal of <hi>Fraunce,</hi>) was bringing of his power priuely too <hi>Noyers,</hi> of purpoze too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloze him and his: he counselled the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dey</hi> too get them thence, and too hye them too <hi>Rochell</hi> as fast as they cowld: which towne by reason of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein auncient customes and priuiledges, had neuer receyued any garrison of sowldyers vntoo that day. In their way they must needes passe the Riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> and in their companie there was the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of <hi>Condey</hi> with six yoong children, wherof one was not past a yeere old. After them, the next day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the yoong children of the Admirall and of the <hi>Andelotte,</hi> whom their keepers couueyed away in the dead of the nyght by the Admiralles commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and passing the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> browght them too their companie in the borders of <hi>Berrey.</hi> And there happened a woonderfull thing, wherof innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable witnesses and beholders remaine yit alyue. Wheras the Prince of <hi>Condey</hi> thowght too haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken twoo or three boates soodeinly on the hitherside of the water, and so too haue ferryed ouer secretly: as soone as he came at the riuers side where it ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by the foote of the hill of <hi>Sanxerre,</hi> there he fownd a foorde, at the which abowt a fiftie horsmen that wayted vppon him went ouer, when in the meane whyle the Ladye his wyfe with hir children &amp; hir whole Nurcerye were conueyed ouer in botes. They were no sooner all wasted ouer, but the riuer
<pb facs="tcp:17736:32"/>
did so ryze in three howers space, (notwithstanding that the day was most fayre and cleere): that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Sanxerre</hi> and all the dwellers therabowts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it too bee the wonderfull prouidence of God, praying him to blisse those yoong children and babes krying in their Cradles.</p>
            <p>The King hauing knowledge of theis things, gaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundment by the counsel of his Courtiers, that all his men of armes, specially which were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> borders of <hi>Santonge</hi> and <hi>Poytiers,</hi> should owt of hand go too <hi>Rochell:</hi> and he sent his brother <hi>Henry</hi> (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee haue made mention afore,) too leade thither as great a power as he myght. In the meane season, the Protestants which had returned home euery man to his owne Citie &amp; countrie, vppon the making of the peace, and vppon trust of the kings assurance: were euery where oppressed &amp; murthered by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude. While theis things were a dooing, <hi>Ioane</hi> Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who had hild hir self at home in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer warres, abhorring now the lawlesse and often renewed treacherie: rayzed such power as shee could w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all speede, and went too <hi>Rochell,</hi> carying hir sonne <hi>Henry</hi> with hir, (to whom the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Nauarre</hi> descended after hir death), and one dawghter. When the foresaid matters were set at a stay as is sayd alredy, the Admiral toke certein pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ordinance out of <hi>Rochell,</hi> and went to beseege the towne of <hi>Niort,</hi> &amp; within feawe dayes after tooke it by composition. From thence he led his armie too <hi>Angolesme.</hi> This towne sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vpon a hygh hill, cut
<pb facs="tcp:17736:32"/>
steepe on all sides sauing one, into the which Towne the aduersaries had conueyed a greate Garrison a feawe dayes since. The Admirall cawsed his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie too bee layd too that side of the Towne where it myght bee cumne vntoo, and when he had assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it certeine dayes, it was yeelded vntoo him by the townesmen.</p>
            <p>Anon after there was a battell fowght at <hi>Iaseneul</hi> betweene the vawardes of bothe the parties. The Captein of our vaward was the Admirall, who brake in vppon his enemies with such violence, that they being vnable too abyde the brunt, sowght too saue themselues by flyght, and drewe towardes <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signian,</hi> leauing all their caryages behynde them. The pray that was taken, was esteemed almoste at fiftie thowsande Crownes. The next day a letter of one of the Clerkes of the Counsell named <hi>Fizie,</hi> wrytten too the Queene Moother, was intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: wherin he bewayled that losse, adding also that since man was first made, neuer anie sonne of <hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> (it is a vulgar phraze among the <hi>Frenchmen</hi>) was in so great hazard of his lyfe as he had bin. Not long after, the Admirall going too <hi>Iarnacke</hi> a Towne neere by, was driuen too fight whither he woold or no: and he was euen at the verye poynte too comme intoo his ennemyes handes. For his aduersaries spyes vnderstanding, that he pourpozed too passe the Riuer that ronneth by the Towne, which is not verye brode, vppon a bridge of Boates: ambushed them selues secretly on the other side of the Riuer,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:33"/>
and assoone as they perceyued the Admirall too bee there, by and by the Hargabuts began too discharge at him, and other some indeuered too get ouer the bridge by force. As God woold there was one Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabutter that stopped their brunte with his often shoting of of his peece, but yit was he strike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through with a nomber of shot, and fell downe dead. Abowt twelue other being stirred vp with his noyze, succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his roome. The Admirall himself stepping too the banke, with his naked swoord, (for he had no leyzure too put on his corslet) did cutte asunder the ropes wherwith the boates were fastened, during the which tyme, his aduersaries which hild the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the Riuer, neuer left shooting at him, which thing cawsed him too haue a gard abowt him from that day foorth for the defence of his persone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such suddein chaunces.</p>
            <p>A twoo dayes after, when the aduersaries had passed ouer the riuer of <hi>Sharent,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dey</hi> for feare of being inclozed by them, althowgh he had lately hyred thre thowsand swart <hi>Rutters,</hi> and had more ouer six thowsand <hi>Swissers,</hi> whom he had interteyned from the beginning of the warres: yit notwithstanding being a man of a noble and stowte stomacke in battell, he determined too stop them of their passage, howbeeit not too fight in pitched bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. In the meane whyle woord came too the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall that his men which had taken the Towne next their enemies the day before, were beset &amp; browght too vtter perill, but yit stood manfully still too their
<pb facs="tcp:17736:33"/>
defence. The Admiral minding not to abandon them, gathered certein horsmen quickly togither, &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them apace. Whom when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies knew, they suddeinly cast themselues in a ringe, and beset him rownd abowt with greate force. Wherof the Prince of <hi>Condey</hi> being certified, and being much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyer in corage then fortified with strength, brake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middleward of his enemies, and there being oppressed with multitude, had his horse striken throwgh, so that he was ouerthrowen &amp; slayne. The Admirall being soore greeued with the greate losse, and distrusting what might insew to the whole, rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his brother the <hi>Andelot</hi> intoo the towne of <hi>S. Iohn d'Angeli,</hi> And wheras the foyle that he had receyued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of the Prince of <hi>Condey,</hi> he could haue reuenged vppon the bodies of dyuers his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that were of greatest power and nobilitie, and haue requyted their dishonorable dealing with like for like: yit determined he to hold himself within the bownds of nature and manhod, and to giue the dead their dewes: and in that mind did he continue as long as the warre lasted. As I told you before, <hi>Ioane</hi> Queene of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was the same time at <hi>Rochell:</hi> who hearing of the greate losse that was receyued, went with all haste intoo the Campe, where hauing comforted the cheef of the whole host, and incoraged the sowldiers too be myndful of their auncient prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse, shee told them that shee gaue and deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too them hir only sonne <hi>Henry</hi> (too whom the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Nauarre</hi> should descend after hir dicease) to
<pb facs="tcp:17736:34"/>
bee their Generall: protesting openly, that the life of hir only sonne was not deerer vnto hir, then the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the whole armie. <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Condey</hi> the sonne of the foresayd <hi>Levvis</hi> late deceased, was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him in societie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honorable charge. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, the Lords and all the Capteines and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der capteines betooke the charge of the warres, and the ordering of all martiall affaires to the Admirall with one consent, as to him that was knowen to be of greatest credit and authority among the protestants. For besids his singular skil in martiall affaires, and besids his iustice &amp; his stayednes, it was wel knowen to all men, that he was the first of all the nobilitie of the Realme, which imbraced the trew religion and professed it openly, which reformed the order of his howse according to the order of religion: which durst breake with King <hi>Frauncis</hi> the second (who was hild intangled with the alyance of the howse of <hi>Gvvyse</hi>) concerning the demaunds of the Churches, &amp; put vp supplications in their names to the Kings counsell: which gaue example of godlines to the french nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whom al men knew to haue bin most horribly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with euill manners, by reason of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wicked cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Kings court. And it is further knowen, that after he had once imbraced the religion, he neuer gaue any cause of offence to the reformed Churches: and that wheras men resorted vnto him on all sids, in the name of those Churches, he alwayes gaue them the wyzest counsell: and tooke weapon in hand, not to rebell ageinst the King (as sum reported of him) but
<pb facs="tcp:17736:34"/>
at the request and intreatance of the Queene mother, which thing neuerthelesse he did not vppon his owne head, or to satisfie the Queenes mind, but (bycawse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King was not yit full twelue yeeres old,) he grown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself vppon the authority of the generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell holden at <hi>Orleance</hi> (as is sayd afore) and also vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Kings edict that was wrotten and proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at <hi>Paris</hi> within certeine dayes after by the full consent of all men: wheras on the contrary part it was by the <hi>Gvvyses</hi> procurement and counsell, that so many honorable and worshipful howses were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of all their goods and possessions: that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny florishing and noble Cities were sacked: that so many Princes, noblemen, Capteines and Maysters of chiualrie were slayne, to the exceeding greate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of the whole Realme: and (which is the cheef of all other) that so many florishing congregations were oppressed welneere in al the townes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> &amp; finally the Realme brought to that point, that it lay open to any forrein Prince as a bootie to pray vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>These things were no sooner finished, but the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral had a sore mischaunce by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of his brother the <hi>Andelot,</hi> who died of a suddeine diseaze in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town of <hi>Santon,</hi> not without suspicion of poysoning: which was so much the more lykely, bycawse <hi>Birague</hi> the Uicechauncelour (who anon after was made Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour) a man of <hi>Piemount,</hi> was herd to say oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the Court, that all these warres were too bee dispatched, not by armed men, nor with so great ado, and with so great losses, but by cooks &amp; skullions w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17736:35"/>
small adoo. And forasmuch as the Admirall wrate a letter with his owne hand a feawe dayes afore to his owne sonnes &amp; to the <hi>Andelots</hi> sonnes which were browght vp all vnder one Tutor, to comfort them, which letter of his written with his owne hand I haue now presently in my keeping: I thowght it not amisse to translate it in maner word for word, and too set it downe here, in this place.</p>
            <p>Although I dowt not (quoth he) but the death of my brother <hi>Andelot</hi> was a great greef vnto you, yit notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>standing I thowght it good to put you in mynd of your happines in that you be the Sonnes or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uewes of so noble a gentleman, whom I dare auow to haue bin, both a faythfull seruant of God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of singular commendacion and renowme for his excellencie in martiall affayres. The remembrance and example of which vertewes owght too stand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before your eyes, that you may imitate them to the vttermost of your power. And I thinke verily, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may well affirme this of him, that in all <hi>Fraunce</hi> there was not any that went beyond him in matters of warre, nother do I dowt but that forrein nations will yeeld him like record, specially such as haue had experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his prowesse heeretofore. He purchaced not this so great estimation by sloth and ydlenes, but by induring of greate peynes for his countries sake. Surely I neuer knew man eyther iuster towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, or more zealous of righteousnes to godward. nother am I ignorant that it were not comly for mee too report these thinges of him among straungers.
<pb facs="tcp:17736:35"/>
But I am the bolder to speake them vnto you, to the intent to incorage and sharpen you too the imitating of so great vertewes: for I my self also do set this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample before mee to followe the same, praying &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching our God and Lord, to graunt mee to depart as godlily and blessedly out of this life, as I saw him do. And bycause I find myself to haue a great want of him: to the intent I may beare this greef of mine the more patiently, I craue of you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may see his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tewes reuiue &amp; shine forth in you. For your better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinement wherof, giue your selues with your whole hart to godlines &amp; religion, and while you be in these yeeres, spend your time in the study of such learning as may lead you into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way of vertew. And although I can well abide that you should be from your books at such howres as your mayster giues you leaue too play: yit looke to it that in your playing you nother do nor say ought that may offend God. Specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence your Schoolemaister, and obey him no lesse then myself. For I am sure that he will not giue you any precept or counsell, which shall not bee both for your honour &amp; profit. As concerning all other things if ye loue me, or rather if ye loue your selues, so deale as I may alwaies heare glad tydings of you: &amp; looke as ye growe in yeeres and body, so growe yee also in godlines and vertew. God blesse you all, and be your defence, and vphold you euermore with his holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. From <hi>Sauton</hi> the xviii. of May .1569. <hi>Shatilion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nother was the Admirals stowt corage in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out the greatnesse of that greefe, vnknowen too
<pb facs="tcp:17736:36"/>
straungers. For although he had forgone such a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he knewe to bee peerelesse in godlinesse, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, valeantnesse, renowme of noble deedes, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendacion of chiualrie, insomuch that for his owne part he termed him his right arme: yit did he oftenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes protest among his freends, that he himself rested vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouidence of God. For he both vnderstoode and also was wont to say oftentimes, that nother the Churche of God was gwided by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes pollicy, nor the christian army ordered by the prowesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines. And in talking of his brothers death among his free<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, he was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to cry out. O happy <hi>Andelot,</hi> which ended y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> course of his lise so godlily &amp; luckily.</p>
            <p>About the same time word was brought of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>VVoolfgang</hi> Duke of <hi>Bipount</hi> into <hi>Fraunce</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a mighty armie of <hi>Germanes,</hi> whome he browght to our reskew: &amp; how he had already passed the <hi>Loyre</hi> with his power, and had woone the towne of <hi>Sharity,</hi> bicause there was a bridge ouer the riuer in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> towne, into <hi>Berrey.</hi> When the <hi>Germanes</hi> were come to the towne of <hi>Shalluce</hi> in the borders of <hi>Limosin:</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall determined to ioyne with them, the which self same day the Duke of <hi>Bipount</hi> being oppressed with a sore sicknes, departed out of this life, and the cheef charge was by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of al the <hi>Germanes</hi> committed to <hi>VVoolrade</hi> Earle of <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> who had bin his lieuetennant. The aduersaries were greatly abashed at this ioyning of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> togither, &amp; there was no place in all <hi>Fraunce</hi> where this opinion was not spred, that if the <hi>Germanes</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen</hi> might match togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Kings power was like to go to wrecke, and
<pb facs="tcp:17736:36"/>
the Courtiers should be glad and fayne to stoope to their aduersaries. Also such as shewed themselues de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sirous of peace and of publike quietnesse, did openly both in the Camp and in the Citie curse the authors of falshod: saying that it was neuer yit seene, but that the end of periurie was alwayes mischeuous. This was certeinly thought of all men, that if the Admiral ioyning his owne power with the power of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> had led them rightforth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart of <hi>Fraunce</hi> towards <hi>Paris,</hi> many cities would haue yeelded vnto him, and haue committed themselues to his tuicion. This opinion was very greatly confirmed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in feaw daies after. For at such time as <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iow</hi> being incamped neere vntoo him, had giuen him battel, he was easily driuen back, and compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre with the losse of a greate number of his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the taking of <hi>Mounsyre Strossie</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queene moothers sisters sonne, who had the charge of them.</p>
            <p>The Admirall hoping that vppon the matching of so great forces togither, the King considering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> state of things would incline his mind to sum indifferency: sent bookes of supplication vnto him (for the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> would giue him no leaue to send any messe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) wherin he praied and besought him in the name of the whole army, that he would not harden his hart any longer, but haue compassion of his afflicted and miserable subiects, and consider with how great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the Realme, the twentie thowsand forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or thereabowts, which were come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> succor of both parts, should rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge vp &amp; down through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm
<pb facs="tcp:17736:37"/>
of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> if the warre were prolonged any longe tyme. For the matter was nowe proceeded so farre forth, as the ciuill warres were not likely to come to end by reconcylement of mennes mynds or throwgh the loue and compassion of their countrie, but by the wasting of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realme: &amp; therfore it was expedient for him too spare his subiects that had indured so many discommodities &amp; so long continewing already, &amp; not too trust ouermuch too the Cardinalls and <hi>Italians,</hi> which bare to much sway in his court: for straungers would neuer rew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miseries of <hi>frenchmen</hi> as <hi>french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> would. The tyme was now most conuenient too treate of peace, while eyther part stood vppon the trust of their owne strength. And the condicion of peace was very eazie, inasmuchas the whole number that were in armes with him, desired nothing but fre liberty to exercize their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which had bin grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them so often, both by authoritie of publike coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and also by the Kings Edicts. Extreme was the madnes of the <hi>Italians</hi> and of a few others that were neerest abowt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, to warrant him that two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thowsand men of the reformed religion, might be dispatched and rid out of the way with so small a do as they made of it: wherof the successe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tymes might be a sufficient proof. When the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> had taken the foresayd foyle, then by the aduyce of his freends, he dismissed a greate part of his armie, and specially of his horsmen, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> space of a mooneth or two, commaunding them to returne home to refresh themselues. And then <hi>VVool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17736:37"/>
Erle of <hi>Mansfeeld</hi> late leeuetennant to <hi>VVoolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang,</hi> was set vp in his place with the full consent of all men.</p>
            <p>When things were thus set at a stay, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall called a counsell, wherin all men thowght it good, that forasmuch as all the Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries from the Hauen of <hi>Rochell,</hi> and on all the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coast, were in possession of the Protestantes, those quarters should be fortified, and the winning of the Towne of <hi>Poytiers</hi> bee attempted, that it myght bee as bulwarke too defend and mainteine that whole Countrie. This deuyce seemed too bee greatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the yeelding vp of the Castle of <hi>Lusignian,</hi> which is the strongest hold in all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and yit notwithstanding was yeelded vppe within a feawe dayes beseeging, and so was newes browght abowt the same tyme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the towne of <hi>Chastelleraut</hi> had done the lyke. Anon after that the seege was planted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Poytiers,</hi> and all things put in redinesse for the assaulting of the towne: the Admirall being ouerty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with watching and trauell, was taken with the bluddy Flix, wherwith he was so pulled downe for thirtie dayes todgither, that he could not bee present at their dooings, nor giue them counsell howe too deale. By meanes wherof the Townesmen being refreshed bothe with vittelles and with newe and fresh succours that were dayly sent in, and hartened with daily salyes, and moreouer incoraged by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and messages from the king, bare owt the seege stowtly. But all men are certeinly perswaded, that
<pb facs="tcp:17736:38"/>
had not the Admirals siknesse hindered the matter, <hi>Poytiers</hi> had comme vnder his subiection.</p>
            <p>Abowt the same season, one <hi>Dominik Albio,</hi> a <hi>Gascon</hi> borne, and one of the Admirals howsehold seruaunts, which being taken by the Kings side, had taried certeine monethes in their Camp and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie returned now home too his Master, and resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting boldly agein too his house, began too bee had in suspicion at manie mennes hands, for his fond talk &amp; for the vnconstancie of certeine speeches that he cast forth, bicause he commonly agreed not with himself. By occasion wherof being apprehended &amp; examined, he brought forth a box of poyson, which he confessed too haue bin deliuered him by one <hi>Riuers,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Captein of the Duke of <hi>Aniowes</hi> gard, and by a certein other person which was the same Dukes secretarie, &amp; that he was promized .2000. French crownes to kill his master the Admirall therwith. Upon the knowledge wherof he was condemned too death, &amp; wheras most men deemed him woorthie of greeuouser punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yit was he but hanged with a rope, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that his maister sewed for his pardon.</p>
            <p>Before the Admirall was throughly rid of his disease, when word was brought him that the towne of <hi>Chastelleraut</hi> which was a .7. miles of from the Camp, was beseeged of his enemyes: he led his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer thither, beeing caryed himself in a horselitter, and easely entering the Towne with his sowldyers, did putte his enemyes too flyght, sleaing a greate number of them, and specially of the <hi>Italians:</hi> and he
<pb facs="tcp:17736:38"/>
ceassed not too pursew his enemyes as they fled, till they were past the Riuer, which for the deepenesse therof is in the vulgar tung called the Crewse. In the meane whyle the yoong Duke of <hi>Gwyse,</hi> which had bin Capteine of <hi>Poytiers,</hi> issewing owt of the towne with a greate companie by nyght, did send in other new and fresh fellowes in their sted. And ere long after, the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> hauing repayred a greate armye, not only of <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> but also of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> and <hi>Swissers,</hi> came too <hi>Chinon.</hi> The armie of the Protestantes began too bee weerye of the long seege of <hi>Poytiers,</hi> for want of vittelles and wyne, and throwgh fowle and stormie wether, matched with siknesse which had greatly anoyed the footemen, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>Germanes.</hi> By reason wherof manie of the <hi>Santones</hi> had conueyed themselues home too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh their bodies, &amp; diuers had slunk away intoo the innermore part of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> to <hi>Sharitie</hi> and <hi>Sancerre,</hi> which were in possession of the Protestants. Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Admirall vnderstood, he thought it good not to be ouerhastie, and therfore restreined the whote corage of his sowldyers from battell. Whervppon bothe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sowldyers &amp; the petie capteines did cast forth threatning speeches, saying that they woold returne home, and shift for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: for it woold be more for their ease to make warre at home in their owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, where they might help themselues with their owne houshold store, than in strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge places: specially seing they had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of certein townes in <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> &amp; <hi>Delphynoys,</hi> &amp; by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> wherinto they
<pb facs="tcp:17736:39"/>
myght resort, and wherowt of they myght make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasions, and easly waste the feelds of their enemyes. Not vnlike theis were the speeches of the <hi>Almane</hi> sowldyers, who hauing forborne their wages now certein moonethes, kryed owt that the matter was too bee committed too the swoord, rather than too lye lingering so long from their owne countries and dwelling places. And it was almost comme too the poynt, that certein nobleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great authoritie were abowt too haue forsaken the Camp, and too haue led a great part of the armie away with them.</p>
            <p>When it was once determined too put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too the swoord, and that bothe the armyes drew neere too <hi>Mongontur</hi> to incamp there: the Capteins of the armie of our aduersaries, did soodeinly set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our lyght horsmen that were the foreriders, and vppon certein bands of our foreward, whereof the Admirall had the charge. The Admirall hauing sowght a good while for his harnes bearer, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him not, did at length neuerthelesse aduenture intoo the thickest of his enemies. After him followed the foremencioned <hi>VVoolrade</hi> Erle of <hi>Mansfeeld,</hi> who compelled the battell of the enemies too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their grownd. Heere ran a riuer which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries labored by all meanes too passe. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall being garded with certein Hargabuts, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched sumwhat before the foreward, and stayed at the bank of the brooke, and stopped the enemies of their passage, prouiding there for all things necessarie vntill the shetting in of the Euening, when as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:39"/>
his enemies neuer left beating of that place of all the while, bothe with greate Ordinance and with small shot. And surely if they myght haue passed the Riuer at that time, and haue broken in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our armye, it had bin horrible too think what a slawghter they had made of our men. For they were mo in nomber than our hoste by a third part. Besides this, they were fresh and lusty, and our men faint and weerie at the ioyning of the battell: and therfore it was but twoo dayes respit. For the third day when it came too hand strokes, the most part of our foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men went too wrecke, and our horsmen were put too flyght. The Admirall giuing charge vppon six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Almanes,</hi> with twoo hundred <hi>French</hi> horsmen, was shot at with thicke shot of pistolets, and wown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the right side of his nozethrilles: insomuch that hauing his Beuer beaten too his face, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able too spit owt the blud that issewed from his wound, and moreouer hauing his swoord striken from him, and his swoord girdle broken of with the continewance of the Pistolet shot, and almost all the lethers of his corslet burnt asundre with the heate of the pellets that lyghted vppon his armour, so as his brestplate hung but by the vppermoste thonges: he was at length conueyed owt of the battel by the help and faythfull seruis of one <hi>Ploriner,</hi> a yoongman of <hi>Normandie,</hi> whom he had browght vp of a chyld in his howse, and after the ouerthrow of his hoste, was conueyed by his freendes too <hi>Partheney.</hi> Here a man may well woonder at the constancie and greatnesse
<pb facs="tcp:17736:40"/>
of his corage. For wheras vppon the receyuing of this so greate losse, most men did cast away bothe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and hope: he tooke vppon him too comfort and harten euery man, and calling all his secretaries and clerkes vntoo him, sent letters abrode into all partes of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> least the Protestantes that were vp in armes in other places, should faint, or think the losse too bee so greate, as myght not bee recouered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in feawe dayes space.</p>
            <p>The next morning he tooke his way too <hi>Niort,</hi> and when he had set things in order there, he went thence too <hi>Santon,</hi> and abode there but seuen dayes for the curing of his wownd, which could not be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led throughly in lesse than .25. dayes. While the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall was thus greeued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burthens of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer trauels, and with great heauinesse and distresse: newes was browght him, that he was atteynted of high treason by act of parlament, made at <hi>Paris</hi> the 13. day of September .1569, and that whosoeuer could bring him aliue too the king, should haue fiftie thowsand Crownes in reward for his labour. Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere at the same time it was told him, that one <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinengo</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> condemned of Treason in his owne countrie, was sent with certein antsignes by the king to <hi>Shattilion,</hi> and that when he came there, he not only ransacked the Castle, and spoyled &amp; cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away the costly plate and houshold stuffe that had bin layd vp there of manie ages as an ordinarie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the howse, too the valew of a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande Crownes at the leaste: but also did so burne vp
<pb facs="tcp:17736:40"/>
the Towne that standeth vnder the Castle, as there scarcely remained anie incling of a Towne. At the receyt of which newes, the Admirall was so farre of from conceiuing anie greater greefe of mynd that coulde appall him in going foreward with his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres: that there appeered not so much as anie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration at all in his countenance: insomuche that when his freendes and kinsfolk resorted too him too comfort him, he was woont too say stowtly vntoo them, that God of his singular goodnesse had giuen him such a mind at the present, as could possesse the things that are termed goods, and not be possessed of them, so as his goods were alwaies subiect to him, &amp; not he to his goods. And therfore in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ciuil warres wheras for the most part all the princes, noble men, gentlemen, men of armes &amp; footemen mainteined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres, &amp; liued vpon the pray fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hand to mouth when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king had seized their possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: Only the Admiral &amp; a few other payed their hostes &amp; vitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers alwayes redy monny for themselues and their retinewes: by reason wherof he had not only brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght himselfe farre in dette by borrowing vppon inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest: but also had layd a great part of his wyues ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, Iewelles, and ornaments too gage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewed that trade so long, vntil that being in maner left destitute of all howsehold helpes, (which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned almoste abowt the end of the third ciuill warre) he sewed in an assembly of the states, too haue some releef graunted too him also, for the mayntenance of his howshold charges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17736:41"/>Abowt the same tyme the Admirall wrate a letter with his owne hand, too his owne sonnes, and too his brother the <hi>Andelots</hi> sonnes, which were browght vp all toogither vnder one Schoolemaister at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell,</hi> as is shewed afore. Which copie and handwry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his I hauing gotten, thowght it woorthie too bee translated in maner woord for woord, and too be put intoo this place. It had (<hi>quoth</hi> he) bin moste too my contentation, too haue spoken theis things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too yow presently, and to haue seene yow and talked with yow. But forasmuch as I am not able now so to doo: I thowght it good too warne yow too haue godlinesse and the feare of God continewally before your eyes, specially sith tryall and experience may now teache yow, that there is no greate trust too be giuen to the things that are termed goodes. Our hope must bee settled in another place than in this earth, and other Artes are too bee gotten than those which are seene with eyes, and handled with hands. Howbeeit, forasmuch as that lyeth not in our owne power, wee must humbly craue help at Gods hand, too bring vs intoo the surest and safest way: and yow must not looke that that way shalbee pleasant and delyghtfull, and flowing with all prosperitie.

harme that you haue done them, but only for hatred of me, wherof I am sure there is none other cawse, but that God voutsafeth to vse my labour and seruis in susteyning his Churche. Therefore if we suffer harme and losse in that behalf, blessed are we: and we shall haue such a reward, as no man can haue power ouer it, I haue many other things whereof I would write vnto you if I had leyzure. At this tyme it shall suffize me to warne you, and to beseeche you in Gods name, to proceede lustily in the study of vertew, and to shewe both in your doings and sayings, and in all your whole life, how much you abhorre all kind of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

            <p>When the Lords had sit oft tymes in counsel in the same towne of <hi>Santon</hi> concerning their state: at length it seemed good by generall consent, to set sum staye among the Townesmen, and to leaue certeine antsignes of footemen in garrison for defence of the towne, and to go their way, with their lighthorsmen into the borders of <hi>Tolowse</hi> where <hi>Mountalbane,</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:17736:42"/>
towne very strong both by nature &amp; by hand of man, was in possession of the protestants, who had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered no small somme of money wherwith too pay the <hi>Almanes</hi> their wages. And besids that, they hoped that if they were once past the twoo riuers of <hi>Gerownd</hi> and <hi>Lotte,</hi> they should ioyne with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wherof the Countie <hi>Mountgomrye,</hi> a man of greate authoritie for his knightly prowesse and skil in martiall affayres, was Capteine, and by whose seruis he had pacyfied <hi>Bierne,</hi> a territorie of the King of <hi>Nauarres.</hi> In this iourney, which was verye peynfull by reason of the vneeuennesse of the wayes: althowgh that all the Cities were manned with garrisons, and had cut asunder the bridges, and drawen the ferryboats all to the other sides: yit was there none so bold as too assayle our sowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers weeryed with the tediowsnesse of the wayes, and (for the most part) vnarmed, or too stoppe them as they passed the ryuers and brookes on bridges made of barges and boates. Therefore after a long and weerisomme iourney, they came at length too <hi>Mountalbane:</hi> owt of the which towne, the Admiral sent messengers to the King and the Queene moother, with charge to make earnest and humble sute in the behalfe of all them that were in armes with him, that they should not suffer so manie valeant men too murther one another, as were nowe readye in bothe the hosts too giue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, but of their clemencie make an ende of those so greate myseryes and inconueniences. For it
<pb facs="tcp:17736:42"/>
was but the counsell of certeine Bysshops and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls which neuer came intoo the feelde themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and of a sort of <hi>Italians</hi> which had no remors of <hi>Frenchmennes</hi> myseryes: Neuerthelesse it was a poynt of starke madnesse for them too thinke, that twoo hundred thowsand Protestants, specially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing so greate a number of noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among them, could bee intrapped and rid quite and cleane away withowt towche of brest: Nay ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, besides that, there were a greate number e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the Catholiks themselues, which shoulde not scape without tasting of the comon myseryes: insomuch that somme should perish by the swoord, and othersomme throwgh the ouergreatnesse and weerisomnesse of trauell and peynestaking, and the more part be sure to susteyne greate losse and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in their goods and possessions. Agein it was not beseeming the Maiestie of a King, that (as the Courtyers did comonly report of him,) he shoulde not spare his owne people so he might oppresse his aduersaryes: for it is the speeche of a Tyrant and not of a King, too say, Let freends perish, so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes maye goo too wrecke with them. As for peace, the condicion was eazie, namely that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the publike Counsell which was hild at <hi>Orleance,</hi> and of the Edict made at <hi>Paris,</hi> doo take place, so as men might haue libertie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyze the purer Religion in somme certeine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Uppon the sending of this message, consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:17736:43"/>
was had there how to passe the riuer of <hi>Gerownd,</hi> which was betweene <hi>Mountgomries</hi> hoste and ours, and seemed verye hard to bee passed by reason of the depth, bredth and swiftnesse of the streame. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Admirall gaue counsell to take the towne of <hi>Mariane</hi> standing vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same riuers side. Which being done, forasmuch as the Countie <hi>Mountgom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye</hi> possessed the other side, the Admirall deuyzed to make a bridge in this wyze. First heauing out fowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene pyles of timber, of fower and twentie foote long a peece, sharpened at the one end and armed with y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, he draue them with rammers into the chanell of the riuer, setting fowerteene mo full ageinst them in the vpper part of the streame. Then vppon euery cupple that stoode one ageinst another, he layed a beame well fastened with mortises and braces, and likewize sidebeames from payre to payre, which he couered ouer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> planks to go vppon. On eyther bank was made a litle bridge vppon twoo wheeles, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey horses the eassier both of &amp; on to the great bridge. And to strengthen the worke with all, he fastened ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rowe of the pyles with cables and cheynes tyed to posts driuen into the grownd on eyther side of the riuer. When the worke was finished, and two dayes spent in passing ouer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Almane</hi> horsmen: a shippe of great burthen comming downe the streame in the deade of the night, dashed ful ageinst the bridge with such violence, that it shooke the whole work &amp; made it fall asunder. This shippe our men tooke and hild al that side of the riuer, howbeeit for want of good loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:17736:43"/>
to, bycawse they tyed it not with cables ynow, it was caryed away with the violence and swiftnesse of the streame. Therfore it seemed best to make pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for <hi>Mountgomrye</hi> with certein bots and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes fastened togither, whom the <hi>Almane</hi> horsmen which clozed vp his rereward followed immediatly.</p>
            <p>When the Admirall had giuen his sowldiers a feawe dayes respit to refresh themselues, he led them to the Citie of <hi>Tholowse,</hi> and tooke manie of the small townes abowt it, whereof somme yeelded themselues to his tuicion and freendship, and somme were woone by force, and yit had he but twoo battering peeces in his hoste, which he had browgt with him from <hi>Mountalbane.</hi> When he had set those townes at somme stay, he determined to take his iourney to <hi>Viuaret</hi> and to the riuers side of <hi>Rhone.</hi> And bycawse many had put on armour in <hi>Delphinoys</hi> that fauored his side, and hild certein townes there, he sent part of his armie ouer thither, to attemp the wynning of mo Cities if he could. The performance of which charge was committed to <hi>Levvis</hi> of <hi>Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sawe</hi> (of whom I haue made mention before) who passing ouer on a bridge of boats, did strike such a feare into the rest of the people of <hi>Delphinoys,</hi> that they fled all of them intoo the townes. Howbeeit forasmuchas he had no battering peeces, he thought it was not for him to tarrye there any longer, but that he had done ynowgh for the commendacion of his owne valeantnes, and therfore when he had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted their feelds, he browght backe his armie agein
<pb facs="tcp:17736:44"/>
safe to the Admirall within feawe dayes after: which exployt of his purchaced him greate prayse, as well among the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> as among the <hi>Almanes,</hi> both for the noblenesse of his corage, and for his skill in behauing him self.</p>
            <p>Anon after, the Admirall being appalled with ouergreate labour, care, and watching, fell sicke, wherwith although he were sore cumbered, yit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding forasmuchas he thought it best to come to the riuer of <hi>Loyre</hi> with as much speede as might bee, he determyned to tarry long in no place, but cawsed himself too bee conueyed with his armye in a horslitter. For a two thowsand men were assembled abowt <hi>Sharitie</hi> and <hi>Sanxerre,</hi> whom he thowght greatly for his aduantage too bee ioyned with him: and that so much the rather, bycawse <hi>Mounsyre Cossey</hi> the Marshall of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> whom the King had set in the roome of the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> after the victorie at <hi>Santone,</hi> was reported too bee comming towards him with all the Kings power. To whom the Admirall sent woord by a Herault of his that was come intoo his Camp for the raunsoming of prisoners, that <hi>Mounsyre Cossey</hi> should not neede too take so much peynes too come vntoo him, for he would visit him with as much speede as he could, and ease him of the trauell of that iourney. When the armye was come too the Forest, behold there came Commissioners ageine from the King too treate of composition and peace. For when the Courtyers heard that the Admirall (who a litle
<pb facs="tcp:17736:44"/>
afore seemed too bee forlorne and past hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie) had gathered so greate a power ageine and renewed his armye: they were striken in great feare, least the Admirall ioyning with the power of <hi>Sharitie,</hi> shoulde come ryghtfoorth too <hi>Paris,</hi> and set fyre vppon the goodly howses and pleasant manours of the Burgesses of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of the Courtyers neere abowt the Citie, after which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they had heard that he had plaged the Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Tholowse.</hi> When the Admirall had gone part of his iourney by horslitter (as I sayd before) his diseaze began to growe sorer vppon him, and the phisicions letted not to say, that he could not long indure the force of it, specially being ouerloden with so manie cares. And therfore the talke of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners was broken of, &amp; the treatie of peace was let alone for a time, which intermission when certein noblemen of great authority among the protestants, tooke in displeazure bicause of the prolonging of the warres, &amp; made complaint to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Commissioners that it was not meete y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of peace should be broken of for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sicknes of the Admirall being but one man, for though he happened to die, he should leaue a great sort alyue behynd him, with whom they might treat of composition: the Commissioners made them answere, that they woondered very much to see, that they perceyued not of what estimation the authoritie of their Admirall was: for if he should dye to day (quoth they,) tomorrowe wee would not offer you a cuppe of water, as who should say, yee knewe
<pb facs="tcp:17736:45"/>
not that the only name of the Admiral is more worth among you, than such another armie as greate as this. Within feawe dayes after, when the Admirall was sommewhat cheered, and strengthened, they fell to consulting agein of peace, and certein were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen too go with the Kings Commissioners, and to carye these Instructions with them. That nothing was more wished of the protestants than peace, nor nothing greeued them worse than warre: but yit ther was not any of them, which minded not to aduenture much greeuowser peynes, yea and death it self, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to forsake Gods Religion which they had professed. Wherfore if the king woold graunt them libertie too vse the pure religion, as he had doone in former yeeres, and priuiledge certeine townes for the same: there was none of them all but he woold most willingly and gladly lay away weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer. The Admirall hauing giuen theis instructions too the Commissioners, dislodged his Campe, and ere long after tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Towne of <hi>Reneleduc</hi> in his way, whither certein of the foreryders of Mounsyre <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seyes</hi> hoste were come. And from thenceforth there scaped not almost any day without somme skirmish: and one day the hartes of all the sowldyers were so inflamed too battell, that a little more woold haue made the matter too haue coome too a pitched feeld, bycawse that wheras there was but a Brooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene bothe the hostes, <hi>Mountgomrey</hi> breaking the aray of the aduersaries Uaward (wherof one Mounsyre <hi>Valet</hi> a <hi>Gascon,</hi> a man of greate estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:17736:45"/>
in his Countrie had the leading) did put them too flyght.</p>
            <p>Within feawe dayes after, the king sent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners agein too the Camp, too ask trewce, but so long till the things concerning the composition myght bee dispatched. For the Burgesses of <hi>Paris</hi> (who were of verie great estimation with the king) were sore afraid of the wastings and burnings that were threatened them: nother is there any kynd of people in all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> that is more feerce in prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre when it is farre of from their doores, nor more cowardly in accepting any conditions of peace whan warre commes home to them. When the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners had gone too and fro on both sides a good sort of tymes, at length an Edict was browght from the King, wherby he gaue men leaue to exercyze and maynteine the Religion in certeine places, and for the assuring therof, gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fower cities in pledge, namely <hi>Rochell, Mountalbane, Conyak,</hi> and <hi>Sharitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this peace (which is reckened as the third) was made, and the Kings Edict proclaymed ouer all <hi>Fraunce:</hi> the Admirall hauing first conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home the <hi>Almane</hi> horsmen to the borders of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> browght backe the twoo yong Princes (of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and <hi>Condey</hi>) too <hi>Roehell</hi> too the Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> determyning too abyde there, vntill he might perceiue that the peace was throwghly setled euerywhere. Within feawe moonethes, trusting too the Kings promises, and too the othes both of the King himself, and of his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and of all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamentes,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:46"/>
forasmuche as he hoped that after the owtwearing of so manie toyles, he should now gette some rest, he inclined his mind too mariage agein, at the perswasion of his freends, and specially being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited by the kinsfolk of the Lady <hi>Iaquet</hi> of <hi>Moulet,</hi> the widow of the Lord <hi>Antonie Moulet,</hi> ¶ daughter of the Countie <hi>Entremont,</hi> of whose modestie, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and holie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation he had herd much a good while ago. Therfore being honorably browght vnto him too <hi>Rochell,</hi> he tooke hir too his wife. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while after, he gaue a dawghter of his named <hi>Loyse,</hi> in mariage too Mounsyre <hi>Telignie,</hi> a yoong Gentleman of great Nobilitie and singular vertew. No gentleman in all <hi>Fraunce</hi> seemed more dere and delightfull too the king, than this <hi>Telignie</hi> was, for his singular towardnesse. And therfore it is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon brute among all men, that this mannes report was the only thing that perswaded the Admirall, too conceiue good opinion of the kings faithfulnesse and fauour towardes him.</p>
            <p>Anon after, in the yeere of our Lord. 1571, the Admirall being inuited by moste gentle and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble letters of the kings, repaired too the Court then lying at <hi>Bloys,</hi> and was requested too bée the maker of the mariage betweene the kings sister, and <hi>Henry</hi> the yoong king of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> [for the better bringing wherof too passe] the King had declared by his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers and commissioners, that there could not bee deuized a more sure bond too link toogither the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik peace and concord, nor a certeiner meanes too
<pb facs="tcp:17736:46"/>
bring all the states too an attonement. Within a feawe dayes after the Admiralles departure, the yoong Duke of <hi>Gwyse</hi> being perswaded by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the Cardinall his vncle, and by his moothers inticement, began too renew the old quarell of hys fathers murther. The King therfore vsing his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the matter, did set downe a forme of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which he determined too haue them bothe sworne vntoo, and too confirme it with their seales, so as all rememberance of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dissension should bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly wiped away. Notwithstanding, when as the Duke of <hi>Gwyse</hi> came too <hi>Paris</hi> within a feawe dayes after with a greate traine of armed men, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall (who was then gone home too <hi>Shattilion,</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certified therof by <hi>Telignie</hi> his sonne in lawe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested the king too giue him leaue to keepe somme conuenient garde about him in his house: the King wrate to him with his owne hand, (which letter was deliuered too Mounsyre <hi>Brikmavv,</hi> a man of greate estimation, too cary vnto him) that he liked very well that he should take as good heede too himself as he could, giuing him leaue too gard himself &amp; his castle with as great a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie as he listed: and he required him too trust too his good will towards him, and not too dowt but that he should bothe hope for and looke for as much maintenance at his hand, as any good subiect might looke for at a good princis hand. This letter indited with manie woordes too that purpoze, many men red with greate pleasure, bycawse it was wrytten with the Kings owne hand: and now they
<pb facs="tcp:17736:47"/>
thowght that his good will towardes the Admirall was not too bee dowted of anie more. In respect wherof, <hi>Levvis</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> of whom I haue made mention afore, thinking that it was not for him too let slip this occasion of speeding his owne affaires, began to breake with the king (who had inuited him secretly too the Court) on the behalf of his brother the Prince of <hi>Orendge,</hi> and told him how there were manie Cities in Lowe <hi>Duchland,</hi> which were so we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of the madnesse, lecherie, couetousnesse and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of the <hi>Spanyardes,</hi> that if he woold reache them his helping hand, they woold willingly and gladly submit themselues too his tuicion and iurisdiction. When certein dayes had bin spent abowt this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at length the king made the Countie of <hi>Nassawe</hi> faithfull promis, that he woold send the Admiral thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther owt of hand with a great power: and it was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenanted betwixt them, that if that warre had good successe, then the King should haue all the Lowe Countrie from <hi>Antwarp</hi> too <hi>Picardie:</hi> and <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> and <hi>Fryzeland</hi> should bee left too the Prince of <hi>Orendge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Abowt the same time were letters intercepted from Cardinall <hi>Perlewe</hi> too the Cardinall of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine:</hi> the conteintes wherof were, that the king was neuer in better mynd, and therfore he was in verye good hope of the prosperous successe of their comon conceites, by reason of the singular earnestnesse of the king himself, and of the Queene Moother, and of <hi>Henry</hi> the Duke of <hi>Aniow.</hi> For the king had beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:17736:47"/>
himself much more wysely, and played his part farre more cunningly at the Admiralles comming too the Court, than anie of them had looked for: by meanes wherof the king had made the Admirall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that there was no occasion left why he should suspect him, or think amisse of his good wil towards him, which thing the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrein</hi> knew wel ynowgh too bee the growndwoork of all the deuyce which they had in hand. And wheras communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ministered of making warre vppon the king of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and the king had accepted the same with so free a corage, as the Admirall conceiued verye good opinion of his good will towardes him: those shiftes were too bee pursewed, till their secret prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyze might take his expected euent. As for the king of <hi>Spayne,</hi> he was diligently informed of all things, and such meanes vsed, as he should not mislyke of the preparature of warre that was pretended too owt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward showe, bycawse all those things were applyed too the accomplishing of a singular good purpose. Therfore whatsoeuer the Cardinall had herd too haue bin doone afore, or should heere herafter: let him assure himself that the king wold not start from the thing that he had once begonne. For whatsoeuer was doone or too bee doone, was directed and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too the end of their determined purpose: and there was not anie thing wherof the king, and his mother, and his brother had so great a care. Wherfore as soone as the matter were dispatched, he woold wryte too the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrein</hi> with all speede, &amp; send
<pb facs="tcp:17736:48"/>
him a sure and faithfull messenger for the nonce. As towching the king of <hi>Nauarres</hi> mariage, he hoped it woold bee browght of a hand within a little while. For that must sette their matters abroche. In the which meane season, the time that was appoynted for the laying of the fower townes too pledge woold bee ronne owt.</p>
            <p>He that sent the Admirall the copie of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hoped that the reading therof woold forewarne him too take heede too himself, and too lay for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his state. But he trusted so much too the kings faithfulnesse and great good wil towards him, (spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bycawse it was confirmed by the continewall perswasions of his sonnylawe <hi>Telignie</hi>) that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in all other things he seemed most sharpwitted, and of very greate foresight, in this one cace he was by a kynd of destinie stark blynd. Howbeeit foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there is a treatise set foorth alredy, intitled the declaration of the Hellish slawghter, conteyning the discourse of the whole matter, with the tragicall issew therof, and the celebrating of the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarres</hi> mariage with all maner of pomp and royaltie of showes: I will as now set downe no more but the things that concerne the last time of the Admiralles life, wherof I haue gotten most certein testimonies. Notwithstanding, I will first set downe a copie of a letter which he wrate the self same day with his own hand from <hi>Paris,</hi> too his wife then great with chyld. For seing I had the originall copie in my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which seemed to cary greate weyght with it for the setting
<pb facs="tcp:17736:48"/>
foorth of the truth of the storie: I thowght it was not to be let passe in this place. And therfore I haue tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated it thus, in maner woord for woord. Greeting. This day (my right deer beloued wife) is the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the kings sister, &amp; of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. Theis next .3. dayes wilbe spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in playes, ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettings, masks &amp; triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phs. The king hath promised me faithfulli, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> afterward he wil bestow some time in heering the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are brought to him from sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry partes of his realme for violating of his edict of peace. In which matter it is good right that I should imploy myself to the vttermost of my power. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue great desire to see thee, yit wold it be a greef both to me, &amp; to thee also (as I think) if my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuer &amp; duetie should want in the furtherance of that matter. Neuertheles, this let wil not stay my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the Citie so long, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may come away the next weeke. If I had no further respect tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my self, it were more pleasure for mee too bee with thee, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tary any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in this Court, for causes which thou shalt know of mee when I comme home. But I must haue more regard of the comon weale, than of priuate loue or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie. I haue diuers other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs too impart too thee, as soone as I may conueniently talke with thee, wherof I assure thee I am desirous night and day. But all that I can tell thee of as now, is this. It was this day past fower of the clocke in the afternoone, ere the mariage masse was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Whyle that was a singing, the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> walked vp and downe with certein noblemen of our
<pb facs="tcp:17736:49"/>
Religion which followed him, in a certein yard with owt the Churche. There are a nomber of smaller things, which I will deferre till wee may talk too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. In the meane while I beseeche God too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue thee my deerbeloued and moste louing wife. At <hi>Paris</hi> the .18. of August. 1572. A three dayes ago I was diseased with the cholik and the stone. But (as God woold) it lasted not past a .9. or .10. howres: and as now (such is Gods goodnesse) I am free from all such peynes. I promis thee I will trubble none of them in the thronges of their feastes &amp; playes. Once agein Farewell. The subscription of the letter was this: Thy louing husband, <hi>Shattilion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The .5. day after the Date of this letter, which was the .22. day of August, as the Admirall went homeward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kings counsel abowt dinner time, and passed by the house of <hi>Villemure</hi> a canon, schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister too the yoong Duke of <hi>Gwyse,</hi> he was stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a hargabus shot owt of a Lattiswindowe, and wownded in three places. For the forefinger of his ryght hand was broken in peeces, and hys left arme shot throwgh with two pellets of brasse: which thing the foremencioned storie of the hellish slawgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hathe breefly towched. Hervppon the Phisicions and Surgions were sent for owt of hand, among whom was <hi>Ambrose Parey</hi> the Kings Surgion, which was takent too haue greate skill in Leache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. He that was witnesse of the things insewing, did bothe see them and also hold vp the Admiralles arme as he lay vppon his bed. The sayd <hi>Ambrose</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17736:49"/>
began his cure at the broozed finger, and did cut it of not without putting his patient to great peyne. For inasmuch as his pinsons were not sharp ynowgh, he was fayne to open them thryce, and thryce to grype them ageine togither. Afterward he launced bothe the sids of his left arme where the pellets had perced through: the peyne wherof the Admirall abode, not only with a stowt corage, but also with a stedfast cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Yea and wheras they that hild vp his armes and behild those launcings were not able to forbeare weeping: the Admirall perceyuing them too bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd, sayd vnto them. Why weepe yee my freends? I thinke my self blissed in suffering these wounds for Gods name sake. And therw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all looking vppon <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> a minister of Gods word, my freends (quoth he) these are Gods benefits. In deede I am full of peine: but I acknowledge this to bee the will of our Lord God, and I think his maiestie that he hath voutsafed me so greate honour, as to lay somme crosse vppon mee for his moste holie names sake. Therfore let vs pray him too graunt mee the gyft of perseuerance. Then beholding <hi>Merlyne</hi> moorning and lamenting. My <hi>Merlyne</hi> (quoth he) why dost thou not rather comfort mee? Yee say truth sir (aunswered <hi>Merlyne</hi>) nother is there any greater or surer comfort for you, than to thinke continually that God doth you greate honour, in deeming you worthye to suffer these greefes for his name and religions sake. My <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyne</hi> (replyed the Admirall) if God should handle mee according to my deserts and woorthynesse, and
<pb facs="tcp:17736:50"/>
deale with mee according too his iustice: I shoulde haue farre other maner of greefes too indure. But blessed bee his Name for vsing his mercie and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie towards mee his moste vnwoorthie seruant. O Sir (quoth another) hold yee still in that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye mynd. For you haue cawse too giue greate than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes too him for his goodnesse, in that he hathe left you the moste part of your bodie whole and sownde. Therefore you haue in these wowndes a greater warrant of Gods mercye, than token of his wrath: specially sith he hath lefte you your head and mynde vnwounded. Then answered <hi>Merlyne,</hi> You do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye well too turne awaye your mynde and conceyt from your strykers, and from them that gaue you these wowndes, vntoo God alone. For surely it was his hand that layd these strokes vppon you, and it is no tyme for you too thinke now vppon the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throts and murtherers. As for mee (quoth the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) vndowtedly I forgiue freely and with all my hart both him that strake me, and them that did set the striker to do it. For I am sure it is not in their power too do mee anye harme, no not euen thowgh they shoulde kill mee: for I am out of all dowt, that deathe is too mee a passage vntoo lyfe, which say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he repeted ageine anon after too the Marshal <hi>Mounsyre Damuyle,</hi> who came too him too visit him, in the heering of <hi>Merlyne,</hi> who escaped the slawghter and is yit still alyue. And when the same <hi>Merlyne</hi> told him that the calamities and myseryes which happen too godly men in this lyfe, do comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:17736:50"/>
stirre them vp to pray vnto God the more earne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly, and quicken them vp to reuerence Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: by and by the Admiral did burst out into these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des with a lowd voyce and vehement corage, saying: Lord God, heauenly father, pitie me of thy mercie and clemencie, and remember not the wickednesse of my former life. If thou looke vppon our faults, and vppon our lightnesse and vnfaythfulnes in breaking of thy Lawes, Lord who shall abide it? who shalbe able to indure the force of thy wrath? Setting aside all fabulous Gods, I call vppon thee alone, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging and worshipping thee the etetnall father of the eternall God Iesus Christ, Throwgh him I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee to graunt mee thy holy spirit, and the gift of pacience. In thine only mercy do I trust. In that only is my whole hope repozed. Whither it be thy will to giue me present death, or to prolong my life yit longer, behold, I protest my self to bee readie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bothe: nothing dowting but that if I must die out of hand, thou wilt take mee out of hand intoo thy blessed and heauenly rest. And if thow suffer mee too continewe longer in this life, graunte mee O heauenly Father, that I maye spende the reste of my time, all wholly in spreading abrode the glorie of thy name, and in the reuerencing and obseruing of thy most holy religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When he had ended this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Merlyne</hi> asked of him neuerthelesse, whyther it could like him that his Seruants should also ioyne their prayers with his. To whom the Admirall answered, with all my hart, and you Mayster
<pb facs="tcp:17736:51"/>
               <hi>Merlyne</hi> speake on in the behalfe of this our congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. While <hi>Merlyne</hi> was vttering a praier appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the present cace, the Admiral lifting vp his eies to heauen, shewed a wonderfull earnestnesse of mynd in praying. After the end of the praier, when <hi>Merline</hi> alledged the examples of the auncient Martyrs, and told how that euen from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> no man had euer imployed his seruis notably to God &amp; his Churche, but he was afflicted with many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences: the Admirall interrupting his speeche, sayd he felt himselfe greatly confirmed by his talke, and tooke greate comfort by his rehersall of those Martyres and godly fathers, and that his greef was much asswaged by it.</p>
            <p>Soone after, <hi>Mounsyre Cossey</hi> &amp; <hi>Mounsyre Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyle</hi> the Marshalls of <hi>Fraunce</hi> came vnto him, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were very sorie for his mischaunce, and that there had not happened any thing to them a good whyle, that was a greater greef and corzie too them: neuerthelesse it was meete and agreeable too the wonted corage of his mind, that he should plucke vp his hart &amp; shew himself a man: for his owne prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse had giuen him much more, than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mishapp could take away. Then the Admirall turning to <hi>Cossey,</hi> said: You remember what I told you a while ago: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowtedly you must abide as much your selfe. Then said the <hi>Damuyle,</hi> my Lord Admiral, I wil not take vppon me either to comfort you or to incorage you to valeantnes and constancie of mind. You your self are he from whom such precepts of comfort and corage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owsnesse
<pb facs="tcp:17736:51"/>
are to bee taken. But I pray you see wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my seruis may pleasure you. I maruell whence these things come. The Admirall answered: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Duke of <hi>Gvvyse,</hi> I suspect none: and yit I dare not affirme that for a certeintie. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, Gods goodnesse hath lately tawght mee, to feare nother myne enemyes nor yit death, which I knowe to be vtterly vnable to hurt me, &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a blessed and euerlasting rest. For I know that God in whom alone I put my trust, is nother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytfull nor vntrew: howbeeit that in this my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nothing hath happened more to my greef, than that I see my selfe bereft of libertie, to shewe to the King how much I was mynded to haue doone for his sake: (his saying so, was in respect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning <hi>Flaunders.</hi>) Would God I myght talke a litle w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, for I haue certein things which it standeth him greatly on hand to know, and I think there is not any man that dareth report them vntoo him.</p>
            <p>In the meane season the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condey,</hi> complayned to the King of the heynowsenesse of the fact. To whom the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered thus: I sweare by God whom I take too witnesse, that I will reuenge this fact so seuerely, as it may bee an example too all that shall come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The woman that was fownd in the howse (wherowt of the Hargabut was shot at the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,) and a boy of hirs were taken and cast in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon. Abowt twoo of the clocke in the afternoone,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:52"/>
the King being certified of the Admiralls desyre, went vntoo him, accompanyed with the Queene moother, the Kings twoo brothers, the Duke <hi>Mounpauncer,</hi> the Cardinalls of <hi>Burbon, Mounsyre Damuyle, Mounsyre Tauanne,</hi> and <hi>Mounsyre Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> Marshalls of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Countie of <hi>Rhets, Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre Torrey</hi> and <hi>Mounsyre Meruey</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Damuyles</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, after whom followed <hi>Gonzaga</hi> Duke of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</hi> At the first the King commaunded all that were of the Admirals howshold to be shet out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, sauing <hi>Mounsyre Telignie</hi> and his wife, and one persone that scaped alyue from the slawghter, who marked aduyzedly what was doone and sayd at that time. When the king was come to the bedds side, I thanke your maiestie most humbly (quoth the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) that you haue vowtsafed me so great honour, and taken so great peines for my sake. The King preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gladnes for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great corage of his mynd, willed him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> very faire words to hope well, &amp; to be of good confort. Sir (quoth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admiral) ther are three things wherof I was desirous to talk w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your maiestie. The first is myne owne faythfulnes &amp; allegeance towards your highnesse. So may I haue the fauour &amp; mercie of God, at whose iudgmentseate this mischaunce wil peraduenture set mee ere it bee long, as I haue euer borne a good hart to your maiesties person &amp; crown. And yit I am not ignorant how oft maliciowse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones haue accuzed me too your highnesse, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mee as a trubbler of the state. But (as God would) the matter it selfe hath sufficiently shewed,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:52"/>
thowgh I my selfe should hold my peace, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cawse of all those greate slaunders is, that I haue withstoode those mennes ouerboldnes and owtrage, and defended the authoritie of your Edicts ageinst their trubblesum and violent attempts, and could not beare that they should breake the promis which you had made so often with othe vntoo your subiects. Of this my meening God is best witnesse, who will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the cace betweene me and my backefreends, and decyde it according to his righteowsensse. Agein, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuchas I haue bin aduaunced to so greate honour and authoritie in this Realme by your maiesties fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and graundfather, and confirmed in the same by your bownteowsenesse: I cannot discharge my dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards you, without making humble petition to you, too vowtsafe too remedie the greate number of hurlyburlyes that haue kept your Realme occupyed now a good whyle. Now come I too the <hi>Flaunders</hi> matter. Neuer any of your aunceters had so notable an occasion of welspeeding. Many Cities of nether <hi>Dutcheland</hi> do sew for your frendship, as you know, and are desirous to commit them selues to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. This occasion I see to bee openly skorned in your Court, and to bee taken from you throwgh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault of a feaw. Now alate, the army that <hi>Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>syre Genlys</hi> led, was surpryzed of the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> by a trayne, and for the most part discomfited and put too the swoord. You knowe what a sort of Catholikes were in that armie. Now what Religion suppoze you them too bee of, or what mynd thinke you that
<pb facs="tcp:17736:53"/>
they beare towards their owne countrymen and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the same religion, which make but a mock at so greate slawghter of them? A strawe can scarce be stirred in your secret counsell, nor any voyce bee vttered there, but it is byandby caryed too the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> I beseeche you, can wee hope for any thing, when they that are of the priuie counsell with your self or your brothers, do blowe abrode euen your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretest deuyces too straungers, yea and to your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes? Sir, I would verye fayne that you had a care of this thing, and I beseeche you so haue hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The last, which I would wish you too haue no lesse care of, is the obseruing of your Edict of paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. You knowe you haue oftentymes confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it by othe: and you knowe that not only forrein nacions, but also your neybowrprinces and freends are witnesses of the oft renewing of the same othe. O Sir, how vnseemely is it that this your othe should bee counted welneere but for a iest and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage, as it is now comonly taken. Will forrein Princes and nacions make any account hereafter of you or of your promis? Within these feawe dayes past, as a Nurce was carrying home of a yong babe from baptim not farre from <hi>Troys</hi> in <hi>Shampayne,</hi> and was returning from a sermon that was made in a certeine village by you assigned for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poze: certeine seditiowse persones which lay in wait by the way, killed both the Nurce and the chyld, and somme of the companie which had bin bidden to the Christening,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17736:53"/>Consider I beseeche you how horrible the owt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of that murther was, and how well it may stand with your honour and dignitie, too suffer so greate owtrages vnreuenged and vnpunished in your king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Too this his oration the king answered thus: that he neuer dowted of his faythfulnesse, but tooke him for a good subiect, a valeant man, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Captein, euen for such a one as none was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable too him in all his Realme. And if I had had any other opinion of you (<hi>quoth</hi> he): I woold neuer haue doone as I did. It was marked aduyzedly, that the King answered not one woord concerning the <hi>Flaunders</hi> affaires, and that he answered to the third poynt thus. That he ment nothing more than that his Edictes of pacification should bee kept faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and seuerely: and that for the same cawse he had sent commissioners intoo all partes of his Realme, for witnesse wherof he cyted foorthwith the Queene his moother, who turning too the Admirall, sayd, my Lord, there is nothing trewer: Commissioners are sent foorth intoo all partes. Yea (<hi>quoth</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall) of that sort of men which valewed my head at the pryce of fiftie thowsand Crownes. Then sayd the King, my Lord Admirall, it is too bee feared least this contention impaire your health, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for yow too take your rest, the hurt is yours, but the despyte is myne. But I sweare too you by the lyfe of God, that I will punish this fact so seuerely, as it shalbee remembered for euer. Wee haue a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a boy in prizon, which were taken in the
<pb facs="tcp:17736:54"/>
howse. Is it your desire too haue anie too sit vppon the examinacion and iudgment of them? As for that matter (<hi>quoth</hi> the Admirall) I referre it too your maiesties owne discretion and iustice. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, forasmuch as you requyre mine aduice, I wold wish that Mounsyre <hi>Cauanie,</hi> and Mounsyre <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parotte</hi> were called too the dooing of it. Also the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall named a third persone, but he that is the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this talke hath forgotten his name. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall added, surely I think there needes no farre serche too bee made for the author of this deede. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theis woords the king and the Queene Mother went neerer the Admirals pillow, and talked w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him softly. Of which communication he that stoode by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beds side could heere nothing else, but that at the last the Queene sayd, Although I be but a woman, yit I am of opinion that it is to be loked too betimes. The king at his going away, connseled the Admirall too bee remoued into the palace: and so sayd the Countie <hi>Rets</hi> once or twice too the Admirals sonnylaw, &amp; too the other that stoode at the beds side: adding further, that he feared that the men of <hi>Paris</hi> woold make such a stirre, as the king shuld not wel be able to appeaze. It was answered him that none of all the Surgions allowed that deuyce, but were all of opinion, that the peyne of his wounds being so greene, wold increace by the shaking of his bodie. And as for the <hi>Parisians,</hi> they were no more too bee feared than a sort of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, so long as the king continued his faithfull good will towardes the Admirall: For the name of King
<pb facs="tcp:17736:54"/>
was of such estimation euery where throwghout all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and specially in <hi>Paris,</hi> that the very menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof woold owt of hand appeaze the comon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were they neuer so furiowse &amp; out of their right wits. Then the king wold needes see the brazen pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let wherwith the Admirall was wounded, and asked of him whither he felt anie great peine when his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was cut of, and his arme launced. And wheras he that shewed him the pellet, had the sleeue of hys cote alberayed with blud: the king demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of him, whither that were doone with the Admirals blud or no, and whither much blud had issewed from hys woundes or no. Too whom the other answered as he thowght good: Then, I am sure (<hi>quoth</hi> the king) that there is not a stowter nor a constanter man too bee found this day in the world: and therwithall he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him the pellet agein. Which when his mother co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming after him had behild, I am glad (<hi>quoth</hi> she) that the pellet is owt of his flesh: for I remember, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Gwise</hi> was slain in his camp, some surgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s told me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although ther had bin some poison mixed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it, yit there was no dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger when the pellet was once out. Then said another, Madame, we were not so contented, but we gaue the Admiral a drink, to help him betimes if any poyson had bin mixed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Anon after whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king was gone out, the Lord <hi>Iohn Ferrers</hi> the Uidame of <hi>Sharters</hi> entering intoo the Admiralles chamber, and comforting hym with manie woordes, added at the last, that his enemyes had openly bewrayed their cowardlinesse, in that
<pb facs="tcp:17736:55"/>
they durst not assaile him otherwise than at a Lattis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windowe: and that the Admiral was blissed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, in that he had hild owt in renowme of so greate prowesse vntoo that age. Too whom the Admirall answered: Nay, I think my self blessed in that God hath vowtsafed too powre owt his mercie vpon me. For they bee rightly happie, whose sinnes and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse God forgiueth. Not long after, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> &amp; of the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dey,</hi> the cheef Lords went toogither intoo a parlour vnderneathe the Admiralles chamber, too see what counsell might bee taken as the matter and tyme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. There the Lord <hi>Ferrers</hi> shewed wyth manie earnest woordes, that the best was too get them spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily owt of <hi>Paris,</hi> for it was not too bee dowted, but that this was as the first pageant of some tragedie, wherof the rest should followe soone after. Others reasoned ageinst it, saying it was ynowgh if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded Iustice at the kings hand, so as he should commaund an inquirie too bee made of the fact, and iudgment too bee executed accordingly: in which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion Mounsyre <hi>Telignie</hi> stoode very stifly, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he knew the kings mind throwghly and assuredly, and therfore that they owght not too think amisse of his good will.</p>
            <p>The next day, certeine of the Admirals freends hauing aduertizement that there was much huffling and shuffling in the Citie, and priuie conueying of armour &amp; weapon togither in manie places: thought it very expedient too consult of the matter betymes,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:55"/>
and that no good was too bee looked for of such tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyling and huddling toogither. Hervppon charge was giuen to one of them that are witnesses of theis things, too go too the king, and too certifie him of the stirring of the people and the clattering of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and therwithall too request him too co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund somme competent nomber of his gard to kepe watch at the Admiralles gate, for his defence. As soone as the king herd that, byandby beeing sore displeazed with it (as it seemed) and marueling at it, he began too inquire of him who had told it him, and whither it were reported so too the Admiral: and therwithall commaunded the Countie Rhetes to call the Quene his moother. The Queene was scarce come in, but the king being in a greate chafe (as it should seeme) sayd, what a mischeef? What a doo is heere? This man telles mee that the people are in an vprore, and redy too put on armour. They bee in no vprore, sayd shee, nother doo they arme themselues: but you know you haue giuen commaundment, that euery man should keepe himself within his owne warde till the breake of day, least any tumult myght perchaunce insew. That is trew (<hi>quoth</hi> the king) but yit I gaue charge that no man should put on armour. Then the other man, too go throwgh with the rest of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, desired the king too send sum part of his gard too the Admirall. Too whom the Duke of <hi>Angeow,</hi> who was comme thither with his moother, sayd: ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, take Mounsyre <hi>Cossins</hi> too yow with fiftie Hargabuttes. No (<hi>quoth</hi> the other) it is ynowgh
<pb facs="tcp:17736:56"/>
for vs if wee may haue but six of the kings gard with vs. For they shall beare as much sway with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as a greater number of armed men. Nay mary, (<hi>quoth</hi> the King) and so said the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> too, take Mounsyre <hi>Cossins</hi> too yow: yow cannot chooze a fitter man. At which woordes, vttered (as it should seeme) with stomack inough, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> messenger who knew Mounsyre <hi>Cossins</hi> to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admirals deadly enemie, was notwithstanding stryken dumb. And ere he was gone farre from the chamber, he fownd Mounsyre <hi>Thorrey</hi> the Marshall <hi>Memorancies</hi> brother, who whispering in his eare, sayd: there could not a more hatefull keeper haue bin appoynted too yow. Too whom the other answered, yow see how skornfully the king commaunded it: wee haue committed our selues too his courtesie: but yit yow are witnesses of my former answer too the kings appoyntment.</p>
            <p>Within a feaw howres after, Mounsyre <hi>Cossins</hi> came too the Admirals lodging, accompanied with 50. hargabutters: and choze twoo howses next it for himself to place his warders in. And anon after folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed <hi>Rambulet</hi> the knyght Herbinger, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding too the Duke of <hi>Angeowes</hi> mynd, which he had giuen foorth in his former talk, commaunded all the noblemen and gentlemen that were Catholikes, too remoue owt of that streete, and too lodge sumwhere else, and distributed those lodgings too the Admirals freends &amp; acquaintance. Than the which deuice none could be inuented either more suttle or fitter for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the things that came to passe afterward.
<pb facs="tcp:17736:56"/>
Towardes the euening there happened a thing that gaue many men no small occasion of mistrust. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein lad browght a cupple of borespeares to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals lodging by the commaundme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Thelignie,</hi> whom <hi>Cossins</hi> bade backe, and woold not suffer the borespeares too bee caryed in. The matter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who was within with the Admirall. Whervpon he came downe and asked of <hi>Cossins</hi> how he durst be so bold as to do so. Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre <hi>Cossins</hi> answered him flatly, that he did it by the kings commaundment &amp; appoyntment. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse (<hi>quoth</hi> he) seing it is your pleasure, let them bee caryed in. The same day the king [of <hi>Nauarre</hi>] had sent secretly too his freends, and often warned them too repaire as manie as myght bee, neere vntoo the Admiralles lodging, &amp; too fill all that warde. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in feawe howres after, there was a counsell called vnder the Admiralles chamber, Where <hi>Marline</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the former opinion, was very earnest too haue the Admirall conueyed owt of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that his freendes and familiars should depart with him: for he sawe manie things euery howre, which did greatly increace his mistrust of bad meazure. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwyse, all the residew for the moste part were of opinion that Iustice was too bee demaunded at the Kings hande, and that request was too bee made, that all the <hi>Gwisians</hi> should departe owt of <hi>Paris,</hi> bycawse they bare too muche sway wyth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Towne. Which opinion the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condey,</hi> and well neere all
<pb facs="tcp:17736:57"/>
the rest allowed, and refuzed the other: so much the rather, bycawse Mounsyre <hi>Telignie</hi> auowched that the king should bee wronged, if any man should dout of his faithfulnesse and vpright dealing: wherfore it should suffyze too demaund Iustice meeldly and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly at his hand: for the matter was yit greene, and if any ouergreat stoutnesse should bee vzed, it were too bee feared least the king woold bee offended at it. In that Counsell was present one <hi>Bucauan</hi> a <hi>Picard:</hi> and it was marked that he spake not one woord, but hild his peace &amp; noted euery mannes opinion, which dealing did greatly increace the suspicion that had bin conceyued of him nowe long ago. For manie thowght it straunge, that he professing the purer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, should notwithstanding bee so hyghly in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the Queene Moother, and resort so often too the Countie <hi>Rhetes,</hi> and others of the Queenes familiar freendes.</p>
            <p>Abowt the third howre of the nyght, there rose another occasion of suspicion throwghe Mounsyre <hi>Cossins</hi> frowardnesse: who espying the Corselets of Mounsyre <hi>Telignie,</hi> and Mounsyre <hi>Gvverchie</hi> too bee browght in, did put backe the bringer. Uppon the knowledge wherof, <hi>Gvverchie</hi> being of warlike disposition, and very feerce of nature, went owt too <hi>Cossins,</hi> and giuing him euill language, was like too haue made a fray with him. But <hi>Telignie</hi> appeazed the quarell with gentle speeche: for (as all men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) he was a yoongman of a meeld and meeke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozition, and such a one as being deceiued wyth the
<pb facs="tcp:17736:57"/>
Kings fayre words, was woont to aduance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his sinceritie without meazure or end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when as <hi>Gvverche</hi> and diuers others asked of him whither he thought it good for them to tarie and keepe watch all night in the Admiralls howse, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them all that it was labour more than needed, and gaue them thanks with very louing words. By meanes wherof it fel out, that none lodged in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals house that night, but only <hi>Cornaton, Labon, Yolette</hi> the Mayster of the Admiralls horses, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> the minister of Gods word, <hi>Ambrose</hi> the Kings Surgion, the Admiralls chamberseruants, and a fower or fyue other seruants at the most. For <hi>Telig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> had gotten himself with his wife intoo his owne howse which ioyned wall to wall to the Admiralls lodging. Neuerthelesse there watched fyue <hi>Svvissers</hi> of the King of <hi>Nauarres</hi> gard at the gate of the owt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter court, whom he had commaunded to tarie there all night for the Admiralles defence.</p>
            <p>Sommewhat before daylyght, woorde was browght to <hi>Labon,</hi> that there was one at the gate sent by the King to the Admirall, who desired too bee let in. <hi>Labon</hi> taking the keyes ranne too the gate out of hand and opened it. Byandby <hi>Cossens</hi> cawght hold of him and killed him with his dagger: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing garded with his hargabuzers, he rushed foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with into the howse, &amp; killed somme running away amazed and othersomme as they met him: and set all on a noize and vprore. Then brake he open the doore at the stayers foote, and althowgh he slew one of the
<pb facs="tcp:17736:58"/>
               <hi>Swissers</hi> with the shot of a hargabut: yit was he kept from comming vp the staires, by setting certeine chests in his way. The Admirall and they that were with him, being waked with the noyze of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pistole<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and Curriers, &amp; dowting not but that their enemyes were broken in vpon them, did forthwith fal flat vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground, &amp; began to pray for peace at Gods hand, and too call vnto him for mercie. The Admirall him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being lifted out of his bed, and hauing put on his nightgowne, commaunded <hi>Merlyne</hi> too make pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before him, and he calling vpon Christ our God with vehement sighing, fell too commending of his spirit intoo his hands, which he had receiued of God to inioy. When the witnesse of all theis things came into his chamber, being demaunded of <hi>Ambrose</hi> the Surgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what noyze that was: he turned himself to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admirall and sayd: Sir, it is God that calleth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too him. They haue broken intoo the howse, &amp; there is no way too withstand them. As for mee (<hi>quoth</hi> the Admirall) I haue prepared myself vntoo death afore hand. Shift yow for yourselues if yow can possibly: for it wilbee in vaine for yow too go abowt too saue my life. I commend my sowle to Gods mercy. They that are the witnesses of theis things, noted that the Admirall did no more chaunge his countenance at theis dooings, than if no straunge thing at all had happened vntoo him. All the residew (sauing only <hi>Nicolas Muskie,</hi> a right trustie seruaunt of his, &amp; his interpreter for the <hi>Dutche</hi> tong) getting themselues away intoo the garrettes of the howse, and finding a
<pb facs="tcp:17736:58"/>
windowe in the roofe, fell too shifting for their liues by flight, and diuers of them scaped by the benefite of the night.</p>
            <p>By that time <hi>Cossins</hi> hauing remoued the chests, and the other stoppes that were cast in hys waye, browght in first certein of the <hi>Swissers</hi> apparelled in longcotes garded with blacke, white, and greene, wherby it was perceyued that they were of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of <hi>Aniowes</hi> gard. Theis beholding their fower coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen vppon the stayers, did hurt none of them. But <hi>Cossins</hi> being armed with a Corslet &amp; a sheeld, and brandishing his naked swoord in his hand, did by and by commaunde the hargabuzere that was next him too shoote at them, with which shot one of them was striken stark dead owt of hand. Assoone as they were broken intoo the Admirals chamber, one <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme</hi> a <hi>Germane,</hi> borne in the Dukedome of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg,</hi> (whose father (by report) was the maister of the ordinance,) being the first that stept intoo the chamber, and seeing the Admirall sitting there, said: Art not thou the Admirall? Yis I am he (<hi>quoth</hi> the Admirall:) and thou yoong man haue regard of my hore heade and old age. But <hi>Beheme</hi> without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him any mo woordes, strake him on the heade with his swoord, and was the first that imbrued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the Admiralles blud. After him followed <hi>Cossins, Attignie,</hi> and all the residew. As for the rest of the things that concerne the murthers &amp; saccages y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were done in <hi>Paris</hi> those .2. whole dayes togither, they be recorded alredy in the foresaid discourse of
<pb facs="tcp:17736:59"/>
the hellish manslawghter. The Admiralls bodie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throwne downe out of a windowe, was trampled vnder foote by the yong Duke of <hi>Gvvyse,</hi> and anon after tumbled into the myre in the open streete, and mangled and vsed with all the vilanie that might be, and a three dayes after caried out of the Citie by the furious multitude, and hanged vp by the feete vppon the gallowes of <hi>Mountfalcon.</hi> There it remayned certeine dayes as a banner of the people of <hi>Parisis</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, and as a monument of their madnesse and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, which they executed vppon him bothe quicke &amp; deade: which deede will not only neuer be forgotten, but also bee the destruction of <hi>Paris,</hi> as a nomber of wise and discreete men foredeeme. But within a feaw dayes after, the Admiralls bodie was taken downe in the night by certeine horsmen, and buryed in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place.</p>
            <p>Among diuers wrytings that were taken in the riffeling of his stuffe, was fownd his will, made a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the end of the last warres, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queene moother commaunded too bee red before certeine of hir familiar freends. In the same there was one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, wherin the testator counselled the King, that he should not gine his brothers too greate richesse, and authoritie. At the heering wherof, the Queene turning too <hi>Frauncis</hi> Duke of <hi>Alaunson</hi> the Kings brother, said: Lo heere your odde frend the Admiral, whom you loued so deerely and set so much store by. To whom the Duke of <hi>Alaunson</hi> answered: I cannot tell how much he was my freend: but surely he hath
<pb facs="tcp:17736:59"/>
well shewed, euen by this counsel, how greatly he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the king. Not vnlike too this was the Quene of Inglands Ambassadours answer. Who, when the Queene moother told him that the Admiral had cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seled the king too bee alwayes gelows of the power of Ingland: answered, surely that mind of his was euill towardes Inglande, but singularly good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When tidings of the slaughter at <hi>Paris</hi> was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into <hi>Ingland, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> too such as hild the same Religion of the Gospell which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall had doone: it is incredible too tell how greate hatred it procured too the king and the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, specially forasmuch as in those feawe dayes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ten thowsand Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts being striken in feare, and amazed with that storme, fled intoo those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: who making report that the Admirall was a noble gentleman, a great and wise capteine, and the glorie of their countrie, blazed the authors of that wickednesse for ranke murtherers. Too the increace wherof made also the speeches and complaintes of diuers yoong Gentlemen of <hi>Germanie,</hi> who being sent into <hi>Fraunce</hi> too studie there, and being striken in feare with the sayd storme, returned home for the moste part spoyled and stripped owt of all that euer they had, and therfore cursed not only the owtrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heinousnesse of the fact, but also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole realme of <hi>Fraunce</hi> among their parentes and kinsfolke. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersomme which had serued the Admiral in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer warres, commended his vertue euerywhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb facs="tcp:17736:60"/>
the princes of <hi>Germanie.</hi> For (which is thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght too bee the hardest thing in Martiall affayres) he excelled not only in counsell, but also in prowesse, wheras comonly wisdome breedeth fearfulnesse, and corage breedeth rashnesse. Furthermore, not a fewe which were familiarly acquainted wyth the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals life and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation at home in hys owne house, going abrode among princes, commended him with singular praises for his innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, stayednesse, mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and woonderfull zelowsenesse in following the religion: which thing might bee cheefly perceiued by the inward conuersation of his life at home, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I wil adde sumwhat heere, which I know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie, partly by the record of other men, and partly by mine owne sight and beholding. At his first rizing in the mornings, (which was meetly early adayes) he woold cast his nightgowne abowt him, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe vppon his knees, take vppon him too be as the mouth of his whole companie in praying and calling vppon God. And so the residew kneeled all downe after his example, and Prayer was made in the same maner that is vsed comonly in the <hi>Frenche</hi> Churches. After the end of prayer, looke what time was betweene that and the Sermon time, he besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed it euerywhit, either in hearing of the delegates of the Churches that were sent vntoo him, or in the dispatching of other publik affaires. For afterward, eche other day there was a sermon at warning giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and some certeine Psalme of Dauid was sung. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sermon was done, he returned too his businesse,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:60"/>
vntill dinner time. Which being redie, all his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, sauing a feawe that were occupied abowt dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the meate, came togither into the hall where the table was couered, and there (if there had bin no sermon,) a Psalme of Dauids was sung in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence standing at the table, with his wife standing by his side, and the Table was blissed with ordinarie grace. Which kind of order he was woont too keepe euery day without faile, not only at home &amp; in time of peace, but also euen in the Camp. Wherof not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innumerable Frenchmen, but also a greate nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Almaine Knightes, Capteines, and officers, which were oftentimes bidden too his table, can bee witnesses. As sone as the table was taken away, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andby the Admiral rose vp, and standing on his feete with his wife likewise by him, and the rest of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie that sate with him at his table, did either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pronounce the praier of thanksgiuing vnto God, or cawse it too bee doone by the preacher. And at Supper times, not only the same thing was doone bothe in prayer &amp; in singing of the Psalmes: but also forasmuch as he sawe it woold be harder for him too get all his folk togither too nightprayer at bedtime, bicause that that time was vncerteine by reason of sundrie businesses which they had too doo: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them too be all with him immediatly after supper, and caused the nightprayers to bee sayd as soone as the Psalme was ended. Through the which example, it cannot bee sayde howe manie of the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie tooke vp the same order in theyr
<pb facs="tcp:17736:61"/>
howses: the rather for that the Admirall warned them, that if the maister of a howse intended to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine godlinesse aright, it was not ynowgh for him too frequent sermons, and too leade a godly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie life to himself: vnlesse he did also bring his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and acquaintance too the same trade of life by his example. Certein it is that his godly and holye conuersation was had in so greate admiration euen among them that were of the Catholik side: that if it had not bin for feare of the horrible persecution &amp; butcherie that followed afterward: the greatest part of <hi>Fraunce</hi> had turned too the same religion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of manners. When the time of the Lords supper was at hand, he vsed too call his houshold ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes and reteiners abowt him, and too tell them that he was too yeeld account vntoo God, not only of his owne life, but also of their ordinarie dealings. If any iarre were falne among them, he appeazed it by setting them at one. If any man seemed not altooge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so foreward in vnderstanding and reuerencing that greate misterie as he owght too bee: him did he cause to be instructed more diligently in religion. If any seemed ouer stubborne, he wold tell them openly that he had leuer to dwel at home alone, than to kepe a rowt of leud lozels. Agein, he thought the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of schooles, and the well training vp of yong chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to be the singular benefite of God. This he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the seedleape of the Churche, and the Nurcerie of godlinesse. Affirming that the want of learning had cast a mist, not only vppon the Common weale,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:61"/>
but also vppon Religion: and that the tyranny of the bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had bin bred and borne in that dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, who had reigned ouer the blind and ignorant wretches, as father <hi>Dis</hi> is reported among the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etes too haue reigned ouer night and darknesse. And therfore he founded a schoole in a pleasant &amp; whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some place hard by the <hi>Shattilion</hi> howse, and when he had finished the building of it, at his great cost he mainteined many children and yoongmen there, and manie lerned <hi>Hebricians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Latinistes</hi> too reade those languages too them. Moreouer, of his singular stayednesse this was one proof: that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he was indowed with greate offices of honour, and could haue sowght his owne commoditie, and gleaned riches too himself after the example of other Courtyers: yit did he not purchace one Acre of grownd, nor increace his fathers inheritance wyth one cotage. And although he played the good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in vsing and spending of his owne goodes: yit notwithstanding when any Princes, noblemen, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, or men of any degree came vntoo him, (as they came vntoo him from all partes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowt the publik affaires of the Realme:) loke what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer monny he had gotten before by his sparing, he spent it liberally vppon them in hospitalitie. By meanes wherof it is certein, that he left his heires or successors charged with the dette, of not so little as fortie thowsand powndes, besides the yeerly loan of six thowsand powndes, which he payd too his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors for interest. And I must not heere let passe in
<pb facs="tcp:17736:62"/>
silence, the incredible vnitie of minde, loue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that was betwene the three brethren <hi>Shattili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which was so greate, that there seemed too bee but one mynd made of all the three.</p>
            <p>The Admirall liued three and fiftie yeeres, six monethes, and eight dayes. He was of stature meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tall, of colour ruddie, of all his members well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned and agreeable, of countenance stable and cheerfull, of voyce gentle and sweete, howbeeit of speeche sommewhat slowe and soft: of helth meetly good, of gesture and gate comly, specially when he was at home in his gowne, walking with his wife or his freendes: a small drinker of wine euen by nature, measurable in meate and sleepe, for comonly he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted not aboue seuen howres. And since the tyme of the last pacification, he suffered no day to passe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he entered not intoo his daybooke with his owne hand, before he laid him downe too sleepe, the things that seemed woorth the noting in the former ciuill warres. Which being fownd after his death, and browght too the kings cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell, purchaced him great commendacion for his quiet and vncombered mind, euen among such as hated him moste. Besides this, when the warre was once ended, and he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen himself too <hi>Rochell,</hi> as is sayd afore: he let no day passe without reading one of <hi>Caluins</hi> Sermons vppon the storie of Iob bothe morning and euening: which storie he termed oftentimes the comfort of his sowle, and his necessarie medicine at all assayes in all his aduersities. By his first wife he had fiue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb facs="tcp:17736:62"/>
of whom he left aliue, his eldest daughter <hi>Loys</hi> maryed (as is sayd heertoofore) vntoo Mounsyre <hi>Telignie,</hi> who was murthered in the same furiows slawghter, the selfsame night that his father in lawe was: and also <hi>Frauncis Odette</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> of whom the twoo eldest were conueyed speedily from the butcherly slawghter, and the third which was but seuen yeere old and eyght moonethes, whom his father loued moste intierly for his pleasant concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse, being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the aduersaries, was tawght too beare Christes crosse euen from the pryme of his chyldhod. The Admirall left his later wife with childe of a dawghter, wherof shee was deliuered a fower moonethes after, and then returning home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too the borders of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> was committed too warde within feawe moonethes after, by the commaundment of <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the Prince of that Countrie.</p>
