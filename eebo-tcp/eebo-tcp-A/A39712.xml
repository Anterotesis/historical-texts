            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Promis'd you a Play, and to avoid farther importunity) behold it here. I cod not promise you it shud be Acted, (for having no interest in the Stage, I leave that to those who have;) you may think it a preposterous way to Print it before it be Acted; but Printing it as I do, (to pass to private hands, not to the publick) may no more prejudice it, then the first dayes Acting do's the second; which if good, commends it but the more. It will want much of the grace and ornament of the Stage; but though thÃªre it be better seen, yet here 'tis better understood; mean while, a lively fancy may imagine he sees it Acted: and to help the imagination, I have set down the Scenes, the Habits, and Names of the Actors,
<pb facs="tcp:42092:4"/>
who though I chiefly intitle, to the right of acting it, yet I intend not to depart with the Poets right of directing how it shud be Acted. To conclude, I hope it may no wayes prejudice it in opinion, to have him for Author who may say without vanity, that none knows more of the <hi>English</hi> Stage then he, nor has seen more of the <hi>Latine, French, Spanish</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi>; nor may it prejudice him to be the Authour of it, (whatsoever the ignorant and envious say) of the same Profession with <hi>Petre Ronsard</hi> in <hi>France; Lopes de Vega</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>; and the best and famousest Poets in <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <p>Gentle <hi>Anthenor,</hi> all I cod do to oblige a person of your worth, was abundantly rewarded in the doing it, and if you'd oblige me speak no more of it: let's talk of somewhat else. â€” We hear <hi>Cleander</hi> your noble General in the <hi>Attique</hi> War, with victory leading him, and fortune following him, goes on like lightning consuming all before him,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42092:6"/>
and 'tis much wondred that imployment, was not rather conferr'd upon the Prince, who wants nor years, nor experience in the wars, to make him fit for action; but necessity of state (it seems) requir'd an older, and more experienc't Souldier.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anth.</speaker>
                  <p>Betwixt you and I I'le tell you, those who not onely look upon the outside of Princes actions, but boldly pry into their insides too, say, t'was not so much necessity of state that sent the brave <hi>Cleander</hi> to the wars, as more to facilitate the Dukes access unto his Lady the admir'd <hi>Erminia</hi>â€”. But how do's your fair Princess <hi>Cyrena?</hi> that we may freely talk of; t'was our hope the Prince at's being at <hi>Argos</hi> shud have married her, but the destinies of marriage were not pleas'd it seems to make us so happy.</p>

                  <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
                  <p>It was our hopes too, and we indeed wondred as much as you he shud so suddenly leave her, but much more, she shud so suddenly after leave her countrey, since when none knows, nor can imagine, what's become of her.</p>

                  <p>Alas, I fear you'l hardly finde so much as her memory with him now, who onely mindes the fair <hi>Erminia,</hi> about whose palace restlesly day and night like some pale ghost he wanders, carefully seeking opportunity of seeing her, whilst she as carefully avoids his sight.</p>

                  <p>That man never gets honour (nor woman that's never tried: what made <hi>Penelope</hi> (neither) so famous (I pray) in her husbands absence, but her entertaining so many Gallants as she did? there was a valiant woman now. Let them come as many as they wod, she fear'd them not, she knew she cod deal with them all. And you to lock up your self (a this manner) for fear of them! there's wise valour indeed!</p>

                  <speaker>Er.</speaker>
                  <p>As though there were not as much valour, in Passive Fortitude, and holding out a siege, against the enemy, as in the Active one, of fighting them in the field. The one is <hi>Cleander</hi>'s honour, the other shall be mine. In either we'l declare our selves invincible.</p>

                  <p>I grant you a mans honour chiefly consists in sighting, and a womans in defending her chastity; but there's discretion in all things; a man may fight and fight, and yet be counted a quarrelsom Coxcomb for his pains:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42092:10"/>
and a woman proud and peevish, in defending her chastity: give me a fair condition'd man or woman 'long as you live; &amp; one, that understands reason. I cannot blame young maids to have always for burthen of their song, a <hi>husband, a husband,</hi> for they never tryed, and therefore may long perhaps; but for married wives to be alwayes in that tone, and crying out for their husbands, like fools and children for their baubles, shews a kinde of incontinence, and insatiate desire in them.</p>

                  <p>That shews your ignorance now; for as that man shud never be a great scholar who never red but in onebook, so shud she never be a wise woman, who never knew but one man. Variety is good in every thing; and use in that, as in all things else makes perfectness.</p>
