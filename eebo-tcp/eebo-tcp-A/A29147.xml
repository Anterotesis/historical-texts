            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter the fleeting current of many trancient years,
<hi>Truth,</hi> the daughter of Time, began to ſhew her
ſelfe, and by making new diſcoveries of old paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
ſo pull'd off that viſor of <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> which
had too long been worn, that one might diſcover the
true Phiſiognomy, and as it were <hi>digito monstrare,</hi>
point out with the finger, the <hi>Aſſe</hi> ennobled with the
<hi>Lions</hi> skin; for, the Republican State-holders had no
ſooner got into the Saddle, but they began to ride in a
full cariere: the old Proverb in them was truly verified,
<hi>Set a Beggar on Horſeback, and he will ride to the Divel;</hi>
and ſo might they, if they had not been ſtopp'd; for,
that State-monſter, <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> for the better modelling
of what was yet but in <hi>Embrio</hi> into a form, was moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the wings of ambitious malice, and put into an
office of the greateſt truſt and profit in the Nation:
But if (according to the vulgar opinion) Agues be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
then was <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> poſſeſſed, and the Divel being
entred, he was now fit for what might in any manner
be put upon him; and here, for a while, he lords it, till
his <hi>Mungrel</hi> Maſters now tottering in t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Saddle, were
by the Soldiery, thoſe Sons of Valour, quite diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and conſequently returned to their firſt original,
which was to be <hi>Terrae filii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This purgation wrought ſo ſtrongly, that <hi>White-Hall</hi>
began to ſmell; for the Members defil'd themſelves ſo,
that in every corner you would have ſworn had been
<hi>Atkins:</hi> But <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> being exceeding coſtive, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65457:3"/>
Divel owing him a ſhame, and now intending to pay
it him home, the Phiſick wrought not, but lay grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
in the gizzard, till what with that, and the
ſtrength of conceit, he turn'd up his heels, and like a
<hi>Jade,</hi> yielded the Crow a pudding.</p>
            <p>Long had not theſe two companions the Soul and
Body been parted, ere his <hi>Ghost</hi> began to appear, and
pacing up and downe the diſmal ſhades of the more
frightfull night, ſo terrifying the guilty conſciences of
his late <hi>Aſſociates,</hi> was at laſt encountred, to its owne
terror, by the Apparition of the late K. <hi>Charles,</hi> which
upon the ſudden meeting thus accoſted him.</p>

               <p>And what art thou (bold fiend) that thus dareſt
trouble theſe forbidden lodgings, forbidden (I ſay) to
the ſteps of ſuch too curious, and more bold than welcome
Gueſts: ſpeak, ſpeak, I ſay, whence art thou?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I am (quoth it) the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> of <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> now
condemn'd with unwearied walking, to trace this loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
place, to get a part, wherein was once my
ambition, though now too dearly &amp; too late repented.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
               <p>But tell me (fiend) what was the cauſe, in life, of
your inveterate hate againſt me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Br.</speaker>
               <p>To ſpeak the truth, I hated not your perſon,
but your ſtate, and that your lofty eye did never caſt
a glance upon my ſhrub-like growth, I ſetting a value
on my ſelfe, and ſuppoſing you ought with <hi>Alexander</hi>
to have given honour, ſuch as befitted a Princes gift,
though by me wholly undeſerved.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
               <p>Was that the cauſe indeed? know you not that
Providence guides the hand of blinde Fortune, and
though we would, we cannot give beyond our alotment?
but ſurely, there were other motives that induced you to
after actings, when you and your Complices firſt drew the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65457:3"/>
Sword, you threw away the ſcaherd: ſuch crimes as yours
as great in this attempt, ſo ſtill muſt be carried on by
acting greater; for, but to ſlack the hand, is as it were
to loſe the day: but pray reveale the progreſſe of thoſe
furious acts, which in a maze have put the world, and
by their various changes almoſt reduced all into a
Chaos?</p>

               <speaker>Br.</speaker>
               <p>When firſt the ſound of War was noyſed abroad,
it was conſidered by what means to ſteal the hearts of
the People, no cloak was thought ſo fitting as that of
<hi>Religion;</hi> nor any bait ſo apt to be caught at, as that
of <hi>liberty:</hi> whereupon an alteration in the <hi>one,</hi> and a
breach upon the <hi>other</hi> was proclaimed: we did trace
<hi>Jeroboam</hi> in the like caſe; the meaneſt of the People
we extolled and applauded, whoſe ignorance of what
they would have, encreaſed their fury: 'twas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cloſely inſinuated, that ſome great ones muſt be
removed, elſe the Work would meet with many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
oppoſitions, I need not relate the courſe was
taken for perfecting the deſign; who were engaged,
who diſcarded, who checked, who countenanced:
<hi>Reformation</hi> was pretended by <hi>all,</hi> intended by <hi>few,</hi>
for it is more than probable, that the Sword is an ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
for ſuch a work: but the work was begun,
and it muſt be done; yet I verily ſuppoſe, much of
the evils that have hapned, might have been prevented,
if <hi>you</hi> had notbeen ſo pitifull.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Truly I repent me not however of it, although
long before my death, I was told by a great man in my
Kingdome, when I had with <hi>pity</hi> diſmiſſed ſome active
perſons against me, which I was adviſed to trye by a
Councel of War; well (ſaid he) you may gain the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven by theſe doings; but if ever you get
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65457:4"/>
the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> I never ſaw the like: how
true I have found theſe words, I am ſure you, and all
the world know.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Br.</speaker>
               <p>That was it I was comming to; for had you
kept the rein of government in your hands with ſome
ſtrictneſſe, no one had dar'd to ſuperviſe you: or, if
after the War begun, you had driven <hi>Jehu</hi>-like, you
might like him, even but drawing a bow at a venture,
have ſmitten your enemies in the joynts of their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and your ſelfe ſtill have ſate <hi>regnant</hi> in the
Chariot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
               <p>But upon what account did you enter the ſtage,
and how at laſt did you arrive at that height of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that you, of a whole reduced people, durſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to ſit as my judge? upon what principles did thy
ſeared conſcience lay her foundation? or with what
peace did it ever think to enjoy any thing ſo injuriouſly,
and without all right gotten?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Br.</speaker>
               <p>When now the <hi>Cauſe</hi> began to thrive, and things
did ſucceed, even beyond expectation, <hi>Felix &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperum
nefas virtus vocatur:</hi> all Oppoſers becoming
now Delinquents, and their ſequeſtred Eſtates without
controll filling the new-made <hi>Treaſuries,</hi> I ſtruck in
for ſomething, and by application to ſome of the
Grandees of the then leading faction, inſinuated my
ſelfe, as a Pleader at the bars of their licentious <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,</hi>
wherein I ſoon became a great Proficient, for
I argued down learning, and endeavoured to ſubvert
even the very foundation thereof, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities:</hi>
whereby, and ſuch other the like practiſes, I was now
thought a fitting ground for any impreſſion; hereupon
I became acquainted with many Leaders, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
with that ſink of ſin and forge of Satan, <hi>Nich:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65457:4"/>
Machiavels</hi> elder brother in their heatheniſh Policies,
old <hi>Noll,</hi> him we looked upon as <hi>Soloriens,</hi> and all his
actions as fitting Precepts for a State to be ruled by:
this man hammering in his head how to bring that to
paſſe, which <hi>he</hi> ſo egregiouſly afterward effected, by
a counterfeit of zeal gained an opinion of <hi>godly;</hi> and
under that notion his intended <hi>villainies</hi> paſſed the
vote without any ſerious examination. How he did
court you into a trap, your ſelfe I believe is too ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and becauſe he could not himſelf, he undermin'd
your moſt intimate friends to betray you: what force
could at that time have manacled you, if you had not
run into <hi>Caresbrook</hi> Goal; and there too he was like
to have been out-witted, for had you in that perſonall
<hi>Treaty</hi> granted at firſt what you conceded and yielded
to at laſt, you had taken Time by the fore-lock, and
in all probability had ſtill been King; but, <hi>Poſt eſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio

hazzard his deſigne any more, gets you into his clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>But was it his intention at that time to uſe me
as he did afterwards?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Br.</speaker>
               <p>Yes truly was it, for then was the <hi>High Court of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
               <p>But how did you think to look me your King in
the face? with what ſpirit were you poſſeſſed? or what
inducements had you to move you thereto?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Br.</speaker>
               <p>I knew an act of that height muſt be carried on

would both attend me.</p>

            <sp>

Why the thing had been ſtill the ſame; <hi>Cromwell</hi>
himſelfe ſaid, there was a fatal neceſſity, that either
<hi>You</hi> or <hi>He</hi> muſt die. <hi>Nec Caeſar ſuperiorem nec Pompeius

he could brook neither ſuperior nor equal. All things
now thus fitted, and reſolved on, I endeavoured to
ſtill my conſcience into a beliefe of the legality of my
fact, and to that purpoſe I did light on a paſſage that
pleaſed me, and the more for that it was out of our
own Chronicles; the paſſage was this: In a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
time there was a certain head of <hi>Wax</hi> made by
<hi>Negromancy</hi> (as it was reported) which head at an
hour appointed to ſpeak, uttered theſe words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at three times, and then ceaſed to ſpeak any more:
the words are theſe. Firſt, <hi>The Head ſhall be cut off.</hi>
2. <hi>The Head ſhall be lift up aloft.</hi> And, 3. <hi>The feet ſhall
be lift up aloft above the Head.</hi> This happened in the
time of that <hi>Parliament</hi> that was called, <hi>The mercileſſe
Parliament,</hi> not long before that which was called, <hi>The
Parliament that wrought wonders.</hi> By this thing was
my wickedneſſe heightened, and I ſo confirm'd in my
audaciouſneſſe, that I counted it a ſmall matter to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
my hands in the ſacred bloud of my King. After
that fatall buſineſſe, I began to lord it over my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and forgot the <hi>turfe</hi> from whence I ſprang: thus
continuing for ſome time, at laſt I was arreſted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<hi>ſera venit ſed certa venit vindicta.</hi> Oh the
terrors of a guilty conſcience! how oft, in ghaſtly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
have my thoughts preſented before me your <hi>head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>
perſon, whoſe ſprings of bloud have threatned an
innundation both to my ſoul and body? then have I
weighed the calm though provok'd <hi>Majeſty</hi> that ſate
on your brow, ſcorning fear, and diſdaining the terrors
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65457:5"/>
of an enforced death, rather then make a breach o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and feels in it ſelf the everlaſting torments of a repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bated ſoul, and to add to my griefs, and heap up the
