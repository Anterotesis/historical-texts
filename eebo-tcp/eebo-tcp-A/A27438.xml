            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 PET. III. 15.</bibl>
               <q>Be ready always to give an answer to
every man, that asketh you a reason of
the Hope that is in you.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>BY the <hi>Hope that is in us,</hi> we do understand
here, as in other places of Scripture, not
only the bare Hope strictly so called, but
the Faith too of a Christian. Whence
it is, that in the Syriac version of the text, and in
some ancient Latin copies, the word Faith is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the other; <hi>the hope and the Faith that is in
you.</hi> And indeed if we consider Hope as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
passion; we shall find it to be always attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ussher'd in by Faith. For 'tis certain, there
is no Hope without some antecedent Belief, that
the thing hoped for may come to pass; and the
strength and steadiness of our Hope is ever propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
to the measure of our Faith. It appears
therefore why the word Hope in the text may with
sufficient propriety of speech comprehend the whole
Faith of a Christian; and that, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
exhorts us, <hi>to be ready always to answer every
man that asks the reason of our Hope;</hi> 'tis the same,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51644:3"/>
as if he injoined us, to be never unprepared nor
unwilling to reply to any doubts or questions about
the grounds of the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>At the date of this Epistle, the whole World
(with relation to the text) might be consider'd under
one general division, Jews and Gentiles: First, the
Jews,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>To whom the Oracles of God were committed,</hi> and
who from thence had the information and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Messias. These, when they asked a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
the reason of his Hope, were themselves alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
persuaded, that the Messias would come: and
the only controversie between them was, Whether
<hi>Iesus</hi> was He? according to the message of <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Baptist,<note place="margin">Luk. 7. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Was Iesus he that should come, or must they
look for another?</hi> Secondly, the Gentiles, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no means of knowledge besides mere natural
Reason, could have no notions nor notices of this
expected Messias. These therefore, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the reason of a Christian's Hope, were first
to be acquainted with the purpose and promise of
God to send the Messias, were to be instructed about
the reasons and designs of that great embassy; about
his quality and office, and all the circumstances of
his Person: and then was the proper time to shew,
That <hi>Iesus</hi> was He; that the description of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias
was truly exhibited and represented in His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
and the ancient prophecies all accomplish'd
in His actions and events.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51644:3"/>'Tis not for nothing, that the Apostle so presseth
this advice in the text, <hi>Be ready</hi> always <hi>to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the hope that is in you.</hi> As if he had foretold,
That there would be no age of the Christian world,
wherein this preparation would be superfluous. It
hath pleas'd the divine Wisdom, never yet to leave
Christianity wholly at leasure from opposers; but
to give its professors that perpetual exercise of their
industry and zeal. And who can tell, if without
such adversaries to rouse and quicken them, they
might not in long tract of time have grown remiss
in the duties, and ignorant in the doctrines of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
Perhaps before this time even some of the
Records of it might have perish'd by mens negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
as the Jews had like to have lost their Law,
if divine Providence had not preserved one copy of
it in the Temple.<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 25.</note> It is, <hi>while men sleep,</hi> while they
live in peace and security, and have no enemies to
contest with, that the great <hi>Enemy comes and sowes
tares among the wheat.</hi> But of all the ages since the
coming of Christ, I suppose this present has least
reason to complain for want of work and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in defence of Religion. Here are not only the
two parties in the text, Jews and Gentiles, still in
the world to engage with; but even in the midst of
Christianity are the most dangerous designs form'd
against it: as if our Saviour's prediction of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51644:4"/>
families were to be verified too of the whole
Church,<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 36.</note> 
               <hi>That its worst enemies should be they of its own
Houshold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are a sort of persons baptized indeed into
the Christian Faith, and educated in the profession
of it: but in secret, I wish I might say so, nay even
openly they oppose and blaspheme it; repudiating
at once the whole authority of Revelation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing
the sacred Volumes to the rank of ordinary
Books of History and Ethicks. The being of God
and a Providence they profess to believe, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a difference between Good and Evil, to
be verily persuaded of another Life to come; and
to have their expectations of that state, as their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
is in this. Nay even the whole system of
Christian Morals they can willingly embrace: but
not as a collection of divine Statutes and Ordinances
sent us by an express from Heaven, but only as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
rules of life, discoverable by plain Reason, and
agreeable to natural Religion. So that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see the mighty occasion, that should invite even
the eternal Son of God from the bosom of the Father,
to act so mean and calamitous a part upon the stage
of this sorry world. What need of so great a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to read mankind lectures of Morals, which
they might easily learn without any teacher? 'Tis
true, they are often told of some sublime mysterious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51644:4"/>
doctrines deliver'd by him, which they own would
ne'er have been thought of by natural Reason. But
then, that is so far from recommending to them
the importance of his errand from Heaven; that
for that very reason they deny the truth of his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
For whatever comes imperiously in the name
of divine Mystery, and soars above the pitch of
humane knowledge, whatsoever things they cannot
fathom and grasp through all the causes, designs,
modes and relations of them, as the notion of the
Messias, his incarnation, mediation, satisfaction;
all these they reject and explode, as incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to pure Reason, which they set up as the only
principle and measure of belief.</p>
            <p>In all this, these persons act the part, and place
themselves in the condition of Gentiles, whom we
may imagine in the text, <hi>to ask the reason of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
hope:</hi> since the whole body of these mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is no more than what even Heathens attain'd
to: the modern Deism being the very same with
old Philosophical Paganism, only aggravated and
damn'd with the additional crime of Apostacy from
the Faith. But besides this, these very persons will
on other occasions personate the Jews too, those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enquirers suppos'd in the text; and dispute
with Jewish objections against the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
though they no more believe the matter of those
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51644:5"/>
objections, than the thing they object against: like
<hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> of old, that gather'd arguments
against the Christians from all the different Sects and
Hypotheses of Philosophy, though inconsistent one
argument with another; and brought objections
too from the Old Testament, which they did not
believe, against the New one, which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
by all methods to oppose.</p>
            <p>In our present Discourse therefore, we shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to refute these modern adversaries under
their double shape and character: first as they are
mere Deists or Pagans, renouncing all Revelation,
and the very notion of the Messias: and secondly,
as they fight under Jewish colours; so as admitting,
there be a promised Messias the Saviour of the world,
yet men ought to reject the person of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and
still to wait for another.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> And first we shall consider them in the quality
of Deists and Disciples of mere natural Reason.
We profess our selves as much concerned, and as
truly as themselves are, for the use and authority of
Reason in controversies of Faith. We look upon
right Reason, as the native lamp of the soul, placed
and kindled there by our Creator, to conduct us in
the whole course of our judgments and actions.
True Reason, like its divine Author, never is it self
deceived, nor ever deceives any man. Even Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51644:5"/>
it self is not shy nor unwilling to ascribe its
own first credit and fundamental authority to the
test and testimony of Reason. Sound Reason is
the touchstone to distinguish that pure and genuine
gold from baser metals; Revelation truly divine
from imposture and enthusiasm. So that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion is so far from declining or fearing
the strictest trials of Reason; that it every-where
appeals to it, is defended and supported by it, and
indeed cannot continue, in the Apostle's descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">James 1. 27.</note>
               <hi>pure and undefiled</hi> without it. 'Tis the benefit
of Reason alone, under the providence and spirit
of God, that we our selves are at this day a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Orthodox Church: that we departed from
the errors of Popery, and that we knew too where
to stop; neither running into the extravagancies of
Fanaticism, nor sliding into the indifferency of
Libertinism. Whatsoever therefore is inconsistent
with natural Reason, can never be justly imposed,
as an Article of Faith. That the same Body is
in many places at once; that plain Bread is not
Bread; such things, though they be said with never
so much pomp, and claim to infallibility; we
have still greater authority to reject them, as being
contrary to common sense and our natural faculties,
as subverting the foundations of all Faith, even the
grounds of their own credit, and all the principles
of civil life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51644:6"/>So far are we from contending with our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
about the dignity and authority of Reason:
but then we differ with them about the exercise of
it, and the extent of its province. For the Deists
there stop and set bounds to their Faith; where
Reason, their only guide, does not lead the way
further and walk along before them. We on the
contrary,<note place="margin">Deut. 34.</note> as <hi>Moses</hi> was shewn by divine power
a true sight of the promised Land, though himself
could not pass over to it: so we think, Reason
may receive from Revelation some further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
and new prospects of things, and be fully
convinced of the reality of them; though it self
cannot pass on, nor travel those regions, cannot
penetrate the fund of those truths, nor advance to
the utmost bounds of them. For there is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a wide difference between what is contrary to
Reason, and what is superior to it, and out of its
reach. To give an instance in created Nature:
how many things are there, whose being we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doubt of, though unable to comprehend the
manner of their being so? That the human soul
is vitally united to the Body by a reciprocal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of action and passion; this we all conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feel and know, and our adversaries will affirm
it. Let them tell us then, what is the chain, the
cement, the magnetism, what they will call it, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51644:6"/>
invisible tie of that union, whereby Matter and an
incorporeal Mind, things that have no similitude
nor alliance to each other, can so sympathize by
a mutual league of motion and sensation? No,
they will not pretend to that; for they can frame
no conceptions of it. They are sure, there is such
an union from the operations and effects: but the
cause and the manner of it are too subtle and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
to be discovered by the eye of Reason; 'tis
mystery, 'tis divine magick, 'tis natural miracle.
If then in created beings, they are content with us,
to confess their ignorance of the modes of existence,
without doubting of things themselves: have not
we much more reason to be humble and modest
in speculations about the essence of God, about
the reasons of His counsels, and the ways of His
actions? yes certainly: under those circumstances
we may believe with Reason even things above
and beyond Reason.</p>
            <p>For example: If we have sure ground to believe
that such a book is the Revelation of God; and
we find in it Propositions expressed in plain words,
of a determinate sense without ambiguity; so as they
cannot be otherwise interpreted, by any just me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
or fair construction allowed in common
language: we say we have sufficient reason to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to those propositions, as divine doctrines and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51644:7"/>
infallible truths, so far as they are declared there;
though perhaps we cannot our selves comprehend,
nor demonstrate to others, the reasons and the
manner of them. Neither is this an easy creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or unworthy of the most cautious and morose
searcher of truth. For observe; we do not say,
Any thing incomprehensible to Reason is separate
and alone a proper object of belief: but as it is
supported and establish'd by some other known
and comprehensible truth. As, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had
been told by some ordinary Man, That in His
and <hi>Sarah</hi>'s decrepit age he should be blessed with
a Son: this Promise so alone, without its basis to
stand on, could not have challeng'd his assent;
because the thing was impossible in the way of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 26.</note>
But since it was God Almighty, <hi>with whom
all things are possible,</hi> that was the author of that
Promise; by the mediation of that certain truth,
the veracity and omnipotence of God, without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation
he believed, and so obtain'd the glory to
be <hi>Father of the faithfull.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> And upon the same
grounds the Blessed Virgin gave credit to the salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Angel; though the message in it self
seem'd impossible to reason. So true it is, that
Reason it self warrants us to proceed and advance
by Faith, even beyond the sphere and regions of
Reason. We agree then with our adversaries about
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51644:7"/>
the authority of Reason: but we dissent about the
exercise of it, and the bounds of its jurisdiction.
We believe even the abstrusest Mysteries of the
Christian Religion: of which mysteries perhaps
we can assign no reasons; but for our belief we
assign a good one: Because they are plainly taught
in the word of God, who can neither err nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
And this we affirm to be a reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
though it carry us even to the confines
of Heaven, beyond the limits of Reason. But if
the Deists think to oblige us to give a natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of those mysteries, without the authority of
Scripture: for that we must beg their excuse. We
will argue from strict Reason, as much as they
can pretend to: but we must not submit that our
adversaries shall confine us to improper topicks
and impossible ways of proof.</p>
            <p>It appears therefore, that though we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
and despair to give any account at all of the
reasons and methods of God's counsel in the missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Son; and only appeal to the sentence of
Scripture: yet the Deists ought to be satisfied with
that proof; since the Doctrine is so expresly
taught in the oracles of God. But besides this,
what if even natural Light shall discover to us some
faint, but yet certain views of that mysterious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of divine Wisdom and Goodness; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51644:8"/>
to us a rational account, Why the Son of
God should condescend to be our Mediator and
Redeemer. But before we engage in this attempt,
let it be lawfull to implore the candor of our
Friends; if, while we endeavour to win over our
Enemies, we may seem to some, To do too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or perhaps to others, To venture too far,
and to advance beyond our Lines. To discern
then some reasons of this wonderfull Mystery; we
must take our prospect from the highest mountain
of Nature, from the first Creation, and origin of
human Race.</p>
            <p>GOD, who at the beginning viewed all the
works of his hands,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 31.</note> and <hi>behold, all things were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good;</hi> made Man also upright and compleat,
without any defect in his whole composition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any original perversness of Soul, or false byass
of Will or Judgment, without any natural obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
or enormity of Inclinations. He made him
an intelligent Being, to know God and Himself:
to understand and feel present happiness, and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it by consideration and contrivance for the
future. He endow'd him with liberty of mind:
that he might act, not of necessity, nor blind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
like the Brutes; but with consciousness and
voluntary choice. He implanted in him diverse
Appetites and Affections, all usefull instruments of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51644:8"/>
his happiness, if fitly imployed: and none vitious
and culpable radically and in their whole nature;
but then only, when they are applied to wrong
objects, or in right ones are raised or sunk beside
their due temper and measure. I say it again, for
the justification of our Creator; that not one of the
simple affections of the Soul, no not Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
Hatred, Anger, Revenge, are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
criminal and sinfull. Some of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
'tis true, have very bad names: but those
are either mere excesses of simple Passions; or else
mix'd and compound ones, which have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
real essence, but are only notional terms; as
<hi>Envy</hi> for example, a very bad thing indeed; but
'tis an evil of our own product, and not of God's
creating. For the real constituent parts of it, are
Hatred and Grief, very usefull and lawfull affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but the evil of it is our own; when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
that Hatred and Grief at the good that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
others: which is what we express by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
name of Envy.</p>
            <p>God therefore having so created Man, in every
capacity pure and perfect, might justly require of
him, that he should maintain and preserve this
original rectitude; that in all his desires, designs
and actions, he should constantly adhere to the
dictates of Reason and Nature; so as the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51644:9"/>
would make him obnoxious to God's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
and nothing less than compleat obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
recommend him to his favour: according to
the terms proposed to <hi>Cain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>If thou dost well, shalt
thou not be accepted? and if thou dost not well, sin lies
at the door.</hi> God, I say, might expect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of man such a perfect obedience to the Law
of Nature: because it was both reasonable and
possible for Man to perform it. <hi>Reasonable</hi> it was,
because every Statute of that Law promotes the
true interest and felicity of Mankind, even in the
very performance. 'Tis true, in the present po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of human affairs, a man's duty is frequently
inconsistent with his temporal interest. <hi>But from
the beginning it was not so:</hi> neither would it be now,
if the whole world at once could be just and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
For 'tis not my keeping the Law, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
transgressing it, that involves me in any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
The scope and tendency of the Law it self
is always mine and every man's advantage. For
'tis not a thing foreign and aliene to our nature,
imposed on us purely to try our obedience; but it
all results from our very frame and constitution.
The general preservation of man's Natural good is
the sole root and fountain of the Moral: the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Profit and Pleasure, the publick Happiness of
human Life gives being and denomination to every
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51644:9"/>
virtue and vice: and the true rules and directions
to preserve and secure that happiness make up the
whole Volume, the Code and Pandect of the
Law of Nature. Without doubt then it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to obey, where nothing was commanded
us, but to pursue our own interest; nothing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
us, but not to do our selves harm. And
secondly, it was <hi>possible</hi> for man to perform that
entire obedience. For since, as we have proved
before, all his natural faculties are right and good,
and the Law it self accommodated and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
to those faculties; there appears no necessary
intrinsic impediment, why he may not adequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe it. If every particular precept be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be done, 'tis not absolutely impossible to
fulfill the universal. And methinks they, that on
other accounts acknowledge that God requires
such perfect obedience upon the terms of the Law
of Nature, should be very averse from believing,
that there is a natural and fundamental insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in man to perform it. For certainly the just
God cannot be so importune and unreasonable a
Master, as to enjoyn us what is physically impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>to expect to reap where he has not sown, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Bricks without allowance of Straw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, though there was no such original and
natural disability in Man; yet there arose a moral
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51644:10"/>
and circumstantial one, an accidental incapacity
supervening to his Nature, an impossibility from
event, that ever any person from the beginning of
the world to the last period of it (always excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Man Christ Iesus)</hi> should be wholly pure
and free from the contagion of Sin. For our first
Parents having fallen from their native state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence;
the tincture of evil, like an hereditary
disease, infected all their posterity: and the leaven
of sin having once corrupted the whole Mass of
Mankind, all the species ever after would be sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and tainted with it; the vitious ferment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
diffusing and propagating it self through
all generations. For let us but consider the state
of human life; first a perpetual conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
evil Examples, and the strongest principle
of our nature, Imitation; and then, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and prejudices of Childhood, the fervour
and temerity of Youth; the force and the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Temptations, and the narrow dubious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confines
between Virtue and Vice: and we may
pronounce it impossible, that any man should so
govern his steps through all the lubricous paths
of Life, as never once to slip and fall from his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Agreeably to the testimony of Scripture, <hi>which
hath concluded all under sin,</hi> Gal. 3. 22. and again;
<hi>If we say,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51644:10"/>
the truth is not in us:</hi> and again,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 9. 23.</note> 
               <hi>both Iews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
are all under sin; all have sinned and come short
of the glory of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. v. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Every mouth then be stopp'd;
and all the world</hi> must plead <hi>guilty</hi> before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of God: <hi>for by the deeds of the Law</hi> (the Law
of nature as well as of <hi>Moses) no flesh can be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his sight.</hi> It is evident then from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of pure Reason, beside the authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
that upon the Deists Hypothesis, upon the
terms of natural Religion, no Salvation can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd;
no Life and Immortality can be expected.
For that being the free offer and favour of God;
he might justly set what price he pleas'd upon
it; even the greatest that we can possibly pay;
nothing less than entire obedience, than unspotted
innocence, than consummate virtue.</p>
            <p>Thus far then even Reason evinceth, and holds
the Lamp to Revelation. Some means of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
between God and Man, the Judge and
the Offender, must be contrived; some vicarious
satisfaction to justice, and model of a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
or else the whole bulk of Mankind are for
ever unhappy. And surely to prevent that, to
retrieve a perishing world, was a weighty concern;
even of greater importance than the very creating
it, and more worthy of the care and consult of
Heaven. I say, the care of Heaven; for alas here
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51644:11"/>
on Earth, what expedient could Man find out?
<hi>How could Dust and Ashes take upon him to speak unto
the Lord?</hi> Could any of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> presume
to be advocate for the rest? himself one of the
criminals, himself in want of another advocate?
and what friend knew we at the court of Heaven;
of that high power and favour with God, as to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his intercession? or so wonderfully kind to Us,
as to pay our satisfaction? We must freely own to
the Deist; that here Reason was at a stand: even
Nature her self languish'd between hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 22.</note>
and in the stile of the Apostle, <hi>the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
groan'd and travell'd in pain together;</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
(what Revelation hath informed and assured
us of) the eternal Son of the Almighty,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Paternal Glory and the express image of his
Substance,</hi> even He vouchsafed to be our Patron
and Mediator, to take our Nature upon him and
to dwell among Men, to fulfill that Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
wherein we were deficient, to bear our
guilt and our burthen upon himself, and to offer
his most precious blood, as an expiation for our
offences, as the seal of a new Covenant better than
the Law of Nature; a Covenant of more graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
terms, terms of Repentance and Remission of
sins: so that if we truly believe in Him, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
endeavour to observe his Commands; our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51644:11"/>
imperfect Righteousness through the merits of his
Sufferings shall be imputed, accepted and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
as if it were an entire obedience to the strict
Law of Works and of natural Perfection.</p>
            <p>And now I dare presume to ask even our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
themselves, what flaws or fallacies they
can shew in all this. If it be true then, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it self discovers such absolute necessity of some
way of Reconciliation between God and Man; and
if it was necessary for Man, as being the party
concern'd, to know the particular way that God
did approve and accept of; and if mere Reason
could never find that out, but Revelation alone
must and ought to inform us; and lastly, if such
Revelation be actually made, attested, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated
to the world: what pretence is there left,
why we should not believe and acquiesce in it? if
upon examination it bear all the marks of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
if it contain nothing unworthy of it self,
and of the wisdom and goodness of its Author.</p>
            <p>And is not the Oeconomy of man's Salvation,
as it is set forth in Holy Scriptures, every way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to that divine character? No, if we ask
our Adversaries; 'tis an improper and unequal
method; 'tis inconsistent with the justice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality
of God. <hi>Rex Iupiter omnibus idem.</hi> God,
say they, if he had design'd such an universal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51644:12"/>
for Mankind, would have exhibited it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and indifferently, to every Age and Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
But the conditions of Salvation proposed in
the Gospel are incompetent and much too narrow;
being restrain'd to those times and countries alone,
that can hear of the fame of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and believe in
his Person. And what becomes then of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages of men, before He was born? What of
those remote Nations ever since, that could have
no intelligence of him, nor hear the least tidings
of <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> must all those Myriads of
Souls perish for invincible ignorance, for want of
impossible Faith?<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> 
               <hi>For how could they believe on him,
of whom they had not heard? and how could they hear
without a Preacher?</hi> And why should <hi>the God of the
whole earth, the God that is no respecter of persons,</hi> no
nor of nations, be so unaccountably kind, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
fond and partial to any single country? much
less to a little obscure people, the <hi>Iews,</hi> scarce heard
of in the rest of the world, till they were captives and
slaves in it? and withdraw his paternal love from
so many other Nations much more considerable,
and more worthy of his providence? <hi>Is he God of
the Iews only?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 29.</note> Is he not also of the Gentile?</p>
            <p>This way of discourse we may expect from the
Deists: And I hope, according to the advice of
the text, we are both <hi>able and ready to give a Reply.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51644:12"/>
For first as to that imagined Partiality of God, in
preferring any one country before the rest of the
World, to be the Land of Christs Nativity; what
a poor and contemptible cavil? For upon suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that the Messias of God was to take hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature upon him, and be born of a Woman:
must he not of necessity be born in some one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Country, exclusively to all the rest? And
is not that then a ridiculous objection against any
single Country; that may equally be urged against
all whatsoever?</p>
            <p>Neither was it mere Fondness in the Deity, that
he chose the obscure land of <hi>Palestine</hi> for the birth
place of his Son, rather than <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> or
<hi>Asia,</hi> the theatres of Art and Learning, and the
seats of Empire? For not to mention <hi>Abraham</hi> and
the Patriarchs, whose singular faith and piety justly
obtain'd of God, that their Posterity should have
the <hi>adoption and the glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and the covenants and the
promises, and the consanguinity of Christ:</hi> it appears
also from event; that the circumstances of that
nation were of all others the most sutable to the
design of the Messias. For since it was fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that Prophecies should foretell of him long
before his coming; that his pedegree and extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should be accurately deduced through a long
series of Ancestors; and other such marks be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51644:13"/>
of him, that men might know, This was
He: what more proper to those purposes, than the
state of the Jews, that <hi>peculiar people,</hi> secluded
and distinguish'd one tribe from another, and the
whole from all the rest of Mankind, by the very
frame of their polity? So that the Genealogies
were less confused, the Histories and Prophecies
more faithfully recorded, and the accomplishment
of all more certain and illustrious, than they could
have been in any other Nation upon Earth; all of
which, within that long compass of time, were
blended together by mutual commerce and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
conquest, and other omnifarious causes of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and confusion.</p>
            <p>And then as to that other surmise, that God would
have proposed fair and equal means of general sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and not upon such narrow and insufficient
terms, as an actual Faith in the person of Jesus; a
condition impossible to the much greater part of
Mankind: we acknowledge it to be true, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
true; Faith in Christ Jesus the only way to
Salvation since the preaching of the Gospel: so
as whosoever rejects that, when it is duly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to him, and refuses his assent and obedience to
it, can have no portion in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
But for those, that never once heard of the
Lord of Life; that's an undecided case, which we
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51644:13"/>
do not determine. For who has authority to give
sentence, where God and Scripture are silent?
Thus far we are assured there; that let the future
condition of those be as God pleases, at least he
will not condemn them for invincible ignorance.
<hi>For there is no respect of persons with Him;</hi>

inferr then by parity of argument, That as <hi>many
as shall sin without the Gospel, shall perish without the

Jesus, whom they had not the least notice of: but
they will be tried and sentenced for sins against

him not, as God; because they held the truth in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
so that they are without excuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Deist shall still insist; that though
we have justified God from the calumny, as if
he would condemn the Gentiles for want of impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Faith: yet still he maintains it to be unjust
and incredible, that while one small part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
enjoys the favour of the Gospel; all under
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51644:14"/>
the state of Nature shall have the hard measure of
<hi>Summum Ius;</hi> must be all damn'd by rigid inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Justice, without equity or mercy, without
any act of pardon, or the least room for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
if he will rather obstinately believe, or hope,
or wish; that <hi>the God of tender compassions, who
loveth all things that he hath made, who will not require
much, where little has been given, cannot be so extreme</hi>
with the Gentile world <hi>as to mark all that is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss;</hi>
and yet to slight and overlook those shining
examples of vertue not unfrequent among them.
If this be all he sticks at: God forbid, that on this
single account, he should exclude himself from the
Communion of Faith. We can allow him this
opinion; as at worst a charitable error, as some
indication of a large heart and a generous love of
Mankind. But then he must always remember,
that even those virtuous Heathens, whom he
would so gladly place in some part of Heaven, can
be saved on no other account than by the merits
and mediation of Jesus their Saviour. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his satisfaction, there is no remission of sins
nor acceptation of repentance: and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> 
               <hi>by the deeds of the Law,</hi> and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

            <p>II. And now we may expect, that our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
will put off the garb and character of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists;
and make a new attempt for the fortune of
the day, under the arms and conduct of the
Jews.</p>
            <p>It must be granted on all hands, that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,
whensoever he is manifested to the world,
must appear in that very manner, as the Jewish
Prophets describe him. All the characters must
hit and correspond one to another; the same fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the same lineaments visible in both; the
one the shadow and picture, and the other the
substance. Now, say they, it is evident from
the Prophets; That the Messias is to be a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Prince, to sit on the throne of <hi>David</hi> his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ancestor, and to make <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the seat of an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51644:15"/>
universal and perpetual Empire. But the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of Jesus is as different from this description,
as a stable from a palace. 'Tis true, we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
endeavour to shew a similitude between them
by figurative interpretations of Scripture: which
we call the spiritual and mystical sense; but they
call arbitrary and precarious, as having no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in the native and naked Letter: which is
not to be racked and wrested from its obvious
meaning; little credit being to be given to such
extorted confessions.</p>
            <p>Thus far our Objectors. But I suppose, the
Prophetick language and character is better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
than that this surmise should pass without
a just answer. Indeed if it were in this case alone,
that the expressions of the Prophets need a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
interpretation, the exception might appear fair
and plausible. But it cannot be denied, that on
many other occasions, besides the matter of the
Messias, their discourse (after the genius of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
nations) is thick set with metaphor and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory:
the same bold comparisons and dithyram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick
liberty of stile every-where occurr. Which
is an easie and natural account (besides the more
secret reasons that the Holy Spirit might have)
why the kingdom of Messias, though really spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and not of this world, is so often dressed and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51644:15"/>
painted by them with the glories of secular Empire.
For when <hi>the spirit of God came upon them,</hi> and
breathed a new warmth and vigour through all
the powers of Body and Soul; when by the influx
of divine light the whole scene of Christ's heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kingdom was represented to their view; so that
their hearts were ravished with joy, and their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
turgid and pregnant with the glorious
ideas: then surely, if ever, their stile would be
strong and lofty, full of allusions to all that is
great and magnificent in the kingdoms of this
world. But then in other passages of the same
Prophets, as it were on purpose to hint to us the
true meaning of the former, the Messias is describ'd
plainly without poetical colours, <hi>to be a person of
low condition, to have no form nor comeliness in him,
a man acquainted with sorrows, and numbred among
transgressors;</hi> and by other characters so clear and
express: that some of the Jewish Rabbies, to elude
so strong a conviction, have maintain'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
an absurd opinion, as if two Messiah's
were foretold by the Prophets, the one a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
monarch, and the other an unfortunate and
afflicted person. What will not perverse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractary
minds take hold of, rather than submit to
an unwelcome truth?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51644:16"/>It is evident then, that the kingdom of Christ
so magnified in the Prophetick stile is a spiritual
kingdom. And yet to be free and ingenuous, we
must own that the whole nation of the Jews mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stook
the meaning of those passages. Even our
Saviour's own disciples were not exempted from
the common error. And the whole posterity of
that people are pertinacious in it to this day: which
to many is a mighty prejudice against the credit
of the Gospel. What? as if it were such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of astonishment, that they obstinately adhere
to the literal sense, which promises them a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kingdom with worldly honours and pleasures?
an interpretation both specious in it self, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their proud hopes and carnal apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are miserably defeated and disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Jesus? There seems to be nothing so very
unnatural and unaccountable in this. But then
that very Disappointment, so far it is from being
an objection, that to a sagacious mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt
judgment, it self is a convincing proof,
that he was truly the Messias. For let us reflect
upon the state of those times. 'Tis certain in fact,
that the whole nation was possest with an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
persuasion, that the Messias was then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And 'tis as certain, that <hi>Iesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
profest himself that Messias. Let us argue now
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51644:16"/>
upon human reasons and the common principles
of action. If he was not the true Messias: we
are then to consider him, as an ordinary Jew, of
mean quality and education. Now to give any
tol<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rable account, why such a one should pretend
himself to be the Messias, there are but two ways
possible. Either he was acted by ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
which he hoped to compass by that impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e
or by a complexional and natural enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm,
verily imagining himself to be the Messias.
I suppose, I scarce need to say, that both these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
are fully confuted by every word and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his life. But what I now observe, is this;
that upon either of those principles, whether Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
or Enthusiasm, he would certainly have
acted the part of the Messias, in such a character
as men then asscribed to him; according to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
expectation, and the received notion of those
times. Now the whole Nation expected, that the
Messias was to be a great General; to rescue them
from the <hi>Roman</hi> power, and <hi>to restore the kingdom
to Israel.</hi> 'Tis certain then, that upon either of
those motives, he would have blown the trumpet
to rebellion, and attempted their deliverance. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
would have animated him to it; as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way to his hopes and wishes: or if Enthusiasm
had inspired him, what would he not have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51644:17"/>
and assumed to himself? <hi>to fight the battles of the
Lord; to execute vengeance upon the Heathen; to bind
their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with fetters
of iron.</hi> Such were the designs of <hi>Barcocab</hi> and
some other impostors of old: setting up to be
the Messias; they put their followers in arms, and
proclaimed liberty to the people. Not so the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Jesus: but when the multitude would have
made him their King, he withdrew himself even
by miracle to avoid it. He did not summon to
arms, but to repentance and newness of life. He
had a kingdom indeed: but <hi>not of this earthly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
but of that which is above.</hi> He was truly their
deliverer: but not from the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke; but from
the more slavish yoke of the Law, from the more
wretched bondage to sin and death. Was this the
air and language of Ambition? Was this the meen
and spirit of Enthusiasm? Nay rather does not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
her self cry out and declare; that for one of his
low condition and vulgar education, to profess
himself the Messias in so surprizing a manner, in a
character so unthought of, by an interpretation of
Prophecies so spiritual and divine, so infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the literal meaning, against the universal
prejudice of the nation, and the hopes and sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his very followers; was certainly a thing more
than human, an invincible testimony, that he was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51644:17"/>
really the Christ, and <hi>his doctrine from God and not
of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Adversaries have another objection still
behind: and our answer thereto will put an end
both to it and to the present discourse. And this
objection is borrow'd from the Law of <hi>Moses:</hi>
which, say they, having a promise of eternity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to it, to be <hi>an everlasting covenant, a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
statute, a covenant of an everlasting Priesthood,</hi>
ought of necessity to be continued and confirmed
by the true Messias: whereas <hi>Iesus</hi> endeavoured to
abolish it, and thereby wholly subverted the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of his own pretensions. But we answer in our
Saviour's declaration,<note place="margin">Matth. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that he came not to destroy the
Law, but to fulfill it.</hi> We are to distinguish then
between the moral part of the Mosaic Law, and
the political and ceremonial. As to the Rites and
Ceremonies; 'tis apparent, they had no intrinsic
nor moral holiness in them; no natural tendency
to promote the happiness of men; nay rather they
were inconvenient and grievous, <hi>a yoke of bondage
and servile discipline, which none were able to bear.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the rewards and penalties, which enforced their
observation, did not naturally flow and result from
them, as effects from proper causes; but they were
miraculously added to them by the sole virtue of
the divine promise. 'Tis true, they were fit and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51644:18"/>
proper for the ends of their institution; to be types
and shadows of better things to come; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the people from Idolatry, by allowing no
intercourse nor commerce with other nations. But
'tis evident for that very reason, as well as many
more, that those ceremonies were neither calculated
for eternity, nor modelled for mankind in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
So that when the reasons of their sanction
no longer continued, when the things they typically
represented, were come to pass; when <hi>the wall of
partition was to be removed,</hi> and according to the
Prophecies, <hi>all nations to be called to Christ, and the
ends of the earth to be his possession:</hi> they must needs
be antiquated and abolished, like scaffolds that
are removed when the buildings are finished: since
under that new state none of them had any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
use, and several of them became impossible to
be observed. And so for the Political institutions
of <hi>Moses:</hi> 'tis plain they were accommodated to the
circumstances of affairs, and the necessities of time
and place; not absolutely the very best, but the
best that those ages of the world and the genius of
that people would bear. As for instance, the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Polygamy and causeless Divorces; these
were indulged them, not as most pleasing to their
Law-giver,<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 8.</note> but <hi>because of the hardness of their hearts,</hi>
in the words of our Saviour: because they were too
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51644:18"/>
stiff-necked and headstrong to admit of a shorter
bridle. These civil ordinances therefore, when
better precepts were once proposed and accepted
in their place, must of necessity drop and die of
themselves, and become obsolete without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal:
just as the temporary edicts in war, and the
agreements of the cartel do expire of their own
accord, when the peace is concluded. But then
the Moral part of the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which is the
sap and marrow, the soul and substance of the
whole, that indeed is of eternal and universal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
But then, who can say, that this is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
and cancelled by <hi>Iesus?</hi> so far from that,
that every branch of it is ingrafted and incorporated
into his Gospel. In this best of senses therefore the
Mosaic Law is confirmed and fulfilled by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
For Morality is a thing immutable; and
unless human nature it self should be new molded
by our maker; vice and virtue must be always
what they have been. So foolish was the cavil of
the Deists against our Saviour's descent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;<note place="margin">P. 4.</note>
because he gave no other Lectures of Morals,
than what Nature and Reason had taught before.
Nay if he had taught us the reverse of those Morals,
this had been an objection indeed. But in that even
the divinity of his doctrine most eminently appears;
that the finger of God upon the tables of our hearts,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51644:19"/>
and the pens of the inspired Writers in the volume
of the Gospel have prescribed us one and the same
lesson. As for Us, whose employment it is to
teach that lesson to others; let us but express it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in our own lives and conversations; let us but
add that credit to our doctrine, that reputation to
our profession: so may we expect to bring over
all our adversaries to the truth and power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
so may we expect, when we give the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our talents, to be received with that
blessed approbation, <hi>Well done, thou good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Master.</hi>
