            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>Now the God of peace that brought again from the
dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the
sheep, through the blood of the everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
make you perfect in every good work to do

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING upon the point of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this Station, in which I
have continued for the space of
above Twenty three Years,
it neither became me, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was I willing to pass from
it (where I have found so great a Respect,
and have had as great Satisfaction as any, I
think, could have in that Condition); I say,
I was not willing to quit it, without a Solemn
Farewell; and which to me is little less Solemn,
than if I were to leave you and this World to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>And therefore I shall at this time so endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Speak, and I wish you may also so atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
Hear, as if it was my dying-Sermon,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37741:4"/>
and what I should Preach, were it the last that
ever I should Preach, and this the last time that
ever I should Converse with you.</p>
            <p>The Sum of what I should say to you, or
desire for your good, is contained in the Words
I have read. <hi>Now the God of peace that brought
again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which Words we have set forth,</p>
            <p>I. The State which every Christian is to aspire
after, and that is, a Perfection or Promptitude
<hi>in every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The Means by which that Perfection is to
be acquired, and that is, by God's Assistance;
and therefore the Apostle begins with it; <hi>Now
the God of peace—make you perfect,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>III. The Hopes or Assurance we have of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
and that it is well-pleasing in his
sight; and that is, <hi>through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
covenant;</hi> and of the Efficacy of which
there is sufficient Testimony, when <hi>the God of
peace brought again Jesus our Lord from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The main of what I have to say, will fall
upon the First of these, and that is, The being
<hi>perfect in every good work;</hi> which doth suppose
that there is no Good Work but what a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
must be practised in. His Obedience must
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37741:4"/>
be universal, and what is as large and extensive
as the Law it self. And as the Law which is
to govern us would not be a perfect Law, were
it deficient in any Points requisite to be known,
or in any Duties requisite to be done: So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is a Christian compleatly so, if he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in any good Work which that Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
Such as a Person is in all Points to be,
such is the Rule to be; and such as the Rule is,
such is he in all Points to be. He that is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Man, is in every state of Life alike; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
over himself, and skilful in the government
of himself; he is Temperate, Holy, and Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Patient, Meek, and Contented: Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in his Opinions and Characters of others;
Just and Honest in his Dealings; useful in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
And he is not only thus extensive in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Duties he is to practice, but to be
expert in them; <hi>perfect in every good work;</hi> and
that being spurr'd on by a fervent Zeal for the
Glory of God, and of doing good in the
world, wisely takes hold of such opportunities
for exerting it, as fall in his way.</p>
            <p>And now if we would know what those
<hi>Good Works</hi> are which we are to be perfect in,
and what the Occasions are which we have for
such <hi>Good Works,</hi> and the Practice of them:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:37741:5"/>
I shall consider you of this Auditory, that I
am more especially to direct my self to, under
a Threefold Capacity.</p>
            <p>I. As in a Publick Relation, and what is
usually called a Parish.</p>
            <p>II. In a Domestical Relation, as in a
more peculiar Relation, that of Families and
Housholds.</p>
            <p>III. In a Personal Capacity, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to every one in particular.</p>
            <p>I. As in a Parish.</p>
            <p>This is in it self a very useful Constitution,
and what, were it broken up, and all laid in
common without that distinction, we should
soon find the want of, in the Confusion we
should be in. For as it is necessary that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
should be ranged into Kingdoms, and
those Kingdoms into Districts and Counties,
and those Counties into Towns and Cities; so
it is very convenient, if not as necessary, those
Cities should be subdivided, and broken into
lesser Proportions; that the mutual Offices of
Mankind one toward another, might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
executed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:37741:5"/>
And if it be so, there is a duty arising from
each Member of that Society to another, and
much more to the whole; and which a Person
can no more suppose himself discharged from,
than he can be a branch of a Family, and yet
not be obliged to seek and promote the Welfare
of it. For a Parish can no more subsist, and
answer the ends of such a prudential and useful
Constitution, than a Family can be supported,
without each Member of that Society do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his capacity contribute to the good
of it.</p>
            <p>And in the first place, the Peace of such a
Society ought with the utmost diligence to be
maintained; and all Prejudices, and Passions,
and private Interests (the great Nurseries of
Faction) ought to be laid aside. And no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
how displeasing soever another may be to
him in respect of his Temper, how prejudiced
soever he may be against him in respect of
any clashings that have been between them, how
repugnant soever their secular Interests may be,
is to right himself upon the Society's distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance;
but is to behave himself upon all Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Meetings, and in all Parochial and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Interests, as if they were all of one Mind,
and as embarked in the same design. In such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37741:6"/>
no Man is to act like a particular Person,
but still to consider the Relation he stands in to
the Community; to know neither Friend nor
Brother on one hand, nor Enemy on the other,
so as to do wrong to the whole, or to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of it; but in the Apostle's Phrase, to <hi>bear
one anothers burdens,</hi> and so <hi>to fulfil the Law of
Christ,</hi> that noble Law, That <hi>whatsoever ye would
that men should do unto you, do ye also to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a farther improvement of this
Relation; for a Parish is not only a Civil, but
a Religious Society, instituted for the Service of
the Church of God, and for the maintenance of
Religion; and this lays us under a stricter obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>In this case, a Parish is but another Name for
a Church; and each Member of such a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ought to have a mutual care for each other.
Our Church doth suppose it, where notorious
Offenders are to be taken notice of, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against, and debarred the Communion, upon
good information of their scandalous Misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
till they have given satisfaction (if
publick) to the Congregation.</p>
            <p>But how could this be, if there were not a
Society to whom this Offence is given, and a
Neighbourhood that could (generally speaking)
observe it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37741:6"/>
And accordingly, as they are thus joined in
Neighbourhood by scituation, and in an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Society by a Parochial Union; so there are
acts of Religion and Worship, which as of such
Society they are to join and Communicate in:
And that under a general Character, is what we
call Publick Worship, consisting in Prayers, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
and Instructions, Psalms, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And since these are the publick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Communion, and what we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by the Divine Command to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in, how much are they to blame that live
in the neglect of these or any of these?</p>
            <p>Of which there are Three sorts.</p>
            <p>Some that are of another Communion, that
join not in what we call Parochial; this is a
Case I will not at the present intermeddle in far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than to wish as St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another case,
<hi>I would to God,</hi> that they all were <hi>altogether such</hi>
as we are that do join in this Parochial Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and that they would examine carefully,
and lay aside all Prejudices that arise not from
the nature of the things; and that they would
think that the Peace of the Church and the
Union of Christians, are as Necessary, as they
are Beneficial and Beautiful; and that in order
hereunto, they would come as far as they can.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37741:7"/>
If this were done, I am pretty confident, that
if there were not a Union in Worship conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
upon it, yet that the Differences would
grow less, or at least, that the Charity would
be greater than the Difference is.</p>
            <p>A Second sort are those, that are in Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Members of our Parochial Churches, but
are in the largest sense Non-Communicants;
that wholly, or generally, live in the neglect
of such Duties as are the Significations and
Symbols of that Communion; that do not
frequent the Publick Worship, but loyter away
that time, which the Nature of our Religion,
the Precepts of the Gospel, and the Laws of the
Land have made it our Duty to observe: That
take it ill if they are not accounted Church-men,
and yet if you may judge of them by their
practice, are the remotest from that Character.
We call others by the Names of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
according to what they Profess, whether
Papists or Protestants, whether Presbyterians or
Independents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But of what Church are
they who live in no Communion? That rarely
or never appear in our Assemblies; and whom
ill Weather, or some Accident, or other Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
sometimes bring to these places, and
so may be at the best reputed but Occasional
Communicants?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37741:7"/>
Next to these are they that I may call Partial
Communicants; that are of the Church as to
one part, but live in the plain neglect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
no less necessary to be observed; those I
mean that neglect what is called (from the
Eminence of it) <hi>the Communion.</hi> As if it were
in their Power what to do, and what to leave
undone; and though our Lord has said, <hi>Do this
in remembrance of Me,</hi> neglect it, as it were in
Contempt of him.</p>
            <p>And now I am upon this Argument, I must
mind you of another solemn Ordinance of our
Religion, that if we respect the Use and End of
it, should first be Treated of, and that is,
Baptism. An Ordinance indeed not neglected;
For who is there amongst us that is not willing
and forward to have his Children thereby Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculated
and admitted into the Church of
God? But if we consider how it is generally
Celebrated in Private, in the corner of a Room,
in the presence of scarce so many as will enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the Company to a Congregation; it is far
from being a Solemnity, or from being treated
as a Divine Institution; far from answering the
End of that Institution: For what is the End of
that Ordinance, but to initiate the Person into
the Church of Christ, and to entitle him to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37741:8"/>
Privileges of it? And where is that Society that
he is admitted to? Is it not when Assembled
after the most Solemn and Conspicuous manner
for the Worship of God, and for the testifying
of their Communion in it? And where is the
Profession to be made before such admission,
where the Stipulation to be given, where the
Promise to undertake the Duties of a Christian,
but where the Church is? And how can all this
be done in Confusion and Precipitance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any timely notice or preparation, without
such an Assembly as the nature of the thing, as
well as the Order of the Church, in consequence
of it, doth require? The Ordinance is certainly
Publick, Publick in the Nature and End of it;
and such ought the Celebration of it to be:
And the neglect of such a Celebration is the
less excusable, because it is so easily remedied.</p>
            <p>But I come not here so much to Reprove as
to Exhort; and do no farther tax the neglect of
such, than as it may serve to awaken them that
are guilty of it, to a sense of their Duty. O what
an Honour would it be to Almighty God!
what a Service to our Religion! what a Means
to sweeten our Tempers, and to treat each other
with Fairness and Simplicity, if as we are Men
<hi>made of one blood,</hi> as we are Christians and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37741:8"/>
by the Blood of one Common Saviour,
so we could all come to join in the same Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
What a glorious sight would it be when
we come into the other World, to find all of
one Mind, no grudgings, no animosities, no
Sides nor Parties, no private or personal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
no supplanting or undermining, but that
all as much agree, as if they were but one! That
is a Church Triumphant indeed, <hi>without spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not the Church here a part of that
Blessed Society, a Nursery to train us up to it,
and supposed to be endued with the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Qualities, in a lower degree and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
And how little resemblance is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Church and Church, if we Divide as if
we are under different Heads, and had different
Creeds, and were in no expectation of having
a Portion in the Blessed State above? Whilst, I
say, we Wrangle, and Divide, and Censure,
and Revile, and treat each other like the Wild
Beasts of <hi>Africa,</hi> rather than Men, Christians,
and Brethren. These are things to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of whereever they are; but, Beloved, <hi>I
hope,</hi> and I may say of some, I know <hi>better
things of you, and things that accompany salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:37741:9"/>
Let it therefore be a Testimony of the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you have for our Religion, and of your
Zeal for the Glory of God; nay, let it be a
Testimony of the hope you have of Salvation
in the World to come; that you promote
what you can the Peace and Union of the
Church and Place to which you do belong; that
you be Frequenters of the Publick Worship of
God, attentive Hearers of the Word, Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of your Pastor that is to Instruct you, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Partakers of the Holy Ordinances, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the Lord's Supper, and the Publick
Prayers, to which the Scripture hath annexed
special Promises and Blessings.</p>
            <p>And for what end is all this required? To
what purpose was it that the Saints of Old, and
the Primitive Christians, chose to Die, and
to expose themselves to such Deaths, as came
armed with the most formidable Terrors, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than not join in the Publick Communion;
but that this was in effect to Renounce their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
And shall not we be as careful to do
our part when it is so easily and safely perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by our Attendance on the Divine Offices
maintain the Credit of Religion against Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers,
and testify as much as we can, That this is
our Religion, and what we believe to be the
True?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:37741:9"/>
               <hi>Go to the ant, thou sluggard,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon;</hi> and
we may be sent to the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and to the
<hi>Heathens,</hi> and to those of a False Religion, and
the Disguisers and Corrupters of the True (I
mean the Zealots of the Church of <hi>Rome),</hi>
to those of other Parties, to learn how to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
our Religion, and to bear Testimony to
the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>What a Reproach is it to see the Fields full
and crowded, and the Churches too often
scandalously thin on the Lord's day?</p>
            <p>To see on other days what a vast Concourse
there is on the place of Commerce, what
Crowds pass along by the Church-doors, and how
few are, in our Saviour's Phrase, <hi>able</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>to enter.</hi> How full are our Houses of Youth
and Servants, and of others that have in some
hours of the day little to do? And how often
the most Busy have time to spare, and stand at
the same time Idle and Unemploy'd, when
there is Publick Notice given that the time of
Divine Service is then come?</p>
            <p>If we were but prudent husbanders of our
Time and Business, How easily might the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Service of every day, be made, for the
most part, consistent with the common Affairs
of our Professions? And I will appeal to any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37741:10"/>
that have considered and tried it, whether this
is not generally Practicable; and I will appeal
to those that think it Unpracticable, whether
they have as carefully computed this, as they
have cast up their Books, or thought aforehand
after what manner to dispose of their time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any day to the Advantage of their own
Affairs.</p>
            <p>I would make all allowances that I can,
and pass the most favourable Constructions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the urgency of Affairs; and in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
must leave it to every Man's Conscience
(as the best Director) to answer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>This I am sure of, and what all must allow,
that if there was a joint concurrence in the
Divine Worship, that all Persons were of one
Mind, and with one Mouth Celebrated the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Praises, that the Publick Worship were Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
frequented; it would be to the Honour
of our Religion and Church, and consequently to
the Honour of God. And if I may speak my
own Opinion, from the best Observation I am
able to make, If every one did what they could,
if each Person would well and impartially
weigh his own Case; and those that are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of others, and have Families, would
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37741:10"/>
consider how to proportion and adjust their
time to their Business; and lay aside what
time they could well and conveniently
spare, the House and Service of God would
never be without a laudable Congregation. I
desire no more in this case, than I did before
of others that Dissent from us, That Persons
would do what they can. No Man knows
what he can do till he tries; till which every
Difficulty seems impossible, and every little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
a Difficulty, and every Appearance
shall be an Inconvenience.</p>
            <p>God <hi>requires not according to what we have not,
but according to what we have;</hi> and has so wisely
ordered things, that our Worldly Business and
his Service may be consistent; and we find no
inconvenience to our selves, that out of Seven
Days he has reserved one to himself.</p>
            <p>If this were left at large, and we had no such
portion of time set apart by Divine Institution,
but were to do it of our selves, or were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Superiors, we should be apt, I doubt
not, to complain, that it was impossible for us
to spare Fifty two days in a Year for such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
considering the multiplicity of our Affairs,
and the pressing Necessities we were under; we
should (I say) be apt to complain very heavily of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37741:11"/>
such a restriction. And yet notwithstanding what
this would seem to be if we had not tried, we
find it very Practicable; and those that do Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously
Observe it, and rest from all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Business on that Day, do as well dispatch
their Affairs, and are as successful, as those that
do apply as much of it as they can or dare to
their own peculiar Service. And I am Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that so it would be here, if we did but
try, and endeavoured to order our Affairs, and
husband our Time to the best Advantage.
We should then, for the most part, find that
we have spare People in our Families, that may
have leisure given them, or which those that
are in their own power may take, for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of God.</p>
            <p>Who could think but that in these Two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
in which there are (if I mistake not)
about Seven hundred Communicants, there
should be so many found as should make up a
Congregation every day; and when among the
Hundred and Thirty Houses, of which these
United Parishes consist, there are not much
above Twenty of them that, of all Persuasions,
do Dissent from us? Whoever considers this,
cannot well conceive, that all are alike employed,
and have the same pretence to excuse such an
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37741:11"/>
Omission, as tends in the consequence of it so
much to shew our want of Zeal and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Religion we Profess.</p>
            <p>The Reformation of this depends upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
and Consideration. And if upon
this they find it unpracticable, I dare be their
Compurgator, and plead their Excuse. But
that I am in some measure secured there will be
no occasion for.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have Considered the First Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
as you are in a Society, and of a Parochial
Communion.</p>
            <p>II. I am to consider you under a Domestical
Relation, that of Housholds or Families.</p>
            <p>We Read in the Epistles,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 5.</note> of a Church in the
House of <hi>Aquila</hi> at <hi>Corinth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 19.</note> which was when there
was no Place in that City for Publick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or when it was not permitted in the times
of Persecution. But however, every Christian-Family
may maintain that Character, where
the Master is a Priest, as it were, and Presides
over it: And as there is a Publick Service for
the Publick Congregation, so is there a Private
due from the Private, in which he, or some
other fit Person Deputed by him, is to Officiate.</p>
            <p>And the first Duty that offers it self to our
Consideration, is that of Domestical, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Prayer,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37741:12"/>
with which the day should begin
and end; being a just Tribute we owe to
Almighty God for our daily Preservation, and
for all the Advantages we receive from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
and Bounty of his Good Providence.
Without which we do no more than the Beasts,
who Receive, but have no Knowledge of their
Benefactor; nay, our condition seems to be
worse than theirs, who have such Faculties and
Powers as they have not, and are made for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and reap the Pleasure and the Benefit of
it. And how unseemly is it for us that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Roof, thus embodied into little Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that are conversant all the day in Business
relating to the good of the Family, and take no
notice of Almighty God, the common Guardian
and Patron?</p>
            <p>How would it look, and how would the
Master of the Family resent it, if his Children,
or his Servants, should take no notice of him
time after time, but where-ever they meet him,
pay him no Respect, nor Obey his Orders,
though he Provides for them, is Kind to them,
and continually Obliging them by his Favour
and his Care?</p>
            <p>And what an Indignity is it then in the Master
of the Houshold, and all under his Roof, to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37741:12"/>
Live upon the Bounty of Heaven, to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in their going out and coming in, their
lying down and rising up; to be Successful in the
beginning and end of their Affairs, through his
Blessing, and yet to live as if they had no need
of, or were not beholding to such a Power?</p>
            <p>And especially are these of our Communion
the less Excusable, if there be any (as I doubt
there are too many) that are guilty of this
neglect.</p>
            <p>For these are satisfied in the Lawfulness and
Expedience of Using a Form (which some of
other Communions Scruple) and which they
may readily be furnished with, out of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Books of Devotion that are extant. If
it were otherwise, that they thought a Form of
Prayer Unlawful, they might, perhaps, plead
a Disability as to themselves, a want of Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a want of Words, or Thoughts, or Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
And if it really were so, that there were
a Disability or Incapacity in the Person; and
that a Form were in it self Unlawful, or that
they did in their Conscience conceive it so to be;
then the plain Consequence would be, That there
could be no such Family-Prayer performed by
him, and that Order of Devotion must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
fall, as far as the Master is concerned
in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:37741:13"/>
But whenas the contrary to this is true, and
own'd so to be; then there is no excuse to be
pleaded: For if he cannot Pray without a Form,
yet there are Forms for him every where to be
had.</p>
            <p>The next Duty incumbent upon the Guides
and Governors of Families, is a due regard had
to the Behaviour of those under their Care, and
an Instruction of the Younger sort especially
in the necessary Principles of Religion and
Virtue.</p>
            <p>It is a great Advantage a Master of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
herein has, and that beyond the Minister;
for he is near to them, Converses with them
every day, can observe their Humours, Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and Demeanor, and so can apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a peculiar manner to them; and if he
prudently manages these occasions, he may do
it to great advantage.</p>
            <p>And especially is this evident in Catechising
and Instructing them; or if that be too much,
that he send them to be Catechised, or to hear the
Catechetical Expositions of his Pastor: This is
no toyl, takes up none of his own time; and
perhaps may be more to their Benefit.</p>
            <p>This neglect, I must confess, is what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and the Publick suffer much by; as daily
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37741:13"/>
Experience shews. It is from the want of sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the early Seeds of Piety, that the Enemy
takes the opportunity of sowing his Tares; not
only of False Principles, but of Evil Inclinations,
and of improving them to their final undoing.</p>
            <p>Here the Mischief generally begins, from
whence all Disorders in Families and Societies
do proceed: And therefore, though the Persons
themselves are guilty that fall into these evil Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and shall without Repentance suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
deeply for it another day; yet they to whom
the care of their Education did belong, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
accountable for it. For the Governors of
Families are not to repute themselves to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Persons (as I have before said in another
Case) and at liberty to do what they please,
and to use their Authority only for the service of
their own Humour or Interest; but are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that they serve a Master, as well as
others are to serve them, the Lord of both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and Servant, the common Parent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and therefore have a part to discharge,
and are answerable for.</p>
            <p>And he that shall think he has done all when
he provides Food and Cloathing, or Worldly
Necessaries and Conveniences for them, and
looks upon himself as concerned no farther,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37741:14"/>
puts his Children and Servants into the condition
of his Beasts, which have alike Treatment from
him, according to their condition. No! They
have Souls as well as he himself, and his business
is to see those as duly cared for, according to
his Power, and Capacity, and the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he has for it.</p>
            <p>If this were done, that every Family
were thus a Church, and the Service of God
set up, and a care taken for the Education of
Youth, and the bringing them up <hi>in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord;</hi> What an alteration
should we see in the face of things? What a
blessed change in the World? How much
Quiet and Comfort within doors, and how
much Order without? The Church and the
Nation would reap the blessed Fruits and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of it, and the Ages to come would
rise up and call that Blessed in which this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
did begin.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, there is a Duty also
belonging to the Inferiors; which they should
be as careful to Discharge; I mean Children
and Servants, that they be Submissive in their
Behaviour, Tractable and Obedient, Honest
and Faithful in the discharge of their Trust;
as knowing, that though such may escape the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerning
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37741:14"/>
Eye of their Master, who cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and act all by himself (for then what need
would there be of Servants and Subordinate Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers)
nor penetrate into their private and clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine
designs; yet that there is a greater Master,
to whom, though invisible to us, nothing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible:
Let them remember (as the Apostle
saith) <hi>they serve the Lord Christ;</hi> and therefore be
as Diligent and Just in the Affairs committed to
their Trust, Care and Management, as if our
Lord and Saviour himself were visibly present,
and would also be as sure to discover them to their
Superiors, as he is to know and observe them.</p>
            <p>This leads us to the</p>
            <p>IIId. Division, and that is,</p>
            <p>The State of Particular Persons, and the Duty
which every one is obliged to, as to Himself,
his Profession, and Station.</p>
            <p>Here indeed we are naturally to begin; for if
we learn to govern our selves, we shall the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
learn how to exercise all the parts of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
as to other Relations. <hi>If any man,</hi> saith the
Apostle,<note place="margin">James 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>offend not in word,</hi> has the power over
his own will and passions, <hi>the same is a perfect
man, and able also to bridle the whole body,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the Political or Oeconomical. But
this is the hardest task, for a man may sooner
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37741:15"/>
Govern others than himself; notwithstanding
all the advantages he has for it, and is, or should
be, best known to himself. And if the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be not laid here in the renovation of a man's
Temper, in the mortification of his lusts, and
the command of his passions, it must needs
slacken and cool his endeavours towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of any disorders that he is obliged, or
is in his power, to rectify. He therefore that
will be a good Parishioner, a good Master, a
good Servant, and to say all, a good Christian,
must begin with himself;<note place="margin">Luke 22. 32.</note> and <hi>if he be</hi> thus <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi>
he will be able to <hi>strengthen his brethren.</hi>
This will then prompt him forward to lay himself
out for the good of others, where-ever he is, and
according to his Capacity and the opportunity
he has for it. He will then be fit for Society, who
is neither apt to Provoke, nor to be Provoked
by others; but behaves himself with a seemly and
a regular Temper. He wil then be Just in his
Dealings, True to his Word, and be as cautious of
doing any Wrong, as any can be of suffering it.</p>
            <p>He will then live in the fear of God, and not
dare to do any thing wilfully, that may offend
the Divine Majesty, how great soever the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
be; nor neglect any Duty that the
Divine Precept has made necessary, how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37741:15"/>
soever it may be to him. For such a
one must be conceived to depend upon God in
all his Affairs, to commit himself by daily and
constant Prayer to the Guidance of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to set him before his Eyes, as the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
at present in this World, and that will be
the Rewarder of him in another.</p>
            <p>This is the Character I would above all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to you, and which I am certain, if you
come up to, as it will be the best fruit of my
Ministry, and of the many Years I have spent
in your Service, so it will be as much to your
everlasting advantage; when both Minister
and People will rejoyce together in that happy
and glorious Society we come into this World to
prepare our selves for. There is no better sight
nor happiness in this World, than to see Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to dwell together in Unity; and to find
such a Correspondence and Concordance in a
Nation, City, Parish, or Christian Society, that
there be no <hi>no breaking in,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 144. 14.</note> 
               <hi>nor going out;</hi> no reason
for complaint in our Neighbourhood; but that
by a holy emulation, each of you may strive
to outdo one another in the mutual offices of
Charity and Kindness, and to be Exemplary to
others, or to follow the good example of others
in all things becoming a Christian, and as those
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37741:16"/>
that <hi>look for that blessed hope, and glorious appearing
of the great God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we are, indeed, a small Congregation
Assembled together for the Worship of God;
and to take a solemn Farewel, as Minister and
People, after we have lived so long together in
a Parochial Communion and Fellowship. But
what is this Assembly to the whole National
Church of this Island (though for Convenience
it is divided into more than Ten thousand
lesser Congregations)? What our little Whole,
comparatively to the Catholick Church now exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent,
and dispersed far and wide upon the face
of the Earth? And what is all this to <hi>the general
Assembly</hi> of all the Faithful Servants of God
throughout all Ages that shall be convened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 10.</note>
               <hi>when our Lord shall come to be glorified in
his saints, and to be admired in all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi>
This we are always to bear in mind. Here
one Generation comes, and another goeth; but
then we that are now divided into several Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Ages, shall at once stand before the Son
of Man;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>For we must all appear before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seat of Christ, that every one may receive the
things done in his body, according to that he hath
done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, and I tremble to speak it, I must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37741:16"/>
as your Guide and Instructor to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my Stewardship, and of the Flock
committed to my Care; and you must appear
as Disciples, to be accountable for what you
have Heard and has been Taught.</p>
            <p>As for my own part, I am conscious of my
own manifold Infirmities, and of the Omissions
known and unknown that I have been guilty of
throughout the Exercise of my Ministry among
you; must beg Pardon of God and you: Of
you, that you will exercise your Charity in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
those Faults you may have observed; for
though I can say with the Apostle,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 23.</note> 
               <hi>I have cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no man's silver or gold;</hi> yet I am far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the other part of his Character.</p>
            <p>As to Almighty God, the words of the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
become me to use,<note place="margin">Psal. 130. 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldest
mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? but there
is forgiveness with thee, that thou may'st be feared.</hi>
It is that which I beg for my self and you. And,
O that the consideration of this might awaken us
all to a due sense of our condition! that we
may so live and behave our selves in this present
state of trial, as that after a short life spent here,
<hi>we may enter into,</hi> and be partakers of <hi>the joy
of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for which we have great advantages and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37741:17"/>
encouragements, which are are no less than the
Divine Assistance, which God has Promised to
bestow upon us, if we sincerely desire it; and
Acceptance through the Blood of Jesus our
alone Redeemer and Mediator.</p>
            <p>And that this may be the Issue of all, and that
you and I may meet together, and for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in the Society of Just Men made Perfect,
shall be my, and I hope will be your, constant
Prayer, according to the Advice of our Apostle:</p>
            <p>Now the God of peace that brought again from
the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd
of the sheep, through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Covenant, make you perfect in every good
work to do his will; working in you that which is
well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
