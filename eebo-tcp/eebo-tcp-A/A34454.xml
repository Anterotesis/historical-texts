         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>How great the Countrey of Iapan
is &amp; whether it be an Iſland
or no.</head>
               <p>THe Countrey of <hi>Japan</hi> is ſuppoſed to bee
an Iſland, though there bee no certainty of
it, this vaſt territorie not beeing yet wholy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to the inhabitants themſelves. I have
often enquired and been informed that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
have gone from the Province of <hi>Quanto,</hi>
the principal of his Majeſties dominions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Imperial Citie and Pallace of <hi>Iedo</hi> are
ſcituated, 27 daies North-Eaſt wards, before
they could reach the utmoſt point of the land
of <hi>Sungaer,</hi> bordering upon the Sea; being come
thither they paſſed over an Iſtmus of thirty
three Engliſh miles broad, leading into the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Iezzo</hi> abounding in ſkins &amp; furrs of price.
This territorie is very great, mountainous but
litle inhabited. The <hi>Iappaners</hi> attempted its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
ſeverall times but in vaine, for though
they entred to &amp; fro, far into the Countrey, yet
they could never find its end, nor any certainty
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning it, their proviſions ordinarily failing
them, which inforced their fruitleſſe returnes.
The diſcoverers reports of theſe, were ſoe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
that his Majeſtie diſpaired of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Satisfaction, the countrey being preſented
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56704:9"/>
as deſolate and unpaſſable, though in ſome place
inhabited with a people all over hairy (wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Beards long, like the Chineſſes) brutiſh,
though otherwiſe well ſhaped. To conſider
therefore the uncertianty whether this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
be an Iſland or no; wee may obſerve that
the paſſage betvveene <hi>Sungaer</hi> and <hi>Iezzo</hi> is no
running water, but an Inlet or long Iſtmus of the
Sea it ſelfe, 120 Engliſh Miles long, extending it
ſelfe betvvixt <hi>Iezzo</hi> and <hi>Iapan,</hi> where it bounds
upon vaſt mountaines and deſerts, about the
Province of <hi>Ochio;</hi> ſo that, that way being
vvholly unpaſſable by land, travellers are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ferry over the aforeſaid <hi>Iſthmus</hi> from

great Plains bordered with large Galleries
againſt the Sun and Rain, do preſent themſelves
to the common view. The Streets in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
are extraordinary large, built on each ſide
with goodly Pallaces, belonging to the Lords
of the Kingdom: The Caſtle Gates are very
ſtrong, and covered on both ſides with iron
Bars of an inch thick croſſing each other, and
faſtened with Bolts of the ſame: every Gate
hath his Houſe large enough to contain two or
three hundred Souldiers, and defenſible upon
occaſion: within, in the midſt of the firſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
ſtandeth his Majeſties Pallace; it is
great, and conſiſteth of ſeveral dwellings beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with Woods, to the envy of Nature, full
of Ponds, Rivers, Gardens, Plains, Courts,
places to Pickeer and Sport in, and moreover,
contains all the dwellings of his Women. The
ſecond Circumference is inhabited by the next
Princes of the blood, and thoſe of the Council:
And the third is poſſeſſed with the proud Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
and dwellings of the ſeverall Kings and
principal Dukes, and Lords of <hi>Japan.</hi> The
Cheifs of Leſſer note have their Houſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the third Round, each adorned according
to the Dignity and Riches of the Owners, all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56704:16"/>
almoſt gilt, ſo that this goodly Edifice appears
at a diſtance not unlike a Mountain of Gold;
for all the Lords (none excepted) rack them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to pleaſe his Majeſty by beautifying his
Caſtle and their own Habitations; which their
lawful Wives and Children do likewiſe enjoy
after their deceaſe, continuing always under
the Emperors eye as Hoſtages of their fidelity.
This City of <hi>Iedo</hi> is nine English Miles long,
and ſix broad, and is as cloſely built as any City
in Europe.</p>
               <p>The Court, how great ſoever, is dayly
crowded with multitudes of Nobles, who with
their numerous Trains with Horſes and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanquins</hi>
make the Streets too narrow for their
paſſage. When the Emperor goeth abroad,
ſometimes on Horſe-back, and ſometimes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in a <hi>Pallanquin,</hi> open on every ſide, he is
ordinarily accompanied with theſe Lords, who
are called his Majeſties Companions; being
all of them of high State and Revenues, though
without Lands or other Office ſave their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
They are Perſons extraordinarily qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified;
ſome in Muſick and Singing, others in
Phyſick, Writing, Painting, Elocution, and the
like. Theſe are followed by the Life-Guard,
all Perſons of quality and choice, being the
natural Sons of Kings and Princes, begot on
their Concubines and uncapable of ſucceſſion;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56704:16"/>
and the Brothers, Coſins and Kindred of great
Lords, which, by reaſon of their many Women,
are very numerous: I will give you one example.
The Emperors Uncle, King of Mito, now fifty
four years old, hath as many Sons as he hath
years, and many more Daughters, whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is unknown. After theſe follows part of
the ſecond Life-Guard, which conſiſting of
ſome thouſands, is ſo divided, that half goes
a Cannon shot before his Majeſty, and the
other half follows at the ſame diſtance.</p>
               <p>However the number of theſe Souldiers be
great, yet there is not one of them which hath
not paſſed Examination, and found to be thus
qualified: They muſt be active of body, ready
in the uſe of all ſorts of Arms, and ſomewhat
knowing in their Studies; eſpecially well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
and trained, which they are to a wonder:
for when his Maieſty moves, they go along,
Horſe and Foot, clothed all in black Silk, and
ranked before, behinde, and on each ſide of
him: They march in ſuch comely order, that
never a one is obſerved to go out of his place;
and with ſuch ſilence, that they neither ſpeak
nor make any the leaſt noiſe: Neither indeed
do the Citizens move their lips when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
paſſeth, nothing being then heard but
the ruffling of Men and Horſes: The ways
and ſtreets, are at ſuch times, made very clean,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56704:17"/>
ſtrewed with ſand and ſprinkled with water:
No doors are shut, and yet no body dares look
out either at them or at the windows, or ſo
much as ſtand in their shops to ſee the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

When his Maieſty goes on progreſs to <hi>Miako,</hi>
ſometimes the imperial City, which happens
once every five or ſeven Years, to give the
<hi>Deyro</hi> (which is the true Heir of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and lives there) a viſit, the preparations
are making an whole year before the orders
are given on what day and with what train
every great Man shall go, to the end that the
ways may not be peſtered with their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
Half of the great Lords, according to
their turns ſet out ſome days before, then
follows his Maieſty with his Councellers, who
are followed ſome days after by the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kings and Lords. The concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at ſuch a time is incredible, the whole City,
though containing above One hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Houſes, not being big enough to lodge
them all; ſo that tents and huts are raiſed round
about the ſame for the Souldiers and common
People.</p>
               <p>The diſtance betwixt <hi>Jedo</hi> and <hi>Miako</hi> is
reckoned to be one hundred twenty five Dutch
miles; At every two or three miles there is a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56704:17"/>
City or open Town; and the whole is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into twenty and eight Giſts or Lodgings,
whereof twenty are ſtrong Caſtles: there is in
every quarter, from the firſt to the laſt, a train
of Gentlemen, Souldiers, Horſe, Proviſions,
and all neceſſaries befitting ſo great a Prince,
ordered there for his reception and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thoſe that ſet out with him from <hi>Jedo</hi>
ſtay in the firſt lodging; thoſe that were there
remove with him to the ſecond; thoſe of the
ſecond to the third, and ſo to the laſt; ſo that
each train and their dependants follow his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
but half a day, until all of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their inſtructions, marching in order,
do at length arrive at <hi>Miako,</hi> leaving the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Caſtles and Lodgings to their uſual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
and Guards. In the return from <hi>Mia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko</hi>
to <hi>Jedo</hi> the ſame method is obſerved, all
things being prepared as formerly, without
trouble or confuſion.</p>
               <p>This year 1636 there is an extraordinary
great Edifice and Building at <hi>Niko,</hi> four days
journey from <hi>Jedo,</hi> which is to be the Burial
place of the Emperors Father, in whoſe Temple
the great Copper Crown which the Eaſt-India-Company
gave his Majeſty laſt year, is hung
up. There is likewiſe in this territory of <hi>Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko</hi>
a very great Caſtle, with double moats and
ſtone walls, ſtrong and ſumptuous: there are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56704:18"/>
ſeveral Palaces in it; as alſo a great number of
Artificers, as Painters, Maſons, Statue-Cutters,
Gold, Silver, and Iron-Smiths, Cloathiers, and
all ſorts of Handy-Crafts-Men, who have their
tasks ſet them, but are well paid. This Caſtle,
which ſeemed to require three years for its
building, was finished in five moneths, though
it lies far in the Country, and out of all ways,
being only made to receive his Majeſty in his
ceremonious viſits of his Fathers Sepulchre.</p>
               <p>His Majeſties Treaſure conſiſts in Silver and
Gold, packd in Cheſts, each weighing one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Teyls,</hi> that is about fourſcore ordinary
pounds weight: theſe are placed in the ſeveral
Towers of his Caſtle together, with other le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies,
with their writings, which are kept for
their Antiquity. This vaſt Treaſure increaſes
dayly, for the Revenue of two moneths, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to defray the Emperors expences, how
great ſoever, for one whole year.</p>
               <p>This Emperors Father being the Son of <hi>Ongo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchio,</hi>
who poſſeſſed himſelf of the Government
after the late troubles, died about the fiftieth
year of his age, in the year of our Saviour 1631:
being ſenſible of his end, he called his Son to
him, and amongſt many other good counſels,
concluded to this purpoſe; <hi>My Kingdom and all
my Treaſures are yours; but vvhat I recommend
to you I likevviſe deliver you, The old Lavvs and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56704:18"/>
Chronicles of the Countrey, our vvritten Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

principal Ievvels of my Crovvn are likevviſe in
it; receive them all as they deſerve, for they are
mine, and vvere highly valued by your fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
The Jewels which were accounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable,
are theſe following; whereof he

               <p>Theſe ſix pieces beſtowed on the three Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are but of little worth, in compariſon of
the ſix other given the Emperor, and yet they
are valued at a thouſand gold <hi>Oebans,</hi> that is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56704:19"/>
forty ſeven Teylens a piece. The Silver and
Gold which his Majeſty gave to the Princes of
his blood, to ſeveral of his favorite Kings, their
Wives, his companion Lords, his Soldiers and
Gentlemen amounted upon account to above
Thirty Millions ſterling.</p>
               <p>The preſent Emperor being after his Fathers
deceaſe in full and peaceable poſſeſſion of the
Government, had as then no lawful Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much given to Sodomy, which moved the
<hi>Deyro</hi> to ſend him two beautiful Ladies, (of
his own kindred, and every way accomplished)
with a deſire that he would be pleaſed to chuſe
one of them, that beſt pleaſed him, for his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
or Empreſs. He did indeed conſent to the
<hi>Deyros</hi> requeſt, but followed his old way of
living; ſo that the young Lady, being deſtitute
of the converſation she might reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
was extreamly afflicted, although she
durſt not let it appear for fear of her Husband's
diſpleaſure. At length her Foſter-Mother (a
Lady of great credit, both in reſpect of her age,
and in that she had bred up ſo great a Princeſs)
finding the Emperor one day in a good humor,
adventured, though very ſubmiſſively, to ſpeak
to him in behalf of her Miſtris; which she did
as followeth. <hi>Hovv is it poſſible that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
affections should be carried avvay vvith
ſuch unnatural pleaſures, and that ſo beautiful a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56704:19"/>
Creature as your ovvn Handmaid, vvho vvould
rejoice you in bearing another like to your Self,
should be forgotten, certainly she ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</hi>
The Tyrant, though till now in his fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
grew angry, yet ſaid nothing; but riſing
up retired immediatly: and ſending for all the
Overſeers of his Buildings, commanded them
forthwith to begin and build him a Caſtle, with
high Walls, Moats, Bridges, and ſtrong Gates;
as alſo to adorn it within with all manner of
neceſſary and ſumptuous appertainments and
Lodgings. The work being finished with
more then ordinary haſte, the beautiful Queen,
her Foſter-Mother, and all that train of young
Ladies which she brought with her from <hi>Mia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko,</hi>
were put into it, where she is kept without
the ſight of men, and intirely forſaken of her
Husband. The Emperor's own Foſter-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was likewiſe in great eſteem and
reſpect as his own Mother, being much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at this action of his Majeſty, and ſeeing he
had no Children, neither was like to have any
whilſt he lived thus, ſent into the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in his Dominions to ſearch out the moſt
charming beauties that could be found; which
done, she diſpoſes of them in ſuch manner, that
his Majeſty inſenſibly had the ſight of them all;
among the reſt there was a ſlight maid, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morers
Daughter, who did ſo far pleaſe him,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56704:20"/>
and gain upon his affections, that he lay with
her. The great Ladies of the Court, ſeeing an
Artificers Girl preferred before them all, mad
with jealouſie and rage, reſolved to ſtrangle
her Childe in its birth, which they cruelly
performed; but have hitherto kept the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of ſo black a deed from the Emperor, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his juſt indignation and revenge.</p>
               <p>The Japan Chronicles write, that this great
Kingdom hath, until this hundred years, been
ſtill governed by an Hereditary Prince, which
they call <hi>Deyro,</hi> who was in ſuch reverence
with the people, that never any tumults or civil
broils were raiſed againſt his Perſon or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
He was eſteemed ſo Sacred, that to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him was judged no leſs criminal then to
fight againſt the Gods; both being inexpiable.
When any difference aroſe betwixt his ſubject-Kings,
ſo that they armed each againſt other,
there was a <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> appointed to mediate
their quarrels, and punish, if need were, the
offending or tranſgreſſing Prince: For the <hi>Dey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros</hi>
themſelves were eſteemed ſo holy, that they
never trod upon the ground; neither was the
Sun or Moon ever ſuffered to shine upon them;
nothing of their Body was diminished or pair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
off, their hair, beard and nails being ſuffered
to grow at length: When they did eat, their
meat was ſtill dreſſed in new pots, and ſerved
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56704:20"/>
up in new dishes. They have twelve married
Wives apiece, who are ſeverally honored and
brought with various ceremonies to this height
and ſtate: When the <hi>Deyro</hi> goes abroad, he is
followed with theſe twelve Women, each in
her Coach, adorned with her Arms and Titles;
theſe have their Houſes and Trains apart, all in
the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s Palace, built in rows, ſix on a ſide,
very magnificent, and beautified (as the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es)
with their Names, Arms and Titles. The
Concubines dwell likewiſe by themſelves. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is provided every evening in every one of
theſe twelve Houſes, with voices and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
though none knows who shall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
with the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s company. Where the
<hi>Deyro</hi> enters, the banqueting and proviſion of
the other eleven Houſes is immediatly brought
thither; the other eleven Wives following
with their Ladies and Muſick, to divert and
make merry with her whom the <hi>Deyro</hi> thinks
at preſent worthy of his converſation: They
have their Comedies likewiſe, and ſuch other
paſtimes as befit ſo ſplendid an entertainment.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Deyro</hi> is bleſſed with a Son, the
hoped Succeſſor of that Empire, a Nurſe is
choſen for him out of eighty of the lovelieſt
Women of the Country, young and Noble
Wives to Perſons of great quality and birth:
Theſe Women are honored and received by the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56704:21"/>
                  <hi>Deyro</hi>'s twelve Wives, and all his Women, as
alſo thoſe nine principal Lords who are of his
blood and kindred, and next the inheritance
in caſe he have no iſſue male, with extraordinary
ceremonies and feaſting. The following day
forty are choſen out of the fourſcore, the
which, the number decreaſing, are entertained
more honorably then before; the day being
ſpent in uſual and pompous diverſions, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
forty retain the Titles and Dignities of
Foſter-Mothers, but are diſmiſſed from further
attendance, though not without gifts and rich
preſents. Ten are again choſen out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
forty; out of theſe ten three; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
out of theſe three one; in all which electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the honors, ceremonies and preſents are
ſucceſſively heightned. Three days after the
laſt choſen Nurſe is again highly entertained;
which being done, the milk is preſſed out of
her breſts into the Childes mouth, (which all
this while is held by one of the nobleſt Ladies
of the Court;) which ceremony done, the
Nurſe is as then eſteemed worthy to take that
Childe into her cuſtody, being it hath taſted of
her milk and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>The Ceremonies and Feaſts of their Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
Childe-bearings, and thoſe other which
they celebrate yearly, are performed with much
ſtate and modeſt pomp, and are at this day in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56704:21"/>
uſe by the <hi>Deyro,</hi> who wants nothing, ſave
that the Land is governed by another; the
reaſon and hiſtory whereof we will briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>The Office of Chief General was formerly
the firſt in the whole Kingdom, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
was conferred upon the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Son; but having then another Son,
which, for the Mothers ſake, he was willing
to advance, he divided this great charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, with command, that they should
govern each his three years by turn. This took
for ſome time, until one of them, having
taſted the ſweetneſs of ruling, was loath to
quit ſo ſplendid an employment; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leagues with the great Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and ſettles his power ſo faſt, during his
Commiſſion, that neither the commands and
entreaties of his Father, nor the violence of
his offended Brother, were able to remove
him: Yet this being a buſineſs of ſo ill and
ſo great conſequence, and like to embroil
the Kingdom in diſorders, the <hi>Deyro</hi> reſolved
to chaſtiſe his rebellious Son; which, by the
aſſiſtance of his Kings, and the valour of his
former General, he did. And this was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and the firſt inteſtine war that ever
happened againſt the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s State and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56704:22"/>
The aforeſaid General being for his good
ſervice continued in his command, ordered his
buſineſs ſo well, that after his Majeſties death
he made himſelf Lord of his inheritance, uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Government of the Kingdom wholly
into his hands; leaving yet the <hi>Deyra</hi>'s Court
in its former ſtate and greatneſs, (his Succeſſor
to his Revenue) and commanding he should
be uſed in all things with the ſame reſpect and
ceremony as before. Theſe proceedings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
another War, another General being
choſen; who having overthrown the former,
uſurped to himſelf what he had condemned in
his Predeceſſor, the Soveraignity of the whole
Land; which occaſioned a third inteſtine War
more cruel and more deſtroying then the other
two: For now the Kings and Governors of
Provinces began to ſet up each for himſelf, ſo
that the Countrey was well nigh ruined (Town
being againſt Town, and City againſt City)
by theſe diſſenting Grandees: During theſe
troubles it fell out that a bold active Fellow,
formerly a private Souldier, thinking it beſt
fishing in troubled waters, reſolved to put in
for a share; Having therefore got together
forty or fifty Companions, as deſperate as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he in a little time, what with his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and good conduct, grew very numerous
and conſiderable, and having taken ſeveral
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56704:22"/>
Caſtles and Towns, drove likewiſe all that
ſtood him out of the field; ſo that in leſs then
three years he became abſolute and Soveraign
Lord of the whole Kingdom. He, as the other
Uſurpers, left the <hi>Deyro</hi> in quiet poſſeſſion of
all he formerly enjoyed (except the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
which he held himſelf; and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
by the ſaid <hi>Deyro,</hi> (unable to vindicate
his own right) acknowledged and crowned
Emperor of Japan with unimaginable pomp
and magnificence.</p>
               <p>This Emperor, whoſe name was <hi>Taycko,</hi>
being no leſs prudent then brave, fearing leſt the
great Lords of his Kingdom, reflecting upon
the lowneſs of his former condition might
contemn his preſent Authority, as diſdaining
to be governed by one leſs then themſelves,
thought it beſt to keep them in action, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to divert them from caviling a new; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſent thoſe Kings and Chiefs, that he feared
moſt, with an Army of ſixty thouſand Men,
to war againſt <hi>Corea,</hi> and reduce that Country
to the obedience of the <hi>Iapan</hi> Empire. Theſe
he held there with kinde meſſages, and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
promiſes of ſuccours ſeven whole years,
commanding they should not return till they
had ſubdued and made conqueſt of all: But
the Army longing for their Country, their
Wives and Children, and deſpairing of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56704:23"/>
mutined; and deſtroying, burning, and
plundering all they could meet, endeavoured
the ſatisfaction of their pretended wrongs by
the deſolation of others. The <hi>Coreans,</hi> unable
to endure this violence any longer, ſent an
Ambaſſador to the Emperour <hi>Taycko,</hi> who,
being admitted into his Court, found means
to take away his life by poiſon, in revenge of
the manifold wrongs his Country had ſuffered
by the injurious ambition of this Prince. The
Kings and Lords, commanding the Army in
<hi>Corea,</hi> hearing of their Emperor's death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to quit that Country, and to return eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one to his own, in expectation and hopes
who amonſt them might be choſen to ſucceed
in the Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>The Emperor being removed, left one only
Son behinde him, called <hi>Fideri,</hi> about ſix
years of age; but before he died he appointed
him a Governor, one of the greateſt Lords
of his Country, by name <hi>Ongoſchio;</hi> one whom
he had obliged by his favors, and relied upon
above all others for his fidelity: To this Perſon
he delivered his Infant-Son, with command,
that when he was fifteen years of age, he should
cauſe him to be crowned by the <hi>Deyro,</hi> with
the uſual Pomps and Ceremonies, as Emperor
of <hi>Iapan. Ongoſchio</hi> being thus declared Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of the Princes Perſon, was likewiſe by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56704:23"/>
                  <hi>Taycko</hi>'s will, and the conſent of his Subject-Kings,
made Regent of the Kingdom during
the minority, which for ſome time he peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
ruled in his Maſter's name: But growing
now weary of ſubordination, he quickly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
his promiſe made to <hi>Taycko,</hi> and ſealed
with his blood; <hi>Fideri</hi> being therefore to be
removed, to make place for his greatneſs, he
aſſaulted him firſt in his reputation, by laying
thoſe things to his charge he was no way guilty
of; amongſt others, he accuſed him of diſtruſt
of his Tutor, and that he made private prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to extort the Government out of his
hands by force, before his time; he laid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ambition, and an untimely deſire of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to his charge, in that he ſuffered himſelf to
be adored as Emperor before he was inveſted
with the Power; and that the Kings and Lords
of the Realm, had done him that reverence
which was only due to a received Emperor.
But armed ambition needs not many excuſes,
<hi>Ongoſchio</hi> muſters his united forces in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Surnga,</hi> and marching thence to <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacka,</hi>
where <hi>Fideri</hi> held his Court, beſieged
him with all his might. <hi>Fideri,</hi> having held out
three moneths, being now reduced to great
extremity, would prevent his ruine by a ſordid
ſubmiſſion; he therefore ſent to <hi>Ongoſchio</hi> to
beg his life, quitting all his pretence to the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56704:24"/>
Empire, and deſiring only to ſurvive a Vaſſal
to the Conqueror. But <hi>Ongoſchio</hi> refuſed all
manner of capitulation; and though <hi>Fideri</hi> ſent
out his Wife, who was his Adverſaries Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to ſupplicate his ſafety, she could not be
heard of her Father. The Caſtle being taken,
the Palace where <hi>Fideri</hi> had retired himſelf,
with his Mother and chief Friends, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
with great poſts and palliſadoes,
and much wood being piled up about it, the
unfortunate Prince, and all them that were
with him, were miſerably burnt and conſumed
with ſire. <hi>Ongoſchio</hi> having thus deſtroyed his
Maſter, put all them to death who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
and of his party; bringing the whole
Empire under his obedience by force, as <hi>Tayc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko</hi>
had done before him. The year following
<hi>Ongoſchio</hi> died, not enjoying long what his
violence had ſo quickly got him, his Son <hi>Coubo,</hi>
or <hi>Couboſanna,</hi> ſucceeded him, who was Father
to this preſent Emperor <hi>Chiongon,</hi> now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

in ſervice, entertained by the aforeſaid
Kings and Lords, amount to three hundred
ſixty eight thouſand Foot, and thirty ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
eight hundred Horſe. Beſides theſe his
Majeſty hath one hundred thouſand Foot, and
twenty thouſand Horſe, which he paies out of
his own Revenue, and keeps for the Garriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56704:25"/>
of his Caſtles and Forts, and the ſecuring
of his own Perſon. Moſt of the Lords, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the moſt powerful, do ordinarily keep
double the number of Souldiers, and many
more then they are obliged to by their tax;
and all to out vie each other, and the better to
ingratiate themſelves with their common Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
as hath appeared at large in the late War.
The Horſe-Men are all harnaſſed, though the
Foot have no other defenſive arms then a Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece;
the Horſe are armed, ſome with short
Guns, ſome with short Pikes, others with
Bows and Arrows, and all with Swords or
Sables. The Foot have likewiſe Sables, Pikes,
and Halberts, and thoſe that are divided into
Companies Fire-Arms: every five Souldiers
have their Commander armed as they are; five
of theſe Chiefs have likewiſe thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them; and their five and twenty, and
twice twenty five, make a compleat Company,
commanded by two Heads, who, with their
fifty, are commanded by a Captain in chief:
five of theſe ordinary Companies are again
commanded by another; and fifty Companies
have likewiſe their principal Officer; the ſame
method and order being held under the Horſe.
His Majeſty may eaſily and exactly know how

               <p>THe Revenues of the commanding Lords,
as appears by their ſpecifications, are very
great, and yet they have, by reaſon of their
vaſt expences, enough to do with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys:
Firſt, they are obliged, though never ſo
far diſtant from Court, to reſide ſix moneths
every year in the City of <hi>Jedo,</hi> to wait upon
the Emperor. Thoſe of the North and Eaſt
come one half year, which being expired, they
are relieved by them of the South and Weſt;
who depart with his Majeſties leave, after much
Ceremony, Feaſting, and receiving of Preſents
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56704:28"/>
back to their ſeveral Countries. Thus they
take their turns at Court, which is infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive,
by reaſon of their numerous trains,
ſome of them travelling to and fro with one,
two, three, four, five, and ſix thouſand men.
The Lord of <hi>Firando,</hi> (where our Eaſt-India-Company
hath a Lodge) being but one of the
leaſt among them, travels with three hundred
Men, Gentlemen and others; and hath in his
two Houſes at <hi>Iedo</hi> above a thouſand Perſons,
Men and Women. Thus each Lord lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Means and Dignity, rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
then ſparing; ſo that the City ſwarms with
Men and Attendance, which makes the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
high and very dear. Their ſumptuous
Buildings, their gorgeous Cloathing of their
Servants, eſpecially their Women and their
Attendants, their Feaſts, their Preſents, and
other extraordinary Expences of that proud
and pompous Court, do ſufficiently keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theſe great Men; for their Charges ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
their Revenues, and they are found moſt
commonly to be much behinde hand. Beſides
all this his Majeſties orders, the making of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
publick Buildings, as High-Ways, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
Caſtles, and the like, all which are divided
amongſt the aforeſaid Lords then at Court,

without reſpect of expence, to the envy of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56704:29"/>
each other, with all ſpeed and induſtry imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
The chief Lords when they build new
Palaces for themſelves, do beſides the ordinary
Gates and Doors, cauſe another great and
ſumptuous Port to be made, beautified with
Statues, and wrought all with hard Wax, or
Indian Lack, and richly guilt. This Entry being
finiſhed, it is covered all over with Plancks,
to keep the Sun and Rain from it; and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
ſo incloſed and ſhut up, until ſuch time
as the Emperour honours that Houſe with his
preſence: After his Majeſty hath paſſed and
re-paſſed through the ſaid Gate, it is wholly
ſhut up and never opened more; no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards found worthy to go in or out
at that Door, which hath been graced with the
Princes entry. His Majeſty doth go but once
to feaſt in one Houſe, all the preparations for
his entertainment being made ready long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with great care and coſt; every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
adorned with his Arms, and afterwards
never uſed more, but preſerved with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
in remembrance that the Emperour
did vouchſafe to eat in that Houſe. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is always invited three years before hand,
in which time the preparations fit for ſo royal
a Gueſt are making. After the Emperour hath
been there one day, the Princes of his blood,
his Councellors, and the Kings and great Lords
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56704:29"/>
are treated with incredible magnificence three
whole Moneths together. Briefly, the building
of ſuch a Palace, and the treating of ſo great a
Prince, is ſufficient to make a rich King poor;
and yet theſe ruinning profuſions are not to be
avoided. When his Majeſty goes a Hern-hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hath taken ſome of thoſe Birds, being
of great eſteem in thoſe Countries, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
beſtows one of them upon one Favorite
or other; which Preſent coſts the Receiver
at leaſt a half years Revenue: for the Gift is ſo
highly valued, having been taken by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
Hawks, and given with his own hands,
that the whole City ſeems to partake of the joy,
it being abundantly teſtified by Feaſting and
Preſents.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Satſuma</hi> had lately the honour
to entertain the Emperour in his new Palace,
but with better fortune then any of his greateſt
Princes; for his Majeſty was ſo well pleaſed
with his treatment, that he made him a Preſent
(of Beans, as he pleaſed to tearm it, for his
Horſes) worth threeſcore thouſand Pounds a
year.</p>
               <p>The Emperor diſpoſes of the marriages of
his great Lords, who entertain their Wives
which are ordered them by him with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
carreſings; they receive and lodge them
in their beſt Palaces, and allow them ten, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56704:30"/>
&amp;c. to a hundred and more Gentle women
and Maid-Servants, according to their abilities,
to wait upon them, when they go abroad to
viſit their Friends, which is allowed but once
a year. Their Women follow them in ſhut
Pallacquins, forty or fifty in number, each of
them with two Chamber-Maids, on each ſide
of their Pallacquins one. Theſe Pallacquins
are very richly made, wrought with Lack and
inlaid with Gold, carried ſome nine foot from
each other in good order, with great modeſty.
The Wife that is given by the Emperor, is the
Mother of thoſe Children which ſucceed in
their Father's honors; but if ſhe prove Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
or have no Heir male, the Kingdom, or
Government, is ordinarily beſtowed upon a
Stranger to that Race and Family. Every Lord
may have as many Concubines as he pleaſes,
or can maintain, whereby Children indeed are
multiplied, though none inherit but thoſe that
are legitimate. Theſe Lords enjoy all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
they can imagine, in the fruition of their
Women, Houſes, Gardens, Ponds, Walks,
Muſick, Plays, and the like. They ſuffer no
Men to come into their Wives Houſes upon
any pretence whatſoever, unleſs it be ſome few
who are next of blood, and that but very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
theſe are kept cloſe and careful; and all
their Women, young and old, great and of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56704:30"/>
lower condition, muſt thus ſpend their time,
without any manner of converſation with men;
the leaſt ſuſpition is puniſht with death; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no leſs criminal to be thought ill, then to be
really ſo. Theſe Attendants are choice Maids,
bred up in an humble and honeſt manner, and
ſo obſervant of their Maſter and Lady, that
they neither ſpeak nor ſmile, but as they are
directed by their eye or motion. They are
clothed in Silks of ſeveral colours, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
into ſeveral orders; ſome wear red
veſtments, with green girdles and green head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires;
others yellow, with violet girdles and
tires; others white, with red girdles and tires;
and others, other ſuch colours as they beſt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
moſt embroydered with Gold. Every order
hath its Officers, conſiſting ordinarily of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Perſons, who are ſeated according to their
quality, and ſerved according to the cuſtom
of their Country. Thoſe young Perſons are
all of Noble Extraction, fair, well bred, and
not entertained into this ſervice for leſs time
then twenty years; ſome, nay moſt, for their
whole lives. Many are received into ſervice at
the age of four or five and twenty, ſome at the
age of twenty eight or thirty; and are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in marriage by their Lords, upon ſome of
their Gentlemen, or Officers, according to
their merit; whom he then honours with an
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56704:31"/>
increaſe of ſtipend, beſides preſent ſums of
money. Thoſe who arrive to the age of above
thirty years in their ſervice, do ordinarily ſpend
their whole lives there, being preferred to
Offices under their Ladies. All the married
Women, of what quality ſoever, are trained
up by ſuch rules, that they buſie not themſelves
with the affairs of this life, or trouble their
Husbands with unneceſſary queſtions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
to avoid harſh returns, which are the
conſequences of any demands of that kinde,
when ever the Husbands viſit their Wives,
which is never but for their own diverſion;
they diveſt themſelves of all ſorts of buſineſs,
not reſuming the conſideration of it till they
quit the place, where the whole treatment is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
relating to what is amorous, as Banquets,
Muſick, Dancing, Plays, and the like, wherein
the Women have an extraordinary dexterity
and addreſs in pleaſing their Husbands. The
reaſon they give (eſpecially the great Ones)
why their Wives are kept thus retired, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred
from the company of Men and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
is firſt, as they ſay, Becauſe the Woman
is to ſerve the Man, to divert him, to bring
him Children, to give them education, and for
no other end; further, to avoid jealouſie and
its conſequences, of vexation, blood and war,
which they have gathered from former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56704:31"/>
when their Women had more liberty;
as alſo from tragical examples, recorded in their
Hiſtories, of divers who have been deceived
and ruined by them. Their Women are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
true and modeſt, even to bluſhing,
whereof I ſhall inſtance an example or two:
There was in the Kingdom of Fingo a Perſon
of quality, who had a Wife of extraordinary
beauty; the King cauſed him to be ſecretly
murthered, and after ſome time ſent for his
Lady to Court: She obayed; but knowing
her Husband was made away by his practices,
anſwered his importunities in theſe words;
Mighty Prince, I ought in reaſon to rejoyce
and account my ſelf extream happy, in being
thought worthy to ſerve your Majeſty; yet
permit me to affirm, that at the ſame inſtant
you approach me, I will kill my ſelf; but if you
ſhall pleaſe to grant what I ſhall deſire of you,
I will give my ſelf up to be your humble Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid:
Allow me then the reſpite of thirty
days, wherein I may mourn for my Husband,
and cauſe him to be interred according to his
Dignity; after which, that I may, upon the
Tower of your Caſtle, make a Feaſt for my
Husband's Friends, with them to put an end
to my mourning. The King condiſcended to
this requeſt; but wondred at the curioſity of
it. The Ceremony being performed, at which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56704:32"/>
the King was preſent, and in a good humour,
well heated with wine and his paſſions) the
Lady withdrew to the ſide of the Gallery, as
if ſhe would have repoſed, and upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
threw her ſelf over the walls, and broke
her neck, in the preſence of the King and thoſe
that were with him.</p>
               <p>The other is of a certain Lord, who ſent
about through his dominions for ſome young
Gentlewomen to attend upon his Lady; and
amongſt others found a poor Widows Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who was ſo acceptable to her Lord, that
he received her into the number of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines.
Her Mother being reduced to great
wants, wrote a Letter to her, wherein ſhe at
large ſet forth her poverty, and the miſerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her condition. While the Daughter
was buſie in reading of it, her Lord comes in,
and ſhe endeavouring to hide the Letter, he
perceived it, and in great choler would know
what the Letter was, from whom and from
whence it came? ſhe, aſhamed to diſcover
the poverty of her Mother, refuſed to tell him;
whereupon he endeavored to force it from her,
which ſhe to prevent, put it into her mouth,
and would have ſwallowed it; but not being
able to get it down, it ſtuck in her throat and
choaked her. The Lord, mad with rage and
jealouſie, cauſed her immediatly to be cut up,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56704:32"/>
to ſearch for the Letter; but finding the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of it, and that it contained only the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of her Mothers poverty, was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with grief and ſorrow, that he could
not refrain his tears; and in the ſenſe of it, ſent
for his Concubines Mother, who at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
lives in the houſe with him, in much honor
and eſteem. The modeſty of theſe females
extends to their private converſation, ſo that
they are very careful, even in the preſence of
their next of kindred, not to let fall any word
which may ſavour of the leaſt lightneſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency;
not daring to ſpeak of marriage,
though lawful, nor the way to it; and if any
unſeemly diſcourſe, though but in appearance,
ſhould happen, the youngeſt ariſe immediatly
and quit the company.</p>
               <p>They honour and love their Parents even to
devotion, believing firmly, that thoſe who
do the contrary, cannot eſcape the vengeance
of the Gods; this piety extends to them that
gave them their lives after their death; the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
of their deceaſe being ceremoniouſly
obſerved, by their abſtaining upon that day
from eating any thing that hath life or motion.</p>
               <p>But to return from whence we digreſſed;
the Revenue of the governing Lords is diverſe
and various; ſome Countries produce Corn
and Fruit, others Gold and Silver; ſome again
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56704:33"/>
Braſs, Iron, Tin, Lead, and others again cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Manufactures, Hemp, Cotton, Silk,
and the like; all which are calculated, valued,
and perfectly known to the Emperor.</p>
               <p>Theſe ruling Princes have each of them a
Chancellor, impoſed by the Emperour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
ordinarily with this following comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>Sir, your Government is great, and your
Subjects are many; and therefore I have thought
fit, out of the care I have of your good, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
you an Aſſiſtant, being a perſon wiſe and
truſty, bred up under my eyes, and in my houſe;
employ therefore his ſervices, and let it not be
unacceptable to you that we ſtudy your welfare.</hi>
This perſon is received with great thanks, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
feaſting and preſents; and (though an
open Spie upon his Maſter's actions,) treated
with much honour and reſpect. Theſe Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
are men knowing in affairs, and ſuch
as the Emperor abſolutely confides in. The
more to enſure them to his intereſt, he cauſes
them not only to promiſe and ſwear, but to
ſign like wiſe with their bloods, that they ſhall
take exact account of every particular, great
and ſmall, that may concern the State; and alſo
keep a dayly account, or Diary, of their Lords
lives and actions, and ſend the ſame over to
him by expreſſes. None of the Kings or Lords
can or may do any thing of themſelves, the

being at the diſpoſal of theſe men, as their
principal Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Moſt of theſe Lords entertain alwaies by
them ſome choice Perſons for parts and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
only to obſerve their actions, and
tell them of their faults; which they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
do without reſpect or flattery, for they
ſay, no man can ſee his own errours ſo well as
another, eſpecially thoſe who are called to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
as more ſubject to the tranſports of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and pride, they had therefore rather hear
of their faults by their truſty Servants to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them, then to be ill ſpoken of behind their
backs; and for this reaſon theſe ſecret Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
are alwaies near their Lords perſons, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at Feaſts and publique meetings, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their words and leaſt actions. Theſe
Lords though they have their particular names,
yet they are ordinarily called by that of their
Government or reſidence; further every man
hath three names, the children a childiſh, when
they are men a more manly, and being become
old get others ſuitable to the decays of nature
and age: The ſurnames are firſt pronounced,
for being their parents were before them, they
think it but reaſonable that their names ſhould
likewiſe precede. When one of theſe Lords
die, ten, twenty, or thirty of his Vaſſals kill
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56704:35"/>
themſelves to bear him company: many that
do ſo, oblige themſelves to it during their
Lords lives; for having received ſome more
then ordinary grace and favour from him, and
fancying themſelves better beloved then their
companions, they think it a ſhame to ſurvive
their Benefactour; and therefore in return of
their thanks they uſually add, <hi>My Lord, the
number of your faithful Slaves is great, but
what have I done to merit this honour? this Body,
which is indeed yours, I offer you again, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
it ſhall not live longer then yours; I will not
ſurvive ſo worthy a Patron.</hi> For confirmation
of this they drink a bowl of Wine together,
which is ſolemn; for no covenants thus made
are to be broken. Thoſe that thus binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
cut their own bellies, and do it as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:
They aſſemble their neareſt kindred,
and going to Church, they celebrate the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
feaſt upon mats and carpets in the midſt of
the Plain, where having well eat and drank,
they cut up their bellies, ſo that the guts and
entrails burſt out; and he that cuts himſelf
higheſt, as ſome do even to the throat, is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the braveſt fellow, and moſt eſteemed. If
the Lord cauſe a wall to be built, either for the
King or himſelf, his Servants often times beg
they might have the honour to lie under, out
of a belief, that what is founded upon a living
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56704:35"/>
mans fleſh, is ſubject to no misfortune: This
requeſt being granted, they go with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the deſigned place, and lying down there,
ſuffer the foundation ſtones to be laid upon
them, which with their weight, immediately
bruiſe and ſhiver them to pieces.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty hath ſeveral Caſtles ſtrong and
great, whereof thoſe of <hi>Oſaua</hi> and <hi>Iedo</hi> are
the moſt magnificent. The Countries belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Kings and great Lords, are not much
travelled by our Nation, ſo that we have no
knowledg of them; only I am informed that
they have mighty Towns and Caſtles: None
of theſe Cities are walled, though their ſtreets
are regular every one, and equally long; the
ends of them ſhut with Gates, and guarded
with Watchmen by night or times of danger.
The Country waies are marked at every miles
end with ſtones or ſtakes, being put up for
that purpoſe. In their Towns and Villages
every ſtreet hath two Magiſtrates, who take
care for their precinct, and muſt give an
account for whatever happens in them; and
becauſe none through clowniſhneſs, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

except it be for the ground their houſes ſtand
upon, which is the Lords; and for that they
give from forty ſhillings to two yearly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the greatneſs of their houſes. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
houſe muſt finde a man upon occaſion,
which happeneth three or four times a year,
though but for an hour, and ſometimes for
half a day or ſo. The King, or Lord, hath
the whole product of the Land and Sea; the

their Lord aſſigns them out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;

               <head>What Crimes they punish
moſt ſeverely.</head>
               <p>EVery individual, from the Emperour to
the meaneſt Gentleman, hath the right of
Juſtice over his Subjects and Servants. His
Majeſty hath his ordinary Judges in all his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Towns. When a Gentleman, or
Souldier, is condemned to die, he is allowed
the honour to kill himſelf, by cutting up his
belly with his own hands; whereas the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
Marchant, and meaner perſons, ſuffer by
the common Executioner. A Marchant, how
rich ſoever, is not eſteemed at all, becauſe
they ſay, He liveth by his lying, making no
conſcience to couſen and deceive the People
for his filthy lucre ſake: The Citizen and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer
are likewiſe undervalued, becauſe they
are but Servants to the Commonalty, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to live by their labours and manufactures:
Neither are the Country People of more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
becauſe of the miſerableneſs of their
condition, being ſubject to perpetual ſlavery
and toyling. But the Gentlemen and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who are numerous, are honoured and
feared; and they do nothing, being maintained
and ſerved by the Marchants, by the Citizens,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56704:37"/>
and by the Country Labourers. Every crime,
how ſmall ſoever, is puniſhed with death;
eſpecially theft, although but to the value of
a penny; gaming, and playing for money, is
no leſs hainous then murther: and all other
Delinquents which deſerve the rigour of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
with us in Europe, undergo the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
here. Every one ſuffers for his own
faults, except the matter be treaſonable, and
then the Father, Brothers and Sons muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſuffer, and their goods be confiſcated;
and the Mothers, Siſters, and Daughters be
given away and ſold for ſlaves. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations
are not due to the Emperour, King,
or Lord in whoſe Territories they happen,
but are reſerved under account for publick
uſes, as building of Churches, making of
Bridges, repairing of High-waies, and the
like.</p>
               <p>It happened in my time, that a proud fellow
preſented his ſervice to a poor Gentleman,
demanding of him, by reaſon of his addreſs
and parts, more wages then he knew the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
could give; who vexed at the youths
impertinencies, and perceiving he jeered him,
replied with a compoſed countenance, <hi>Friend,
you demand indeed much wages, but being I
think you will deſerve it, and that you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in my eyes, I am content to receive you into
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56704:37"/>
my ſervice.</hi> Three daies after his Maſter ſent
him on an errand; being returned, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
for ſtaying out ſo long, ſo as no excuſes
would ſave his life; being forced to pay for
his inſolency under this colourable pretence.
The Lord of <hi>Finando</hi> did lately cauſe three
Gentlewomen of his Ladies attendants, to be
ſhut up in Cheſts ſpiked with nails on every
ſide, becauſe one of them had had ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with a certain Gentleman, (who was
likewiſe condemned to die, and his belly cut
up) and that the other two, knowing of their
companions practices, had not diſcovered
them. Who ever findes his Wife in a lockt
or ſhut chamber with another man, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
kill them both; the which, though very
rarely, hath indeed happened: If the Husband
be abſent, then his Father, Brother, Son, or
next of kin, nay a Servant may do it; ſo that
Adultery is ſeldom or never heard of amongſt
them. A certain Gentleman, being jealous
of his Wife, pretended a journey from home;
but returning unexpectedly back, found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man with his Wife in the chamber; tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with jealouſie and revenge, he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kills the amaſed Gallant, and binding his
Wife to a ladder, let her ſtand there thus
chained all night. Next morning he ſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
all his and her kindred, Men and Women,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56704:38"/>
to dinner; which however contrary to their
cuſtoms, each ſex feaſting and eating alwaies
apart, was through his importunity aſſented
unto. The Women, who ſat in a chamber
by themſelves, ignorant of what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
enquired often for the Lady of the houſe;
to which her Husband made anſwer, that ſhe
was buſie in ordering their entertainment,
ſhe would wait upon them immediatly. The
Gueſts being all ſat, Men and Women toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and dinner half done, the Husband
went and cut off the privities of his ſlain Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
and putting them into a covered Box of
Lack, or Wax, deckt with flowers, unbound
his Wife, and clothing her in a winding ſheet,
with her hair looſe and hanging over her
ſhoulders, gave it her, ſhe not knowing what
was in it, adding, <hi>Go and carry it to our Friends
at dinner, and try whether for their ſakes I may
not pardon you alſo.</hi> The poor Woman, half
dead and diſtracted with fear, did as her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
commanded her, and entering in this
dreadful poſture, fell on her knees before the
company, and opened the Box, at ſight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhe ſunk down in a ſwound, and being
cloſe followed by her Husband, had her head
immediatly ſtruck off by him; at which hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
ſight the afrighted Gueſts ran all out of
the houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56704:38"/>
Thoſe faults which are accounted crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
amongſt them, are the breaking of the
Emperours commands and orders; Peculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or robbing his Majeſties Revenues; falſe
coyning, burning of houſes, rapes, and the ill
governing of thoſe in Authority; he that is
guilty of any of theſe crimes, is puniſhed in
his perſon and poſterity; if it be a Woman
that hath offended, ſhe ſuffers alone; nor ſhall
ſhe die for anothers ſin, only be given away
or ſold. Their puniſhments are roſting,
burning, crucifying both waies, drawing with
four Bulls, and boyling in Oyl and Water. A
man who was to deliver Wood and Stone to
his Majeſties Factours, had corrupted ſome
Souldiers and others appointed for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
this being diſcovered, the Overſeers
were ordered to cut up their bellies; but the
Marchant was crucified with his heels upward.
This man, being a man of parts, was in good
eſteem with the Councellors and great ones
at Court, and however it be, that it is not
lawful to intercede for a criminal, yet the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
Grandees, out of pity and affection
to the Delinquent, having conſulted together,
adventured to ſupplicate his Majeſty in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half;
whereupon they received this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
anſwer. <hi>I have underſtood your deſires
with wonder; but that which troubles me moſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56704:39"/>
is, that the unreaſonableneſs of the demands ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
me to ſuſpect your judgements; ſhall not
the evil doer die? whence then proceedeth this
your requeſt? or are your hearts likewiſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with gifts and gold? change your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
and let juſtice have her courſe, and then
if any amongſt you deſire riches, let them go to
my Treaſure and ſatisfie themſelves; go, I give
you full liberty to do it.</hi> This reply did ſo ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the Petitioners, that they retired, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to make any further inſtance, or ſpeak one
word more.</p>
               <p>They have a peculiar method in puniſhing
of crimes, which I will alſo relate: It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
(as it did in my time) that a Gentleman,
appointed Governour of a Lordſhip near the
imperial City of <hi>Jedo,</hi> had forced his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
to pay more then they were obliged to
by their ordinary Tax and Contributions,
with which ſurplus he had Lorded it for ſome
time; but this Exaction continuing, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
ſupplicated his Majeſty for relief;
whereupon the Gentleman, together with
his whole race, were ordered to cut up their
bellies. The ſaid Governour had a Brother
in the ſervice of the King of <hi>Fingo,</hi> two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and forty Dutch miles Weſtward from
<hi>Jedo;</hi> an Uncle at Satſuma, twenty miles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
a Son in the ſervice of King <hi>Kinocoumy;</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56704:39"/>
another Son in the ſervice of the King of <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamme,</hi>
an hundred and ten miles Eaſtward;
a third Son with the Governour of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Caſtle of <hi>Inquano;</hi> with two Brothers
more, that were Souldiers in his Majeſties
Guards at <hi>Jedo;</hi> his youngeſt Son was upon
extraordinary ſollicitations beſtowed upon a
Marchants Daughter, who was an only Child
and very rich: All theſe Perſons, however
Eaſt and Weſt diſtant from each other, died
in one day, and on the ſame hour; for Poſts
were ſent to all places where theſe unhappy
men did live, with orders to the Governours,
that they ſhould cauſe them upon the eighth
day of the eighth Moneth, (the day limited
for their execution) when the Sun was in the
South, to cut up their bellies, according to
the uſual manner; which was exactly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The aforeſaid Marchant, well known to
our Society, dwelt at <hi>Oſaua,</hi> but died for grief;
and his Daughter, unwilling to ſurvive her
Husband, would (if ſhe had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented)
have killed her ſelf; yet ſhe could not
be hindred to deſtroy that life, which was but
loathſome to her after ſo dear a loſs; for ſhe
abſtained wholly from eating, and expired
(concluding this fatal Tragedy with her own)
the eleventh day after. The People of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
eſpecially the Women, die with ſtrange
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56704:40"/>
conſtancy and aſſurance, without any the leaſt
emotion of ſorrow or weakneſs.</p>
               <p>Lyes are likewiſe puniſhed with death,
eſpecially if told to Magiſtrates or Lords;
neither will any Maſter pardon that crime in
his Servant. Theſe aforeſaid manners of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to death, belong to the Gentry, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
Marchants, Citizens and Peaſants; but
the Kings and tranſgreſſing Lords are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
puniſhed: There is a little Iſland, three
miles in compaſs, and diſtant forty two miles
from <hi>Jedo,</hi> called <hi>Faitſnichina,</hi> ſo ſtill and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed
with rocks and precipices, that no
ſhips of burthen can approach it: it was at
firſt attempted in very calm weather by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
deſperate fellows, who climbing up thoſe
rocks, made a ſhift to get on the tops of them;
and having pulled up with ropes materials and
neceſſary inſtruments for their purpoſe, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
beams and ſtrong poſts in the rocks in ſuch
wiſe, that by the help of pullies and ropes, and
ſtrong hanging nets, they can winde the boats
up ſome fathoms out of the water, and ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them againſt the toſſing of the Sea; whoſe
leaſt agitation throws them againſt the Iſland,
and daſhes them in pieces, as it happened to
the loſs of many a man before this expedient
was found. The Iſland it ſelf is very ſtony
and barren, arable but in ſome few places;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56704:40"/>
it is hither that the offending Grandees are
baniſhed, and cloſe kept from all manner of
communication or correſpondency from
without with ſtrict guards of Souldiers, who
have their ſtations upon all the ſeveral corners
of the Iſland for that purpoſe: Theſe Guards,
if winde and weather permit, are relieved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
moneth preciſely, at which time they
receive proviſion for themſelves, as alſo for
the exiled, which is but a little Rice, a few
Beans, ſome Roots, and other ſuch hard fare:
they lodg in little low hutches, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
protect them from either againſt the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
heat or Winters cold; and they muſt
work, and gather Silk from the Worms, which
are fed and kept there, as alſo card, ſpin, and
weave ſuch a portion as is yearly ordered them
by their task-Maſters.</p>

               <p>THey have twelve Sects in all; the Prieſts
of the firſt eleven eat nothing that hath
lived, nor may marry: when they offend by
tranſgreſſing their order, the Delinquent is
buried to the middle in the High-way, every
one that paſſeth, and is no Gentleman, being
obliged to give him a ſtroak in the neck with
a wooden ſaw, ready for the purpoſe; ſo that
the miſerable Prieſt is two or three daies,
ſometimes more, in this languiſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
before he can die. The twelfth Sect
is the moſt eſteemed and moſt honourable of
all; their Prieſts marry, and they may eat of
what ever the ſea or earth produces, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their ſeveral appetites. This Sect, called
<hi>Icko,</hi> or <hi>Ickois,</hi> is the moſt ſuperſtitious of all,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56704:42"/>
and hath its Pope, or Head, reſpected and
ſerved with the ſame honour with their Kings.
When this high Prieſt paſſeth through the
ſtreets, carried in his <hi>Pallaquin,</hi> they of his
faith, worſhip and pray to him; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is the richeſt and eaſieſt order amongſt
them, and moſt countenanced. Some of their
Churches are priviledged and endowed by the
Emperour, or Lords, in whoſe Territories
they ſtand; but the reſt are maintained by the
common people: and as each particular man
amongſt the Papiſts hath his particular ghoſtly
Father, ſo the Inhabitants here have theirs; as
alſo their Churches, which they aſſiſt with
their charity to the utmoſt of their powers.
Each of theſe twelve Sects hath its particular
Faith; ſome believe that the ſoul is immortal,
that the fleſh is earth; and that the ſpirit of
man ſhall live in another world, happy or
miſerable, according to what he hath done
in this. Others think that there is no ſuch
thing as a ſeparable ſoul, and that they need
fear nothing but the Executioner; they are
ignorant of the beginning and ending of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
moſt of them fancying the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
beginning, and that it ſhall be eternal.
The beſt of theſe Sects make Taverns of their
Temples, which are moſt commonly built in
the pleaſanteſt and beſt places, ſumptuous,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56704:42"/>
and well planted with trees and orchards:
When the Inhabitants have a minde to rejoyce,

whores are permitted to enter and dance,
the Prieſts themſelves allowing of this jolity,
and a further uſe, ſo it be in ſecret of theſe
immodeſt females. I never heard that thoſe
people trouble themſelves to diſpute or argue
in their religion; neither do they break their
heads in converting others to their opinions;
but leave every one to the freedom of his own,
as indifferent and reaſonable, as being infuſed
into him by their Gods. Their Prieſts, as
well as many of the Gentry, are much given

               <p>THoſe of this Countrey which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to Chriſtianity by the Romiſh
Clergy, were them only which were perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
At firſt they cut off their heads, and
afterwards crucified them, which ſeemed then
very ſevere; but when theſe cruel Idolaters
perceived that death was not formidable to
thoſe martyred Chriſtians, who went to their
executions with ſinging and dancing, as if
they courted their torments, and that the
great numbers of them that ſuffered did no

but rather ſtrengthen and increaſe their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,
they reſolved to break them by more

privities, and binding the Sons about
with the ſame combuſtible matter, thruſt and
forced them, as alſo the Fathers and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to ſet fire each to other, whereby they
underwent unconceivable torments and pains:
ſome they clothed with ſods, and pouring
hot ſcalding water continually upon them, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
them in that manner till they died, which
dured two or three daies, according to the
ſtrength of the party; hundreds of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtript naked, and burnt in the foreheads
that they might be known, were driven into
the Woods and Forreſts, all men being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Proclamation, upon pain of death,
not to aſſist them with either meat, drink,
clothing or lodging; many more put into pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds
upon the Sea-ſhore, and kept there half
their time dry and half wet, being every tide
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56704:44"/>
overflown by the Sea; but theſe were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to eat and drink, to keep them longer alive
in this miſery, which laſted ordinarily ten or
twelve daies. Theſe bloody Executioners put
out the Parents eyes, and placing their little
Children by them, pinched and plagued them
whole daies long, enforcing them with tears
of blood to call and cry to their helpleſs Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Mothers for an end of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which had no period but with their lives,
whileſt their woful Parents, unable to aſſiſt
either their Children or themſelves, did often
die in their preſence, whom they could not
ſee for grief or ſorrow. All theſe miſeries,
too long and too many to relate, were borne
by the poor Chriſtians with conſtancy to a
miracle; except ſome few, who not able to
reſiſt the bitterneſs of theſe torments aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
their Faith, for ſome relaxation from
pain. Once a year they preciſely renewed
their Inquiſition, and then every individual
perſon muſt ſign in their Church-books, with
his blood, that he renounces Chriſtianity;
and yet all would not do, for many hundreds
of Chriſtians are found every year, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
with variety of torments. At laſt
they found a more helliſh and exquiſite way
of torturing then before; they hung theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
by the heels, their heads in pits, which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56704:44"/>
to give the blood ſome vent, they ſlaſht light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
croſs-waies, (but they do that now no
more) and in this poſture they live ſeveral
daies, ten or twelve, and ſpeak ſenſibly to the
very laſt: The greatneſs of this torment ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth
all other, being beyond all humaine
ſtrength to ſuffer and be undergone, but by
ſuch who are extraordinarilie ſtrengthened
from above. This extremitie hath indeed (by
reaſon of its continuance) forced many to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their religion; and ſome of them who
had hung two or three daies, aſſured me that
the pains they endured were wholly unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
no fire nor no torture equalling their
languor and violence.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians being now almoſt rooted
out, there is an order, that when one is found
and condemned to be hanged by the heels,
he ſhall be pardoned, in caſe he informeth
againſt and produces another, which is now
too much practiſed, for Apoſtacy helps no
more, and they cannot reſiſt the torments of
hanging, but are thus forced to betray one
another: neither will this help theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creatures, for I have been aſſured that they
regiſter the names of ſuch who were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
formerly to fall off, as alſo of ſuch who
by their diſcovering of others ſaved their own
lives, with an intent, that when they ſuppoſe

that they have the entire number and cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of all them who have and do yet profeſs
Chriſt, they may deſtroy them all in one day.
During theſe bloody and ſavage perſecutions,
it happened that ſome Chriſtian Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their beautie, were begged and ſaved;
but many of them of eight, ten, and twelve
years old, &amp;c. refuſed this grace, proteſting
with courage, to a wonder, that they would
not live, they did not fear death; but would
go where their Parents went, into that joy
where they ſhould be no more tormented:
Some of theſe Children who had not this
force, but deſired to live and ſurvive theſe
pains, were violentlie hurried to their deaths
by their Parents, with theſe comforting
words; <hi>Come my Children, do not live with
theſe wicked wretches, I will bring you into a
land that is rich and beautiful, where we ſhall
continue for ever in joy and happineſs.</hi> The
common ſort of Chriſtians were but ſimplie
bound when they were led to their executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but the Prieſts, whether Portugals,
Spaniards or Japaners, had the hair of their
heads and beards half ſhaven off, the ſhaven
part being coloured red; bits were alſo put in
their mouthes, to hinder them from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and their heads being pulled backwards,
with halters put about their necks and tied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56704:45"/>

their faces directly upwards; and thus ſitting
upon a lean horſe, they were carried to the

               <p>ALl the houſes in this Country are built
of wood and timber, which is likewiſe
their fewel; hence their houſes are much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to burning, one of the plagues very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in their Towns; for this cauſe each
houſe hath its pack-houſe of proof againſt
the fire, wherein they keep their beſt and
choiſe goods. The houſes are all built four
foot high from the earth, made of planks
cloſely covered with thick mats very artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
joyned, reſembling each other and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
they dwell moſt below, their upper
rooms being employed to keep their ſmaller
houſhold ſtuffs; but their beſt Chambers,
where they receive and entertain their Friends,
are neat and ſumptuous, according to their
ſeveral abilities. The Souldiers and Gentry
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56704:46"/>
have their houſes divided, one ſide for their
Wives, and the other for them, for their
Friends and their ordinary vocation. The
Marchants and Citizens Wives dwell promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly
with their Husbands, governing and
ordering their families as with us; but are
very modeſt, and never ſpoken to but with
reſpect, none preſuming to uſe any freedom
in diſcourſe with them, although otherwiſe
innocent and harmleſs, for both the man that
took, and the woman that permitted this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
would be equally ſlighted, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and looked upon as culpable and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Their houſhold-ſtuff conſiſts ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in fine painted gilt diſhes, inſtead of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures;
the walls of their chambers are alſo
for the moſt part painted with variety of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and laid with gilt paper ſo curiouſly,
as if it were but one large ſheet; the boards
round about being beautified with liſts of
black Wax, very artificially wrought; moſt
of their rooms are divided with ſhuts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and painted as the walls are, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken out, enlarges the rooms at pleaſure.
In the upper end of this partition they have a
picture with a potfull of flowers, which they
have ready all the year long; and at the lower
end there is alwaies a gallery, with ſtairs to
deſcend into their gardens, which are alwaies
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56704:46"/>
green, and ſo placed, that they in the hall
have the full proſpect of it. They do not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

Cupboards, Wax-works, and the like, theſe

where none is ſuffered to enter, but
their familiar and moſt intimate Servants and
Friends. Their chief furniture which they
expoſe, are <hi>Tſia</hi> Cups and Pots, Pictures, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts,
and Sables, which each provides
himſelf of, rich and goodly, according to his

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56704:47"/>
never quarrel in their debauches, but he that
is firſt drunk retires and ſleeps, until the fumes
of the wine be evaporated. There is no ſuch

their Parents, or for want of ſuch near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by the next of kin. One Man hath but
one Wife, though as many Concubines as he
can keep; and if that Wife do not pleaſe him,
he may put her away, provided he diſmiſs her
in a civil and honorable way. Any Man may
lie with a Whore, or common Woman, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be married, with impunitie; but
the Wife may not ſo much as ſpeak in private
with another Man, as is already ſaid, without
hazarding her life. What is ſaid of divorce,
relates only to the Citizen, Marchant, and
common Souldier; a Gentleman or Lord may
not put away his Wife, although ſhe ſhould

but may freely divert himſelf with

During the civil Wars between <hi>Ongoſchio</hi> and
his Puple, the King of <hi>Cocora</hi> (who followed
the Uſurper) had left his Queen and Children,
as the faſhion is, at the Emperours Court;
<hi>Fideri</hi> having notice of this revolt, ſent for
<hi>Cocora</hi>'s Wife and Children to come into the
Caſtle, the better to ſecure them; which the
Lady refuſed, excuſing her ſelf, <hi>That ſhe was
married, and under the obedience of her King,
as he was under his imperial Majeſty; let him
command her Lord, and ſhe would moſt readily,
upon receipt of his orders, ſubmit to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
pleaſure.</hi> The Emperour, angry at this
denial, ſent her word, if ſhe would not come,
he would cauſe her to be brought by force.
The Queen, who thought no diſhonour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to that of quitting her houſe in her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
abſence, and ſeeing ſhe could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56704:49"/>
her ſelf in it againſt the Emperours fury,
reſolved to periſh with it; ſhe therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
ſome barrels of Gun-powder to be
brought into a Chamber, where ſhe retired
with her Children, Nurſe, and ſuch of her
Women who were reſolved to die with her;
and there writing her Will and her own Elegy,
ſhe conveyed them by a truſty Gentleman in
her ſervice to her Lord; and immediatly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
putting fire to the Powder, prevented
that loſs of honour which ſhe feared, and the

               <p>THe Trade of this Country (which is but
ſmall in reſpect of the vaſtneſs of it, and
it abounds with all ſorts of Merchandiſe) is
carried on by Strangers, the principal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are the Chineſſes, who from the firſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
of this Empire to this day, have been
conſtant frequenters of their yearly Marts.
The Spaniards and Portugals have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with this People above an hundred
years; the Engliſh but of late, who finding
but little profit and great expences, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Traffick again. The <hi>Siammers</hi> and
<hi>Camboiders</hi> uſed alſo to arrive with a ſhip or
two, though not now ſo often as formerly.
Laſtly the Netherlander got footing there,
where they have ſeated themſelves faſt enough,
and traded theſe forty years. The principal
Commodities, as well thoſe which Strangers
bring, as ſuch which are of the growth of the
Country, are all brought to the great City of
<hi>Meaco,</hi> which is the Staple of the whole
Empire; it is here that the Merchants and
Factors, from every part of the Land, do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
bringing with them ſuch things as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56704:50"/>
their ſeveral Provinces do produce, which
they ſell or change for others which they ſtand
in need of. Theſe Merchandiſes are carried
ſometimes two or three hundred miles to and
fro, over hills and dales, all upon horſes,
whereof they have an incredible number. The
Traffick conſiſts of all ſorts of wares, as well
for the pride as uſe of man; Strangers bring
yearly four or five thouſand Picols of Silk,
each Picol weighing one hundred twenty five
pounds weight, beſides a great quantity of
wrought Silks; two hundred thouſand Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins;
one hundred thouſand Rochvellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins;
a great abundance of Hemp, Cloth,
Cotton, and red Wool; Carpets to ſit upon,
Pewter, Quick-ſilver, and all ſorts of Drugs;
Nutmegs, Peper, Musk, Sugar, Porcelan,
Camphier, Borax, Eliphants-Teets, red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and all ſorts of ſmall Wares, which the
Chineſes bring thither.</p>

               <head>What domeſtick Trading,

               <p>HEre are many very rich Merchants who
drive great Trades, theſe go themſelves,
or have Factours at <hi>Meaco,</hi> where they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
their Commodities for Silver, Gold,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56704:51"/>
or other Wares, each according to his fancy
and convenience. The <hi>Japanners</hi> of old had
great correſpondencie with them of <hi>China,</hi>
whoſe Kings ſent Ambaſſadors yearly to each
other, for entertaining their alliance, and the
negotiation of their Subjects; it happened
that the <hi>Japanners,</hi> who were numerous in
<hi>China,</hi> did mutiny, and in a tumult deſtroy
a whole City, plundering, raviſhing, and
ſpoyling all; but the <hi>Chineſſes,</hi> getting into a
body, fell upon the <hi>Japanners</hi> again, and put
all they could meet with to the ſword. The
King of <hi>China</hi> hearing of theſe diſcords, was
no leſs amazed then in a wonder, that ſo few
could do ſo much miſchief, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to baniſh the <hi>Japanners</hi> for ever out of
his Kingdom; in memory whereof he cauſed
a great ſtone Pillar to be ſet up, with the ſtory
of their exile in letters of Gold. He likewiſe
ſet out a Proclamation, that none of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
upon paine of death, ſhould ſaile any
more to <hi>Japan;</hi> which order was then more
exactly obſerved then at preſent, and yet they
do not directly go thither; for the <hi>Chineſſes.</hi>
under a colour of other voyages, do often ſlip
into <hi>Japan.</hi> The Emperour of <hi>Iapan</hi> doth not
at all obſtruct their traffick, permitting them
to enter and leave his Countrey when they
pleaſe, Saying he will not reward evil for evil;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56704:51"/>
conſidering alſo that the reaſon of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
on the other ſide, came not through
any fault of the <hi>Chineſſes,</hi> but by the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of his own People. Since the <hi>Iapanners</hi>
have been baniſhed out of <hi>China,</hi> they uſed
to ſail to <hi>Tayouan,</hi> where the <hi>Chineſſes</hi> brought
them their Merchandiſes; but that being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by the Court of <hi>China,</hi> they were
prohibited this Traffick likewiſe. Many years
after the <hi>Iapanners</hi> obtained leave to return
to <hi>Tayouan,</hi> as alſo to go to <hi>Touckien, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodia,</hi>
and <hi>Sian;</hi> which negotiation was again
diſturbed, upon this conſideration, that the
Emperour of <hi>Iapan</hi> would neither offend nor
be offended by any Strangers, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
happened by the extortions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of <hi>Sian</hi> and <hi>Tayouan;</hi> and therefore
none of his Subjects ſhould any more traffick
or deal with Strangers out of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
Another reaſon was, becauſe he would
have no Arms tranſported out of his Empire,
(which could not be hindred by no way but
this) inſomuch that two <hi>Chineſſes,</hi> Father and
Son, were both crucified at <hi>Finando,</hi> for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to convey ſome away in private;
and five <hi>Iapanners,</hi> who had ſold them the ſaid
Arms, without knowing their deſign, were
beheaded. But the chief cauſe of this inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

flows continually out of this Cavern in a great
quantity, and is not hot, but a man may ſit
in without diſturbance. I have ſeen another
at the foot of a Mountain near the Sea, which
rendered its Water but at times, ordinarily
twice in twenty four hours, but this flowing
did not continue above an hour; when the
winde blows Eaſt and ſtifly, it flows thrice,
and ſometimes four times in a day and night:
This Water riſes out of a ſtony Pit, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with huge maſſie Stones of very great
weight; when the time of flowing comes,
it burſts out of the earth in ſo great a quantity,
and with ſuch a forceable winde, that thoſe
great Stones are violently moved and ſhaken,
the ſtreams guſhing and ſpouting three or four
fathoms high, with ſo dreadful a noiſe that it
equals that of a Cannon, or the falls of the
greateſt Rivers: This Water is ſo very hot,
that it is impoſſible to boyl ordinary Water
to its height; it ſinges where it falls, and left
to its ſelf continues hot thrice longer then any
other. This Well is ſurrounded with a Wall
for fear of harm, little Conduits being made
to convey its Streams to the neighbouring

alſo ſtinted and proportioned according to

indeed four or five thouſand, as well Men as
Women, in their ſervices, but theſe they keep
in their Palaces, and may not enter the firſt
ring of the Caſtle, nor into the City with
them: Now ſuch as are permitted to come into
theſe two places with an hundred Servants,
may not enter the ſecond ring of the Caſtle
with more then twenty Attendants; neither
may they be ſeen there on horſe-back, it being
the dwellings of the Princes of the blood, and
the Councellours: the great ones are carried
here in Pallaquins or Sedans, others of leſs
quality going on foot; which is no difficult
thing, the waies and ſtreets being finely paved,
and the middle of them ſet with great flat free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,
which are kept extraordinary neat and

enter the third ring of the Caſtle, where the
Emperours Palace is, but on foot, and only
accompanied with two Servants, and a Boy to

               <p>THis year trade (as we mentioned in our

been but little advantagious, by reaſon
of the diſaſters at Sea, which hath much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and put behinde hand the India Capital
or Stock, which will without queſtion ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly

from more misfortunes at Sea. We hope, if
your Honours will ſecond us this following
year with fifteen Tonne of Gold and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe,
we ſhall be able to make a return of
thirty, being the Indian Commodities may
probably riſe more then they are now fallen:
<hi>Iapan</hi> will in all appearance yeild us eleven or

<hi>Cantoors,</hi> above three Tonne. The Dutch
expences, which aroſe this year, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall, being the building and fortification of
the dwellings and pack-houſes come to ceaſe.
There is but little hope of advantage from the
Enemy; nor ſhall we be able to <hi>Cape</hi> much
this year about <hi>Spirito Sancto,</hi> by reaſon of the
<hi>Portugals</hi> ſufficiency. We will endeavour to
better all things by an advantagious negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hoping much from <hi>Iapan:</hi> It were not
ſtrange if the <hi>Chineſes</hi> were hindered to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

profit fifty Tonne of Gold every year and
more by the <hi>Iapan</hi> trade; for they tranſport
more then for one hundred Tonne yearly;
God grant that we may enjoy this trade alone,
and that the Gold Mine in <hi>Formoſa</hi> flouriſh,

in Iapan might acquire,

the China Trade
and Commerce: By
Leonard Camps.</head>
               <p>MAny men are of opinion, and have by
experience found, that during the
time it pleaſed the mighty States General of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56704:59"/>
the united Provinces, and his princelie Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie,
to give their Subjects leave to ſaile
into the Eaſt-India, for the increaſe of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and the common good, that to what
place, or by what Prince ſoever we come, we
were admitted and received for fear of harm,
or for hopes of profit; and yet I believe, as
my Predeceſſours did before me, that his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty of <hi>Iapan</hi> ſuffered us not to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and to trade freelie in his Countrie upon
theſe conſiderations, but only to ſhew the
goodneſs of his Nature, the greatneſs of his
Dominions, and his civilitie to Strangers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciallie
thoſe Nations who came into his
Countrie as Friends. His Majeſties goodneſs
to Foraigners appears abundantly in this, in
that he ſtill ſuffers the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to traffick in his
Land, favouring them in his impoſitions more
then his own Subjects; whereas they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the <hi>Iapaners</hi> in their own Territories as
Enemies, having ſet a price upon their heads,
which by miſtake hath coſt many a Portugal
his life: further his ambition doth not extend
beyond the bounds of his own Empire, and
contenting himſelf with thoſe confines God
and Nature hath preſcribed him; he wages no
war againſt his Neighbours, neither ſuffers
his Subjects to moleſt or diſturb any out of
his obedience. No foraign Princes fall out by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56704:59"/>
his inſtigation; neither doth he give or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
help or aſſiſtance upon any account. His
power and might conſiſts in the vaſtneſs of his
Kingdom, and multitudes of his Souldiers;
he hath arms at will, Caſtles that ſeem impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
Proviſions in abundance, and Treaſure
without end. The plenty of Gold, Silver,
Copper, Iron, Lead, and Pewter Mines is
great; and the abundance of Silk, Cotton,
Hemp, and thouſands other commodities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.
Brifley, this Countrie wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
having no need of its neighbours at all;
whence his Majeſty never ſought to foraign
Princes, and yet received all that came or ſent
to him with all imaginable civilitie and kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards and Portugals, not ignorant
of the commodious ſcituation, might and
riches of the Japaniſh Empire, were no leſs
earneſt in the enlarging of their own ſtate,
planting the Chriſtian Religion, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their traffick there, where other Princes
ſeemed to deſire. <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> the firſt of that
name, and the tenth King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was
very induſtrious in this <hi>Diſquiſition;</hi> his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
men having in fourſcore years, wherein
they continued their commerce in <hi>Iapan,</hi>
brought it ſo far, that <hi>Manilha</hi> was raiſed from
nothing by this negotiation, and <hi>Malacca Goa</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:56704:60"/>
and ſeveral other places bettered and enriched
by it; witneſs their great Cargaſoons, and
yearly returns more or leſs, as it happeneth,
amounting one with another to near a Million
and a half of Ducats; never gaining leſs then
fifty, and for the moſt part ſeventy five in the
hundred, as we found by experience in that
time that our Eaſt-India-Company ſhared in
this rich commerce. The <hi>Mavaus</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi>
fetched theſe vaſt profits yearly, which
they gained in four or five moneths, whereof
they ſpent ſome twenty daies in going and
coming upon the Sea, the <hi>Iapan</hi> principal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but one fifth part. Let every one conſider,
whether this noble Negotiation and ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns,
are not capable to indear theſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to this rich Country: Beſides this, their
Religion, which by the zeal and induſtry of
their Prieſts grew ſtrangely there, ſo that they
had four hundred thouſand ſouls at once upon
a liſt, which made them in hope to become
abſolute Maſters of the whole Kingdom; this
they purpoſed, which had been abſolutely ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
but that they wanted an head; and
were traverſed in this great deſign by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland
Miniſters. If they had brought <hi>Iapan</hi>
to their devotion and obedience, as God be
praiſed they have not, it is no hard matter to
conceive the advantages they would have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56704:60"/>
by it, and what they might further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
upon ſo mighty an acquiſition. But
my deſign is not to inſiſt upon this matter,
only to undeceive thoſe men who blindly out
of prejudice or ignorance, not only ſlight the
Japaniſh trade, but have given out, that it is
neither uſeful nor profitable for the Eaſt-India-Company.
But to return where we digreſſed;
it is not imaginable that the <hi>Portugals</hi> and
<hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſuch fools, as to ſearch out pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to ſeat themſelves in, and to carry on a
trade, where there is no advantage to be got;
that they have gained infinitely, and ſhould
ſtill if they were not hindred by us, is viſible:
It is evident that they of <hi>Mavau</hi> are at preſent
rich, that their City is ſtrong, and their Houſes
like ſo many Palaces, wherein they live like
earthly gods in pleaſure and plenty, whereas
they were before but bare and needy. Neither
did the ill treatment they lately received in
<hi>Iapan,</hi> nor the perſecutions of the Women
Catholicks there, nor the loſs of <hi>Andrew Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes
Caraek,</hi> who was aſſaulted and ſunk, by the
Emperours command and forces, before <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſack,</hi>
nor the danger they incur by our ſhips
at Sea, can deter or oblige them to quit this
Kingdom: when the danger to ſaile thither
with great Veſſels was too great, they trulked
with little ones; which this proud Nation,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56704:61"/>
who aſpire to an univerſal Monarchie, would
never have done, if it had not been for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
and ſweetneſs of the profit: What can
our People alledge to the contrarie? is it not
as we have formerlie ſaid, that the door is not
open for us alone, but for all other Nations
who come as friends to negotiate in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Dominions. During our abode in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
we have been treated with very great
civilitie; although we have not profited ſo
much as the <hi>Portugals,</hi> yet we have gained
more honour then they; we have not loſt at
all, and our winnings have been proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our Cargaſoons; we have had ſeveral
commodities thence, and much uſeful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions;
we have repaired many of our old
Ships in their Havens, and furniſhed them
with all manner of neceſſaries: The Fleets
we ſend from hence every year to the <hi>Manil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has</hi>
againſt our common Enemie, return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being queſtioned by any, and diſpoſe of
their prizes at pleaſure, paying nothing but
the ordinarie rites, which is onlie a ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the Emperour; what Chriſtian Prince
in Europe would treat us ſo well, and moleſt
us ſo little? Now that it hath pleaſed the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
that we by the good conduct of our
General <hi>I. P. C.</hi> do not onlie bridle them of
<hi>Maccau,</hi> but likewiſe hinder them to ſaile to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56704:61"/>
                  <hi>Iapan,</hi> and ſo keeps them from that rich trade
they enjoyed ſo many years; it remains onlie
that we ſtill keep them out, to which purpoſe
eſpecial care muſt be had to uſe the <hi>Iapaners</hi>
well and civillie; to hinder their detriment,
and not to diſpiſe or miſuſe them in any kinde,
but to ſuffer every one to paſs and re-paſs
where their buſineſs calleth them, aiding and
aſſiſting them with all poſſible endeavour and
friendſhip. We muſt not be leſs careful then
the <hi>Portugals</hi> have been, to furniſh this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
yearlie with all manner of commodities,
bringing rather more then leſſer; for if it take
according to the Generals deſign, which God
grant, they of <hi>Iapan</hi> will be deprived of the
<hi>Maccan</hi> commerce, as alſo of their trafficking
into divers others places, <hi>Kouthinchina, Kam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boia,
Siam</hi> and <hi>Manilha,</hi> from which places
they received betwixt two and three thouſand
picols of Silk every year, beſides ſeveral other
neceſſary commodities, which they will be
obliged to take from us, as being nearer and
at their own homes. We muſt above all things
cheriſh his Majeſties inclination to us wards,
and have a ſpecial care to remove all cauſes of
diſcontent that may ariſe; for if this mighty
Prince conceive the leaſt diſtaſte againſt us,
and refuſe us his friendſhip and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
it will be the onlie obſtacle to hinder
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56704:62"/>
us to compaſs our deſign; in this caſe we have
more reaſon to fear the <hi>Japanners,</hi> then either
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Chineſes,</hi> as being no leſs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and couragious then they, and powerful
enough to drive us out of the <hi>Piſcadores,</hi> or
where we ſhould endeavour to ſettle; but if
it muſt be ſo, we ſhould be able to help our
ſelves without <hi>Japan,</hi> but not in ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
a place, as we have mentioned already,
which we ſhall finde true in caſe we fall out
with them, which God forbid. Our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
hath ſhewn us a way, and recommended
it to us, which if followed, we may eaſilie
continue in his Majeſties favour, and once
enjoy the long deſired ſweet profits which our
enemies have had ſo many years undiſturbed;
and I doubt not, but by one way or other we
ſhall be able to get the unvaluable <hi>China</hi> trade
into our hands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>China</hi> trade being then in our diſpoſe,
all we have to do, is to ſend yearly into <hi>Japan</hi>
ſuch Cargaſoons as we ſhall hereafter menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
in the doing whereof, we ſhall not onlie
pleaſe his Majeſtie, and enjoy the ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
profits which our enemies will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of, but ſhall be able to ſatisfie our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
out of the gain, without any expence of
theirs, it being more then probable, that their
yearlie return will amount to an hundered
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56704:62"/>
Tonne of Gold, which is ten Millions ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or more every year. <hi>Japan</hi> will be more

and magnificent reception of

1626. Written by Coen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raed

preſent.</head>
               <p>IN the year 1626. having had audience on the
twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> I took my leave of
both the old and young Emperour, four daies
before the feaſt; which ſeemed ſtrange to
them that knew it, being their Majeſties were
ſo intent in their preparations for the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s
reception; but theſe men did not know how
deſirous the Emperour was to diſpatch the
Hollanders before the feaſt: however the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammer</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56704:65"/>
and <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſadours had not as
yet been publicklie received, and all by reaſon
of the preſent buſineſs, which took up the
whole Court, in ſo much that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
till that was paſt; we being therefore
diſpatched, had the more leaſure and deſire
to ſee this ſolemn entertainment, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being invited to a ſtay by the Lord of
<hi>Firando</hi> and <hi>Cackuſymondonne.</hi> On the twenty
fourth we went towards the Emperours Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
attended upon by all our Servants; and
having hired a place from which we might ſee
the whole proceſſion, we were forced to ſtay
there that whole night, by reaſon of the great
crouds of people that paſſed that way; on the
morrow following, being the twenty fifth,
as ſoon as the day appeared, we ſaw an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
company of people, who filled the
way up betwixt the Emperours Palace and
the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s Court. The ſtreets were made
very even, and ſtrewed with white ſand, and
railed in on both ſides, and guarded all along
by Souldiers of both their Majeſties and of
the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s, all clothed in long white veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with head-pieces of black wax, and
armed each with two Sables and a Pike, for
defence of the paſſage through which the
Coaches and Horſes were to march; all run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
waters and ditches were covered with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56704:65"/>
boards and planks; and ſcaffols were raiſed
on both ſides the way for the ſpectators.</p>
               <p>The firſt that paſſed were Servants that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the <hi>Deyro</hi> and Emperour, with
many <hi>Palanquimos</hi> or Porters, who carried
the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s baggage, packt up in great ſquare
Wax Cheſts (the covers whereof were paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s Arms in Gold) to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
Court: Theſe were accompanied with
a great train of Attendants, who were again
followed by ſix and forty <hi>Palanquin</hi> Stooles or
Sedans, wherein the Women belonging to the
<hi>Deyro</hi>'s Wives were carried; theſe Sedans were
all of them curiouſly wrought of bright white
wood, ſix foot high, laid with plates of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and finely painted, each of theſe being
carried by four luſty follows; after them went
one and twenty Sedans or <hi>Norimons,</hi> (for ſo
they call them here) covered with black Wax
and gilded, and behinde them ſome twenty
ſeven more whoſe doors and windows were
all gilded; ſome of the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s chiefe Lords
were carried in theſe, each of them having a
<hi>Quiroſol</hi> wholly gilded, and covered with a
very rich covering, carried before them; theſe
Lords were attended by one hundred and eight
Pages in white liveries; behinde them marched
twenty four Gentlemen on horſe back, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
and armed in their Habillements of war;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56704:66"/>
their Head-pieces were of Wax, with little
black feathers behinde; they were clothed in
Coats with great wide ſleeves; their Breeches
were long and ſmall, made of even Sattin of
all colours, embroydered with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
very richly; they had little black Boots,
gilded with ſtripes of Gold; their Arms were
gilded; Sables with Bows and Arrows were
girt to them, with great rich embroydered
Scarfes, whoſe ends hung over on each ſide
of the Horſe; their Horſes were goodly and
beautiful, with little heads, little eares, and
ſhort bodies; their Saddles were all waxed or
gilded, the ſeats being of embroydered works
or Tigers skins; the maines of theſe Horſes
were twiſted, or platted, with Silver and Gold,
the breaſts and buttocks were adorned with
nets of Silk, whoſe ſtrings hung low; they
had gilded horns on their foreheads, and were
ſhod with interwoven Silke in ſtead of Iron;
every Horſe was lead by two Foot-men, two
great <hi>Quiroſols</hi> made of fine linnen, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd
above with red cloth, with fringe round
about it, being born before, and ſerving to
cover the Horſe, which vvas further attended
vvith eight Pages, or Servants, all in vvhite
liveries, and armed as the manner is, vvith tvvo
Sables or Svvords: And thus theſe Horſe-men
rode by paces, from the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56704:66"/>
Palace in very good order. Theſe
were followed by three rich Coaches, in
which were the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s three principal Wives;
each of theſe Coaches were four fathoms
high, two fathoms long, and one broad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beautified with Wax figures, and enameled
with Gold; there were three windows on
each ſide, and two before, being hung with
rich curtains; the entrie was behinde the
Coach, made like the gate of a Palace, with
chambers on both ſides; all under the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
ſeemed black Wax; the rands of the
wheels were gilded, and the ſpoakes finely
turned and in-laid with Gold; when they
moved, they ſeemed to turn againſt a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glaſs, by reaſon of the clearneſs of the
glittering Wax, which was goodly to behold;
Theſe wheels were covered with pent-houſes
very artificially and richly wrought, every
corner of them being platted with fine Gold;
the top of all, or cover, was black Wax, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s arms were curiouſly done in
Gold; every one of theſe great Coaches, or
rather Towers, were drawn with two great
ſtrong Bulls, covered with nets of red twined
Silk, which were lead by four foot-men clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in white; each of theſe Coaches valued at
ſeventy thouſand Tayles, a Tayl being full
five Engliſh ſhillings. The train of Pages, all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56704:67"/>
clothed in white, that attended theſe Ladies,
was numerous, each of them having a gilded
foot-ſtool, and a pair of Wax ſlippers carried
behind them. Then followed twenty three
<hi>Norimons,</hi> or <hi>Palanquins,</hi> being made of white
Wood, and plaited with Copper, wherein
were the Servants of theſe three Ladies, each
waited upon with a great <hi>Quiroſol,</hi> two Pages,
and four Porters to carry them. Behinde theſe
followed ſixty eight of the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
on horſe-back, clothed and armed as the
former; they marched by two and two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Two beautiful Coaches, equal in form and

before theſe Coaches; they were armed each

all proper ſtout men, and ſerve for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours

pranſed and curvetted all the way. Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56704:68"/>
followed after theſe, two by two; and after
them ſix new fair Coaches, though not above

one Ox, but proportionably beautiful; the
<hi>Deyro</hi>'s Concubines ſate in theſe, who were
again followed by thirty four pair of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
on horſe-back, attended with many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

wherein the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s Secretary rode, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with thirty ſeven Gentlemen on horſe-back;
then followed the <hi>Norimons,</hi> which
carried ſeveral of the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s Grandees, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
fifteen were of black Wood, inlaid with
white Ivory; thirteen of black Wood, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

theſe <hi>Norimons;</hi> and behinde them fifty
four Gentlemen, being the <hi>Deyro</hi>'s Muſitians,
with ſeveral Inſtruments, as Pipes, Tabours,
Cimbals, Bells, and ſome ſtringed ones which
are not known amongſt us. The <hi>Deyro</hi> himſelf
followed theſe Muſitians, ſiting in a great ſquare
Edifice, ſurrounded with drawing doors and
windows on each corner; this lodge was about
nine foot high, its cover being round, and in
the middle a gilded Ball, whereon ſtood a Cock
with his wings ſpread, of pure Gold: This
ſtructure was very beautiful, being adorned on
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56704:69"/>
all ſides with carved Images, its angles plaited
with pure Gold, and the roof of it intimating
the Heaven, with Sun, Moon and Stars. There
were fifty Perſons, all Gentlemen belonging
to the Emperours, clothed with long white
Robes, and Wax Head-pieces, that carried
this ambulatory Pallace: Forty Gentlemen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly
dreſſed, although armed with Europian
Head-pieces, and Pikes gilded at the ends,
went before the <hi>Deyro,</hi> and theſe were of his
Life-guard. One of his principal Lords did
immediately follow him, armed as the other,
bearing in his hand a Shield ſtuck full of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;
then came forty great <hi>Quiroſols,</hi> all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with fine white linnen, and belonging
to the aforeſaid Guards: Theſe were again fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by thirteen great Wax Cheſts, carried
by the Palanquyn Porters: And laſtly, the
whole proceſſion was cloſed with four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
perſons all in white veſtments, marching
ſix in a ranke in very good order. The <hi>Deyro</hi>
and his Traine were no ſooner paſt, but the
evening came on, and an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of people of all ſorts: the Stages and
Houſes which had been filled with Spectators,
had diſgorged their burthens in the Streets; ſo
that the multitude was ſo immenſly great, that
very many diſorders happened, as cutting of
purſes, ſtealing, murthering and robbing each
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56704:69"/>
other; very many were ſtifled in the crouds,
and ſuch as but once fell, were ſure never to
riſe, being troden to death: The noiſe all night
was ſo great, as if the City had been in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar;
and the inſolencies grew to that heighth,
that many perſons of quality, who could not
get out of the throng, or were retiring to their
houſes, were ſet upon, and very many of them
ſpoiled and murthered: among others, the
Lord of <hi>Firandos</hi> Secretary ſaw his Servant
robbed, and a rich Cabinet of his taken from
him, before his own face, whileſt he himſelfe
had much ado to defend himſelf from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of theſe aſſaulters. We were forced, with
our Servants, to quit our ſtage, and put our
ſelves into the crowd, becauſe of the night,
and the danger to continue where we were,
which we durſt not do without running the
hazzard of being murthered; the preaſs was ſo
great, that we were borne up by the people
moſt of our way, being but ſeldom able to put
a foot upon the ground; yet at length, by Gods
great bleſſing, we got all (without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
loſs) ſafely to our lodgings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Deyro</hi> and his Wives were lodged three
daies and three nights in the Emperors Palace,
being ſerved by their Majeſties and their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the greateſt Princes of their Court,
every meale conſiſting of one hundred and

            <head>A Deſcription of the
Government, Might,
Religion, Cuſtomes,
Traffick, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Affairs in the
Kingdom of SIAM:
Written in the Yeare
1636. by Jooſt Schouten,
Directour of the Eaſt-India-Company
in
that Countrey.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>SIAM</hi> is a famous and potent King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſcituate upon the continent of
<hi>Aſia</hi> eighteen degrees Northern Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
where it bordereth upon the
Countries of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Ava</hi> twelve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
it extendeth it ſelfe Weſtward to the
<hi>Bengaſche</hi> ſea of <hi>Martavan</hi> to ſeven degrees,
where it borders upon the Kingdoms of <hi>Pay
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56704:71"/>
tany</hi> and <hi>Queda;</hi> Southward from the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſche</hi>
to the <hi>Patanys</hi> Ocean, this Coaſt turns
Northward to thirteen degrees, making with
its bowing the Gulf of <hi>Siam;</hi> thence the Coaſt
runs again Southward to twelve degrees, and
leaving the Sea terminates Eaſtward upon the
Deſart of <hi>Cambodia,</hi> and the Kingdoms of <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia,
Tangou,</hi> and <hi>Langjang</hi> to eighteen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
even to <hi>Ava</hi> and <hi>Pegu;</hi> ſo that the form
of this Land is like an halfe Moon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
in its circuit four hundred and fifty
Dutch miles, one Dutch mile makes ſix En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.
This Country (which is in many places
mountainous, woody and mooriſh, eſpecially
towards the Sea, although for the moſt part
even and clay, and is likewiſe full of all ſorts
of Beaſts and Fowls, and Rivers repleniſhed
with abundance of Fiſh) hath where it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
upon the <hi>Benga</hi> and <hi>Siams</hi> Seas many
Iſlands, Bays, Havens and Rivers moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
for the receipt of great and ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
I ſhall not particularize all, only mention
the chief River, as the moſt frequented Haven
of the whole Kingdom: This River (called
by the name of <hi>Menam,</hi> or the Mother of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
is great, wide, and very long, its courſe
being not known unto them. It paſſeth from
the North Southward very ſwiftly through the
Land of <hi>Ava</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> and ſeveral Provinces
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56704:71"/>
of <hi>Siam,</hi> until that it diſcharge it ſelf by three
mouthes into the Sea of <hi>Siam;</hi> it partaketh of
the nature of thoſe famous Rivers <hi>Ganges</hi> and
<hi>Nilus,</hi> flowing once a year ſo high that it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
moſt part of the Countrey, making it
incredibly fruitful, and deſtroying by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nundation
(which continueth four or five
moneths) all obnoxious vermin and creatures.
The greateſt mouth of this River, is that which
lies moſt Eaſtward thirteen degrees and a half
Northern latitude; and in the middle of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
there is a great flat, or ſand, a mile long, that
croſſes the entry of the River five or ſix foot
deep at low water, but at heighth is fifteen or
ſixteen, and in the Winter moneths, when the
the floods are great, there is ordinarily ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or eighteen foot and more; great Ships
that go deep, are forced to anker at four, five,
or ſix fathoms water without this banck, the
ground being clay and good; but thoſe that
paſs this flat at high water, enter the River
without any more danger of runing on ground
till they come to the Town of <hi>Banckock,</hi> ſix
Dutch miles upwards; then the River grows
narrower and more ſhallow, Ships drawing
eleven or twelve foot water, being ſcarceable
to mount to the City of <hi>India,</hi> where they are
ſometimes forced to ſtay till the moneths of
<hi>September, October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> for water
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56704:72"/>
to return. The Country is generally well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
eſpecially the lower part of it, being full
of Villages and Towns; the principal whereof
are <hi>Iudica, Picelouck, Sourckelouk, Capheng,
Soutcethay, Kephinpet, Conſeywan, Pytſyay Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidi,
Lydure, Tenou, Mormelon, Martenayo,
Lygor, Bordelong, Tannaſſary, Banckock, Pypry,
Rapry, Mergy,</hi> and ſeveral other, all which are
governments and heads of Provinces; beſides
theſe there are many Cities and Burroughs full
of people, which I omit as ſuperfluous. The
City of <hi>Iudica,</hi> the Metropolis of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and ſeat of the King and his chiefeſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
is ſcituate upon the River <hi>Menam,</hi> in a
little round Iſland, encompaſſed with a thick
ſtone wall, about ſix Engliſh miles round; the
Suburbs are on the other ſide of the River,
cloſely builded, and full of Temples and Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
lying in a flat and fruitful Country. The
Streets of the walled Town are many of them
large, ſtraight and regular, with channels run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
through them, although for the moſt part
of ſmall narrow Lanes, Ditches, and Creekes
moſt confuſedly placed; the Citizens have an
incredible number of ſmall Boats or Prawes,
which come to their very doors, eſpecially at
floods and high water. The building of the
Houſes is according to the <hi>Indian</hi> faſhion,
ſlight, and covered with Tiles; but the City
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56704:72"/>
is beautified with more then three hundred
faire Temples and Cloyſters, all curiouſly
builded, and adorned with many gilded Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Pyramids, and Pictures without number.
The Kings Palace is ſeated upon the River, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
a little Town apart, great and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent,
many of its Buildings and Towers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entirely gilded. This royal and admirable
City is perfectly well ſeated, and populous to
a wonder, being frequented by all Nations;
and is likewiſe impregnable, as not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
but ſix moneths in a year, by reaſon of
the innundations of the River, which covers
the Countrey round with its overflowings.
The Soveraignity and Government of <hi>Siam</hi> is
in the King, a Prince of a Noble and ancient
family, who hath been in poſſeſſion of this
Kingdom, and the neighbouring Provinces,
many hundred of years; this Prince is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in his Dominions, diſpoſing of War and
Peace, Alliances, Juſtice, Pardons and Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
&amp;c. at his pleaſure; He maketh Laws
without any adviſe or conſent of his Council,
or Lords, his will being the rule he walks by,
unleſſe his goodneſſe deſcend ſometimes to
counſel with his <hi>Mandoryns,</hi> them of his
Council; theſe ſometimes deliberate upon his
Majeſties propoſitions, and preſent their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
to him by way of humble ſupplication,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56704:73"/>
which he confirms, changes or rejects, as he
thinks good. He diſpoſes Soveraignity of all
the Dignities and great Offices of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
without reſpect of perſons, noble or
otherwiſe, (except ſome of the Antienteſt and
greateſt Families) to ſuch as have or may ſerve
him well, whom he againe deprives of their
honours for ſmall faults; ſo that they are all his
Slaves and Vaſſals, which the Great ones e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
an honour, and put in their titles. The
King thus ſoveraignly diſpoſing of all things,
doth notwithſtanding nothing without ſome
appearance of reaſon, and conformity to the
Laws of the Kingdom, which however anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
he by his uſurped prerogative and power,
doth interpret and bow to his Arbitrary will
and pleaſure. His Majeſties Court and Train
is exceeding great and glorious; He ſeldom
ſhews himſelfe to the People, and very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
to his Grandees and Officers of the
Kingdom, which happens at certain appointed
times and daies; when he gives them Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he is richly clothed and crowned, ſitting
upon a golden Throne, at whoſe feet his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Attendants reverently kneel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with three hundred armed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of his Lifeguard: All, as well Strangers
as Subjects, who have audience of his Majeſty,
whileſt they are in his preſence, muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56704:73"/>
kneele, with folded hands and heads
hanging down; when they ſpeak to him, it
muſt be in this humble poſture, loading him
with titles and praiſes; his Anſwers are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Oracles, and his commands unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
ſo that he lives happy in all imaginable
worldly pleaſures, having many magnificent
Houſes up and down the Kingdom, as alſo
other places, Tents and Pavilions: He eateth
highly, but his drink is ſimple water, or <hi>Coco,</hi>
all ſtrong drinks being prohibited by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and the Laws, and eſteemed ſcandalous.
His Majeſty goeth ordinarily by water with
eight or ten very coſtly and fine Barges, each
with eighty or a hundred rowers; he ſits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a gilded Pavilion upon a Throne, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with his Courtiers and other Barges,
to the number of three or four hundred, with
his Train and Guards waiting upon him; moſt
of the great Ones follow the Court at ſuch
times, each in his rich gilded Barge or Praw;
ſo that the whole train of them is twelve or
fourteen hundred, and ſometimes more. When
he goes by land, he is mounted upon a gilded
ſeat, and carried upon mens ſhoulders, the
train being ordinarily the ſame, all marching
in order and great ſilence; no body is ſeen in
his way or ſight, but upon their knees, with
folded hands, and bowed heads and bodies;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56704:74"/>
this reverence better becoming a celeſtial Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then an earthly Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Once every year, about the moneth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſhews himſelf by water
and land in ſtate to his people, going to the
principal Temple of the Gods, to offer there
for the welfare of his Perſon and Kingdom,
the manner follows: When he goes by land,
the proceſſion is led by two hundred Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
each attended vvith three armed men;
theſe are follovved by many Muſitians vvith
Gomnies, Pipes and Drums, and a thouſand
men richly armed, and provided vvith Banners:
Then march the great Lords of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
on horſe-back, many of them vvearing
Crovvns of Gold upon their heads; and every
one vvaited upon by ſixty, eighty, or an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men on foot: Tvvo hundred <hi>Iapan</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
follovv theſe vvith bright Arms and rich
Colours, and much noiſe of Inſtruments; then
comes the Lifeguard vvith the King's Horſes
and Elephants, richly adorned vvith pretious
Stones and Gold furniture; vvhich is follovved
by many Servants loaden vvith fruits and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
for the Sacrifice, accompanied vvith a
ſvvet conſort of Muſick: Theſe are again fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved
by many of the great Ones on foot,
vvith folded hands; as alſo ſome Crovvned
Grandees, vvhereof one carrieth the gilded
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56704:74"/>
Standard, and the other the Svvord of Juſtice;
his Majeſty follovvs next in perſon in his royal
Robes, ſitting upon an Elephant, or elſe a
gilded Throne, carried upon mens ſhoulders,
and vvaited upon by many Lords and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers;
the Prince, or Heir of the Kingdom,
follovveth him; and then in order the Kings
Wives and Concubins, ſeated upon Elephants
in little encloſed Cabinets: laſtly the ordinary
Courtiers follovv; the vvhole proviſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of fifteen or ſixteen thouſand perſons,
having its rear brought up by ſix hundred arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men. But if the King go by vvater, then
tvvo hundred Lords, each in his Barge, ſeated
in a gilded Cabinet, vvith eighty or ninety
Rovvers, lead the van; theſe are follovved by
ten extraordinary rich figured Pravvs, or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the vvhich, as alſo the Oars, are all gilded,
each having ninety or an hundred Watermen:
The King is in the richeſt of them, ſitting like
an Idol upon a golden Throne, vvith his Lords
in their humbleſt poſture at his feet: the royal
Banner is borne by one of theſe Grandees, at
the head of the Barge, in ſtate. The King's
Brother follovveth next vvith his Train; and
after him his Majeſties Wives and Concubins,
in gilded Cabinets and Tents, each in their
Barges apart: laſtly the Gentry, Courtiers,
Guards, and other Attendants follovv, the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56704:75"/>
vvhole amounting to five or ſix and tvventy
thouſand perſons. The River is bordered on
both ſides vvith Boats, and an infinite number
of People, vvho reverence and adore their
King in his paſſage, vvith bended heads and
folded hands.</p>
            <p>The Dominion and Revenue of the Crovvn
is great, amounting yearly to many Millions,
ariſing out of in-land Commodities, as Rice,
Sappang, Tin, Lead, Salt-peter; as alſo the
profits of the Sand and Mountain Gold, which
are only ſold by the Kings Factors to forraign
Merchants: He hath alſo his Cuſtoms for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh
Wares; his Tributes and Preſents from
Subject-Princes, and Governours of Cities
and Provinces, who know how much they
muſt contribute; as alſo the profits of his
Traffick with <hi>Chormandel</hi> and <hi>China:</hi> add to
theſe the inland trade, carried on by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
in the City <hi>Iudica,</hi> or elſewhere, and
his Majeſty of <hi>Siam</hi> will be found to be one
of the richeſt Princes of <hi>India.</hi> There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Officers appointed for the receipt of
incomes, who muſt account every year, and
that exactly: Moſt of theſe monies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in building and repairing of Temples,
in rewarding of merits, and defraying the
publick charges of the Kingdom; the reſidue
being brought into the Treaſury, which is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56704:75"/>
eſteemed rich and great. The Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of <hi>Siam</hi> are ſtrange (though orderly)
in the ſucceſſion of their Princes; when the
King dies, it is not his Son, but his Brother
who is Heir to the Crown; but in caſe he have
no Brother, then indeed his Son ſteps in by
courſe, whoſe Brothers do ſucceed ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively;
laſtly all the Sons of the eldeſt Brother,
who hath reigned, follow by turns, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being wholly excluded any pretence to the
Government. But this order is not alwaies
obſerved, the Scepter being ſometimes uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by him of the family who is moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and moſt gracious with the people, which
is the preſent Kings caſe; who having raiſed
himſelf before his turn, cauſed all his Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors,
and their Adherents, to be ſlain, to the
end he might peaceably enjoy what he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
got, and leave the Crown to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or Children after him.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Juſtice, both Criminal and
Civil, is adminiſtred through the Kingdom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ancient Cuſtomes and Laws,
by Officers purpoſely appointed: But in the
City of <hi>Judica</hi> they have (beſides the ordinary
Courts of Judicature) a Colledge of twelve
Councellours, with one principal Preſident,
which doth definitively decide all Appeals, and
other buſineſſes, whether Criminal or Civil.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56704:76"/>
It is indeed permitted, though with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
expence and coſt, to appeal to the King
and his Council, who ordinarily confirm and
cauſe the former ſentence to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In this and leſſer Courts, all Civil diſputes
are brought in by Lawyers; and the cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pleaded, and witneſſes examined on both
ſides before the Commiſſioners, the Secretary
makes an extract of the whole, which being
writ in a Book, it is ſigned by both Plantiff and
Defendant, or others deputed by them; that
done the Book is ſealed up, and kept by the
Judge till next Seſſions; at which time it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
opened in the preſence of both parties,
and their debates heard, noted, and ſealed as
before: So that the Lawyers, by their ſeveral
exceptions, demurs and practices, do very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
delay and keepe up the parties for many
years; until at length, after much ſollicitings
and expence, the cauſe is anew opened and
examined, and finally adjudged and ended by
a full Colledge. But in Criminal matters, as
injuries, robberies, murther, treaſon, or the
like, the guilty, or ſuſpected perſon, is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
impriſoned, and examined; if he deny
the fault againſt witneſſes, or great preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he is forced by torture to confeſſion; all
which being noted in a Book, and preſented
to the Judges, they immediatly proceed to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56704:76"/>
Sentence and Execution; except in Capitall
crimes, ſuch being reſerved for the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
who either pardons, baniſhes, or cauſes
the condemned perſon to be put to death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſentence. Offences are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
puniſhed as they are more or leſs hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
with caſhiering, baniſhments into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts,
ſlavery, confiſcations, mutilation of hand
or foot, burning in oyl, quartering, and other
ſevere executions. Where the caſe is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
no witneſſes appearing, nor no ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions
againſt the accuſed, ſo that the Judge
knows not how or what to do, he then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
both parties to try it out by common pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
either by ducking under water, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their hands in boyling oyl, to go bare-foot
upon hot coales, or to eat a meſs of charmed
rice; this conjured meſs being made up into
balls, is given them by the Prieſt with much
ceremony; and he that can ſwallow it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
caſting it up again, and behaves himſelf in
this and the other trials with moſt courage, is
eſteemed moſt innocent and acquitted, whileſt
the other, whether accuſor or accuſed, is moſt
ſeverely puniſhed, according to the nature of
the crime.</p>
            <p>The Kings power and military force by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and land, conſiſts moſt of his own Vaſſals
and Natives; he hath indeed ſome few Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56704:77"/>
as Moors, Malayers, and ſome five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Iapanners,</hi> the moſt eſteemed for their
courage and fidelity, although the Prince now
reigning drove them out of his Country, but
they are now crept in again; ſo that moſt of
his forces are <hi>Siammers,</hi> who muſt ſerve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pay, and be alwaies in a readineſs, the
hundredth, fiftieth, twentieth, tenth, or fifth
man being levied, according to the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and occaſions. Beſides theſe, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
have ordinarily ſome hundreds of men in
their ſervice, who wait upon them in the field;
ſo that his Majeſty can raiſe an Army when he
thinks good, of two or three thouſand men,
with two or three hundred Elephants, Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
Ammunition, and other warlike Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for all this his Armies ſeldom exceed
one hundred thouſand men, and not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
forty or fifty thouſand, as his affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
either for offenſive or defenſive. His
foot are in reaſonable good order, though
merely armed with Bows and Arrows, Shields,
Swords, Pikes, and a few Guns: the horſe
are not better, though generally armed with
Swords, Shields, Bows, and Lances. Moſt of
their force conſiſts in ſome hundreds of tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Elephants, each of them furniſhed vvith
three armed men; and they have a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Cannons, but do not well know how
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56704:77"/>
to uſe them. At ſea his Majeſty hath ſeveral
Gallies and Frigots vvell provided vvith great
Guns, though the Seamen and Mariners are
but pitiful. The Pravvs, vvherevvith the <hi>Siam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
can ſtoutly ſcuffle, are vvithout number,
but ill ordered and armed, and yet ſufficient to
deal vvith their neighbouring enemies as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
as they are, though far ſhort of our
Europian Veſſels and Mariners either to fight
or ſail. Theſe Mariners, eſpecially vvhen their
Princes have been brave, have conquered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the neighbouring Kingdoms and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
but being all human things, they have
their viciſſitudes, theſe victories did but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv
the fortune of their favorites.</p>
            <p>There hath of old been great vvars betvvixt
them of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Siam,</hi> vvith various ſucceſs:
the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> pretending to the Monarchy
of the neighbouring Kingdoms, vvhich he
hath formerly had, and as yet poſſeſſeth in
part; ſo that the borders of theſe Kingdoms
are quite ruined and unpeopled, and theſe
Princes of late years content vvith inroads and
ſudden invaſions, vvith ſmall flying Armies of
tvventy or thirty thouſand men, vvhich they
have ordinarily for defence of the frontiers.
The <hi>Siammers</hi> have had likevviſe vvars againſt
other Princes, as the Kings of <hi>Jangoma, Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gou,

of <hi>Siam,</hi> and ſtoutly defended himſelf againſt
thoſe great Armies which were ſent to reduce
him; of late the Kingdom hath been in peace
until the uſurpation of the laſt deceaſed King,
who having deſtroyed the true Heirs, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
the Government contrary to order, was
likewiſe himſelf ſlain, together with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the Crown ſeized upon by another
of the blood, who after ſeveral civil and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
broils enjoyed it peaceably, and governs
at preſent with great reputation and honour,
continuing ſtill his wars with them of <hi>Pegu,</hi>
and the Rebel <hi>Cambodian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince, as well as his Predeceſſors, is
kinde to Strangers, but reſpects and eſteems
the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> more then the <hi>Portugals;</hi>
which the late King ſufficiently teſtified, when
upon the taking of a Holland Yacht in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1624. the Spaniſh Gally of <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando
de Silva</hi> was violently ſeized upon by
his command, and reſtitution and ſatisfaction
made to our Company; hereupon he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into a war with them of <hi>Manhila,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
much in his <hi>China</hi> voyages, which was
well recompenſed by the ſeaſonable aſſiſtance
of ſix Dutch men of war, which were lent him
to be employed againſt his Rebels of <hi>Patany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King hath more then three thouſand
tame Elephants in ſeveral parts of his Kingdom,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56704:78"/>
each attended by two or three men, wherein
much of his greatneſs doth conſiſt; for theſe
Beaſts are very much eſteemed in <hi>India,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when trained up to the wars, the reſt
are employed to carry Ordinances, Tents,
and Proviſions to the Camp. Theſe creatures
being great, very ſtrong, and ſtrangely docible,
are taken in ſeveral parts of the Country, and
diſciplined as followeth: A Troop of fifteen
or twenty tame ſhe Elephants, which were
taken when they were young, are driven into
the Wilderneſs, with two or three fellows to
obſerve them; the wilde ones upon ſight of
them, aſſociate with them, one or two at once,
which are driven with the reſt inſenſibly into
a great ſquare building with high ſtone walls,
and encompaſſed on the outſide with trees
which cover them; as ſoon as theſe Beaſts are
decoyed in, a great turn pike is ſhut behinde
them, and gates to hinder their return; when
they are entred further into the ſquare place,
the tame Elephants being brought up to it by
their teachers, upon notice from them, ſlip
away through other gates for the purpoſe; ſo
that the wilde ones being left alone, are out of
other little ſquares, whereof one is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
vexed and tormented with all manner of
inventions to make them angry and furious:
the above mentioned ſquares are made of great
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56704:79"/>
thick poſts, well nigh two fathoms high, but
ſo far diſtant from each other, that a man may
creep betwixt them; ſo that when the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
with his running, turning and winding,
ſeeks to revenge himſelf upon his tormenters,
they ſave themſelves behinde theſe poſts; at
length, when the beaſt is weary, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
tormented, thee is a great door opened,
into which he runs to ſave himſelf, which is
immediatly ſhut upon him, and he reſtrained
to a narrower priſon, and is there bound to
two or three tame Elephants, placed for the
purpoſe; this done, they are led into a covered
houſe, where croſs planks being contrived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the wilde ones belly, they are hoyſſed up
with pullies, and left as it were half hanging
for ſome time; ſo that with this invention,
and help of the tame ones, they are wholly
tamed in three or four moneths, and rendred
ſupple and uſeful. The Court is for the moſt
part preſent (Galleries being builded for the
Spectatours) at the taking and tormenting of
the Elephants, which is moſt pleaſant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
Theſe Beaſts are ſometimes taken in the
open fields, being environed with tame ones,
and caught in ſnares and jins; but this way is
dangerous although often practiſed; and both
ſhew how fabulouſly Writers have informed
the World in this particular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:56704:79"/>
A white Elephant (eſteemed by the <hi>Indians</hi>
a wonder in Nature) hath been found in <hi>Siam,</hi>
and no other known Land; it is eſteemed by
the inhabitants as the Prince of the Elephants,
and hath been ſo treated by the Kings of this
Country, who have had of them in the Palaces
many times, and cauſed them to be ſerved in
ſtate, often viſited them, and honoured their
Vaſſals with more then ordinary reſpect. Theſe
white Elephants have formerly occaſioned
great wars betwixt the <hi>Siammers</hi> and their
Neighbours; and ſome ſixty years ſince againſt
the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> who proving victorious, did
not only take the white Elephant priſoner, but
obliged the King of <hi>Siam</hi> to become his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary;
which yoke the following Princes did
not only caſt off, but gloriouſly revenge their
Predeceſſours misfortunes. During my firſt
reſidence in <hi>Siam,</hi> the then King took two
young white Elephants, but both died ſhortly
after to his great grief. This Nation believes
ſomewhat more then humain natue of this
creature, alledging they do not only reſpect
him for his whiteneſs, but for his divine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
which appears in his pride and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
when he is treated in ſtate, and of his
melancholy and ſorrow when thoſe honours
are denied him, or that the black Elephant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
him his obeiſſance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:56704:80"/>
The <hi>Siammers,</hi> as alſo the Neighbouring
Nations, are all Idolaters and Heathens, ſo that
they have every where great and little Temples
and Cloyſters for the ſervice of their Gods;
and the dwellings of their Prieſts. Theſe Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
are builded of Wood and Stone very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
and ſumptuous, with guilded Towers
and Pyramids; each of the Temples and Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
being filled with an incredible number of
Idols, of divers materials and greatneſs, gilded
adorned and beautified very rich and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
ſome of the Idols are four, ſix, eight, and
ten fathoms long; amongſt the reſt there is one
of an unimaginable greatneſs, being one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty foot high. In theſe Temples
and Cloyſters there are many Prieſts and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Men diſciplined, and very obedient to
their ſuperiours, being all ſubject to the Arch
<hi>Flamin,</hi> or Prior of the great Temple of <hi>Iudica,</hi>
whoſe ſpiritual power is vaſtly great, though
ſubordinate to the Kings. All the Clergy
(whereof there are in <hi>Iudica</hi> alone at leaſt thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand) are clothed, without any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale
difference, in yellow linnen clothes, having
their heads all ſhorn. The learnedſt amongſt
theſe are profeſſed Prieſts, out of which the
Regents of their Temples are choſen, (who
are held in great eſteem and reverence by the
People) preaching, teaching, and offering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56704:80"/>
their Feaſts and Holy daies. Theſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
the natural uſe of Women, upon pain
of being burned; but they may alwaies, and
at pleaſure, upon declaration of their frailty or
weakneſs, quit their frocks, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to another life, which happens often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. They have their morning and
evening Song, Readings and other Services,
celebrated in their Cloyſters every day, and
frequented by their ſociety. They live upon
the Alms and bounty of the King and great
Ones, as alſo on the fruit which their Church
Lands bring forth; but principally out of the
ſweet and labours of the Commonalty, who
unanimouſly ſhare with them, they ſending
every morning ſome Prieſts and Clerks out of
their Cloyſters, with begging bags to receive
theſe donations and charity: Beſides theſe
Prieſts, there are a ſort of old Nuns ſhorn,
lodged in Chappels near the greateſt Temples,
who aſſiſt very devoutly in all their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſingings, ceremonies, and other Church
ſervices, but all voluntary, being tied to no
rules or preſcriptions. Theſe Heathens do
generally believe, (however differing in many
particulars) that there is one upper God, with
many leſſer Deities in Heaven, who created
all things: that the Souls of Men are immortal,
and ſhall be rewarded or puniſhed according
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56704:81"/>
to their merits and actions; the good dwelling
with the God in bliſs, whileſt the wicked are
tormented by the Devils that ſeduced them.
Their Religion is principally founded upon
theſe points, which have been delivered to
them in writing many hundred years ſince, and
confirmed with the teſtimony of many holy
men, (whoſe memory they worſhip in their
Images, which they have ſet up like ſo many
leſſer Deities) who by their charity to the
Church, to the poor, and to all things that had
life, they endeavored to merit Heaven, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the dreadful puniſhments of the Devils.
Thoſe that are religious and ſuperſtitious in
theſe, buy ordinarily upon Feaſt daies, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of Birds and living Fiſh, bringing them
to the Temple, and there give them their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
eſteeming it a great ſin to kill not onely
men, but the more rude creatures, fancying the
ſouls of deceaſed perſons to be tranſmigrated
into them: all other evils which Nature teaches
us to be ſin, they account ſo too, and are much
preached againſt by their Prieſts. The chief
Ceremonies of this Idolatry are, as we ſaid,
preaching, teaching, ſinging evening and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Prayers, and offering of Sacrifice, which
is done with torches, candles, incenſe, ſpices,
and flowers at the altars of their images, which
in their opinion repreſent the great God, the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56704:81"/>
leſſer Deities, and holy Men, whereby they
think their wrath is appeaſed; to which end
they celebrate with much ſolemnity at the
new, full, and quarters of the Moon, as alſo
ſeveral other extraordinary Feſtivals, with a
faſting from any thing which hath had life, for
three moneths together, they pray for the ſick,
and alſo the dead, who being firſt ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſhaven, anointed, charmed, and with
much ceremony, as weeping, cutting of the
hair of the head by the next friend, alms, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Prieſts, muſick, plays, fire-works,
and other ſhows (according to the quality and
ability of the deceaſed) burnt with fire, their
collected aſhes are afterwards anointed and
buried near the Temples, a Pyramid rich and
magnificent being erected over them; ſo that
theſe funerals are extreamly expenſive to the
ſurvivors, as well as honorable for the deceaſed.
The Prieſts carry themſelves very moderatly
to thoſe of a contrary Religion, condemning
no opinions, but believe that all, though of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
tenets, living vertuouſly, may be ſaved,
all ſervices which are performed with zeal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acceptable to the great God, eſpecially
theirs, they being convinced of its truth and
innocency. This conſtancy of theirs makes
them not eaſily to be drawn to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
which hath been ſufficiently attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56704:82"/>
by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> whoſe induſtrious Prieſts
omitted nothing for their converſion, and by
the Mohometans who are no leſſe zealous in
their way, though with little or no ſucceſs by
either of them, and yet the Chriſtians, as alſo
the Mahometans, are both permitted the free
exerciſe of their Religions in their Countrey.
However theſe Heathen be thus religious, yet
they fear and ſerve (although contrary to the
opinion of moſt of their Prieſts) the very
Devils, whom they believe to be the authours
and cauſes of all evil, as the Gods are of every
thing that is good and vertuous: They adore
theſe unclean Spirits in their ſickneſſes and
misfortunes, celebrating their feaſts with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
playing, and offering attoning ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of fruits and living creatures: They are
ſo ſtrangely abominable in their geſtures and
actions, that it is not fit for a Chriſtian either
to ſee or write them; thus fondly ſearching his
favour, whoſe indulgences do but plunge them
deeper in their unhappy miſtakes and errours.
The people of this Countrey are reaſonably
well proportioned, brown and tawny; they
are none of the beſt Souldiers, though proud
and inſolent in their victories; they are modeſt
enough in their civil converſation, though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
light, fearful, incredulous, diſſimuled,
deceitful, and very lying. The men are lazy and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56704:82"/>
ſlow, inſomuch that the women, with their ſlaves,
are forced (contrary to the cuſtoms of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
to labour the earth, and do moſt of their
husbands work, beſides taking care for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and houſes, whileſt the men follow their
pleaſure and divertiſements abroad. They clothe
themſelves (both men &amp; women) thin, according
to the hot climat they live in; both ſexes wear
painted petticoats, the men covering their upper
parts with a ſhort ſhirt with half-ſleeves, and the
women with a thin cloth, both ends hanging over
their ſhoulders to hide their breſts: They wear
for ornaments gold pins in their hair, and rings of
the ſame mettal on their fingers: This is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
wear, high and low being all of a faſhion,
and not diſtinguiſhable but by the richneſs of
their veſtments, and the greatneſs of their trains,
which they much glory in: The Gentry and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
have many ſlaves attending them when they
go abroad, ſome ten, twenty, thirty, or more,
according to their abilities and greatneſs; and not
a Citizen, or his Wife, ſtirs in the ſtreets without
one or two of theſe ſlaves to wait upon them.
Their houſes are builded according to the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>India,</hi> of wood and reeds, and covered with
<hi>Coco</hi> leaves, or tiles; the floors are raiſed three or
four foot high, their appartements being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
though but ſlenderly furniſhed, only
for ſleeping, and dreſſing what is neceſſary for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56704:83"/>
their refection. Their diet is but mean, as rice,
fiſh, and herbs; they drink water, though on
Feaſt daies they indulge more the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
drinking ordinarily Arak, or Brandy-Wine.</p>
            <p>They differ very much in their cuſtoms about
marrying; great Perſons need nothing but the
conſent of their Parents or Friends, (the Prieſts
not intermedling at all) the ceremony ending in
feaſting and rejoycing. Husband and Wife may
part again at pleaſure, dealing their goods and
children without further circumſtance, and may
re-marry if they think good, without fear of
ſhame or puniſhment. A man may keep as many
Concubins as he pleaſes, beſides his Wife, though
they are in ſome ſubordinacy to her, whoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
onely inherit, the other being contented
with ſmall portions for their ſubſiſtence. Great
mens goods are divided after their deaths into
three parts; one part for the King, the ſecond for
the Prieſts and their Funerals, and the third for
their Children. The common People have other
Cuſtoms; the Bridgroom buyeth his Bride for
a ſum of monies of her Father or Friends, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the marriage is made and concluded with a
little feaſting; but they may divorce, like the great
Ones, at pleaſure, and marry again with the ſame
liberty. The Children deal their deceaſed parents
goods equally, except ſome little advantages for
the eldeſt Son. They have many other Cuſtoms
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56704:83"/>
in marriage and ſucceſſion, too long and tedious
to write. As for their Children, they ſend them
to ſchool at five or ſix years old, where they are
taught to write and read, and rendered fit for
Trades and other employments; ſome are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in their ſtudies by the Prieſts their Maſters,
until they are called to Offices and advancements
in the State, and then they caſt off the yellow
frock; others continue there out of hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one day Heads of Temples and Schools, or
ſharing in the Prieſthood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Siammers,</hi> who live in Towns and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
places, are either Courtiers, Officers, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
Watermen, Fiſhermen, Tradeſmen, or
Artificers, each one containing himſelf in his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
The Country people brew, till, plant,
and bring up fwarms of Cattel, as Horſes, Kine;
Swine, Deer; and domeſtick Fowl, as Geefe;
Peacocks, Ducks, Hens, Pigeons, and other
tame creatures, inſomuch that proviſion is very
cheap, notwithſtanding the abundance of at
which is ſent into the neighbouring Provinces
for their ſupply and uſe: They have Brick, Lime,
Wood, and all materials for building of Churches,
Forts, Houſes, Ships, Prawes, Jonks, and other
veſſels in great quantities. The divers Towns of
this Countrey have their ſeveral Trafficks and
Commerce; in the chief City the trading is very
good and free in its courſe; the principal commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56704:84"/>
are Choromandes and Sura veſtments, all
manner of <hi>China</hi> wares, Jewels, Gold, Benjamin,
Gumlack, Wax, Sappang, Agerwood, Tin, and
Lead, &amp;c. as alſo vaſt numbers of Harts-skins,
one hundred and fifty thouſand of theſe creatures
being caught yearly in this Countrey, and fold
with much profit to the <hi>Japanners.</hi> They drive
a great trade with all eating proviſions, eſpecially
Rice, many thouſand Tuns being tranſported
yearly by forraigners. This City, by reaſon of its
great traffick, is frequented by ſeveral Nations,
as the <hi>Indians,</hi> the more Weſtern <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean
Moors, and Chriſtian Merchants. The
King himſelf is alſo a Merchant, and hath his own
Ships and Factours trading to <hi>Choromandel</hi> and
<hi>China,</hi> being for that cauſe more favoured and
priviledged then any other Prince; he likewiſe
trafficks to <hi>Pegu, Ava, Jongoma, Langs-jang,</hi>
and other places, beſides his negotiations at
home, all which bring him incredible profit, and
no ſmall diſturbance to private Merchants, all
which do certainly manifeſt the great trade that
is carried on in this Countrey. The Monies cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
is of very fine ſilver, of a round figure, and
impreſſed with the Kings picture; the kindes are
a Ticlas, a Maſe, and a Fong, worth thirty pence,
ſeven pence half penny, and four pence Engliſh,
or near upon. They reckon ordinarily by <hi>Cattys,</hi>
each being twenty <hi>Tayls,</hi> or forty eight Royals
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56704:84"/>
of eight; and it is with this and no other coyn
that they handle and trade with, ſave that there
is a leſſer called <hi>Schulpkens,</hi> or little Sheels, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
eight or nine thouſand go to a Fong, being
brought out of <hi>Manilha, Borneo,</hi> and <hi>Lequeo,</hi> very
uſeful for poor people.</p>
            <p>Before the coming of the Netherlanders into
the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> the <hi>Portugals</hi> had great correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and amity with this Kingdom, being in ſuch
eſteem and honour by the King, that the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
ſent from their Vice-Roys, Governours,
and Biſhops of <hi>Malacca</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> were not only
well received by his Majeſty, but richly preſented
by him, and many of the reſiding <hi>Portugals</hi> in this
Country advanced to great Offices and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
they had not only the free exerciſe of their
Religion, but their chief Prieſt had alſo a moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
penſion allowed him for his more ſplendid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence;
thus they proſpered here for many years,
until the Dutch Company got footing amongſt
them, and gained upon them from time to time,
by taking their Ships and interrupting their trade,
with <hi>Santhome</hi> and <hi>Nevagatain,</hi> inſomuch that
they are at preſent very low and out of credit, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
more particularly by their taking of a
Dutch Yacht by a Spaniſh Gally in the River of
<hi>Siam,</hi> which the King took ſo highly, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
it with his Arms, which produced a war
between him and <hi>Manilha;</hi> and however the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56704:85"/>
               <hi>Portugals</hi> ſeemed unconcerned in this quarrel,
yet they wholly loſt their credit at Court, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the Biſhop of <hi>Malaccas</hi> Vicar, their
chief Reſident there, is debarred of his uſual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to his Majeſty and his Miniſters, whereas in
former times they were eſteemed the onely and
chief Merchants of the whole Kingdom. This
breach and difference between theſe two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was fomented by the Dutch, and increaſed
by ſeveral acts of hoſtility on the <hi>Portugals</hi> ſide,
who took many of his Majeſties Ships and Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
at Sea; in revenge whereof, the <hi>Portugal</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
were ſeized on in <hi>India,</hi> and all the preſent
<hi>Portugals</hi> natives clapt up in priſon, who were
after two years reſtraint, upon a fictitious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie,
reſtored to their liberty; but this practice
coming to light, occaſioned the ſeiſure of a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilian</hi>
and a <hi>Portugal</hi> Veſſel in the Havens of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goor</hi>
and <hi>Tanaſlary,</hi> the men whereof were not
releaſed till after a two years reſtraint; but then
indeed returned with his Majeſties Letters to the
Governours of <hi>Manilha</hi> and <hi>Malacca,</hi> with
invitations of their former peace and traffick,
where it is probable they may return, but queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
whether they ſhall ever recover their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
credit and authority.</p>
            <p>It is more then thirty years ſince the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
came firſt to <hi>Siam,</hi> and were admitted of
by his Majeſty; ſo that the Company have judged
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56704:85"/>
it neceſſary, for the cheriſhing their traffick and
alliance with ſo mighty a Prince, to ſettle there;
to which end they builded a houſe, or lodge, of
wood in the City of <hi>India,</hi> where they trade in
in land commodities, and ſelling of clothes, as
alſo buying of Harts-skins, Sappang, &amp;c. which
are ſent yearly to <hi>Japan:</hi> the Company indeed
hath not profited much, by reaſon of ſeveral
misfortunes by this traffick; but they have gained
more reputation then any Europians beſides, by
the great friendſhip and correſpondence which
is betwixt them and the King; and alſo have had
the benefit of tranſporting great quantities of all
ſorts of proviſions in <hi>Batamia,</hi> which friendſhip,
notwithſtanding the ſeveral ſucceſſions of the
Princes, diſturbing the Companies Cantore and
Servants, is yet ſufficiently conſerved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and ought in my opinion to be cheriſhed,
as abſolutely neceſſary for the good and welfare
of our Company, as alſo in regard of the Kings
civil uſage of us, and his averſion to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
our common enemy; finally our factory
eſtabliſhed there in the year 1633. and trading du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my four years direction, are ſo much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
and increaſed, that the Company hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
gained by them, with probability, with
good mannagement of more ſignal advantages:
To which end the General and Councel of <hi>India</hi>
cauſed in <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. a ſtone lodge, with fit pack-houſes,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56704:86"/>
pleaſant apartements, and a commodious
landing place, to be builded on the borders of
the River <hi>Menam,</hi> being one of the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt
and beſt ſcituated of any that is unfortified
in all the <hi>Indiaes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much we found good to diſcover of
the cuſtomes and manners of the Kingdom of
<hi>Siam,</hi> being my obſervations during my eight
years reſidence in the chief City of the Country.
I have followed the exact rules of truth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my beſt knowledge and diligence, in this
ſhort relation, remitting the curious to the more
large and more particular diſcourſes of better and
more exact judgements.</p>
