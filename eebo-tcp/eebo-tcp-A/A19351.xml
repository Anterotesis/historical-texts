            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hee doth not perswasion;
which in all noble natures, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes
more then compulsion: hee
is not vrged by feare, but in feares
stead hath iustice, hath the sight of
his owne place, hath the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that vpon his shoulders
rests the whole body of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
which respectes curbe
Princes, vnrestrayned by feare.
More particularly to the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
meaning,—<hi>Odia qui ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium
timet;</hi> It belongs to a Prince
to shunne the deseruing hate; not
to feare hatred: feare, as it is said,
belongs not to them; and if in
them, bastardizeth their natures,
and corrupts them. The vniust
<pb facs="tcp:9159:7"/>
partialitie of some natures, abused
by selfe loue, wil hate the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of iustice, and not vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the intent of lawes, thinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriously
of their executors. This
must not be regarded by Princes,
nor stop their wel intended cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
The satisfaction of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is Metridate expelling the
poyson of ill tongues, and himselfe
finding he hath performed his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, shal be strong
inough to resist vulgar thoughts,
which liue in opinion. The hate
of these is feeble, and howsoeuer
common it is to the worst mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
to giue them handsome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
yet cannot these present
their griefes to iudiciall men, so
shadowed, as not to bee discerned
faulty: so cannot the way of trueth
beget hate, able to doe harme; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and spleene from some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
it may, but they are too weak
<pb facs="tcp:9159:8"/>
euer to doe hurt. But were there
perill in the performance of the
true office of a Prince, yet must it
not disswade him; for shuns he the
execution of his duety for feare of
hate, he explaneth his regalitie to
bee an office vndertaken, to please
himself, not to profit his countrey,
then which mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is not any
more monsterous and detestable.
The iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al causes, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding

restes the very soule of
the state, &amp; the life of a states flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,

            <p>It is the destinated affection to
seruile natures, feare: and it is wel,
for they are not so straightly bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to be good, as are higher fortunes.
Two are the bandes, whereby the
diuine wisedome preserueth the
world: Loue of vertue, and feare
of punishment: and thus are some
(I am afraid most) kept from the
extremitie of ill; Therefore in the
preseruation of Kingdomes, feare
hath, and ought to haue a great
hand. It is not the often vsing
tortures, and executions, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaseth
this; though offendours
suffering, and according to the
fact rigorous execution, is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to the bodie of a state: and
that I verily beleeue, the hanging
of one man, to worke better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
amongst men, then twentie
made into mummie; yet that feare
<pb facs="tcp:9159:9"/>
amongst Subiects, that preserueth
the kingdome, hath his originall,
not from this, but from the princes
life: for those states onely are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with the blessednes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and tranquilitie, where the
Prince vseth his authoritie to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
offences, not to authorize his
owne offences; for though hee
hath the oddes of being aboue the
law, yet if he giue his Subiects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
example, they wil follow him;
albeit he seeke to quench the fire
of their viciousnesse, with neuer so
much of their blood. It was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
tricke among the heathen
Princes, to fetch their petygree
from the Gods; I doe not thinke
their fortunes had so besotted
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to think so themselues, but
only nourisht the opinion to draw
the more awe &amp; obedience from
their Subiects. They should haue
imitated the diuine powers in the
<pb facs="tcp:9159:9"/>
puritie of their liues, and so haue
beene neerer the gods, and more
feared of men: for nothing produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
true feare from Subiects to
their Prince, but the worthinesse
of his owne person. His power, his
splendor, his fortune, his gards, and
other circumstances, (without
vertue) doe rather stirre vp dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
against him and his fortune,
then awfull regard: the vse of all
these things wil be conuerted into
detestable names; his power, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
his splendor, prodigalitie,
his fortune cursed, his gard ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the instruments of oppressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
his other signols of authoritie, the
deckings of a corrupt minde: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which name, when the people
shall behold them, they bring his
authoritie to contempt; and being
once brought to that declyning,
they neuer leaue roulling, vntill
they come to the bottome of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse.
<pb facs="tcp:9159:10"/>
               <hi>Regna custodit metus.—</hi>
But that feare must come from the
vertue of the Prince, not from his
power, or els it holds not: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vertue, it hath no vertue.</p>

that deceiues the world: it is not
pleasure to doe what wee list, but

which hope doubtlesse is the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted

chastising the irreligious, or

common-wealths men are so

gouernours cannot prosper:
inferiours participate with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

their licentiousnesse, with putting
on the fashion of their life, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
by the hand of tyrannie;
who doth, by the hand of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Iustice: So is there no safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vnder such Magistrates, since
refusing or obeying, ruines one of
the two best parts of man. The
good obey the ill; it is worth the
obseruation, how the eternall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
applies and suffers: ill is
here made the touch-stone of
good, and good obeyes ill, to trie
goodnesse constancie: could the
ill soften or giue the least alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the good, it were not good,
nor were good then worthy of
the preeminence. Thus doth he
make goodnesse combate with his
contrarie, which contention
ends with the excellencie of his
<pb facs="tcp:9159:19"/>
iustice and wisedome; his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in descrying by this means
hypocrisie; his iustice, that at the
end of these warres, both parties
are made ready for his sentence,
when no excuse or colour can mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate
or darken his reward to the
victor, and punishment to the
vanquished. In the time of life, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this oppression there is
hardly any counsell to be giuen,
since if he commeth to authoritie
by succession or iust election, it is
not lawful to practise against him;
but if otherwise, it is otherwise:
and a life is well sold, that loseth it
in conspiring their ouerthrow: but
atteyning it by any of the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>If manuall trades aske time and

that professe the seruing of their

for the minds executions are

if a trade-mans worke plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

may be mended, or at the worst,
there is but so much lost: the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the mind can hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called,
&amp; if miscarried, dangerous.
Euery man by the state he is born
in, may gesse in what maner he is
to doe his Countrey seruice: so
ought he to prepare himself, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
those nobly descended,
which as they haue a greater por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Countrey then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
men, so are they bound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
to care for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation;
they are chiefe Actors
vpon this stage, whose action if it
doth not fit their part, whose part
if forgotten or not learned, the
whole matter is disgraced, and
themselues more taxed then a
<pb facs="tcp:9159:21"/>
Messenger or a mule, vpon whom
the eies of men haue set no note.
It is then the office of a true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner
into things, not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
any place or office, in the
managing which, hee is yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
but to prepare himselfe
for that is likely to follow; for the
first lesson of wisdome is,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Noscere hoc primum decet,</l>
                  <l>Quid facere victor debeat, victus pati.</l>
               </q>
               <p>In generall, mercie belongeth
to the Conquerour; for if the fault
be but slight, the conquered hath
punishment ynough, to hold his
life, of any lord but God: besides,
his owne destinie is vnknowne,
which may come to the same
point and then his clemencie may
procure him clemencie: more it
often hapneth, commiseration of
the estate of enemies hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
them, and made them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:9159:21"/>
friends: here then to be rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
were his owne losse; for
there is no possession comparable
to that of friendes. But particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
the cause of quarrell, the
nature of the people, their force,
their distance must produce the
Victors vse of his Conquest. If
they take vp armes being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
and now become rebels, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
must teach them to know
their errours; if a neighbour or
confederate, that hath committed
trecherous actions, or proceeded
contrary to the law of nations; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
againe. If naturally the
people be contentious, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to suppresse their natures,
with cutting off their strength;
if their forces bee apt to intice
them to armes, to abate their
force, the cause of their intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
if farre off, and yet meete
to bee held in subiection, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
<pb facs="tcp:9159:22"/>
the naturals likely to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
and to plant Gouernours of
the Victors appointment, and to
mingle the blood of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
with the conquered. In this
first, the punishment must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the offence, for then it is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie:
for the other, they must
be accomplished without much
blood, for the shedding of blood
without a very iust cause, is inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.
To threaten people must
be carefully shunned, for he that
giueth his enemie desperation,
giueth him a weapon more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
then valure. From both
rigour and mercie, proceede great
benefits to a State, but they must
bee vsed according to a Princes
owne state; for if hee bee yet to
conquer them, his estimation of
clemencie softeneth their spirits,
and is the onely meanes to make
them cowards: if already in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:22"/>
their opinion of their
Princes rigour keepeth them in
awe.</p>
               <p>But Iustice must reconcile
this question, of which, is most
necessary; for by his warrant, to
saue or kill is lawfull.</p>

               <p>Aduersitie hath no more to do
but this, a short lesson though
hard, hard through the custome
of sympathizing with our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
a misfortune farre more
lamentable then the first; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling
them, drawes the minde
to an extreme basenesse, to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
follie: for if our harmes be
not past recouerie, yet was there
neuer any helped by this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
many haue beene despised by
this; for from others there is
no assistance drawne, except
<pb facs="tcp:9159:23"/>
in the way of charitie, which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
worthy nature abhorreth; but
from the strength of our owne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inward or outward graces:
the outward is already lost, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
lost, if wee bewaile the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
losse, which in the Victor
stirreth vp eyther contempt or
pitie, the best of which in a noble
minde is more abhorred, then
the worst part of fortune. In the
vanquished, debarred from all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of outward thinges, is
there an oportunitie to shew their
owne worth, more then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time; for he is then separated
from those things, that are wont
to make disfigured monsters to
looke handsomely: though there
bee a triall in the moderation of
high fortunes, yet is it a thing
much more easie, it commeth not
so neere the quicke: for hee that
endureth famishing without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:23"/>
hath a greater part of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
then he that commeth from a
feast without a surfet, patience
beeing a more substantiall part of
Vertue, then temperance: this is
left him, which should procure
both patience and comfort, the
exercise of the minde being to be
preferred much aboue the ease of
the body. This meditation, with
a minde iudicially determining
what ought to bee done, not what
is most ordinarily done, cannot
choose but learne him in calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to weare that part with as
much ease as he did the other: the
strength of the minde is able to
doe more then this, whose power,
whose worth, whose abilities, wee
are ignorant and so destitute of,
with following the beaten way of
the idle vulgar.</p>

worke would soone be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
shee hath giuen limits to all
things, and to all things courses
fitting their natures, which gone
beyond, and able to runne on,
would beget a new Chaos, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all things from their owne
natures; there would be nothing,
for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bating against one another,
&amp; setting their forces one against
another; the Victor would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
all things to his owne nature,
and that would destroy nature,
whose glory is the multiplicitie of
her instruments, and the working
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with one another. Much more
<pb facs="tcp:9159:24"/>
dangerous is it in men, whose rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is able to resist violence, and
more strongly, whose reason tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
them to abhorre violence.
The state of a Prince is vpheld by
his subiects opinion, his Maiestie
begetteth reuerence, so long as
his power fitteth it selfe to iustice;
his Royaltie maintained, so long
as they find his wisdome and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
gouerns him, and hee them in
peace: nothing assisteth another,
that is not againe by that assisted.
The violence amongst men is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
an humour begotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
selfe-loue &amp; ignorance;
it resembleth selfe-loue, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
his owne safetie aboue the
liues or loues of his subiects; like
ignorance, in fetching the means
of his safetie from false grounds,
an humor of all humours the most
vnsafe and most displeasing: for
he is not safe, when he is safe, his
<pb facs="tcp:9159:25"/>
minde thinketh then of danger
and treason, and for the bodies
safetie without the minds, it little
helpeth, for the minde giueth
quiet to the bodie, not the bodie
to the minde; most displeasing it
is, for it displeaseth the whole
world, and with the world him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
for hee raiseth no content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of his course, and that
displeaseth, that goeth without
contentment.</p>
               <p>No State of this nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth:
if the Turkish Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement

this Axiome, it may be answered,
It is a tyranny, that goeth masked
vnder religion: for were it so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as the people might behold
they suffer by the bloody hand of
crueltie, without the allowance of
God, and that his actions were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
vnlawfull, soone would

               <p>The whole world is vpheld by

lowest, especially man is behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her; for without her helpe, of
all other, hee is the most detestable
creature: without moderation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
conquers reason; without

serue a wrong master; without
moderation, the body will rebell
against the soule; without mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the soule yeelds to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
in a word vnmoderated, both
soule and body perisheth. This is
she, that makes the distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
vertue and vice; this is shee,
that makes courage valour, that
without moderation would be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and then furie; this is she, that
separateth iustice, and crueltie;
prouidence, from feare; power,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:26"/>
from tyranny; maiesty, from pride:
this is she that keepeth tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

this is she that tempereth, and
keepeth in frame the whole frame
of the world, without who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> violence
&amp; extremes her contraries, would
ouerthrow &amp; ruine all. Thus much
owe we to moderation, to whom
after our seruice to God, if wee
would sacrifice a serious meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to her excellency, our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s would

his satisfaction aboue any thing,
is not the way; this is euery day
to fall: but he that aspireth to this
flight to the starres, must make his
body hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly desire his soule to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
and make apt his grosse inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of earth. <hi>No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est ad astra mollis
e terris via.</hi> In times past, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
goodnes of vertue was not fully
discouered, but their electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s drew
their force rather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of honoring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlds Creator,
or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope of eternity; yet eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then
they magnified nor deified none,
but me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> famous for atchiueme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, or
<pb facs="tcp:9159:29"/>
profitable inuentions. Thus came
the multiplicitie of the heathen
gods, most of whom were so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
either in chiualrie, or in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
the state of peace, as draue
their countrey men betweene the
effects of admiration, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to proclaime them gods.
Thus Iupiter, who doubtles was
an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t souldier; thus Bacchus,
for finding out the vse of the wine;
whose meanes though wee haue
spotted with many imputations,
no doubt they were extraordinary
men of qualitie, whom the people
of those times made gods, though
the Poets of after ages made one
a lecher, the other a drunkard: but
that was not their fault, but a fault
of the idlenes of poeticall fancies.
From these may be seene, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
vertues are not to be obteined,
without the imployment of the
minde and body, laysinesse the
<pb facs="tcp:9159:29"/>
yonger brother of idlenesse, is
one of the burthens of impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the soule is of too fine and
quicke a mettal, to loue doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
shee must haue employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
otherwise she wil grow dull
and heauie, and like prisoners that
are debarred exercise, fatte and
vnweildsome: in many things
doth the soule follow the bodies
inclination, euen as the eye seeth
by the assistance of a spectacle,
whose glasse, if false, the eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see truely; if thicke, my stily:
the body by cherishing groweth
not able, but like a pampered
horse, short winded, pursie, and
vnseruiceable, whose organes by
this meanes growe vnapt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their functions, and the
soule depriued of shewing her
dexteritie, like a house vnhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
groweth desolate and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9159:30"/>
Contrarily, the soule cherished
and obserued, recompenseth her
obseruer, with a more large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
then haruest doth the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman.</p>
               <p>So for the first iourney to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
there cannot bee a truer
way appointed, then the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting
the bodie, and giuing the
soules motions libertie: for the
soule by cherishing flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth;
the bodie cherished, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth.</p>
               <p>Nowe of the wings enabling
our flight, the first is pleasures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
not the true pleasure,
but a wrong conceiued: for the
hope of the true, is the life of all
good actions, and all men liue
by the meditation of the obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this summe of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>But wee miscall and mistake
<pb facs="tcp:9159:30"/>
vertue, reading whose front, and
conceiuing there is nothing in
her, but a stearne depriuation of
libertie, so leaue her.</p>
               <p>But howe doeth our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
erre, since vertue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
to leade men into
the mansion of a neuer dying
pleasure?</p>
               <p>And the mayne difference
of vertue and vice, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the one worthie of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement,
the other of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
is vertues continuance in
pleasure; vices sodaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
into dolour and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</p>
               <p>I cannot denie, but the false
solicitours for vice our senses,
bring a kinde of pleasure with
their satisfaction; but so short it is,
as euerie man knoweth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow
subiect to ende this surfeiting
<pb facs="tcp:9159:31"/>
pleasure with griefes and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is the permanencie of
pleasure then, that makes it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
which though it commeth
vnto vs not by any immediate
meanes, wee must not therefore
refuse, for so commeth all things
to man, which is the cause that
the life of man must be laborious
and painefull: for so are all things,
that must vse second and third
meanes, for obtaining the first
and chiefe. We reckon of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicions,
because the end of them is
health: of Lawyers, for they say
they produce quiet: of Souldiers,
for they purchase peace. Let vs
thinke thus of vertue, and wee
shall bee vertuous; temperance
first aspect is not to be valued, nor
his abstinence; but that the ende
of his abstinence giueth pleasure
a longer continuance then appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
satisfaction: to this ende for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb facs="tcp:9159:31"/>
embraceth perill &amp; paines,
that hee may receiue a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
more full and continuall
then a dastardly idlenesse: this is
the reason of vertues prohibition,
because shee would giue vs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and happinesse more lasting
and solide: who then will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
the humorous wishes of
vice, since by that meanes he shal
obtaine vertue, and with her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
contentment.</p>
               <p>But yet hath man gotten but
one wing, with which though he
can flicker, and hoppe, yet can
he not flie: for himselfe, hee hath
ynough to serue his turne, but he
is borne to societie, and to helpe
others: to performe which, his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wing is appointed, vertues
application; this is the wing of
splendor, the other is profitable,
so are the designes for a mans self;
but this leaneth to the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:32"/>
and is therefore commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>
               <p>Who applieth himselfe to his
countrey, with a minde applying
all things to vertue, he is so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
as nothing originally of the
world more worthie: First, hee
beholdeth the state of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,
hee redeemeth that, for
commiserations sake: Next, hee
vieweth the liues of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen,
whose swaruing croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
hee amendeth, both by
counsell and example: Lastly, he
beholdeth forreine States, with
the eye of preuention, that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasions,
incrochings, or conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
disturbe the safetie of his
Common-wealth. I call this last,
because I will vnder these three
heads, mention what I thinke,
not doubting of many more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
that belong to this life, nor
inforcing any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beleeue, that
<pb facs="tcp:9159:32"/>
these three comprehend the
summe of their duties; but thus
shall my sleight touch of these
passe his iourney.</p>
               <p>To commiserate the distressed I
estate of others, needs no great
perswasion, for all good natures
bring it with them from their
cradles; but I knowe not how,
great fortunes, and high estates,
so alter the dispositions of men, as
it deserueth a remembrance; for
nothing is more common, then
the prosperous to despise the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed.
This commiseration
hath two meanes of performing
his function, to helpe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by violence of men; and
the oppressed by the malignitie
of fortune: the former is iustice,
the last charitie. In this first ought
there to bee a freedome giuen to
Suitours, to enter both into
your gates and presence; mee
<pb facs="tcp:9159:33"/>
thinkes there cannot bee a more
vniust course, then to professe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and to denie suitours their
presence. How can hee know the
griefes of men without hearing
their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints? Who deserues his
place, vnlesse ready to heare the
distresseds petitions? But these do
euill. Who will do well, let him
giue ready audience, and as ready
dispatch, without any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
then the remembrance of
his good deed; with this hee must
be carefull of his seruants, lest
his authoritie and their couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
despoile not the poore,
and make them buy iustice at a
deare rate.</p>
               <p>For Charitie, it befitteth well
the life of aboundance to haue
recourse hither, but how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
giftes, that they may rightly
deserue the name of Charitie, is
the difficultie. It is no charitie to
<pb facs="tcp:9159:33"/>
giue so violently as may waste the
maine of an estate; but what may
be spared, by cutting off superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
delicates &amp; outward pompe,
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert this to the poore distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
outcasts of fortune, is true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
I like not of feasting those
that are able to feast mee againe,
nor to keepe a table for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers:
it is better to giue one his
dinner that knowes not elsewhere
to haue it, then twenty able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
feast with feast. I haue often
inueighed against our English se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
courses, which kil many with
surfeits, whiles as many starue at
their gates with famine: I cannot
thinke of an Honourabler estate,
then to haue much, and yet to
liue temperately, depriuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of excesse to supply the
wants of others, which course
whosoeuer shall entertaine, shall
encrease his vertue, keepe his
<pb facs="tcp:9159:34"/>
body from diseases, and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
from enuie.</p>
               <p>To make his countrey men
worthy of enioying their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and meete to preserue it,
there are two meanes, rewardes
and punishment. I spake lately
of charitie, which is to giue them
altogether in want; I speake now
of liberalitie, which is to giue
to them rich in vertues, but poore
in wealth: but to giue gifts as we
vse nowadaies in hope of a greater,
belongeth neither to liberalitie
nor charitie.</p>
               <p>Mee thinkes it becommeth
Magistrates to haue an eye aswell
to those of deserts and to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
them, as to bee inquisitiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
offenders and their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It is not thus, and that it is
not, I thinke hath bene the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
cause of the decay of vertue:
for by this neglect, vertue hath
<pb facs="tcp:9159:34"/>
lost one of her meanes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
and many woorthie
spirites haue runne out their liues
vnprofitably.</p>
               <p>I possesse as little of vertue,
as the most beggerly in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie;
yet did I neuer see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
limme of her bodie, but I
was enamoured of it. Howe
much it would rayse the spirites
of worthie fellowes, and lift vp
declyning vertue, to haue great
men lend them good lookes,
and withall to displace Buffoones,
flatterers, and vnprofitable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of great charge, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
that to their vse, the proofe
will bee better beleeued then I;
yet in my opinion, this man should
bee as profitable to his countrey,
as the most vigilant, turning his
eyes to some other care.</p>
               <p>For punishment, the phisicke
of a State, it ought with asmuch
<pb facs="tcp:9159:35"/>
regard to bee looked into, as this
former, they are indeede to goe
arme in arme: of this part of iustice
since the direct meane is hardly to
bee obtained, I hold him the best
States-man, that leaneth rather to
seueritie, then to much lenitie; for
example, the vse of iustice doth
nothing so much harme with some
strict executions, as with letting
offenders escape without punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
law is the Load-stone, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
iustice saileth, and must be kept
in a venerable accompt: if the
crimes procuring them bee but
light, and not likely to impaire the
Common wealth much, it is better
not to see them, then seeing them,
to let them escape: for there is not
a more dangerous and disgraceful
thing to a Common wealth, then
to make lawes, and then suffer
them to lye vnprofitable without
execution. For forreine estates,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:35"/>
their force, the natures of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
of those forces, giueth the
eie of preuention the surest iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
if their forces be of too great
strength, and to their strength
added a wise gouernour, there is
most danger: if these meete not,
no great perill when they doe: the
breeding the same ielousie in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bordering Countreys that
your selfe conceiues, is a meanes
likely to make your strength able
to encounter him, but before this
time it had beene meete to haue
foreseene this danger, there being
no surer meanes to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forreine
inuasions, then to keepe any one
from being too powerful; which is
easily done, by succouring the
weaker parts, but these are secrets
of which my writing is meere
presumption: for I hardly euer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
any of my thoughts so high as
this meditation, more lowe flyeth
<pb facs="tcp:9159:36"/>
my conceit, and to the forme of
my life more profitably, in which it
may be, my sight can cary leuell as
far as need requireth; but in these
things I am altogether purblind.</p>
               <q>Non est ad astra mollis e terris via.</q>
               <p>It is not by the way of a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
soft clothing, and delicacie;

the way to heauen: which

that shape their course through se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualitie,
call hard, is not therefore
to be shunned: for the obtayning
set apart, which we allow painefull
in the attaining, the sleightest my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
it is not hard, but easie and
pleasant, ioyned with such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
and satisfaction, as is
past the power of any pennes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing,
for it can be knowne nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb facs="tcp:9159:37"/>
nor can I say in al through

the want of examining and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our intendements, the lightest

               <p>That our actions are called, and
rightly called humane, here is the
<pb facs="tcp:9159:38"/>
reason; fortune gouernes them:
which word, though the fancy of
Poets hath giuen a bodie to, and
made her blinde, and a goddesse,
yet is she neither a goddesse, nor
a separated essence: for there are
millions of fortunes, yea as many
as there are men, euery man his
owne fortune; but the word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
chance, and by chance
wee are gouerned, for so must
they needes bee that allowe not
their designes premeditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
order: it is a shift to set vp
fortune, and the imputation of
fortunes preposterous and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
working, it is our owne
fault; since nothing commeth
from vs marshalled with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but as our sences catch vp
euery obiect destinated to their

regard: so suffer wee our selues
to ingrosse the commandements
<pb facs="tcp:9159:38"/>
of lust and appetite, to embrace
euery thing that they see, and to
deuoure poyson, so it promiseth
but sweetnes.</p>
               <p>I can not say wee goe without
meanings, but without the true
meaning I may: for superfluously
taking the suruey of things, not
penetrating the depth, wee neuer
taste of any thing but the scumme
and top of things. Hence come
the exclamations of the world, the
shipwrackes of all estates, and to
comprehend in a word that might
fill pages, all that we call calamity,
&amp; think worthy of the bewayling.</p>

may call these gifts blind, by the
meanes of the obtayning, which
<pb facs="tcp:9159:39"/>
is by aduenture or may meane
them blinde, in respect of their
impotent insufficiencies; for so
examined straightly, must I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
these iewels of the world to
be, since they bring but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,
not their vse, in which consists the
true spirit of the worthinesse of
things. Alas poore man, how art
thou deceiued, that sendes thy

ought to be the attendants of thy

things, without a minde? and that
thou hast not, for already it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted

rockes of earth, they dissoluing the
substantiall body of humanitie,
into licentiousnesse, the pride
raised from the opinion of wealth,
prodigalities, loosenesse, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
extortion. It is meete
<pb facs="tcp:9159:39"/>
here also to tell those weake esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
that glory in those blind

of feathers and winde, and suffer

or the reuerence of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
can neither finde safetie in
his estate, trueth in his subiects,
nor quiet in his mind: how can he,
safetie, since he fetcheth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
from the subiection of
inferiours? and they finding they
are vsed but for the foyles of his
magnificence, soone will they
spurne at such authoritie: for peace
and the combination of societies,
hath his originall from no other
ground, but the hope of a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
supplying each others defects:
how can he, truth in his seruants,
since himselfe is the example of

forbid those meane states the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

Lastly, the quiet of the

how can he procure the quiet

giueth it peace and rest; as the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke

from nothing else is it to bee

               </p>
               <p>The possessions of a priuate
fortune, bee they neuer so great,
and neuer so ill vsed by the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessour,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:44"/>
is but a particular harme;
the possession of authoritie in the
court of Princes, swarueth it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so little from the true bounds,
indangereth the whole state: it
little skilleth, whether a common
sayler be endued with any thing,
but strength; but if the Master or
Pilate bee not expert in his sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
rockes and tempests threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
continually their destruction;
who is exalted to this state, by
any other but his owne deserts,
<hi>Phaeton</hi>-like, maketh his ambition
purchase his owne downefall, and
the fiering of the world. Were
there in this life no more to bee
done, but the resisting the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
that the worlde casteth
vpon the height of his fortune,
doubtlesse he had much to doe; his
iudgement, his modestie, his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
should be all employed; but
with this particular care, the
<pb facs="tcp:9159:45"/>
generall care commeth accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
so is he doubly set a worke,
and more then doubly besieged
by false and deceiueable intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Vnder these two heads
marcheth the glory and danger of
the fauorites of Princes, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
not to corrupt himselfe, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
not to corrupt the state: and
first, to the first, there is nothing
that is fedde with it owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
but encreaseth and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
mightie, and at last dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
thus things combustible,
heaped vpon fire, make it grow
furious and deuouring; thus wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
assembled together beyond
the bounds appointed by nature,
conspire to ouer-runne the earth.
The eyes of the people continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
obserue vpon whome the
Prince lookes fauourably: vpon
whom hee, they, like eyes vnable
to behold the Sunne, yet louing
<pb facs="tcp:9159:45"/>
light, bend themselues to behold
the Sunnes reflection; meeteth
this with an ambitious humour, it
swelleth him, and at last bursts
him: but meeting with a discreet
modestie, hee knoweth from
whence it commeth, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
it thither againe. The loue
of the people deserued, and in
their hearts rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> caps shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, is a happie thing: but when
hee thus fauoured, cannot shew
himselfe any cause of their loue,
but his shewing them greatnesse,
it is dangerous. Princes hate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors,
and popularitie in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
seemes to bandy with the
Prince in power, of which if
Princes be suspitious, and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remoue the cause of their suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they are not to bee blamed:
for as <hi>Caesar</hi> said of the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his wife, hee did it, because
hee would not haue <hi>Caesars</hi> wife
<pb facs="tcp:9159:46"/>
somuch as suspected; well may
they diuorce from them such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
for the suspition is more
dangerous. The vpright States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
obseruing how subiect the
people are, to take ouer-kindly,
vpon the actions performed for
their good, by great men; truely
louing his Countrey, and respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
his owne health, to all these
performances, hee should intitle
his Prince, and by all meanes
draw the people to acknowledge,
from him onely commeth all their
good and preseruation: thus shall
the loue betweene the Prince and
the people growe firme, from
which issueth the flourishing of
a State; of which hee hath not
onely part, but withall receiueth
the commendations due to a
speciall limme of so fayre a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
               <p>No lesse must these beware of
<pb facs="tcp:9159:46"/>
letting their preferments out-run
their deserts; Princes will growe
wearie of giuing, to them that are
still begging, and whatsoeuer
their bounties be, yet I thinke as
Phisitions of blood-letting, which
they say takes with that, that is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
some of the vitall parts;
so with their gifts, goeth some of
their loue, and the more that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the more of their loue is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
with this, degrees of honour
must be moderated; whatsoeuer
you may haue, must not bee rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned,
but what is fitte: if sprung
from a progenie lately base and
obscure, high humours must by all
meanes be shunned, howsoeuer
borne; the safe rising, is leasure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and by degrees, so as a high for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
may not seeme strange,
and bee wondered at by the
world.</p>
               <p>When you make any suits, to
<pb facs="tcp:9159:47"/>
consider, whether it may not bee
offensiue to many, for in such
suits there is great losse and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
a moderation in pompe,
courtesie, rather for courtesies
sake them your owne, and still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all actions with your face
turned to your Prince, doing
good to the common wealth, but
desiring reputation from nobody
but your Soueraigne: howsoeuer
common men that know nothing
before effected, are gouerned by
the euent of things, yet must a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
States-man not builde his
counsels vpon these conditions:
that dangerous resolutions pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
once, do not serue the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time; from probabilitie
must he produce his aduice, and
sitting vpon his foundation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it falleth our, hee is free of
a deserued imputation: for man
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not diuine what end followeth
<pb facs="tcp:9159:47"/>
beginning, the neerest is a likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which may faile without his
fault; for to propound, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
is the destinie of man. To
beware of counselling any thing
tending to innouation, if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
ouer-valueth not the danger,
the thoughts of the vulgar, that
goeth no further commonly then
what they feele and see, the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rownes
of whose discourse, brings
them not acquainted with any
thing that they are not daylie
conuersant with, vtterly mislike
changes of importance, they that
doe not, it makes them delight in
them too much, and so is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vnsafe to most of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
               <p>Nor in the particular customes
of men of these places, doth it
become grauitie to loue change,
especially the fashions of other
countries are most dangerous,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:48"/>
by which some will coniecture ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gaine, or lightnesse, or to
those forreiners an extraordinary
affection.</p>
               <p>All affection must bee aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
not looking vpon any
thing with so true a desire of well
wishing, as vpon our countrey
and Prince.</p>
               <p>Thus shortly in generall, of
particulars to mention all, would
be too tedious; to mention some
without the whole, would be the
pourtraiture of a dismembred and
torne bodie; and to speake true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to mention all, is impossible: for
occasion begets them of infinite
formes, which when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
are to be considerately ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
without all affection, and

               <p>Behold two mothers, rich in
these possessions, in the smal space
of ten yeeres made the most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
behold <hi>Hecuba,</hi> a princesse,
in her youth made happy, with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
magnificence and principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:51"/>
accompanied with her youth:
in her age possessed of mortall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie,
of all the graces that
raigne in man, in a small space, in
lesse then a moment respecting
Eternitie, throwne from this estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
height, and made neither
princesse nor mother; thus Troy,
the famousest citie of the world
most abounding, defaced and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
and left desolate of all but
blood and ashes: this the vngo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
flattery of greatnes procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
here is powers common ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
begetting sensualities
and vnbridled appetite, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose
transitorinesse and cause of disolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               </q>
               <p>Since the mutabilitie of the
<pb facs="tcp:9159:52"/>
world is such, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world could
not be a world, nor stand, were she
not supplied by the transitorinesse
of things, resoluing one thing into
another: how can our opinions be
so forcible, as to hold any of this
rancke deare or pretious? nay, how
so monstrous, as to perswade vs to
pride; a vice full of the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
effects? for to greatnesse it
procureth hatred; to meane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
derision; to none safetie: a
lazie affection, that taketh no
pleasure, but within doores: a
pricelesse affection, for it is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
with none but our selues: an
effeminate affection, for it is still
looking in the glasse of selfe-loue:
in a word; an affection, making
vs vnsociable, and our conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
loathsome.</p>
               <p>Standing in this vncertaine
state, who would not gouerne
and prepare himselfe fitte for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
<pb facs="tcp:9159:52"/>
This cannot pride; for his
loftei behauiour and stiffe rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
thoughtes cannot nimbly
shift the fall of fortune: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a vice of all others to be shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For besides it is a sinne, and
so contrary to goodnesse; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary, must needes bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue,
in this world it is also dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
seldome going without
punishment and destruction.</p>
               <q>Inertis est nescire quid liceat

               <p>NO knowledge is vnfruitfull,
so liberally hath nature dealt
with al things: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appointed but a short course,
and the course of a general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
beeing too long, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
most pertinent to himselfe,
are to bee chosen, which hardly
<pb facs="tcp:9159:53"/>
shall he ende before his course be
ended: so much is there to be read
in himself, &amp; about himself. Farre
otherwise hath it happened with
some mindes, who thirstie ynough
of knowledge, haue fixed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directed
steppes vpon arts vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
considering the shortnes of
our liues, whose swiftnesse giues
vs warning to entertaine the most
profitable and soonest digested
knowledges, both which are
things belonging to life: otherwise
we may fall into their errors, that
die good Astronomers, and euill
men. Three are the knowledges
destinated to our vse; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our selues, the knowlege
of our fortune, the knowledge of
our countrey, when by the smart
of experience, for by counsell or
good inclination few atteine to it,
neither is it so much worth, for
that of counsaile hath too light an
<pb facs="tcp:9159:53"/>
impression, good inclinations na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
are giuen none, but to such
as are of a dull heauy disposition:
but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experience hath made vs
feele, how subiect our courses are
to errors, the best meanes is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
to make our heads take
account of our daies progressions:
this euery day, so shall not the
number of our vices confound our
memories, and make the account
difficult, nor shall this age make
them strong &amp; hard to vanquish,
the beginning of things beeing
within the compasse of curing,
their continuance incurable. At
no time is this Audit to bee better
cast vp, then when the daies circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
is finished: for in the sunnes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
the conscience dealeth not
so forcibly with our offences, but
night worketh vpon guiltines, and
in darkenes the terror of an euill
life is best seene; then also is the
<pb facs="tcp:9159:54"/>
pleasure of the sinne commonly
most remote, a time yeelding the
right opportunitie for amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for in the absence of the
pleasure, and presence of the smart
incident to that pleasure, is the
true time of conuersion.</p>
               <p>In this search and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our selues, wee must beware
of mistaking things: a thing care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to be regarded, since louing
our selues, and rich in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of names, wee seeke not
to shelter crueltie in iustice, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes
in thrift, cowardice in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence:
this flattery of our selues
is like the medicynes of wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Emperickes, which cure not,
but respit paine, which time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
the paine &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger is doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
neither must wee let the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
blindfold vs; it is an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
accompt that is taken at the
end ofthings: with the beginnings
<pb facs="tcp:9159:54"/>
let them begin, that are so valiant
as to defye fortune, for meaning
well, the euent can not bee euill:
hee that armes his intent with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
is inuincible: the trauels
guided by any other starre, howe
succesful soeuer for a time, yet end
miserably. Hauing found our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
the gallantest course is resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
the safest, shunning, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee are not priuie to all the
occurrents of the world, wee must
fetch this safetie from resistance,
and yet when wee can, to shunne
causes of prouocation.</p>
               <p>In the search of our selues,
when wee haue found some, wee
must not leaue, for wee haue
many: nor when wee haue found
many: looke no further; for
yeeres and the change of fortune,
bring with them newe dangers,
which is daily seene: many lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
youths, ending with ambitious
<pb facs="tcp:9159:55"/>
ages; many humble poore men
hauing proued tyrannicall and
proud in riches.</p>
               <p>The last of our inward inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, after the true sight of our
selues, to propound no course be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the power of our managing:
if nature hath laid greater stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
vpon my armes, then head, I will
confesse it, and frame my selfe to
bee profitable that way: if in my
head, that way; if I can not spinne,
I wil reele and bunch hempe: thus
is the fault, if there bee a fault, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and not mine, if ambition
caryeth me beyond the compasse
of vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>For our states, if there were no
body wiser then I, the Lawe of a
Common-wealth that bound e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man to follow the fortune
of his father, should bee well
thought of, so should the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
know to whom to
<pb facs="tcp:9159:55"/>
trust, and her constitution be more
setled, then the giuing euery
man his choyse, by which riches
make some lazie; pouertie some
industrious; wealth giueth esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
estimation is sought to
for their Counsaile, and their
wisedomes lye onely in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentoryes.
All this time ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is not thought of, nor their
aduices are of moment: for they
are drowned in parsimony.</p>
               <p>I like well of thrift, and that we
should know the secretes of our
fortune, howe much wee are
able to spende, and howe wee
ought to spende, in which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
not the liuing at the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most:
it is a dangerous custome,
that because a Gentleman or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and of this liuing, wee must
goe braue and entertaine all, and
saue nothing. I doe hate being at
<pb facs="tcp:9159:56"/>
the appointment of others, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to bee bound to followe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
counsaile: there is liberalitie
and charitie to performe, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man is bound to, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
which, other superfluous
costs must bee omitted: it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to keepe pouertie from star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to feast knaues: which if it
bee misliked for the vertue, shall
fit some for the thrift: fortie shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
goeth further amongst the
poore, then doubled spent in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
the rich.</p>
               <p>More of this I will not treat of,
but onely to restraine our mindes
from looking licorishly vpon any
other estate, then that our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
liued in: for besides that the
shortnesse of our life giues vs not
leasure, hauing businesse of more
importance to dispatch first, it
beeing better to bee an honest
<pb facs="tcp:9159:56"/>
man then a great man, it is too
dearely bought: for as fast as they
pursue promotion, danger, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
and death pursue them, and
not one amongst numbers but is
ouertaken.</p>
               <p>I do not so often pray for raine
and fayre weather, as I doe that
my countrey men should deserue
it: for we are fallen into the iawes
of the Prouerbe, <hi>Better fed, then
taught:</hi> an error that will fall foule
vpon the higher degrees: for spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
generally of the multitude;
they are a people tractable, and
ready ynough to bee better then
they are, if taught, which they can
not receiue by their education, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their pouertie empoyl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
about other businesse: they that
may, should giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the short and
sure precepts of good example,
and so the ones education shall
shew it self answerable to his birth,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:57"/>
the other bee recompenced for
their obedience, by beeing instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the rules of life.</p>
               <p>Many times I haue thought of
these degrees of state; of them wee
cal noble and ignoble: and though
my opinion iumpe with the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of degrees and titles, yet am
I sory that the rewardes of the
promoted should bee an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the deserts separated:
but in such a state is this earth, that
the fauour of time and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is abused, and the smiles
of fortune nourisheth the worst
counsaile.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
a booke worthy to bee read
with attention, consisteth in these
diuersities; her Commodities,
her Situation, her people: though
I doubt not but nature proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
euery Countrey of sufficient
prouision for her owne burthen,
<pb facs="tcp:9159:57"/>
yet hath the delicacie of man stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
with nature, that hee might
want: so are our minds like emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
caskes; as they full of winde,
so we ful of windie wishes: and all
like women with childe, like no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what is hard to come
by. Of the commodities, the
best is bullion and munition, the
worst clothes and victuall: so may
I say for our kingdome, the worst
commodities that enter it being
the foode of wantonnesse, not of
necessitie, and clothes: the other
borrowed superfluitie, wee haue
little need of, our owne countrey
yeelding attire both coole and
warme: for these, wee part with
marchandize of no lesse impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and some of more; but this
is now to bee talked of onely: for
time hath made it vnalterable,
onely the excesse is to be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and those things able to bee
<pb facs="tcp:9159:58"/>
dangerous, carefully to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
lest we make our Countrey
so vnhappie, as to beare children
that will ruine her. The Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
knowne, recompenseth the
knowledge, with beeing able to
prouide against all inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
as to fitte our diets to the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
our forces to the strength,
our spendings and commings in:
Thus shortly and generally for
the particularitie, it must come
from the nominating the place.
The knowledge of the peoples
natures, is of much importance,
both in the vsing them vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and applying lawes to
them: both which cannot bee
rightly executed, without first
their natures be knowne &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.
Thus important is the
knowledge of our selues, and
those thinges belonging to our
selues, which who neglecteth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
<pb facs="tcp:9159:58"/>
the Tragedians title, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a creature altogether vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and vnworthie.</p>

               </q>
               <p>So are we gouerned by our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
as our intents speake in
face: so vngouerned are our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as what they would shun,
they run into; they see but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and beholding nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing else, doe like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
easily discouering what
they wish most secret. It is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the minde onely, that is
able to see and shunne danger at
once, the others see it not with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
but feare, whose nature
wisheth a dispatch without regard,
whether it be with a cut throat or
safetie; feares furthest with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but to bee out of his paine.
<pb facs="tcp:9159:59"/>
Since these affections are so fixed
to men, as there is no man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them; since the suppressing of
them is so rare, as hardly it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to any man, there is no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
almost, that can escape a wise
obseruation; for hee is ledde to
them, by them that seeke most to
keepe them in couert: like vnto
the care that other creatures haue
of their young ones, which care
carieth their pursuer to their nest
or caue. For bee it an attempt,

Which excellent guide of our

               <p>No where hath affection that
power, nor any where doe they
display themselues so openly, as
the affection of parents to their
children; they were begotten by
affection, and by affection they
are maintained: for let them bee
how they will, though deformed
both in minde and bodie, yet will
they finde a louelinesse in their
out-blemishes, and tolerate their
inward; which if nature hath not
appointed to keepe the increase of
the world from miscarrying, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
it is a fault: for sincere
trueth alloweth nothing that
<pb facs="tcp:9159:61"/>
cannot produce the graces of the
mind for euidence. It becommeth
parents mourning, to speake in
no other fashion: it becommeth
parents that will bee parents and
wise, not to mourne at all; for
there is no more allowed to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

of the exact commandements of
wisedome, causes stand all in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
there is none neerer or

and the defectiue part of our

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we say are in calamitie:

               <p>Warre is the remedy for a

yet is it better knowen then

the vitiousnesse of man, so plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as this, vndertaking courses so
desperately and vainely, as if his
intent were nothing els, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<pb facs="tcp:9159:63"/>
his sinnes. I see offendors
dayly, and they see the shame and
bitternesse of punishment, yet can
not this perswade them; so that I
cannot say, looking into their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
without all respect but
of their gaine and losse, that euer
I sawe any, whose profit could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
their losse.</p>
               <p>Omitting petty matters, in
that execrable wickednes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
against Princes, I wonder
not that such intendements finde
Heads; for the profit of the gayne
may corrupt men: but how the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
limmes are drawne in, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
for they aduenture as much
as the principall, and let his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
come to passe, are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of their reward, yea, of their
life: for such benefites that are not
easily to bee recompenced, are as
dangerous as iniuries. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:9159:63"/>
then, and either these men
flatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with vaine hopes,
strengthning which with their
will, they resist the more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
discourse, or els heat with the
allurement of some affection, run
into them without al examination;
both of which are so dangerous,
as the day of vndertaking such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
they may, without being
deceiued in their computation,
reckon the day of their ruine: for
it is hard to iudge of which side he
is in most danger, but of one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doutedly
he shall perish.</p>
               <p>In this and in all other the
gaine is vncertaine, the euill
certaine, which (mee thinkes)
should alone perswade vs, and
make all wickednesse despised:
were the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, For the losse of
the one, here is the other, we were
neerer temptation: but the eternal
<pb facs="tcp:9159:64"/>
goodnesse hath remoued it further
off, I doubt not, to no other end,
but to withdrawe all occasions
meete to nourish the corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of our natures, by which
if wee will not yet take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but hunt out vice hidden
from vs, wee are vnworthie of
pitie, yea, of the common pitie,
that followeth the alreadie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</p>
               <q>Ferre, quam sortem patiuntur omnes,
nemo recusat.—</q>
               <p>WEe haue nothing formed
in the true moulde, wee
carrie sometimes actions bearing
a handsome glosse, but they are
no neerer trueth, then a picture
the life: what wee should fetch
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnderstanding the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
of things, wee draw fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
<pb facs="tcp:9159:64"/>
marrow-fretting sore of enuie; so
what might bee a vertue by the
suffering, is a vice: for not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for the true cause, and the
strength enduring aduersitie, is
not patience, since patience is
founded in the true discourse of
the minde, this fetcht from the
sight of others miseries. Euery
particular bodie feeles his owne
affliction: the affliction of others
is no medicine curing his; yet
from the aduerse fortune of others
can wee drawe comfort: what
helpes it vs to be richly indowed
with reason, since we vse nothing
but fancie? for this is fancie, and
this is so in most things, being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
vp and downe with her light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
without all rest and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manencie.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9159:65"/>
Ferre, quam sortem patiuntur omnes,
nemo recusat.—</q>
               <p>What all suffers, no bodie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
to suffer: no more should we
what we allow; there is this onely
good to be had in aduersitie; the
obseruation how it befel: if by our
owne negligence, it begettes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
if past our knowledge,
so much resistance as leades to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
is allowed; but repining
and sorrow, vnprofitable vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
rather stirring the diuine
powers to a more sharpe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then mitigating the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.
There is nothing in this
world erected so high as man; so
nothing more subiect to fall: there
is nothing so ill as man; therefore
more due to him, then to any: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so sensible; therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more apt to feele affliction:
<pb facs="tcp:9159:65"/>
and as for Chance and Fortune,
they are words founded vpon two
reasons, sometimes in excuse,
when we lay our deserued afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vpon fortune: sometimes
when the diuine executions are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
mans, which though we call
chance, yet doubtlesse is founded
vpon grounds of more excellent
reason, then we can apprehend: so
is chance the issue of follie or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
