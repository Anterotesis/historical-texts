            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EMinent Wit, Sir, no more than Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Beauty, can eſcape the Trouble and Preſumption of Addreſſes; and that which can ſtrike every body with Wonder, can never avoid the Praiſe which naturally flows from that Wonder: And Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is forc'd to hear the Addreſſes as well as Praiſes of the Poor as Rich, of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as Learned, and takes, nay rewards, the officious, tho' perhaps impertinent Zeal of its least qualify'd Devotees. Wherefore, Sir, tho' your Merits meet with the Applauſe of the Learned and Witty, yet your Generoſity will judge favourably of the untaught Zeal of an humbler Admirer, ſince what I do your eminent Vertues compel. The Beautiful will
<pb facs="tcp:39420:3"/>
permit the most deſpicable of their Admirers to love them, tho' they never intend to make him happy, as unworthy their Care, but they will not be angry at the fatal Effect of their own Eyes.</p>
            <p>But what I want in my ſelf, Sir, to merit your Regard, I hope my Authoreſs will in ſome meaſure ſupply, ſo far at least to leſſen my Preſumption in prefixing your Name to a Poſthumous Piece of hers, whom all the Men of Wit, that were her Contemporaries, look'd on as the Wonder of her Sex; and in none of her Performances has ſhe ſhew'd ſo great a Maſtery as in her Novels, where Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prevails; and if they are not true, they are ſo like it, that they do the buſineſs every jot as well.</p>
            <p>This I hope, Sir, will induce you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my Preſumption in dedicating this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to you, and declaring my ſelf,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>FRankwit</hi> and <hi>Wildvill</hi> were two young Gentlemen of very conſiderable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, both born in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and during their minority, both educated together, by which opportunity they contracted a very inviolable Friendſhip, a Friendſhip which grew up with them; and though it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably known to every body elſe, they knew it not themſelves; they never made profeſſion of it in words, but actions; ſo true a warmth their fires could boaſt, as needed not the effuſion of their breath to make it live. <hi>Wildvill</hi> was of the richeſt Family, but <hi>Frankwit</hi> of the nobleſt; <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> was admired for outward qualifications, as ſtrength, and manly proportions, <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit</hi> for a much ſofter beauty, for his inward endowments, pleaſing in his converſation, of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39420:5"/>
a free, and moving air, humble in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and if he had any pride, it was but juſt enough to ſhew that he did not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect humility, his mind bowed with a motion as unconſtrained as his body, nor did he force this virtue in the leaſt, but he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it only; ſo aimable he was, that every Virgin that had Eyes, knew too ſhe had a Heart, and knew as ſurely ſhe ſhould loſe it. His <hi>Cupid</hi> could not be reputed blind, he never ſhot for him, but he was ſure to wound. As every other Nymph admired him, ſo he was dear to all the Tuneful Siſters, the Muſes were fired with him as much as their own radiant God <hi>Apollo</hi>; not their loved Springs and Fountains were ſo grateful to their eyes as he, him they eſteemed their <hi>Helicon</hi> and <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> too; in ſhort, when ever he pleaſed, he could enjoy them all. Thus he ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd the whole Female Sex, but amongſt all the ſighing captives of his Eyes, <hi>Belvira</hi> only boaſted charms to move him, her parents lived near his, and even from their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they felt mutual Love, as if their Eyes at their firſt meeting had ſtruck out ſuch glances as had kindled into am'rous flame. And now <hi>Belvira</hi> in her fourteenth year, (when the freſh ſpring of young virginity began to caſt more lively bloomings in her Cheeks, and ſofter longings in her Eyes) by her indulgent Father's care was ſent to <hi>London</hi> to a Friend, her Mother being lately dead: When, as if fortune ordered it ſo, <hi>Frankwit</hi>'s Father took a journey to the other
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39420:5"/>
World, to let his Son the better enjoy the pleaſures and delights of this: the young Lover now with all imaginable haſte interred his Father, nor did he ſhed ſo many Tears for his loſs as might in the leaſt quench the Fires, which he received from his <hi>Belvira</hi>'s Eyes, but (maſter of ſeventeen hundred pounds a year, which his Father left him) with all the Wings of Love he flys to <hi>London,</hi> and ſollicits <hi>Belvira</hi> with ſuch fervency, that it might be thought he meant Deaths Torch ſhould kindle <hi>Hymen</hi>'s; and now as ſoon as he arrives at his Journeys end, he goes to pay a viſit to the fair Miſtreſs of his Soul, and aſſures her, that tho he was abſent from her, yet ſhe was ſtill with him; and that all the Road he Travell'd her beauteous Image danced before him, and like the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed Prophet, he ſaw his Deity in every Buſh; in ſhort, he paid her conſtant viſits, the Sun ne're roſe, or ſet, but ſtill he ſaw it in her company, and every minute of the day he counted by his ſighs ſo inceſſantly he importuned her that ſhe could no longer hold out, and was pleaſed in the ſurrender of her heart, ſince it was he was Conqueror, and therefore felt a triumph in her yielding; their Flames now joyned, grew more and more, glowed in their Cheeks, and lightened in their glances; eager they looked, as there were pulſes beating in their Eyes; and all endearing, at laſt ſhe vowed, that <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit</hi> living ſhe would ne're be any other mans; thus they paſt on ſome time, while every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39420:6"/>
day rowled over fair, Heaven ſhowed an aſpect all ſerene, and the Sun ſeemed to ſmile at what was done; he ſtill careſſed his charmer with an innocence becoming his ſincerity, he lived upon her tender breath, and basked in the bright luſtre of her Eyes, with pride, and ſecret joy.</p>
            <p>He ſaw his Rivals languiſh for that bliſs, thoſe charms, thoſe rapturous and extatick tranſports which he engroſſed alone. But now ſome eighteen months (ſome ages in a lovers Kalendar) winged with delights, and fair <hi>Belvira</hi> now grown fit for riper joys, knows hardly how ſhe can deny her preſſing lover and herſelf to crown their vows, and joyn their hands as well as hearts. All this while the young Gallant waſh'd himſelf clean of that ſhining dirt, his Gold; he fancied little of Heaven dwelt in his yellow Angels, but let them fly away as it were on their own Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wings, he only valued the ſmiling Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies in <hi>Belvira</hi>'s Eyes. His generoſity was boundleſs as his Love, for no man ever truly loved that was not generous. He thought his Eſtate like his paſſion, was a ſort of a Pontick Ocean, it could never know an Ebb: but now he found it could be fathom'd, and that the Tide was turning, therefore he ſollicits with more impatience, the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their joy<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ames immediately to Heaven; and now at laſt it was agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that they ſhould both be one, but not without ſome reluctancy on the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male

ſide, for 'tis the humour of our Sex, to deny moſt eagerly thoſe grants to Lovers, for which moſt tenderly we ſigh: ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory are we to our ſelves, as if the Deity had made us with a ſeeming reluctancy to his own deſigns, placing as much diſcords in our minds, as there is harmony in our faces. We are a ſort of aiery Clouds, whoſe Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flaſh out one way, and the Thunder another. Our words and thoughts can ne're agree. So, this young charming Lady thought her deſires could live in their own longings, like Miſers wealth-devouring Eyes; and e're ſhe conſented to her Lover, prepared him firſt with ſpeaking looks, and then with a fore-running ſigh, applyed to the dear charmer thus: <hi>Frankwit, I am afraid to venture the Matrimonal bondage, it may make you think your ſelf too much confined, in being only free to one.</hi> Ah! my dear <hi>Belvira,</hi> he replyed, that one, like Manna, has the taſte of all, why ſhould I be diſpleaſed to be confined to Paradice, when it was the curſe of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers to be ſet at large, tho they had the whole World to roam in: You have, my Love, ubiquitary charms, and you are all in all, in every part. <hi>Ay but,</hi> reply'd <hi>Belviria, we are all like perfumes, and too continual ſmelling makes us ſeem to have loſt our Sweets, I<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39420:7"/>
her fifty thouſand pound in Money, and ſome Eſtate in Land; but, poor creature, ſhe was blind to all theſe riches, having been born without the uſe of ſight, though in all other reſpects charming to a wonder.) <hi>Indeed, ſays</hi> Celeſia, (for ſhe ſaw clearly in her mind) <hi>I admire you ſhould ask my judgment in ſuch a caſe, where I have never had the leaſt experience; but I believe it is but a ſickly ſoul which cannot nouriſh its Off-ſpring of deſires without preying upon the body.</hi> Believe me, reply'd <hi>Frankwit,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail your want of ſight, and I could almoſt wiſh you my own eyes for a moment, to view your charming Couſin, where you would ſee ſuch Beauties as are too dazzling to be long beheld; and if too daringly you gazed, you would feel the misfortune of the loſs of ſight, much greater than the want on't; and you would acknowledge, that in too preſumptuouſly ſeeing, you would be blinder then, than now unhappily you are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ah! I muſt confeſs,</hi> reply'd Belvira, <hi>my poor dear Couſin is blind, for I fancy ſhe bears too great an eſteem for</hi> Frankwit, <hi>and only longs for ſight to look on him.</hi> Indeed, reply'd <hi>Celeſia,</hi> I would be glad to ſee <hi>Frankwit,</hi> for I fancy he's as dazzling as he but now deſcrib'd his Miſtreſs, and if I fancy I ſee him, ſure I do ſee him, for ſight is fancy, is it not? or do you feel my Couſin with your Eyes? <hi>This is indeed, a charming blindneſs, reply'd</hi> Frankwit, <hi>and the fancy of your ſight excels the certainty of ours; ſtrange! that there ſhould be ſuch glances even in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39420:7"/>
blindneſs? You, fair Maid, require not Eyes to conquer, if your night has ſuch Stars, what Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine would your day of ſight have, if ever you ſhould ſee?</hi> I fear thoſe Stars you talk of, ſaid <hi>Belvira,</hi> have ſome influence on you, and by the compaſs you ſail by now, I gueſs you are ſteering to my Couſin. She is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed charming enough to have been another Off-ſpring of bright <hi>Venus,</hi> blind like her Brother <hi>Cupid. That</hi> Cupid, <hi>reply'd</hi> Celeſia, <hi>I am afraid has ſhot me, for methinks I would not have you marry</hi> Frankwit, <hi>but rather live as you do without the leaſt Enjoyment, for methinks if he were marry'd, he would be more out of my ſight than he already is.</hi> Ah!

(reply'd the Bride to be) it is that very lulling wakes you; Women enjoy'd, are like Romances read, or Raree-ſhows once ſeen, meer tricks of the ſlight of hand, which, when found out, you only wonder at your ſelves for wondering ſo before at them.

endears the bleſſing; heaven would not be heaven, could we tell what 'tis. When the Plot's out you have done with the Play, and when the laſt Act's done, you ſee the Curtain drawn with great indifferency. <hi>O my</hi> Belvira, <hi>anſwered</hi> Frankwit, <hi>that expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were indeed a Monſter which enjoyment could not ſatisfy; I ſhould take no pleaſure</hi> he rejoin'd, <hi>running from hill to hill, like Children chaſing that Sun which I could never catch.</hi> O thou ſhalt have it then, that Sun of Love, reply'd <hi>Belvira,</hi> fir'd by this complaint, and gently ruſh'd into his arms, (rejoyning,) ſo <hi>Phaebus</hi> ruſhes radiant, and unfullied into a gilded Cloud. <hi>Well then, my dear</hi> Belvira, anſwer'd Frankwit, <hi>be aſſured I ſhall be ever yours, as you are mine; fear not you ſhall never draw Bills of love upon me ſo faſt as I ſhall wait in readineſs to pay them; but now I talk of Bills, I muſt retire into</hi> Cambridgeſhire, <hi>where I have a ſmall concern as yet unmortgaged, I will return thence with a brace of thouſand pounds within a week at fartheſt, with which our Nuptials by their celebration ſhall be worthy of our love.

In ſhort, after a great many ſoft vows, and promiſes of an inviolable faith, they parted with a pompous ſort of pleaſing woe; their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39420:8"/>
concern was of ſuch a mixture of joy and ſadneſs, as the weather ſeems, when it both rains and ſhines. And now the laſt, the very laſt of laſt adieu's was over, for the farewels of Lovers hardly ever end, and <hi>Frankwit</hi> (the time being Summer) reach'd <hi>Cambridge</hi> that night, about nine a clock; (ſtrange! that he ſhould have make ſuch haſte to fly from what ſo much he lov'd!) and now, tir'd with the fatigue of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he thought fit to refreſh himſelf by writing ſome few lines to his belov'd <hi>Belvira</hi>; for a little Verſe after the dull proſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ſervant, was as great an eaſe to him, (from whom it flow'd as naturally and unartificially, as his love or his breath) as a pace or hand-gallop, after a hard, uncouth, and rugged trot.

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:39420:10"/>When this Letter was written, it was ſtrait ſhown to <hi>Celeſia,</hi> who lookt upon any thing that belong'd to <hi>Frankwit</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing glances; ſo eagerly ſhe perus'd it, that her tender eyes beginning to water, ſhe cry'd out, (fancying ſhe ſaw the words dance before her view) Ah! Couſin, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, your Letter is running away, ſure it can't go itſelf to <hi>Frankwit</hi>? A great deal of other pleaſing innocent things ſhe ſaid, but ſtill her eyes flow'd more bright with lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous beams, as if they were to ſhine out; now all that glancing radiancy which had been ſo long kept ſecret, and as if, as ſoon as the cloud of blindneſs once was broke, nothing but lightnings were to flaſh for ever after. Thus in mutual diſcourſe they ſpent their hours, while <hi>Frankwit</hi> was now raviſhed with the receipt of this charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwer of <hi>Belvira</hi>'s, and bleſt his own eyes which diſcovered to him the much welcome news of fair <hi>Celeſia</hi>'s. Often he reads the Letter o're and o're, but there his fate lay hid, for 'twas that very fondneſs proved his ruin. He lodg'd at a Couſin's Houſe of his, and there, (it being a private family) lodged likewiſe a Blackamoor Lady, then a Widow; a whimſical Knight had taken a fancy to enjoy her; <hi>enjoy her did I ſay? enjoy the Devil in the fleſh at once</hi>? I know not how it was, but he would fain have been a bed with her, but ſhe not conſenting on unlawful terms, <hi>(but ſure all terms are with her unlawful)</hi> the Knight ſoon marry'd her,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39420:10"/>
as if there were not hell enough in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but he muſt wed the Devil too. The Knight a little after died, and left this Lady of his (whom I ſhall call <hi>Moorea</hi>) an Eſtate of ſix thouſand pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> Now this <hi>Moorea</hi> obſerved the joyous <hi>Frankwit</hi> with an eager look, her Eyes ſeemed like Stars of the firſt magnitude glaring in the night; ſhe greatly importuned him to diſcover the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his tranſport, but he denying it, (as 'tis the humour of our Sex) made her the more inquiſitive; and being jealous that it was from a Miſtreſs, employ'd her Maid to ſteal it, and if ſhe found it ſuch to bring it her; accordingly it ſucceeded, for <hi>Frankwit</hi> having drank hard with ſome of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that Shire, found himſelf indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and ſoon went to Bed, having put the Letter in his pocket: The Maid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Moorea</hi> contrived that all the other Servants ſhould be out of the way, that ſhe might plauſibly officiate in the warming the bed of the indiſpoſed Lover, but likely, had it not been ſo, ſhe had warmed it by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties in a more natural manner; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in bed in an inner Room, ſhe ſlips out the Letter from his pocket, carries it to her Miſtreſs to read, and ſo reſtores it whence ſhe had it; in the morning the poor Lover wakened in a violent Fever, burning with a fire more hot than that of Love. In ſhort, he continued ſick a conſiderable while, all which time the Lady <hi>Moorea</hi> conſtantly viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and he as unwillingly ſaw her (poor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39420:11"/>
Gentleman) as he would have ſeen a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for as the latter would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, ſo the former ſcared him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. In the mean while, during his ſickneſs, ſeveral Letters were ſent to him by his Dear <hi>Belvira,</hi> and <hi>Celeſia</hi> too, (then learning to write) had made a ſhift to give him a line or two in Poſtſcript with her Couſin, but all was intercepted by the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the Black <hi>Moorea,</hi> black in her mind, and dark, as well as in her body. <hi>Frankwit</hi> too writ ſeveral Letters as he was able, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of her unkindneſs, thoſe likewiſe were all ſtopt by the ſame Blackmoor Devil. At laſt, it happened that <hi>Wildvill,</hi> (who I told my Reader was <hi>Frankwit</hi>'s friend) came to <hi>London,</hi> his Father likewiſe dead, and now Maſter of a very plentiful fortune, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to marry, and paying a viſit to <hi>Belvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> enquires of her, concerning <hi>Frankwit,</hi> ſhe all in mourning for the loſs, told him his friend was dead. Ah! <hi>Wildvill,</hi> he is dead, ſaid ſhe, and died not mine, a Blackmoor Lady had bewitched him from me; I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Letter lately which informed me all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was no name ſubſcribed to it, but it intimated, that it was written at the requeſt of dying <hi>Frankwit.</hi> Oh! I am ſorry at my ſoul, ſaid <hi>Wildvill,</hi> for I loved him with the beſt, the deareſt friendſhip; no doubt then, rejoyned he, 'tis Witchcraft indeed that could make him falſe to you; what delight could he take in a Blackmoor Lady, tho ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him at once with a ſoul as open as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39420:11"/>
her longing arms, and with her Petticoat put off her modeſty. Gods! How could he change a whole <hi>Field argent</hi> into down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Sables.</hi> 'Twas done, returned <hi>Celeſia,</hi> with no ſmall blot, I fancy to the Female Scutcheon. In ſhort, after ſome more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but very ſorrowful, <hi>Wildvill</hi> takes his leave, extreamly taken with the fair <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira,</hi> more beauteous in her cloud of woe; he paid her afterwards frequent viſits, and found her wonder for the odd inconſtancy of <hi>Frankwit,</hi> greater than her ſorrow, ſince he dy'd ſo unworthy of her. <hi>Wildvill</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd her with all the force of vig'rous love, and ſhe (as ſhe thought) fully convinc'd of <hi>Frankwit</hi>'s death, urg'd by the fury and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of her new ardent Lover, ſoon ſurrender'd, and the day of their Nuptials now arriv'd, their hands were joyn'd. In the mean time <hi>Frankwit,</hi> (for he ſtill liv'd) knew nothing of the injury the baſe <hi>Moorea</hi> practic'd, knew not that 'twas thro her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate order, that the fore-mention'd account of his falſhood and his death was ſent; but impatient to ſee his Dear <hi>Bolvira,</hi> tho yet extremely weak, rid poſt to <hi>London,</hi> and that very day arriv'd there, immediately after the Nuptials of his Miſtreſs and his Friend were celebrated. I was at this time in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and having ſome ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with this Blackamoor Lady, and ſitting in her Room that evening, after <hi>Frankwit</hi>'s departure thence, in <hi>Moorea</hi>'s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſaw inadvertently a bundle of Papers,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39420:12"/>
which ſhe had gathered up, as I ſuppoſe, to burn, ſince now they grew but uſeleſs, ſhe having no further hopes of him; I fancy'd I knew the hand, and thence my curioſity only led me to ſee the name, and finding <hi>Belvira</hi> ſubſcrib'd, I began to gueſs there was ſome foul play in hand, <hi>Belvira</hi> being my particularly intimate acquaintance: I read one of them, and finding the contents, convey'd them all ſecretly out with me, as I thought, in point of juſtice I was bound, and ſent them to <hi>Belvira</hi> by that night's Poſt; ſo that they came to her hands ſoon after the minute of her Marriage, with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how, and by what means I came to light on them. No doubt but they exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſurpriz'd her: but Oh! Much more ſhe grew amaz'd immediately after, to ſee the poor, and now unhappy <hi>Frankwit</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who privately had enquir'd for her below, being received as a ſtranger, who ſaid he had ſome urgent buſineſs with her in a back Chamber below ſtairs. What Tongue, what Pen can expreſs the mournful ſorrow of this Scene: At firſt they both ſtood dumb, and almoſt ſenſeleſs; ſhe took him for the Ghoſt of <hi>Frankwit</hi>; he looked ſo pale, new riſen from his ſickneſs, he (for he had heard at his entrance in the Houſe, that his <hi>Belvira</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd <hi>Wildvil</hi>) ſtood in a maze, and like a Ghoſt indeed, wanted the power to ſpeak, till ſpoken to the firſt. At laſt, he draws his Sword, deſigning there to fall upon it in her preſence; ſhe then imagining it his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39420:12"/>
Ghoſt too ſure, and come to kill her, ſhrieks out and ſwoons; he ran immediately to her, and catch'd her in his arms, and while he ſtrove to revive and bring her to herſelf, tho that he thought could never now be done, ſince ſhe was marry'd, <hi>Wildvill</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Bride, and hearing the loud ſhriek, came running down, and entring the Room, ſees his Bride lye claſpt in <hi>Frankwit</hi>'s arms, Ha! Traytor! He crys out, drawing his Sword with an impatient fury, have you kept that Strumpet all this while, curſt <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit,</hi> and now think fit to put your damn'd caſt Miſtreſs upon me; could not you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear her neither ev'n on my wedding day? Abominable Wretch! Thus ſaying, he made awfull paſs at <hi>Frankwit,</hi> and run him thro the left arm, and quite thro the Body of the poor <hi>Belvira</hi>; that thruſt immediately made her ſtart, tho <hi>Frankwit</hi>'s endeavours all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were uſeleſs. Strange! that her death reviv'd her! for ah! ſhe felt that now ſhe only liv'd to dye! ſtriving thro wild amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to run from ſuch a Scene of horror, as her apprehenſions-ſhew'd her; down ſhe dropt, and <hi>Frankwit</hi> ſeeing her fall, (all friendſhip diſannull'd by ſuch a chain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries) draws, fights with, and ſtabs his own lov'd <hi>Wildvill.</hi> Ah! who can expreſs the horror and diſtraction of this fatal miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding! the Houſe was alarm'd, and in came poor <hi>Celeſia,</hi> running in confuſion juſt as <hi>Frankwit</hi> was off'ring to kill himſelf, to dye with a falſe friend, and perjur'd Miſtreſs,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39420:13"/>
for he ſuppos'd them ſuch. Poor <hi>Celeſia</hi> now bemoan'd her unhappineſs of ſight, and wiſh'd ſhe again were blind. <hi>Wildvill</hi> dy'd immediately, and <hi>Belvira</hi> only ſurviv'd him long enough to unfold all their moſt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fate, deſiring <hi>Frankwit</hi> with her dying breath, if ever he lov'd her, (and now ſhe ſaid that ſhe deſerv'd his love, ſince ſhe had convinc'd him that ſhe was not falſe) to marry her poor dear <hi>Celeſia,</hi> and love her tenderly for her <hi>Belvira</hi>'s ſake; leaving her, being her neareſt Relation, all her fortune, and he, much dearer than it all, to be added to her own; ſo joyning his and <hi>Celeſia</hi>'s Hands, ſhe pour'd her laſt breath upon his Lips, and ſaid, Dear <hi>Frankwit, Frankwit,</hi> I dye yours. With tears and wondrous ſorrow he promis'd to obey her Will, and in ſome months after her interrment, he perform'd his promiſe.</p>
