         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The vnerpected pleasure of which game, stayed me til a youth of eighteene or twenty yéeres of age, tall of stature, of a good aspect, well proportioned, tough line wed, and of a strong constitution, beating and crying out vpon the doggs tooke the poore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>dde fro forth their mouthes, and gaue it to a pesaunt attending on him, that laid it on his shoulders, and at a beck of the youth gat him swiftly on before. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the young man turning towards me said. Tell me sir of courtesie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whither is your iourney? I would to <hi>Vercellis</hi> (quoth I) this euening if the time woulde giue mee leaue. You might happily get thither (ꝙ he) were it not that the Riuer that runneth before the Cittie, and that deuideth the confines of <hi>Piemount</hi> from those of <hi>Millan,</hi> is so ouerflowen
<pb facs="tcp:18754:8"/>
that you can hardlie passe it, so that I would aduise you, if it please you, to lodge with me this euening: for not far hence neere that Riuer, I haue a little Cottage, where you may repose your selfe with lesse disease then in any other place nigh thereabouts. Whilst he thus spake I stedfastly beheld him, and me thought I perceiued in his very countenaunce a kind of gentilitie and grace, so that (iudging him to be of no base or meane condicion) séeing him a foote, giuing my Horse to a hyreling that came with me, I dismounted. Thereupon (quoth he) you shall aduise your selfe yonder on the Ryuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, whether you were better to passe on or staie: and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I goe before, not to arrogat anie superioritie, but as your guide, because perhaps you are not well acquainted with the waie. Fortune (quoth I) doth fauour mee with too noble a conduct. God graunt in other things she shewe her selfe as prosperous. Héere I became silent, and I folowed him, but he regarded oft, and often ouerlooked, and looked on me as if he were desirous it séemd to vnderstande of whence I was: so that I preuented his desire, and in some sort to satis-fie him, said I was neuer till nowe in this Countrey, but heretofore going into <hi>Fraunce</hi> I past by <hi>Pyemount,</hi> how beit I repent me not that I came this waie, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is very pleasant, and inhabited of people passing cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. Héere perceiuing that I ministred occasion of speech, he could no longer hide what he desired, but sayd.</p>
                  <p>Tell me I pray you, what are you, what Countreyman, and what good fortune ledde you into these parts? I was borne (quoth I) in <hi>Naples,</hi> a famous Cittie of <hi>Italie,</hi> my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> my father of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> a Cittye scituate in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> my name and surname I conceale, for they are so obscure, as if I should report them, yet you coulde not be the more enformed of my state. The wrath of Fortune and of mightie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I shun, howbeit I am eftsoones shrowded vnder the the estate of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> Under a magnanimous, iust, and gratious Prince you soiourne then (quoth he.) But mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destlie remembring that I desired to conceale some part of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18754:8"/>
mine estate, he enquired no further of me. Wee had nowe walked little more then halfe a mile, but wee ariued on the side of the Ryuer, swifter then which, neuer ranne arrowe fro forth the strongest bow of <hi>Parthia:</hi> and it was swoln so high, as it farre surpast the wonted limmits, neither coulde it be contained in the compasse whereunto it was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And it was tolde me by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Countreymen commorants there, that the <hi>Passador</hi> woulde not put off from the other side, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> (vpon what occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knew not) he had refused to waft ouer some French Gentlemen, that would haue gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen more then ordinary for their passage. Whereupon, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the youth that was my guide, I said. That necessity now bound me to accept his courtesie, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I had not yet determined to refuse: albeit I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acknowledge this fauaur procéeding from your owne disposition then from Fortune. It pleaseth me notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that she hath wrought it in such sort as wee shall haue no néede to doubt of your abode.</p>
                  <p>Thus more and more he confirmed mine opinion, that he was neither of ignoble birth nor meane capacitie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon content to be consorted with so well accomplished an Hoste: (ꝙ I) the sooner you shall please that I receiue the fauour to be lodged, the more shall I accept of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he ledde me to his house that was not farre situate from the Riuerside, and it was as high as on the outside we might easily perceiue it comprehended diuers roomes and stories one aboue another. Before the house there was a little Court enuironed with Trées, and there they ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by double staires which were without the Gate, eyther of them containing fiue and twentie large &amp; moste commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious steps. On the top of the staires we entred into a faire Hall, foure square &amp; of conuenient greatnes, for it had two porthals on the right, and two on the left side, and as manie in the vpper end. Directlie against the Gate whereby wee entred, was there another Gate, and thereby we descended by as manie other steps into a little Court, about the which
<pb facs="tcp:18754:9"/>
were prettie lodgings for seruaunts, and houses for Corne, and thence we past into a Garden large enough, and filled with fruitfull Trees, verie orderlie and artificially disposed. The Hall was furnished with hangings and euery other ornament beséeming the lodging of a Gentleman. In the midst thereof was the Table couered, and the Cupboorde charged with curious plates of <hi>Candie,</hi> furnished with all sorts of daintie fruits. Faire and passing well placed (quoth I) is this goodlie house, and it can not be possest but of some noble Gentleman, who though amongst the woods and in a Countrey Towne, lets not yet to imitate the delica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>y and neatenes of the Cittie, but are you the Lord thereof? Not I (quoth he) my Father is, whom God graunt a long life, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denie I him to be a Gentleman of the Cittie, or vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in Courte or on the worldes conditions, albeit he hath spent the greater part of his time in the Countrey, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a Brother that hath long béene a Courtier in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that yet abideth there, highlie fauoured of the good Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Vercellis,</hi> whose valour and authoritie in these quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters highly are accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of. And in what part of <hi>Europe</hi> and of <hi>Italie,</hi> (quoth I) is that good Cardinall knowne and not accounted of.</p>
                  <p>Thus as we were reasoning, there mette vs another youth of lesse yéeres, but no lesse gentle spirit, that brought worde of his Fathers comming, who eftsoones was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from surueighing his possessions. And anon there came the Father on horsebacke attended with a footeman, and an other seruitor that rode before, who dismounted, immediatly came vp the staires. He was a man of midle age, yet neerer thréescore then fiftie: of countenance verie pleasant, myxed with comelie grauitie, and by the whitnes of his hayre and beard (that only made him séeme old) his dignity was much augmented. I framing my passage towardes the good man and maister of the house, saluted him with that reuerence which I thought fitting both his yeres and such as he should seeme. And hee turning to his elder Sonne with a pleasant
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18754:9"/>
countenaunce, asked him whence I was, for I haue neuer seene him hereabouts or els where (quoth he) to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce. To whom his Sonne made aunswer thus. He co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from <hi>Nouara,</hi> and trauails towards <hi>Turyno,</hi> but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king néerer to his Father, he whispred to him in such sorte that hee woulde enquire no further of my state, but saide, whence soeuer he be, hee is welcome here a shore, for hee is happened on a place, where to our powre, honour and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice alwaies hath béene vsed to strangers. I thanking him for his courtesie, praid that as I willingly receaued thys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of him, so in other things I might shew my selfe mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and regardant.</p>
                  <p>These things thus discoursed, the seruaunts had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided water for our hands, and (hauing washt) we sate, as it pleased the good old Gentleman, who desired to doo me ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor béeing a straunger. Forthwith was the Table furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with fruits, as Mellons, Cytrons, and such like, which at the end of Supper were at a wincke of his reserued and set vp, &amp; then he began thus.

not such as you are vsed to taste elsewhere, remember you are in a Country Town, and lodged in the house of a poore Host. I hold it (quoth I) a happy thing to haue no néede to send for necessaries to the Cittie for the supply of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I meane not of good meate, for thereof sir me seemes héere wants no store. It lightlie happeneth not (quoth hee) that I send to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cittie for any thing necessarie or fit for the life of a poore Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for (God be praised) I haue aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of euery thing ministred vnto me vpon myne owne ground, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I haue deuided into foure parts or formes, call them what you will. The first and greatest part I plow and sowe with wheate and all kind of graine. The seconde part I leaue for Trees and plants, which are also necessarie either for fire, the vse of Architecture, &amp; other instruments of houshold, as also in those places that are sowne are manie rewes of Trees, whereupon the Uines after the manner of our <hi>petit</hi> Countries are laid and fastened. The third is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe ground whereon the Heards and little flocks I haue are wont to graze. The fourth I haue reserued for hearbes, flowers and rootes, where also are some store of hyues for Bées, because beyond this Orchard wherein you sée that I haue gryft so many fruitfull Plants, and which you sée is somewhat seperat fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my possessions, there is an other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den full of all sorts of sallet hearbes and other rootes.</p>
                  <p>You haue well deuided your lands (quoth I) and it is well séene that you are studious of <hi>Varro</hi> not of <hi>Virgil</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But these Mellons héere that are so swéet, are they also growing vpon your owne grounde? Yea (quoth hee) and if they please you, eate of them and tarry not for me. For if I haue eaten but a little, it hath not béene for sparing them, but because I déeme them scarce wholesome: for albeit they be sweet of sauour and pleasant to the fast: neuerthelesse, hanging alwaies on the earth and not discouered on al sides to the Sunne, it must needs be, that there they soke vp the superfluous humours of the earth, which most commonly (béeing vnpossible to be wel or equallie ripened by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18754:10"/>
of the Sunne, which cannot enter into euery part) it hap peneth that there are few good Mellons to be found, but that many of them taste like Goords and Cowgo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Here he became silent, &amp; I to shew that I allowed of that he spake, said little: knowing that olde men, or they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grow in yeeres, were euer more desirous of reasoning and talk, then any other thing, for we can not please them better, then to harken to their spéeches with attention. But he then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at a staie, said because his wife was wanting. Sir, my wife béeing withdrawne from your presence, happily lookes to be inuited, therefore if it please you I wil cause her to bée called. For albeit I knowe that modest strangers are more abasht with the company of women then of men, yet not onely the Towne but the custome of our Countrey, carieth a certaine priuiledge, whereof it wil be wel that you begin to aduise your selfe.</p>
                  <p>The Wife béeing called, came and sate her down at the vpper end of the Table, in that place that was purposelie left empty for her, and the good man of the house beganne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Nowe haue you séene (ꝙ he) all my déerest thinges, for heauen hath not graunted me a maiden Child, for which I were to thanke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much, were it not but that my wife la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth oft for want of one to beare her company, for my Sonnes are for the most part absent &amp; imployed otherwise, wherefore I thought good to haue married myne eldest Sonne had he not much disliked and intreated to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. I cannot (quoth I) in anie sort commend this custome of marrying yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so soone. For it standeth not with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that they should first be getting Children, before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were come vnto their groweth, wherunto me thinks your Sonne héere hath attained: besides, the fathers ought to excéede their children alwaies eyght and twenty or thirty yéeres at the least, for otherwise they are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vigor of their yeeres when the youth of their sonnes begin to florish, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as their desires are yet vnaccomplished, which if by
<pb facs="tcp:18754:11"/>
none other meanes, yet by example of their Children they might moderate, and oft it is the cause, that such regarde is scarcely had or vsed to them by their Children as is due to Parents, for many times they are companions &amp; brothers in their conuersation, nay nowe &amp; then (which is most abhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable) they are ryualls and competitors in loue, where if they exceeded more in yeres, their Fathers could not match them in theyr young desires, but (béeing decrepit) shoulde solely expect and approue that ayde and comfort at theyr hands, which is their due, and nature bindeth Children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And herein I remember that apt forme of spéech vsed by <hi>Lucretius. <hi>Natis munire senectam.</hi>
                     </hi> For by nature Chyldren are the fortresse &amp; defences of their Parents, neither coulde they be such, were they not of able and sufficient yéeres, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Parents are ariued and come vnto their age. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto your selfe beeing eftsoones nigh, mee thinks you ought to hold your selfe no lesse satis-fied of the helpe you haue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the good conditions of your Sonne, who though he cannot yet find in his hart to be married, shal happily conforme him selfe therunto ten or twelue yéeres hence, and time inough. Whilst I spake thus, I remembred that my argument was more acceptable to the Sonne then the father, and he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my remembraunce, said. I hunted not all in vaine to day, for I haue not onely kild, but more then I looked for, I haue happened on an honest aduocat to pleade my cause: and thereupon he carued me of the daintiest morsels of the Kid, and laid it on my trenchour, whereof some was roste, some was backt after the manner of myneed meate. Wyth the Kidde was serued (in seuerall dyshes) some part of a wylde Boare, drest after our Countrey fashion with Larde, and in two other dyshes, two payre of Pygeons, the one roasted, the other boyled This wilde Boare, (quoth the good man) was taken by a Gentleman a friende and neighbor of ours, who often time participates the profit of his sports with my Son, the Pigeons, them I haue from my owne Douehouse, and with these fewe haue we furnished a poore Supper, as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18754:11"/>
for Béefe and such like, I hold it rather a trouble to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and the Table, then a necessarie meate for this conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious weather. It suffiseth mee (quoth I if it bee not more then néedes) to eate of two kinds of wilde flesh: &amp; me thinks I haue supped with noble men to night, in whose time wee reade there was none other flesh eaten then Béefe, Porke, and Uenizon and such like, for the banquets of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> as we read in <hi>Homer,</hi> although (by the opinion of <hi>Lucian,)</hi> they might deserue to haue old <hi>Nestor</hi> at thé almost as a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasite,</hi> were not furnished with other viands And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> compani ons of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> bare not so many mishaps and heates of the Sunne for the desire of Feisants or Partrich, but to féede vp pon Béefe. <hi>Virgil</hi> likewise inducith <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that in <hi>Affrick</hi> slaw seauen Harts, where, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgment of some, it shold haue beene some other thing, for in <hi>Affrick</hi> are no Harts bred, but in hauing regarde to the conueniencie and custome of Noblemens dyet, he faigned or forgat that which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is vsed and eaten in that prouince.</p>
                  <p>And wherefore (quoth the olde man) did the Poets faigne that Noble m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>n of their time, did eate such kinde of flesh. Because (quoth I) they are of great nourishment, and they (as those that exercised themselues with much labour) had néede of great nourishment, which Birds cannot yéelde that are so easilie digested: but the flesh of wild Beasts, although they be of great nourishment, yet are they wholesome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be much exercised and stirring, and theyr fatte is farre more naturall then that of Swine, or other Beastes that fatneth by the hande, for it is not so soone puft vp &amp; fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as those Beasts that commonly are stald and foddered, therefore it was aptly said of <hi>Virgil,</hi> speaking of <hi>Aeneas</hi> sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours.

                  <p>For they fedde thereof at will, without any noisome or superfluous fulnes. Héerewithall I held my peace, and the
<pb facs="tcp:18754:12"/>
olde man began thus. The discourse that you haue made of Wine, and of the auncient times of Noble men, makes mee remember that which I haue hearde obserued of <hi>Homer,</hi> who euermore in praysing Wine, called it <hi>Nigrum et dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> which two conditions, me thinks are not very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and so much the more it séemeth strange vnto me that he should giue Wine commendations of that sort, the more <note place="margin">Wines of the Easterne parts.</note> I haue obserued, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wines of <hi>Leuant,</hi> which are brought ouer héere to vs, are white of collour, as are the Malmeseys, and the <hi>Romaine</hi> wyne which I haue tasted of in <hi>Venice,</hi> without that, the wines which in the kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> are called <hi>Grecian</hi> Wines, because they were made of the Grapes that grow in <hi>Greece,</hi> bee white or rather gold-col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, as that aboue all the rest is wherof we haue spoken. And those wines are more properlie white that are of the <hi>Rheyne</hi> of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and those others that growe in colde Countries, where the Sunne hath not so much force as it can rypen Grapes before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of Grape-gathering, albeit happilie the manner of their making, may also be the cause of their whitnes.</p>
                  <p>Héere I aunswered, that the Wines were termed swéete of <hi>Homer,</hi> with that kind of <hi>Metaphor</hi> wherwith al things, either pleasing to the sences, or acceptable to the minde, are required to be swéete. Howbeit, I denie not that perhaps he loued swéete Wines himselfe, which also most contenteth me, neither is this sweetnes of Wine vnpleasant or hurtful but at some seasons: and the Malmesey, <hi>Greeke</hi> &amp; <hi>Romain</hi> Wines whereof wee haue made mencion, all of them haue some kind of swéetnes, which is neuerthelesse lost the older the Wine is: wherevpon we reade.

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was not because the Poet desired bitter Wyne (for there is none to whom bitternes is not vnpleasant) but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18754:12"/>
because olde Wine loosing the swéetnes, yéeldeth that sharp and heddie taste, which he calleth bitter, &amp; I would so wishe you to vnderstande that it is called swéete of <hi>Homer,</hi> as it was called bitter by <hi>Catullus:</hi> afterward <hi>Homer</hi> calleth it black, hauing reference to some particuler Wine that was then in price, as is nowe our <hi>Lachrima,</hi> which though it bee <note place="margin">Which we call redde Wine.</note> prest from one selfe same Grape as the Wine of <hi>Greece</hi> is, hath yet a vermillion couller. Hauing aunswered thus, I tasted of a cup of delicat white Wine with my Mellons, and afterward, béeing begun to by him, I pledged him of a cup of neate Claret Wine, &amp; vpon interposition of some words, we ended our merry Supper. For the meate taken awaie, there was sette on the Table all sorts of fruite in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, whereof when the old man had onely tasted, hee began thus to reason.</p>
                  <p>I haue many times hearde much questoning of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesse and varietie of seasons, and I haue séene two Letters that are extant to be reade, of <hi>Mutius</hi> the one, and the other of <hi>Tasso,</hi> wherein they contende of the woorthines betwixt Winter and Sommer, but me thinks no time may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Autumn.</hi> For the Sommer with extreame heate, and the Winter with extreame colde, are otherwhile so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, as we can neither temperate the one with fruits nor the other with pastimes: and they are not onely a hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce to the Mariner, who in the Winter is enforced to kéepe the Hauen. To the trauailer, Souldier &amp; huntsman, who in Sommer are constrained to retyre them from the heate, raynes and tempests, vnder the shade of a Trée, or shroude of a Church, whether they first find: but to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper also, who without many inconueniences cannot haue the time so much as to surueigh his grounds. The one sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then is full of labor and of sweat, neither enioyeth it the third part of the fruite it bringeth foorth, for spoile of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wormes and windes. The other slothfull and sleepie, betwixt idlenes and eating, vniustly consumeth that which the labour of another time hath yéelded. Which iniustice, is
<pb facs="tcp:18754:13"/>
indifferently to be noted by the difference betwixt the day and night. For in Winter, the daie which is most woorthy, yeeldeth to the night, whereof it is vnreasenable y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it should be ouercome: and beeing short, colde, and cloudie, it giueth not men conuenient time to worke or to contemplate. So that our operations and contemplations are enclozed with darknes and reserued to the night, a time nothing necessarie for the one nor other. For the sences that are ministers of vnderstanding, cannot so entirely exercise their office in the night. In the Sommer, the daie becomes vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These if I be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled, are the inconuentences and discomodities of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Summer, whereof the Spring and <hi>Autumn</hi> are not to be touched, for they are fraught with millions of delights, and in their times, the Sun (like a most indifferent Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) formith the day &amp; night of such equalitie, as the one hath little cause to complaine of the other. But if wee wyll co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare <hi>Autumn</hi> &amp; the Spring togeather, we shall soone finde the spring so farre inferior to <hi>Autumn,</hi> as hope is to effects, and flowres to fruits, whereof <hi>Autumn</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore I conclude that <hi>Autumn</hi> is the most noble and best season of the yéere, and that which is indéede most acceptable to the Housekeeper: and I remember I haue hearde my Father saie, who (if the troth reported of him may but be beleeued) was for naturall <hi>Morall Philosophie</hi> and eloquent deuise, more then meanelie learned, that in this season the world began, as indeede wee may assuredlie beleeue it did.</p>
                  <p>That (quoth I) hath béene the opinion of some Doctors of the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> and Christians of great account, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding beeing no Article of our beliefe, euery manne may credite as he list, I for my part am one of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> holde the contrary, &amp; it séemeth to me more likelie, that the (world beginning as it is supposed) it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began about the Spring, which I will thus constraine my selfe to prooue.</p>

Neuerthelesse, forasmuch as all thinges contained in thys our variable and corruptible world, chiefely depende vppon the motion of the Sunne, which is the cause of generation and of corruption, &amp; is indeede the father of all liuing things, it is requisite that the motion of the Sunne determine the
<pb facs="tcp:18754:14"/>
differences of the place. According therefore to the motions of the Sun, our Pole is the higher, which according to the motion of the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> should be the lower. This bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, if we will séeke in what season it is like the world began, we shal sée it is most reasonable, that it then began when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Snn remouing foregoes not, but aprocheth vs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it beginneth with generation not with corruption, for according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> custome of nature, things are first ingendred, and afterward corrupted: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sun remouing out of <hi>Aries</hi> it approcheth vnto vs, and there giueth beginning to the generation and engendering of thinges. It is likelye then, that when the world began the Sunne was in <hi>Aries,</hi> which without doubt he shall see is so, that dilligently considereth what was said in <hi>Platos <hi>Tymeus</hi>
                        </hi> of God the Father to those inferior Gods. True it is, that who so taketh the positions of place from the motion of the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> it must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that the Pole <hi>Antartick</hi> is the higher by Nature, and that the world began in that season wherein the Sunne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing approcheth néerer vnto our <hi>Antipodes,</hi> &amp; beginneth generation in those parts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other world that are opposite to these: which who so graunteth, it would séeme more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the world began in the <hi>Autumnal aequinoctial,</hi> when the Sunne was in <hi>Libra,</hi> and yet it would follow that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the Spring, because this that is <hi>Autumn</hi> to vs, is their springtime, in respect whereof, the beginning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be taken.

If you be such an one (quoth he) for I will not search or pry into your state, you cannot but be an indifferent &amp; fit Iudge of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which my Father (loaden both with age and with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) participated vnto me a fewe yéeres before his death, giuing vp the gouernment of his house and care of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to me. And whilst he thus spake, the Seruants tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the auncient Gentlewoman giuing thanks arose, and was attended by her Sonnes, who after a while retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I beganne. Syr, it shall be very acceptable vnto mee, to heare the dyscourse your Father made vnto you, as you were in purpose to haue tolde me, but because it woulde bee gréeuous vnto me to harken thereunto, with the dysease of those that are about vs, I beséech you commaund your Sons to sitte, who obeying the gentle commaunds of their father, the good olde man began thus.</p>
                  <p>About that time that <hi>Charles</hi> the fift deposed his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, and withdrew himselfe from the worlde, as from a tempest to contemplation and a quiet life, my good Father, béeing then thréescore and tenne yéeres old, my selfe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then thirtie, called mee to him, and began to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with me thus.

                  <p>Now to begin, I say thus. That the care of a good hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder is deuided into two thinges, that is, his body and hys goods.

For as two Palfreys or two Oxen of vnequall stature cannot be coupled vnder one selfe yoake, so a noble woman matching with a man of base estate, or contrarily, a Gentleman with a Begger, cannot be consorted well vnder the bands of wedlock.

Which honor is not yet accompanied with reuerence as is that which for manner sake wee are wont to doe to others. And she ought to consider that no distinction of nobilitie can be so great, but that the league which Nature hath ordeined
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18754:16"/>
betwixt men and women farre excéedeth it, for by Nature woman was made mans subiect. But if a man shal take to wyfe an inferior or meane woman, he also ought to weygh, that Matrimonie maketh equall many differences: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he hath not taken her for a slaue or seruaunt, but for a fellow and companion of his life. And thus touching the estate of man and wife, let this suffise.</p>
                  <p>Nowe passing to the age, I say that the Husband should prouide to choose his wife rather yong then olde, not onelie because a woman is more apt to child-bearing in youth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwise, but because, (according to the testimony of <hi>Hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus)</hi> she can better receiue, and retaine all formes of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and conditions, wherewith it shall content her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to commend her. And for this (that the life of a woman is conscribd and ordinarily concluded in lesser tyme then Mans, and sooner waxeth olde, as one in whom naturall heate is not aportioned vnto superfluous moisture) the man ought to excéede the woman so many yéeres, as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the ones age match not with the others, so that one of them before the other become vnable and vnfit for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now if it happen that the Husband take a wife with these conditions, he shall furthermore easily exercise in her that superiority that hath béene graunted vnto man by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where otherwise it often commeth to passe that he shal find her so excéeding waiward, crabbed and disobedient, that where he thought hee made his choyse of a companion that shold helpe to lighten and exonerat that ponderous &amp; heauie loade which our humanity affordeth, he findes he is nowe matcht and fallen into the handes of a perpetuall enemie, who euermore none otherwise impugneth and resisteth him then our immoderate desires, that in our minds so much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselues to reason: for such is woman in respecte of man, as is desire in comparison of vnderstanding: and euen as desire, (which of it selfe is vnreasonable) is by obeying to vnderstanding, formed and beautified with many faire and necessary vertues: so a woman that conformes her selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:18754:17"/>
her Husband is adorned with those vertues, whereof by béeing obstinat she continucth vnfurnished. It is then a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in a woman, to know howe to honor and obey her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, not as a Seruant doth his Maister, or the bodye the mind, but ciuilly and in such sort, as we sée the Cittizens in wel gouerned Citties obey the Lawes, and reuercnce their Magistrates, or so as in our soules, wherein as wel the well dysposed powers as the orders of the Cittizens within their Citties, compell affections to be subiect vnto reason: &amp; héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it hath béene conueniently ordeined of Nature. For being néedful that in the felowship of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and wife, the offices and dueties should be diuers, and the operations of the one, var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying from the others, it is conuenient also that their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues should be diuers.</p>
                  <p>The vertues proper to man, are <hi>Wisedome, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Liberalitie.</hi> To woman, <hi>Modestie</hi> and <hi>Chastitie,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with both the one and the other of them, may very well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme those operations that are requisite: but albeit <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie</hi> or <hi>Shamefastnes</hi> be not properly the vertues of a man, yet ought a good Husband to offend the league of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as little as he possibly may, and not to be so incontinent, as (béeing absent for a season from his wife) he cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from pleasures of the flesh, for if hee himselfe doo not first violate the bandes by so defiling of the marriage bedde, he shall doubtles much confirme the womans chastitie, who by nature libidinous, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But because it behoueth the rule and authoritie of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to be moderate in those things, chiefely which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to women, which for that they are receiued and kept of custome, can not bee condemnd as arguments of much vnshamefastnes: He can practise no way better to dyswade her from such muddy making faire her face, then with shew ing himselfe a hater, contemner, and carelesse of those that are faire with that filthy spunging, proigning, painting and pollishing themselues. As for women desirous to séeme faire I cannot say to please others, but of honest women desirous to content their Husbands, I may boldly speake, that at such time as they shal sée their tricking vp their selues with Lie and such like filth, pleaseth not their husbands eyes, they I know of modestie and loue, will suddainly forbeare it. Much more easie to be entreated should the husbande be in graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her those things, whereof her bodie with conuenient ornaments should be sufficiently apparelled, for albeit su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous pompe be fitter for a stage or Theater then the person of an honest Matron: notwithstanding, herein much may be attributed to vse, neyther should a womans fantasie so sharplie be offended, considering that by nature shee is so desirous to adorne and beautifie her bodie. For albeit we sée that Nature in other creatures hath effected, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Male be more adorned then the Females, as the Hart with his fayre and bushie braunched hornes, the princely Lyon with his proude and feltred locks, which the Females neuer haue, and hath embroidered the Peacocks taile with more variety of collours the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those of theyr Hens. Neuerthelesse, wee may perceiue that in the shape of man, she hath had more regard to the beauty of the Female then

For the flesh of women, as it is more soft &amp; dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so are they ordinarilie more desired to be gazed on, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are their faces shadowed with beardes, which albeit they becom men, béeing proper vnto vs, yet can we not deny but that the countenaunces of youthes vppon whose faces hayre neuer came, are fayrer &amp; farre more louely then those of bearded men.

then a Wife: wherefore it was conuenient, that béeing ashamed of her selfe, a Clowde shoulde bee sent to hide her. And where he saith <hi>Ioue</hi> had not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so much desire towards her as before when he first tooke her to his Wife, it giueth vs to vnderstand, that married women are not forbidde for a little while to represent the person of yong Louers, which notwithstanding she must spéedilie reforme, because it is most vnséemelie in them that (as a Father or Mother, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or Maistres of a house) desire to rule theyr family wyth honest and enterchaungable loue, which ought to bee twixt man and wife, who are also to liue vnder the lawes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie.

                  <p>Thy priuate estate requires that so thou teach and bring vp thy Children, as they may become good members of the Cittie where thy selfe inhabitest, or they shall dwel, good seruitors and subiects to their Prince, which in theyr trades if they be Merchaunts, in good letters if they bee learned, and in wares if they be able, they may shew themselues. Neither shall thy Children be vnfurnished of all, or one of these professions, if thou sée that they become not werish and of a womanish effeminate complexion, but of a strong &amp; man lie constitution, and that they exercise themselues in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the mind and body, al alike or both togeather. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause al this part of education and bringing vp of Children, is or ought to be in a manner, the care of a Father and good Housekeeper, because it is wholie pollitique, that should pre scribe an order to the Father, howe he is to educate &amp; bring vp his Children, to the ende that the Citties discipline may

conforme and be agréeable therewith.</p>
                  <p>I will lay a part this argument, or at least dysioyne it from the rest which I will speake of housekeeping, and it shall suffise me soly to aduise and counsell, that thou bring them vpp in the feare and loue of God, honor of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and in their Princes seruice and obedience, and that they be continually exercised in those most commendable practises of mind and body, as become them, and may better their estate with praise and honestie.</p>
                  <p>We haue nowe spoken so much as hath béene conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thée to doo in the person of a Husband and a Father, eftsoones it remaineth that we come to the consideration of the third person: I meane that of a Gouernour or Maister, terme it as you list, which soly hath relation to the seruant. And if we shall giue credite to antiquities written of house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping and gouernment of families. The Maister ought to holde them satis-fied with <hi>labor, victuall</hi> &amp; <hi>chastisement,</hi> &amp; to keepe them exercised in obedience. But forasmuch as theyr Seruaunts in olde time were slaues taken in warres, and afterward called seruaunts <hi>a seruando</hi> (for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serud from death, and are at this day for the most part ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numitted and enfranchized) mee thinks this latter part of <hi>chastisment</hi> might well be left, as nothing requisite for our times or customes (except percase in those partes where slaues yet serue) and in steede thereof, the Maister to giue them admonition, which should not be such neyther, as is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the father to the son, but compleat and vttered with more austeritie and signiorzing termes, and if that will not serue, to suffer the disobedient stifnecked and vnprofitable seruaunt to depart, and to prouide himselfe of one that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may content him. And yet one thing hath beene forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of those men of elder times, which was not conuement for slaues, but not onely fitting, but most néedfull for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of their labour. But because (albeit the Lawes and vsages of men are variable and diuers, as wee see perticulerly in this of sernaunts, who for she greater number are at thys day free-man: yet for asmuch as the Lawes and dyfferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Nature are not chaunged either by alteration of time, or variety of customes.) Whatsoeuer others saye, thou art thus to vnderstande, that this distinction of <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, Ruler, Gouernour,</hi> or <hi>Maister,</hi> is first founded vpon Nature: for some are naturally borne to commannde, and others to obey: and hee that is borne to obey, were hee of the Kings bloode, is neuerthelesse a seruaunt, though he bee not so reputed: because the people that onely haue regarde to exterior things, iudge none otherwise of the conditions of men, then they doo in Tragedies of him they call the King, who apparrelled in Purple and glistering all in Golde and precious stones, represents the person of <hi>Agamemnon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus</hi> or <hi>Etheocles,</hi> where if he chaunce to faile in action, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     </hi> as the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are, he may be properly termed a Seruaunt, and of him and such like, the good Housekeeper (that woulde haue such persons serue him as he might commaund with reason) may well furnish his house, seeking no further vertue in them then that they may be capable of his commaundements, and execute them willingly, wherein they differ from Horsses, Mules, and other Beastes, whom Nature hath also framed apt to learne, and to be ruled tamed and guided by man, for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18754:21"/>
they in the absence of their Maisters record the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, which these no longer knowe then they are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or scarce performe euen when they are commaunded: so that a seruaunt may be called <hi>Animal rationale, <hi>a Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creature,</hi>
                     </hi> by participation, euen as the <hi>Moone</hi> and the <hi>Starres</hi> receiue light by participation with the <hi>Sunne,</hi> or as mens appetitcs by participation with the light of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing become reasonable: for as our appetites receyue within themselues the forme of that vertue which reason hath imprinted in them, so doth the seruaunt reserue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of those impressions whatsoeuer, commaunded or required in him by his Maister, and of them &amp; of theyr Maister some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be sayde, as <hi>Petrarch</hi> speaking of himselfe and <hi>Laura</hi> reasoneth.

For that enstruction or kinde of teaching Beastes, is not discipline, but an vse and custome, dissonant and segregat from reason: not vnlike as the right hande holdeth and disposeth any sort of weapon, better then the left, albeit there is no more reason in it then in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, but the mind also of Seruants is accompanied with reason, and may become discipline, as is that of Children, wherfore they speake without sence and coniccture vnreasonablie, that rob and reaue their Seruaunts of the vse of reason: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
<pb facs="tcp:18754:22"/>
it is no lesse needefull for them then Children but more peraduenture, (they hauing alreadye so much tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and strength, as not only serueth to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, but to rescue many times and asist their Maisters in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of some ciuill broyle or other troubles, that may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times betide them.)

Howbeit, it is a great argument of basenes, that seruile <hi>fortune</hi> can engender seruile euils in a gentle mind. And yet for instance I remember an example of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  <p>But returning to those Seruaunts whereof a house or familie in deede should be composed or furnished, I cannot commend those that are neither fitte for warre, in mind nor body, but such as are of streng complexion, fit for labor, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey busines, and household exercise. These would I deuide into two formes, the one vnder the other, as the one of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perindents, surueighors, or work-maisters: the other of workmen. The first shall be the Stewarde, to whom by the Maister of the house, should the housholde care bee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The next, to whom the busines of the stable &amp; of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses should be gyuen, as in great houses it hath béene accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

                  <p>But for asmuch as our fortune hath not gyuen vs that wealth whereby we should expect to haue our houses so dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished and multiplyed with offycers, it shal susfise thée to prouide one for all, that may be Stewarde, Horsekeeper, and Baileffe, and (him) commaunde the rest that are thy Hyndes and meauer seruaunts to obey: gyuing euery one hys sallary or day wages, more or lesse as in theyr labours they deserue: ordeyning victuall for them, so as they may rather haue too much then want. Howbeit, yet thou art to féede thy Seruaunts with some other meate, then such as shall be set vpon thyne owne boorde: where dyfdayne not nowe and than to sée such grosse or homely kind of fare, as according to the season shall be happilye purueighed or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for thy seruaunts, to the ende that they séeing thy selfe

But because a family well fedde and truely paid, may with idlenes and ease become pestilent, bréeding euill thoughts, and bringing forth worse works: not vnlike those Pooles and standing waters, which (hauing no recourse) putrifie the good, and engender naughtie Fish.</p>
                  <p>Thy cheefe care, and the duetie of thy Steward, shall be thys, to kéepe euerie one perticulerlie exercised in his perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer office, and generallie all, in such busines as thou canst not seuerallie set them to. For euerie thing that belongs to keeping of a house, cannot necessarily bee doone by him that hath another charge: the Stewarde, he must purueigh thy meates: the Chamberlaine, make the bedds and brush: the Horsekéeper, rubbe the horses and clense the stable: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently euery other, otherwise be occupied. The carefull Steward or surueighor of the house, should therefore (wyth dyscretion) dispose the works, that are or cannot be deuided or distributed, nowe to one, nowe to another, but aboue the rest, to haue a speciall care, that in the house, Coates, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or Coffers, be no vncleanes, filth or Rubbishe, but that the very walles and pauements, lofts and sellers, Harnes and implements of houshold, maie bee pollished and kept so cleane, that (as we terme it) it may shine like Siluer, or looke as bright as Christall. For cleanlines is not onelie pleasing or delightfull to beholde, but adioyneth worth, and bettereth things by Nature base and filthie, as continuallie beastlines and filth, corrupt, disgrace and spoile, thinges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of value and account: besides, Cleanlines increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and preserueth the health, as much as sluttishnes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyeth and impay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But because it sometime happeneth, that one is too much charged with labor, and another hath more day then work, one should so helpe another, as wee sée by vse in our owne bodies, when the one leg is weary we can rest it one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other, or when the right hand is ouer labored, we can ease it wyth the left, and when entercourse of loue &amp; courtesie entreats not thus amongst them, then shoulde the Maister himselfe commaund the negligent and vnprofitable Seruant, to help and ease the weary and the well imployed.</p>
                  <p>But aboue all, me thinks the <hi>Charitie</hi> of Maisters, and loue of Seruants to their fellowes in their sicknes, is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie to be vsd and shewn, at which time, the sicke are to be seuerally lodged from the whole, and nourished with more choise and daintie meate: nor shoulde the Maister of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house dysdaine, or shew himselfe so scornful or vnkind, as not to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site them: for if bruite beasts reioyce to sée their Maisters chéerish them, as we may dailie sée in dogs, how much more may we beléeue that men and reasonable creatures are com forted therwith? Wherupon it comes to passe, that good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb facs="tcp:18754:24"/>
liking and affecting of their Maisters, vnderstand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at a beck, and obey them at a winck of the eye, or bent of the brow, not as a water-spaniel, but as the hand is sturred to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the mind, so prompt and ready is the seruant to obey his Maister. For as the hand is said to be <hi>The instrument of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> beeing it (indeede) that serues to féede, apparrell, and keepe cleane the rest of the lims, which are also called instruments, so is the Seruant said to bee an instrument of instruments: because he kéepeth all the instruments of hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold occupied, not only to liue, but to liue wel, wherin he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from all the other instruments. For where they are <hi>Inanima,</hi> things without soule, he is <hi>Animatus,</hi> and diuinelie is enriched with a soule, and héerein differeth from the hand, for that the hand is fastned and vnited to the bodie, but he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and disoyned from his Maister, and is also different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Artificers,</hi> for <hi>Artificers are Instruments of those things which properly they call workmanship:</hi> but the Seruaunt <hi>is Instrument of the actiom,</hi> which also is distinguished from workmanship. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the seruaunt, if you will rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him, is, <hi>Animatum actionis, &amp; Instrumentum seperabile. <hi>A liuely &amp; seueral instrument of action.</hi>
                     </hi> But forasmuch as of actions, some are placed in care of families and housholde busines, some stretch further, and extend to ciuil administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there are some Gentlemen (amongst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wish thee to be numbred) that vse to kéepe a youth, who in theyr ciuill gouernment, doth serue to write and mannedge, some of their affaires, and him they call theyr Clerke, but these doo farre differ from the other, considering that for the most part they are, or ought to be, not of seruile or materiall witt, but capable of fashions, or apt to studie or contemplat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and their Maisters, can be properly no seruitude or signiory, but rather that kind of friendship, which by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> is applied in the highest. Albeit in those good worldes of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Common wealth, these were taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that number of other seruants, and such an one was <hi>Terence,</hi> the wryter of Comedies, who was so familiar with <hi>Lelius</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18754:24"/>
                     <hi>Scipio,</hi> as it is thought there is somewhat of theyr dooings in his works. The like was <hi>Tyro,</hi> of (whom are many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters extant that were written by <hi>Tullie)</hi> who béeing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Gramarian,</hi> was also a most dilligent obseruer of some little things, whereof <hi>Cicero</hi> was rather a dyspray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser then ignoraunt. But because that vse of seruice as wee talkt of, is (at this day) vtterly extinguished betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and their Seruants of such singularity: those lawes of friendship ought to be obserued &amp; maintained in more highe degrée. And héereupon was that Treatise of vnder Officers (especially) writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by <hi>Signior Giouanni della casa,</hi> which (for that thou art desirous to peruse his workes) I knowe must many times be redd and redd again by thée, I will therefore perticularize none, but refer thée to the booke.</p>
                  <p>And nowe because we haue sufficiently spoken, (though not so much as you desire) touching the regard of the person, for that our spéeche hath reference as well to Maydens as men Seruaunts, and because there hath béene nothing left out that belongeth to a Husband, a Maister, or a Housekee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: I thinke it requisite to come to that, which we deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and deuided for the second part of our discourse: that is, of <hi>Wealth</hi> or <hi>substance,</hi> wherein we wil effectually make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the duetie of a Huswife, and of womens busines. The care of <hi>wealth</hi> or <hi>substance,</hi> as we said before, is imployed to <hi>Conseruation</hi> and <hi>Encrease,</hi> and is deuided betwixt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Mistresse, because the encrease is as proper to the Maister, as the keeping to the Mistresse, howbeit to him (that perticulerly considereth the care of the encrease) it is proper to the Maister, and the other common, whatsoeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers heertofore haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this purpose. But forasmuch as nothing can be encreased that is not first, and wholy kept togeather: the Housekeeper that is desirous to preserue his wealth, should perticulerly know the quallitie, and quantity of his reuenues and expences, wherewith he is to keepe his house, and to maintaine his family with credit, and (measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the manner of his reuenewes, with the issue of his
<pb facs="tcp:18754:25"/>
charges) so to liue, as his expence may prooue the least, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that proportion with his comings in, as <hi>foure</hi> to <hi>eight,</hi> or <hi>sixe</hi> at least, for he that spends as much, as he receiues of his possessions, cannot recouer those losses, which by chaunce or Fortune may betide him: as by fires, tempests, inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; other such, nor supply the necessity of some expence, which (béeing accidentall) cannot be prouided for. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, (to be certified of his substance, and the value of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) it be hooues that he himselfe haue séene, and measured his possessions, euen with those compasses, which gaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to <hi>Geometry</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> which though they be diuers according to the variety of Countreys, is (notwithstanding) no occasion of <hi>substantiall difference;</hi> it also behooueth that he knowe, that what he reapes be aunswerable vnto that he sowed, and with what proportion, the earth restoreth that which it receiueth: and as requisit it is, that hee take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like notice of all whatsoeuer els belongeth, to husbandry or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and no lesse to harken after the prices, that are sette by publique Magistrates, or by consent of Marketfolks within the Countrey where he dwelleth, then to be enformed how they buy or sell in <hi>Turyno, Myllan, Lyons,</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (béeing well aduertised and instructed) he cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his Bailiesfe, béeing a Husbandman, or abused by his Factor béeing a Merchaunt. But forasmuch as I haue said, that he ought to be aduised, both of the quantity and qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of that which he possesseth: (I call not onely that <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie</hi> which is measured by <hi>Geometrie,</hi> as are Fields, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, Woods, or that which is accustomd to be numbred by <hi>Algorisme,</hi> as Flocks and Heards, but that which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as gold or siluer coyned) for (in the quadering and making euen of the enteries, with the expences) no quantity is more to be considered, then that of money, which may bee gathered and receiued of Rent, and such like reuenewes, which is often chaunging and incertaine: for Landes are not alwaies let at one rate, their price and profits rise and fall as other meane things, or things of more account. In

which incertainty and variable state of thinges, a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands iudgment, experience, &amp; dilligence so much preuailes, as not only is sufficient to preserue, but to encrease his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which béeing in the manurance and handling of an ignorant, or ouerwéener, dooth not onely decrease, but peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth.</p>
                  <p>That call I <hi>Quallity</hi> of substance then, that is artificial or naturall, of liuing things, or things without life: <hi>Artefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall</hi> are moueables or houshold implements, and hapely the house it selfe, and money which was first found out by mans appointment. Because we may liue without it, as they dyd in the old time, wherin exchaunge of things was made with out returne of money: afterward (by the lawe of man) was mony inuented, whereupon it was called <hi>Numus</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arteficiall</hi> riches may all those things be called, wherein the workmanship of the Maister is rather solde and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéemed, then the matter or the thing made: <hi>Naturall</hi> are those that are produced by Nature, whereof also some are without life, as Lands, Medowes, Mettals, and some with life, as Flocks &amp; Heards, whereof the good Housekeeper (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentime) receiueth profit. Further it commeth into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of <hi>Quallitie,</hi> to know whether the Landes or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, lye neere or far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Cittie, if they ioyne to any standing Lake or Poole, by the exhalation of whose euill va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, the ayre becommeth filthy and infected: or whether any Springs or Ryuers be adiacent, which by (ofte recorse and refluence) may gather vertue, to refine and purge the ayre: and whether they be guirt or enuironed with hylles, or lye open to the winds, whether vppon the bancks (to any nauigable water) or in a champant Countrey: whereby the commodities raised thereupon, may be transported easily in Carres, or other carriages vnto the Cittie, or whether it lie

stéepeward downe the hyls, vneasie and painful to be past, so that he must needs be chargde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sompter men: whether it be néere to any high way or common stréet, through which the Trauailers, <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants, or those of <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Fraunce</hi> are vsed to passe: or far from frequence, or resort of Passengers, or such as vse to bartre or exchaunge: if aloft, where it lyes in prospect, or below in some Ualley, where it may be ouerflowne: all which conditions, as they much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and deminish the price and value of the things pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest, so may they be occasion of sparing in expences, and teach thée to conserue and multiply thy Reuenewes, if (like a good husband) thou aduise thee and consider it.</p>
                  <p>But to come somewhat more perticulerly to the care and regard, that is (indeede) required, he should so prouide that whatsoeuer is necessarye for the vse of his house in the Cittie, be brought from his Ferme or Mannor in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to leaue his house there, furnished of so much as may suffise him and his family when he shall bee disposed to soiourne there, and to sell the rest at such conuenient time as things are déerest, and with the mony that ariseth thereof, to buy those things which his owne possessions yéeld not, and yet are necessary for a Gentleman, now &amp; then when they are better cheape. All which he may easily doo, if in sparing that expence he vsed at first, he reserue some mony ouerplus: againe, he may kéepe his mony by him many times, when by his own coniecture, opinion of Prognostications, or spéech of other mens experience he heares, or feareth any dearth or scarcity, and then to lay it out when hee perceiues the great aboundaunce of the yere, and fruitfulnes of seasons, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that example of <hi>Thales,</hi> who (through his knowledge <note place="margin">Thales, one of the seuen wise men of Greece.</note> of naturall things) suddainly became rich, with a bargaine that he made for Dyle. Thys shall bee the Husbands rare. But such things whatsoeuer as are brought into the house, eyther from the Countrey, or bought about in Markets, shal be wholy recommended to the wyues charge, who is to kéep and set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp, in seuerall places, according to their natures,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18754:26"/>
for some would be kept moyst and cold, and some dry, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some would be one while set in the Sunne, another while in the winde, some wilbe long kept, othersome a little while, all which a good huswife (well considering) shold cause those that wyll not kéepe, to be first eaten, and make store of the rest. Howbeit, those also that will not kéepe, (without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) may be holpen many waies, and made to kéep long. For Salt and Uineger doo not onely keepe flesh long time sweete, and seazoned, but fish and fowle, which will bee sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly corrupt. Besides, many sorts of fruit that will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly putrefie and perish, if they be sharpe or tarte (otherwise not) wil be long maintaind in Uineger. Likewise the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp in smoke, or baking of some kinds of flesh, or fish and diuers sorts of fruits, drawes away theyr moysture, (that is cause of their corruption) and maketh that they may be kept the longer.</p>
                  <p>Again, there are some things, which (béeing dryed) wold become both hard, and naught to eate, without some kinde of liquor or Conserues, whereof a good Huswife makyng store, for her prouision (if it happen that by some mischance or hynderaunce whatsoeuer, there can not come sufficient store of meate from the market, for her husbands Table, or that they suddainly are driuen to entertaine a Straunger) she may (in a minut) furnish her messe with those iunckets, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in such good sort, as there shalbe no misse of any other meats. She must also haue regard, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> al her houshold Corne, be some ground for bread, and othersome made fit for drink, and so distribute it indifferentlie with equall measure, both to the men and mayd seruants, vsed for those purposes: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom, she shall haue one aboue the rest, as the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath his Stewarde or <hi>Cashur,</hi> that shall kéepe one keye, and she another, that though the Maister or Mistres be abroade, there may be one to deliuer out such thinges as shall be needfull, and to bid a Stranger drinke, which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is not gueason in some houses, where the Steward or Butler beares the keyes, as well of houshold necessaries, as
<pb facs="tcp:18754:27"/>
all things els, pleasing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maister, and not vnplesant to the appetites of those he entertaineth. Therefore a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife should so prouide, that all things whatsoeuer (if occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of resort of straungers be not to the contrary) may be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly disposed: For thrift or liberalitie is as needfull in a woman as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Besides, she shold busie herselfe in viewing and surueighing such things, as she charged to be kept, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring things to be measured, and kéeping iust account of things that are to be accounted: neyther ought her care on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extend to the spending of them, or vnto other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, but also to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wynes, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the older they are, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they are kept, become so much the better, I speake of choyse wynes, which get strength with age: for the small wynes, and those of little spirite that quickly lose theyr strength, should be first dronk or sold if thou haue any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie. But her principall care should be of Lynnen or of wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len weauing, wherewith she may not onely make prouision necessary &amp; fitt, for the ability and credite of her house: but honestly gaine, which is as requisite in her, as is her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands profit gathered by the buying, selling, or exchanging other things. Neither ought a good Huswife to dysdaine or scorne, to set her hand nowe and then to some work. I mean not in the Kitchin, or other soyled places, which may spoile or ray her garments, because such busines are not to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedged and handled by noble Matrons (yet to be seene vnto by such whose state may tollerate such thrift) but in those onely that without noysomnes or filthines she may be bolde to touch, and such are properly the whéeles, lombes, &amp; other instruments that appertaine to weauing, wherewith a good Huswife may furnish any sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t house or dwelling, either for her eldest Sonne or Daughter: and not without reason was this arte first attributed to <hi>Minerua</hi> goddesse of wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in so much as it was deriued first from her, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by these verses in the Booke of <hi>Virgill.</hi>

                  <p>Notwithstanding, the Housekeeper ought to handle these things like a Husbandman, and not like a Merchaunt, for where the Merchant preposeth for his principall intent, the encrease and multiplying of his stock, which is doone by traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique and exchaunge, by meanes wherof, he many times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets his house, his Children and his Wife, and trauails into forren Countreys, leauing the care of them, to Factors, Friends, and Seruaunts.

But the Housekéeper hath his desires of riches certaine and determinat, for riches are none other then a multitude of Instruments that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine

                  <p>And as in euery arte, the instruments should be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and fit, as well for him that worketh, as the thing that shall be wrought withall (for in a Shyppe, the Rudder ought to be no lesse then may suffise to direct hys course, nor greater, then the Mariner can guide, and in grauing or cutting, the Chizzell should not be so ponderous and heauie, as the Mason may not lift, nor so light, as hee cannot with much a doe pierce the out side of the Marble) euen so shoulde riches be proportioned and limitted vnto the Housekeeper, and the family that he is charged withall, that he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite and possesse so much and no more then shall suffise, not onely for hys liuing, but hys liuing well, according to his estate, condition of time, and customes of the Citty wher he liueth and inhabiteth. And where <hi>Crassus</hi> sayd hee was not rych, that was not able to maintaine an Armie, he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely had reference vnto those ryches which are néedfull for a Prince or Ruler within the Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were too too much and immoderate for any one in <hi>Praeneste</hi> or in <hi>Nola</hi> little Townes in <hi>Italie,</hi> and happely superfluous for many men in <hi>Rome.</hi> For to muster and maintaine Armies, becommeth Kings, Tyrants, and other absolute Princes, and is not necessary or fitting for a Cittizen, inhabiting a place of liberty, who indéede ought not to excéede the rest in any such condition, as may interrupt or spoyle that good pro portion, that is requisit and meet in the vniting of frée men.

out, and vsed (a while) to make equall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inequality of things exchangd, and to eltimat and measure prices, not for that it ought to be exchangd, for of mony (as touching the mettall) we haue no néede, neither receiue we any benefit thereof in our priuat or our ciuil life, but in respert of making eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities, &amp; iustly measuring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worth &amp; value of each thing, it is thought both necessary and commodious.

                  <p>I haue told you then that Exchange may multiply in profits infinitly, because <hi>Number</hi> as touching <hi>Number,</hi> not aplied to materiall things, groweth to be infinit, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is not considered to be otherwise applied. But for thy better vnderstanding what we say, know that <hi>Number</hi> is reputed, either according to the formall or materiall béeing. <hi>Formall number</hi> is a collection of a summe, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to things numbred. <hi>Materiall number,</hi> is a summarie collection of things numbred. <hi>Formall number,</hi> may infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encrease, but the <hi>Materiall</hi> cannot multiply so much: for albeit in respect of the partition or deuision, it séeme that it may multiply in effect, notwithstanding, since <hi>deuision</hi> hath no place in that we speake of, we may saie, it cannot infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie encrease, because things of all kinds that cannot be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are of number certaine. This deuision being thus consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, much more may riches multiply that consist in bare money, then that which consisteth in thinges measured and numbred from money: for albeit the number of mony bee not formall, as that which is applyed to Gold, and Siluer, more easily may a great quantity of mony be heaped vp and

gathered togeather, then anie other thing, and so by coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous desire to become infinit. Yet betwixt <hi>Exchange</hi> &amp; <hi>Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> there is some difference. <hi>Exchange</hi> may be retained, not only for the custome it hath taken and obtained in many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Citties, but for the force of reason y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it séemes to beare. For exchange is vsed in stéede of our transporting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighing Corne from place to place, which béeing hardlie to be doone without great discomoditie, and perill, it is reason that the party that exchaungeth may haue some sufficient gaine allowed. Besides the value of mony of some Country coigne, béeing variable and often to be changd, as wel by the Lawes and institutions, as for the sundry worth, weight, and finenes of the Golde and Syluer, the Reall exchange of mony, might bee in some sort reduced vnto naturall indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, wherewith <hi>Vsury</hi> can neuer be acquainted, béeing an arteficiall gayne, a corrupter of a Common wealth, a diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyer of the Lawes of God, a Rebell and resister of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine orders, iniurious to manie, the spoile of those that most vphold it, onely profitable to it selfe, more infectious <note place="margin">Leuit.

So that offending Nature we immediatly offende God, and he that offendeth arte offendeth God touching the hurt or annoyaunce of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Usurer offendeth Nature, for it is not naturall that money should beget or bring forth money without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, since Nature willeth that the corruption of one bee the generation of another, and it offendeth God because it doth not exercise the arte according as God commaunded the first man, when he saide, in the sweate of thy face thou shalt eate thy bread, and it is not artificiall that money shoulde bring forth money, as the Usurers wold haue it, which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the vse in the thing. With those verses therefore, mee thinkes not onely our discourse of naturall and not naturall gaine may be concluded and determined, but whatsoeuer els we purposed at first concerning Husbandry and kéeping of a house, which you haue now séene howe it turneth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth

to the wife, how to the Children, howe to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, and howe to the conuerting and imploying, as also the encrease of whatsoeuer substaunce or possession, which were indeede those Fiue especial points whereof we promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to speake and to entreate perticulerly.</p>
                  <p>But for it is my chiefe desire that thou record effectually those things whereof I haue aduised thee, and that in so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise a sort as thou héereafter not forget them, I will bestowe them and bequeath thee them in writing, that by often rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and perusing them, thou maist not onely learne them but throughly resolue to imitate and practise them: for prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise is the end imposed to all instructions of humaine life.</p>
                  <p>This was my Fathers discourse, gathered by him into a little Booke, which I so often red, and studiously obserued, as you néede not meruaile that I haue so perfectly reported and repeated them. Now would I be silent, to the ende that my discourse should not be made in vaine, for if anie thing be said that in your opinion may be bettered, let it not I praye seeme troublesome vnto you, thereof to certefie mee and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it.</p>
                  <p>Sir (quoth I) for anie thing that I can sée, your father hath not onely well and learnedly instructed you in all hys institutions, but you (it séemes) haue exercised them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously. This onely could I wish, that somewhat more might be annext to that which he hath vttered, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly is this. <hi>Whether houshold care or housholde go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernment be all one, if more then one, then being more then one, whither then they be the knowledge &amp; the labor of one or more.</hi> You say true (quoth hée) and héerein onely fayled his discourse, for the gouernment of priuate houses and of Princes Courtes are different, but I can tell you why hée spake not of it, because the care of Princes Halles belongeth not to priuate men.</p>
                  <p>Trust me Sir (quoth I) you are of swifter vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; more eloquent deuise then I expected. But since wee sound that there is difference in houshold gouernments. It
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18754:33"/>
rests that we consider, whether they be discrepant in forme or greatnes. Forasmuch as if they onely differ in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then euen as the consideration of the forme of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Pallace and a poore mans Cottage, appertaines to one and the selfesame Mason, Carpenter or Architect, so shoulde the care of either houskéeping be one. But thereunto he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered thus, though I were swift of conceit at first, yet now (I doubt) I shall not be so prompt to find, or so iudicial as to censure that which you propose. Howbeit, I can tell you this, that if my hart or happe would giue mee leaue to kéepe a great yet (priuate) house, I meane not a little Court, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that priuate house of mine, should farre surpasse that Pallace for a Prince, which onely differeth from the other in the pompe and greatnes.</p>
                  <p>You are in the right (quoth I) for as a Prince is still to be distinguished from a priuate man, by forme: and as the forme of their commaundements is distinguished, so are the gouernments of Princes and of priuate men distinguished, for when it happeneth that in comparison of number, the houshold of a poore Prince is as little as a rich mans fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, yet are they to bee gouerned diuersly: neuerthelesse, if that be true which is approoued by <hi>Socrates</hi> to <hi>Aristopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>In conuiuio Platonis.</hi> That to compose or wryte a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie and Comedie, bee bothe the worke of one,</hi> albeit they onely differ not in forme, but are opposit and contrarie: it should consequentlie be as true, that a good Steward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as well how to gouerne a Princes houshold, as a priuate familie, for the manner and facultie of eyther is alike: and I haue red in a pamphilet that is dedicated to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that their gouernments or dispensations of a house, are deuided into foure parts, <hi>Kingly, Lordly, Ciuill,</hi> and <hi>Priuate, <hi>Regia, satrapicia, Ciuilis &amp; priuata,</hi>
                     </hi> which distinction I reprooue not. For albeit wee differ farre from those of elder times, yet I see the gouernments of those houses of the Uiceroyes of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Sicilie</hi> and the Gouernour <hi>of Mylain,</hi> are as corespon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for proportion to those Royall houses as were of olde

I pray you nowe shewe or declare vnto me, the order of the milke houses in your Countrey. What manner of Presses they vse to presse their Chéeses in, their Chernes for Butter, what buckets or pailes they vse to milke in, their Chéese fates to make their Chéeses in, or to put their Milke a running in, and Trowes to powder and salt their Chéeses in.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>The Man.</speaker>
                     <p>All these things I wil shew you, as néere as I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. First the Milke house (if ye milke manie Kine) ought to be made the more large, with shelues of plankes rounde about the house, as iust as may be to the walles of the house, of thrée foote breadth, breast-high, to sette your Milke and Creame vpon, in Earthen pannes that be but small, made flat in the bottome, shallow, and glased within, as high as the Milke shall stand in them. They bee best to sette your Milke in. The windowes of the Milk-house where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Milk doth stand, to be made vrrie ample and large, all a long on the North or East side of the same house, and specially for
<pb facs="tcp:18754:38"/>
the Sommer time, to the ende that the colde ayre may take effect in the Milke, for thereby ye shall gather much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more Creame. Your Chéese presses that bee made to presse your Chéeses with a stone or other waight, be not good, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Chéeses pressed with them, be more thicke on the one side then on the other, but the best presses for Chéeses be made of a thick planck, with two péeces of Timber stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpright with long mortesses in them, with a péece of Tymber also brodest in the middest, and narrowe at bothe endes. And that shalbe lifted vp and downe within the sayd Mortesses, with two yron pinnes, and driuen with a Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and wedges of Tymber. In this kinde of presse, ye may as well presse foure or fiue Chéeses at once, as one. Your Chernes for Butter ought to be made higher, and broader in the bottome then ye vse to haue them in this Countrey. Your Cherne staffe in the lower ende thereof, to haue two peeces of seasoned Timber of Ashe, fast sette on like vnto a Crosse, of a hand breadth or more, flatte, with two or three holes bored in the endes of the same two crosse péeces. With these manner of Cherne staues, you shal more easily cherne your Butter, then with your cherne staues made of a round boorde full of holes, and neuer haue anie small chips in your Butter, as yee may sundrie times haue with your owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned staues: whether yée milke in buckets or pailes it is no matter so they be cléene kept. Prouided alwaies that yée suffer not your Maides to haue their buckets or payles to milke in, to haue a furred coate at Midsommer, for of al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that delight in clenlines it will not be well liked of. Chéese fats that be made in Suffolke, be farre stronger, and much better to all effects then those that bee made in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: for although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turners heere be shewed any of those fats made in Suffolke (as I my selfe haue doone) yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie they cannot make the like. The Trowes to salt or powder Cheese in, in Suffolke, be but planckes of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient thicknes, set brest high, that be not past thrée inches and a halfe déepe, to salt their Chéeses in.</p>

The Woman.</speaker>
                     <p>I pray you shew me whether the women in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, after they haue flit or skymmed their euening Milke in the morning, doo heate all the sams euening Milke ouer the fire of a measurable heate, or els doo they heate parte of the same milke verie hote, to the intent that by the heate thereof, the reit of the euening Milke may haue heate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be put a running.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>The Man.</speaker>
                     <p>The best way in that point is, to heate all your euening Milke ouer the fire somewhat more then luke-warme, and to straine your morrowe Milke as fast as it can be brought in from the Kine and so strained, put them togeather a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: for if ye should heate some of the euening milke verie hote to giue heate to the rest, ye shall haue losse and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce thereby, for by meane thereof, ye shall make y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lesse Cheese, &amp; the Cheese so made will euer after be bad Chéese, drie and toughe. For note ye this, the hoter the Milke is put a running, the sooner it will be runne, but if it bee ouer hote, the Chéese will be the worse and the lesse. And if it bée put a running too colde, it will be much the longer before it come or be full runne, and the Chéese so made, though it bee good Cheese, it wil euer be white, therefore the maker of the Chéese must vse her discretion therein.</p>

                     <p>Whether doo ye thinke it better to knede the Curdes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be runne, in a bole or pan, or to breake them but in the Cheese fate?</p>

                     <speaker>The Man.</speaker>
                     <p>The best waie is to breake them very small onely in the Chéese fate, while they be warme, and to vse such dilligence therein, that none of the Curdes be pressed into the Cheese

fate vnbroken smal, for if they be, in that place of the Chéese it will euer be wemmie or faultie. The Curdes béeing so well and small broken, presse them downe often with your handes holden a crosse, vntill the Chéese fate bee more then filled, and highest in the middest of the fate, and let this bée doone ouer a Tub, Couell or Fate, wherinto the whey may runne from the Curdes. When the Curdes be broken into an other vessell, the chéefe part of the buttrines or fatnesse thereof, remaineth in the vessell, and so the Chéese by that meanes much the worse drie and leane meate. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer then that, an other thing by the way, ye must well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, for it is well worthy, when the Milke is wel run, then breake your Curds, and with a boledish spéedily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the whey from the Curdes, and let it runne through a tempse with a bottome of hayre, standing vppon a Milke Ladder, ouer the vessell that is prepared to receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whey, and so with all conuenient spéede that may be, make your Chéese, and presse it without any clothe in the Chéese fate at the first pressing. For marke well this, after the Curdes as a foresaid be stirred, if you, or your maide that you doe put in trust to make your Chéese, doo then goe about other busines and leaueth the Curdes lying still in the whey till they be cold before the Chéese be made, which practise is ought times in vse héere in South-hamptonshire, of the Curdes so vsed I doo assure you, yee shall neuer haue good Cheese, albeit the Milke whereof it were made were neuer flit or scimmed, for that Chéese so made, will bee of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, the longer ye kéepe it, the dryer meate it will bee, and especially in the midst of the Chéese dryest of all, for the moystest part of the Chéese will be néere the rinde, or vtter part thereof.</p>

And first I will saie vnto you, it is both good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to haue your Kine milked earlie in the morning, and rathe at night, for then (especiallie in Sommer time) they shall haue time to feede out of the heate of the daie, and by that meane giue the more milke. If your Kine be milked farre from home, cause then the milke to be brought home in vessels betweene two felkes, couered with a faire Lynnen cloth twice double, and cheefely in the morning, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that thereby the milke may remaine warme enough to be put a running with the euening Milke made warme ouer the fire for that purpose. And if you send farre for your Kine to be milked at home, see in any case that they bee quietly brought home, for if they shoulde be hastilie dryuen, you shall haue thereby much the lesse milke. Your milking Maides (as I said) must be strong, quick, and in all theyr dooings clenlie. But marke ye one thing, that sometimes in Sommer season, by occasion of vehement heate, or by force of much thundring &amp; lightning, or by noise of great Gunnes the drinke in your house may suddainlie change and growe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ger, and then your swéete Milke with that sower Ale or Beare, will make so pleasant a drinke, called of some a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libub, or a posset vnder the Cowe, that if it be not seene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ye shall finde thereby, that your Cheeses be not so well filled after that as they were before, nor so much Creame gathered. Your pailes or buckets to milke in, ought to bee kept cleane and sweete as before, for otherwise they will cause the Milke to turne when it commeth to the fire. If the inner side of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be colloured like a Grey Friers or a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers coate, I feare the Maides will be taken for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their Mistres or dame, will take occasion to excuse themselues, because they laie in bedde in the morning tyll their Maides had milked, where as if she had béen a fine and a thriuing huswife withall, shee might while her Maides were in milking, haue flit or skymmed all her Milke pans of the euening Milke, there lyeth much profit therein if shee could find the waie to practise it. Then vse your Milk thus,
<pb facs="tcp:18754:43"/>
put the euening Milke skimmed and warmed ouer the fire, and the morrow milke newe milked togeather, and so run them togeather, then make your Cheese as aforesaid, presse it well, and clothe it oft enough, scalde your Milke pannes well, then drie them and sette them vp an edge. When yee change your Cheese in pressing thereof out of one cloth into an other, if there happen some part of the edges of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cheese to hang out of the sides of the same (as commonly béeing well filled in the fate it will doo) you must cut that awaie, paring it euen by the edges thereof, &amp; cut that in smal péeces for your younge Chickens. A better meate yee can not haue to feede them with, and a more apt place then your Cheese house is to kéepe them in, ye cannot haue. But then ye must remember to put your Henne in a Coope, or for defaulte thereof, to tie her by the legge, in such place of the house as yee shall thinke meete for her, laying néere vnto her a borde of a foote and more in bredth, whereuppon yee may be well assured the Henne will alwaies broode her Chickens ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then vpon the grounde. And if folke hastilie chaunce to come into the house where the Chickens be abroode in the house, although there were in euery corner of the house a Henne tied that hath Chickens, they will with all speede euerie of them runne for succour to their owne dam, where she standeth tied, as well as a Souldiour in the fielde will repaire to his Captaine in time of néede. The next morning after your Cheese is made, put them in brine as before is mencioned, &amp; béeing salted enough, wash them with whore liquor out of salt, wipe them drie, and laie them on fayre shelues or boordes, and euerie daie turne them, wiping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the place where they laie, for as I saide before, if the Cheese lie so long vnturned, that the forme or print of the Cheese remaineth in the boordes where it did lie, it is much discomendable, and of all folkes delighting in clenlines to be disliked. Put no Cheeses into anie racks before they bee harde. When ye are disposed to make Butter, cause your Cherne diligently to bee prepared as before is spoken of,
<pb facs="tcp:18754:44"/>
your Butter béeing come take it out of the Cherne, into a faire olde smoothe Bole, and therein washe it from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whey, otherwise called Cherne milke, which béeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie doone, put the Butter all abroade in the Bole, &amp; with a Knife garse it euerie waie, drawing euer the edge of the Knife towards you, that doone, then with your forefinger strike the most part of the Butter from the side of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knife, then betwéene your forefinger and your thombe strike all the Butter from the edge of the Knife, and holde that vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene you and the light, and yee shall sée therein both Lint and haires, though the Creame were neuer so well strained into the Cherne, although this be not héere in vse, shee that leaueth it vndoone, albeit to be very fine and clenly shee sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth herselfe, lint and haires will be in her Butter. Then salt your Butter, and weigh it, and note if your Maids had as much Butter of like time gathered before.</p>
                     <p>And thus nowe I finish and make an ende, sauing one thing more yet I call to mind, and that is, if your milking Maides be disposed to sing in time of their milking, some Cowe will take such a delight therein, that afterward whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Maide commeth to milke her and doth not sing, shée will not stand to be milked, and when Maides come to milke Kine more gailiar apparelled, then they be accustomed to milke in, the Kine will be verie dangerous to stande to bee milked of them. And at a Copie hold heere in South-ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire of mine, I haue had also this experience, that one of my Kine hath had such a minde and fantasie to one of my Maides, that in her presence the Cow would neuer stand to be milked of anie other but of her onelie. And thus nowe I ende and take my leaue of you.</p>
