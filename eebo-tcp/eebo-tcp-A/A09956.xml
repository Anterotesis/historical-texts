            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>VR Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth in these wordes give us a part of a description of wicked men in the latter times, and hee bringeth them in by way of prevention or objection or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to an objection, as if some should wonder that there should be such kind of persons in the Church, as he in the former verses had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, <hi>Covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankfull, unholy,</hi> &amp;c. doe these live as the Church doe? Doe these retaine the Sacraments, and the like. Yes saith the Apostle, <hi>they doe, wee cannot deny it, only this, they have a forme of godlinesse, but &amp;c.</hi> So that the point of doctrine arising from hence, doth plainly appeare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the first sight to bee this, viz.</p>
            <p>That there is a powerfull godlinesse necessarie to salvation, and that many have but <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>forme,</hi> but not the <hi>power</hi> thereof.
<list>
                  <item>Now there bee three thinges to bee explained in opening of this doctrine, to shew—
<list>
                        <item>what godlinesse is,</item>
                        <item>what the power thereof is, the reasons why many have no more but the <hi>forme</hi> thereof.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the first that you may the better conceave what <hi>Godlinesse</hi> is, I will first show you what it is not.</p>
            <p>First then it is not bare nature, but that <hi>godlinesse</hi> which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of all men is more then so, God indeed hath commanded nature, yea even corrupt nature to bring foorth many fruits of <hi>godlinesse,</hi> as much abstinence from pleasure, much patience, much temperance, and such like, which are all very beautifull in their owne Spheares, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they come not from GOD, nor his Spirit of sanctifying, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have no respect of God, therefore they are not <hi>godlynes,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth God regard them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is not the act of religion proceeding from selfe love, though offered to God in regard that men see that God is the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the world, that hee hath the keyes of heaven, and earth, and men may doe much to God for such respects, using him as a bridge to get to heaven by making themselves the utmost ends, and therefore


<pb facs="tcp:15463:3"/>
this is not <hi>godlynesse,</hi> but what is it then you will say? why.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>What god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes is.</hi>
               </note>Thirdly it is a divine grace infused into the soule by God, whereby a man followes God, loves him, magnyfies him, sets him up in his heart above all, and manifesteth this in his life, and the whole course of it, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all for him and to him, and it is thus wrought when the creature comes to see no beauty in himselfe, and no help in himselfe, and sith God is full of all beauty, and all excellency, and all power, able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere our desires, in every thing, when he comes to see, and consider this, then he begins to set up God in his heart, as the Ivy having no roote cleaves faster to the tree, so likewise doth he only to God, seing that he cannot subsist of himselfe, and when he comes to see that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on him for all things, he will doe all things for him, because that all are from him. whereas before seing some thing in himselfe, he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified himselfe, and so withdrew himselfe, and his heart from GOD.</p>
            <p>And so I come to the next particular.</p>
            <p>Secondly what is meant by the power of <hi>Godlynesse,</hi> and for that you shall know there is a <hi>Godlynes,</hi> which is not only in words and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, but in deed and truth, for it not onely <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts upon a man a washie colour of perfection, but dyes his heart in grai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in holynesse, and it differs from the other in five things.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Five dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tweene the forme and power of Godlynes.</hi>
               </note>First. It is done in the <hi>Power,</hi> when it is not the bare picture, where there are not only the outward lineaments of nature, but when there is life in it, and that you shall know when a man needes not to bee called on to goood dueties, but there is a naturall principle of life in him, whereby hee doth them with facilitie, and constancie, as naturall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, when likewise hee doth growe in them, for where their is life, there is also growth, and when hee doth likewise desire that which may feede it, as the other meanes, which may strengthen him in the doing of it, as if a man have life he desireth meat and sleepe, and when as there is life, then the workes that come from a man are not dead works, and then you have the power of godlinesse, it is not a fashion only.</p>
            <p>Secondly it is not true but counterfeit, when it is like the true but not the same, but wants some particular property, that is to be found in the true, as that which is counterfeit balsame, which is like the true, but wants the power of healing, and so likewise a counterfeit drug, and a counterfeit jewel which wants that property, which the true hath, &amp; the want of this you shall finde in the use, and in the wearing, as a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bow is found to be rotten when the arrow is drawne to the head,


<pb facs="tcp:15463:3"/>
&amp; so if a mans <hi>godlynes</hi> be counterfeit, &amp; he unsound, it will be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the wearing or in some particular case, when he is put to it, or tryed, a Ieweller will find out the propertie of a Iewell, but an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man can not doe it, but by use and the wearing, to instance in some particular parts of <hi>godlynes,</hi> the love of God if it be true, it hath these properties, that a man loves the brethren, for how canst thou love an immateriall holinesse in God, which is stampt upon the creature like thy selfe, so likewise rectitude, and uprightnesse of heart, trye it by this propertie, which our Saviour Christ makes of it, <hi>gratious speeches</hi>; Christ saith that that which is predominant in the heart, the mouth will be full of: so for keeping of the commandements, if in trueth they have this properly, that they will not bee grievous, they will do them with a naturall delight, and inward willingnes. so for taking of Christ by faith, every man believeth hee doth so, but our Saviour Christ try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it by this, <hi>Goe sell all that thou hast, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,</hi> and so mayest thou trye thy selfe when thou art put to it by losse of goods, or credit or otherwise.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is in the <hi>power</hi> when it is strong, and not weake, when a man hath power and strength in doing good dueties, and heereby many are discovered, who have good purposes onely, which though they be heartie in them for a time, yet they want power and strength, and this is the case of many which bee in the Church, who though they have the knowledge of the word of God, and approve the truth in their consciences, desiring to be saved by the practise of it, and so take up many good purposes, which yet come to nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they want power and strength, consider therefore if thou hast power and strength to performe thy purposes, and then thou hast the power of <hi>Godlynes,</hi> but not els.</p>
            <p>Many will say, I am but flesh and blood, and what will you have me to doe? now here wants the power, as you may see in the fifth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of <hi>Moses</hi> called <hi>Deut,</hi> from the 7. ve. to the 29. the people there said to <hi>Moses that what the Lord should speak to him they would doe it,</hi> they said then what they thought, and what they meant and minded, and the Lord saith of them, <hi>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would feare mee, and keepe my commandements.</hi> &amp;c. they wanted the <hi>power</hi> though they made good purposes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If thou wouldest knowe whether thy <hi>godlynesse</hi> bee in the power or no, see whether thou hast not only the shaddow of it but the substance, for their is a shadow with the substance as if thou pray there is a formall doing of it, which is as the shaddow, but to pray in the holy Ghost, not in the voice of thy owne spirit but out of Gods

owne spirit, but of Gods, not out of memorie or wit, but out of thy heart, and that an heart sanctified by the Spirit of adoption, this is the substance, and so for to heare for knowledge only that is the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but to heare for practise that is the substance, and so againe for us to preach the Gospell, for to doe it, because necessitie is laid upon us, and there's a woe denounced against us if wee doe it not, as saith our Apostle of himselfe, there is the shadow, <hi>but to preach with power, and authoritie, and not as the Scribes and Pharises with the enticing words of mans wisdome,</hi> this is the substance.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and finally, It is in the <hi>power</hi> when as a man goeth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the work, a thing is said to be in the <hi>power</hi> when it is effectuall, when a man bringeth it to an end, and doth it not by halfes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin indeede, but then they leave the worke in the rudiments, but if a man haue the power hee will breake through all difficulties, hee will leape over all till hee hath <hi>wrought out his salvation with feare and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus having dispatcht the <hi>two</hi> former particulars, I hasten to the <hi>third,</hi> and last of the premises.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the reasons why some have but the <hi>forme</hi>? and not the <hi>power</hi> and they are especially these.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reasons why many men have but the forme.</hi>
               </note> First, because it is most easie, but the <hi>power</hi> is a matter of more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, for the former, it doth not call upon a man to cut off his <hi>right hand,</hi> to pluck out his right eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to <hi>deny himselfe</hi> in things nearest, and dearest unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the <hi>power</hi> doth, for it requyres a man should take paines in good duties, and goe throughout in them, not to omit or slight the least of them, in the least measure that may bee, or tolye in knowne sins, and farther it requires a man should doe this from day to day, and that when it crosses the flesh most, this is an hard saying, and caused many, that they would no longer abide with Christ, they were willing to obey the <hi>forme</hi> but not the <hi>power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, because this <hi>power</hi> breeds hatred, and opposition in the world, &amp; the world will crosse it again, now then when a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the former, and hold in with the world, a man may bee of the <hi>world</hi> still, and the <hi>world</hi> will love his owne, whereas the power maks them <hi>Antipodes</hi> to all the world, this makes many care for no more but the forme: fit for this purpose is that place Wil'd 2.12. where the ungodly say of the righteous on this wise, <hi>these mens lives are contrary to ours, and their doings reprove our thoughts, therefore let us oppresse them</hi>: and Christ tels us we must look for no other, saying, <hi>we shall bee hated of all men for his names sake,</hi> and it is no easie matter to have all


<pb facs="tcp:15463:4"/>
men in contention with us, this then is another reason heereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because it is enough to serve a mans turnes, for his unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ends, for men having a naturall conscience, whereof they must stop the mouth, and it being injudicious, and not able to judge of the <hi>power of godlynes,</hi> they are satisfied with the <hi>forme,</hi> as now when Children are wayward and wrangling, because we know they are not judicious, wee give them Nutts, not gold or silver to still them, and it serves their turnes as well. so is it heere in the naturall conscience. it doth judge the <hi>forme</hi> to be enough to cary a man to heaven; and who would doe more then he needs must.</p>
            <p>Fourthly because if men have but the <hi>form of godlynes,</hi> Satan troubls the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, nor the flesh, but Satan, (for he knowes it will bring them to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) when men labour for the <hi>power of godlynes,</hi> and goe on any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the <hi>forme,</hi> then he hath the power of hell against them, and he keepes a great busseling with them to hinder them what he can, and so doth the flesh too, but it will not resist the <hi>forme,</hi> for that will stand with a mans lusts, but if he be divided against himselfe he cannot endure it, as to deny a friend or a stranger if he be importunate is a hard matter, but to deny a mans wife that lyes in his bosome, if shee be earnest is more difficult, but to deny a mans selfe when he is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with himselfe is most difficult, and yet this you must doe, if you have the <hi>power</hi> of it. Now to deny the <hi>power</hi> of it, is when it is laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to men and offered, they with stubbornenesse of will resist and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.</p>
            <p>And so much for the opening of the words, now for the solding of them up againe, and from the first what <hi>godlynesse</hi> is:</p>
            <p>Let us learne not to deceave our selves, for it is not (as I told you) naturall or morall vertues onely, no nor the doing of the actions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, a man making himselfe his utmost ends therin, content not your selves therefore with any thing that is not godlynesse, let mee speake unto you as Peter to the dispersed brethren, whereafter that he had reckoned up many vertues, <hi>patience, knowledge, temperance.</hi> &amp;c. he bids them adde to all these <hi>godlynes,</hi> as if hee had said all the rest are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileable unlesse you have godlynes also, see therefore that all these bee <hi>godlynes,</hi> that is that they all come from him, and looke to him, for this is the nature of <hi>godlynes</hi> to come to the wells head. and to search higher then nature. to have another Alpha, and Omega, of all that is within us, or that comes from us, than what is within us of our selves. And then againe if wee bee to preach to others, wee should learne to preach Christ and God, that is to inforce all as from them and to them,


<pb facs="tcp:15463:5"/>
not only to exhort to morall vertues, with such instructions as may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of <hi>Seneca</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi> (thogh these have their use &amp; place) but as out of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> let Christ &amp; God come in, and shew you how all doe come from God, and looke to God and so all you that are hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, be sure all you doe be <hi>godlynes,</hi> that is comming from God, and tending to him, for <hi>motions</hi> have their <hi>denominations</hi> from their <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus a quo,</hi> and from their ends as that is called <hi>calefaction,</hi> that tends to heate, so is that truely <hi>godlynes</hi> that tends to God, and hath respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as now a student, when he studies and takes pains in his books see whether thou dost it for thy selfe or for thy creddit, or doest thou make God thy utmost end, examine thy heart, and examine it narow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and see likewise you are exercised in other callings, doe you doe them that you may doe good to mankinde in them, as a servant that uses his <hi>talent</hi> to his masters service, then is this <hi>godlynes,</hi> so if you eat or drink, or recreat yourselves, doe you doe it that you may doe good better, as men whet their sythes that they may mowe the better, then this is also <hi>godlynes,</hi> for it tends to God and <hi>godlynes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say, doe you altogether condemne naturall, and morall vertues? must they do nothing, yes you shal have this use of them, that they will helpe as <hi>winde</hi> to drive the ship, only it is <hi>godlynes</hi> is the rudder guides it, and aymes at the right haven, as for example, you are commanded to love your children, and your wives, you are bound to doe this, if you had no naturall affections in you, only having these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in you, you doe it with more ease, els you must drive the ship with oares, wheras now the wind fills the sails &amp; you do it with more facility, and ease, and so likewise you are bound to be patient and meek and you must be so, though your natures be not so, but if your natures be so, you may the more easily be so, yet so as <hi>godlienes</hi> must set the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, and steere the ship, morrall vertues are like good horses, that draw the Chariot, but <hi>godlynes</hi> is the <hi>Auriga,</hi> the <hi>Coachman</hi> without which take the most excellent things, that nature is capable of, if it be not guided by it, the Lord regards them not, for God regards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which drawes the creatures unto him, but now <hi>morall vertues</hi> makes us rest upon our owne bottoms, and so likewise all things whatsoever they bee that beautyfie the flesh, for God wil have no flesh to glorifie in it selfe,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>but let him that glories glory in the Lord,</hi> Nay I add more, take the graces of the spirit, wherewith God adornes his saints, as an husband doth his wife with jewels, if you magnyfie them you doe so much withdraw your hearts from God, therefore in heaven it is said there is neither, Sunne, nor Moone, now what is that?


<pb facs="tcp:15463:5"/>
there is no excellencie in any creature that is magnified there, but God is All in all, hee is Sunne and Moone, and therefore in the Revelation of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> it is said, and said to their honour, it is made their worth that they give all to God <hi>glory &amp; power be to our God for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap</hi> 7.</note> they fal on their <hi>faces,</hi> throw down their <hi>crowns,</hi> though <hi>created glorious</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet when the <hi>evill Angells</hi> began to reflect upon themselves, it was their ruine, they fell from GOD, for the creature of it selfe is like a glasse without a bottome, if it commeth to stand upon its owne bottome, it falls, and breakes, and so the Angells when they would stand of themselves, they fell downe to the lowest pitt, and therefore of all graces labour for emptying graces, as <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> for these give all unto God, nothing to mans selfe, and therefore they are the great graces in religion which you must chiefly labour for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from that there is a <hi>power</hi> in <hi>godlinesse,</hi> if it bee such a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull a thing (as you haue heard it is) then this may serve to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us, in the wayes of it. Wheresoever it is in trueth, there it is in <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi> say that thou hast such a light that thou canst not believe, that bee such roades as that thou canst not walke by them,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</note> yet if thou hast <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse</hi> thou shalt bee able to overcome. <hi>for the kingdome of God consistes in power,</hi> as it is saide, when GOD commeth to dwell in any mans heart, hee sendeth Godlinesse into it, which rules in it as a KING in his Kingdome, thinke therefore of it as of <hi>Monarches</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> was, or those which <hi>Daniel</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, which carry all before it, it bringeth in everie thought into subjection, and therefore also the <hi>spirit</hi> is called a <hi>spirit of power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and if you have <hi>godlinesse,</hi> it commeth from the spirit, and therefore is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with power, and therefore Christ is said to bee <hi>full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and of <hi>power,</hi> and so <hi>Steven,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and grace is said to bee a <hi>powerfull</hi> thing: <hi>Bee strong in the grace of GOD, and in the Power of his might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the reason why godlinesse hath power is, because GOD hath put virtue into it, as when you see such and such an <hi>hearbe,</hi> have such a <hi>virtue</hi> in it to doe such and such a thing, it is because God hath endued it with such a <hi>power,</hi> and so hath hee done with <hi>godlynesse,</hi> if therefore thou hast any thing to doe in religion, set on it, Hast thou any lust to overcome? set on it, and let mee speake to thee as hee spake to <hi>Gideon, Goe on thou valiant man in the might of the Lord.</hi> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Israel</hi> travelling to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they saw the Citties wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <note place="margin">

Dost thou thinke hee will not heare thee? Remember Christ, the onely <hi>Physitian,</hi> how readie hee was to heale men of their bodily diseases when they came unto him, and hee hath not put off his nature now: Dost thou think the power of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>resurrection</hi> were but fancies, or a notion?

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15463:7"/>Secondly, get power in believing <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he came unto his countrey, it is said, <hi>he would not put foorth his power to worke many miracles there,</hi> why so? one would have thought he should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have wrought them there then any where else, both for his own honour, and the good of his countrey men. no place then was fitter for that then it, yet there hee workes few or none, and the reason was, <hi>because of their unbeliefe,</hi> they believed not, so that it is the want of faith that holds Gods hands from strengthning you, you will not I say believe God, he hath sworne (and it is not an old oath) that hee would grant that we should <hi>serve him in godlynes, and holynes, all the dayes of our life,</hi> when the widow came to Christ to be healed of the issue which she had had many yeares, it is said, <hi>that vertue went out of him to heale her because she belieued,</hi> and though it have beene a disease of never so many yeares, yet if he say be ye whole, it is not matter what the disease is, so God be the <hi>Physitian,</hi> and therefore, believe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, pray and furnish yourselves with all the <hi>graces</hi> of the <hi>spirit,</hi> not only goe about things, but maintaine a stock, fill the cisterne every day, within whet and point the graces of God in you, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man every day is subject to decay, as well as the outward man, and doe not take ayme at yourselves, or at your strength when you are in a good mood, or by the present temper, for it vanishes if there bee not a supply from day to day, from <hi>grace</hi> within, if you doe not whet your soules every day.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in the last place is this true, that many are partakers of the <hi>forme,</hi> that have not the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>godlynes,</hi> that when we come to look on the faces of our churches, we finde the <hi>forme</hi> in many. but if wee come unto their dealings, and cariages in private, ye shall scarce finde the <hi>power,</hi> its as rare as the other are frequent, in their profession in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is a forme, but yet ye shall find religious servants, as idle as others, and wives as stubborne as others, husbands, and masters, as like lyons in their families, and as false in their dealings as others, if this be true (I say) as it is too true it is so, then <hi>be not deceaved God is not mocked,</hi> but try and examine your selfes heerein, for the kingdome of God consists not in <hi>word</hi> but in <hi>power,</hi> the Lord will not judge you according to your intentions and purposes,<note place="margin">
