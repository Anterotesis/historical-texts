            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen, and Loving Subjects,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving notice of your ſo ſudden Applicaaion to us (by an Overture from ſeveral of Our good Subjects) it hath been Our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Care to provide for your entertainment, in ſo Honourable a way as might ſtand with the Credit of Our Royal Perſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Our Ability, in this place of Our ſad and tedious Exilement. And being deeply ſencible of the Calamities and miſeries brought upon Our poor Subjects by the late unnatural War; We hold it Our duty to uſe all poſſible means &amp; I joyn with you, the Meſſengers (we hope) of a true Peace between Our ſelf and all Our Loyal Subjects, and that by you (the Inſtruments imployed in behalf of Our Kingdoms, there may be wronght ſuch a perfect Union and conjunction, between Our Self, and Our People, who profeſſe to be ſo ſincerely affected with the ſame Pious deſire of the Publick good as may (God giving the ſucceſſe) produce a right underſtanding between Our Self and you to make up all thpſe great and innumerable Breaches between Us, and Our Loyal Subjects, which by a miſunderſtanding have been planted and long continued betwixt Us and them.</p>
            <p>And wherers we do underſtand that you have undertaken this great Work to Treat with Us, we ſhall adhere to any Propoſitions, that may conduce to the Glory of God, and the maintenance of the true Proteſtant Religion, the Juſt and inſeperable Right of the Crown, and the Priviledges of a Free and full Paaliament, Elected by the Free conſent of Our People, and to the Juſt Rights and Liberties of our Subjects, And that to the end a Treaty tending to Peace may not (as formerly) be founded on the blood of Our good Subjects.</p>
            <p>We cannot indeed acquaint you with the inexpreſſible joy that We are ſencible of to finde Our poor diſtreſſed and diſtracted King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in ſome hopes of Settlement, and Reſtoration of its priſtine Glory, by the Eſtabliſhing of Our Self; which we know and are Confident is the earneſt deſire of all our Loving Subjects, being now at laſt unvail'd, whereby they ſee cleatly the cruelty of thoſe Task-maſters who aſpers'd Us their lawfull King with the name of Tyrant, and have themſelves deſtroyed Our Eſtates with the Eſtates of ſeveral of Our good Subjects to maintain their Violences, inrich themſelves with the ruins of Our good People, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Our Royal Prerogatives, and the ancient Fundamentall Lawes of Our Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Whereas it hath been publikely declared to Our good People (which your ſelves cannot be ignorant of) that Our intent was to come over with Forreign Force (thereby to corrupt the good opinion of Our Loving Subjects) We do profeſſe from the bottom of Our heart it was never Our thought to take any ſuch courſe to regain Our Right, and ſettle Our Self in the Royal Throne and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Our Father, but what We might in Juſtice, both according to the Lawes of God and nature proſecute for the recovery of Our own Birth-right; To which end and purpoſe we hope you are here (through Gods bleſſing) ſafely Arrived, and that not onely to reſtore Our Self, but to powre Balm into the wound of Our three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Though indeed the Innocent blood of our Royal Father is a great grief to Our Self, yet the deſire of Revenge is ſo far from Our heart, that We ſhall leave it to him who is the Juſt Judge of all both in Heaven and Earth; Our chiefeſt aim being onely to endeavor what in Us lies to Compoſe the difference between Our Self and you (who are employed in the behalf of all Our good Subjects) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtructions you have received, ſo far as may ſtand with Gods glory, and the Honour and Safety of Our Self; to which end and purpoſe we have already provided ſeveral Peaceable Propoſitions which will be preſented to your hands an this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happy and (we hope) ſucceſsfull meeting.</p>
            <p>Who knowes but that the Divine Providence hath ſent you to Us, that you (by Our Royal Aſſent to your happy endeavours) may be made the joyful Inſtruments of a well-grounded Peace, and of reſtoring Religion to its purity, the Church to its Rights, Our Self to Our Royal Prerogatives, the Lawes to their Channel, and Our good Subjects to their Liberties: All which if you reſolve to joyn with Our Self in performance of, may Crown Our Kindoms with eternal Honour.</p>
            <p>And ſince it is manifeſt by the Laws of God, of Nature, of Our Kingdoms, and of Humanity, that the Government of the Kingdom is due to One, why not to Our Self, by Birth your Countryman, by Education a Proteſtant, by profeſſion and actions your Pious Prince, and by his gracious Compliance confident in your Loyalty and Obedience. Let Us truly make a Covenant with Heaven, Religion and Juſtice, and we may ſoon make up all the breaches of diſſention in Our Kingdoms by an happy union.</p>
