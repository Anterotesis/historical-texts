            <title>A defence of the sermon preached at the consecration of the L. Bishop of Bath and VVelles against a confutation thereof by a namelesse author. Diuided into 4. bookes: the first, prouing chiefly that the lay or onely-gouerning elders haue no warrant either in the Scriptures or other monuments of antiquity. The second, shewing that the primitiue churches indued with power of ecclesiasticall gouernment, were not parishes properly but dioceses, and consequently that the angels of the churches or ancient bishops were not parishionall but diocesan bishops. The third, defending the superioritie of bishops aboue other ministers, and prouing that bishops alwayes had a prioritie not onely in order, but also in degree, and a maioritie of power both for ordination and iurisdiction. The fourth, maintayning that the episcopall function is of apostolicall and diuine institution.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> This contempt therefore is diligently to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented and auoided, as by the godly and religious care, both of your Highnes in preferring worthy men to this high and sacred function, and of the reuerend Bishops in shewing themselues worthy of that honour whereof they would, and indeed should be accounted worthy: so also by instructing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to conceiue a right of this holy and honourable calling. And for as much as the pernicious schisme and diuision, which is among vs, proceedeth from an erroneous conceipt, eyther that the Presbyterian Discipline is the holy ordinance of Christ, or that the gouernment by Bishops is vnlawfull and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian: I was perswaded (for my part) that I could not performe a seruice, eyther more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, or more profitable to his Church; then to publish those arguments for the satisfaction of others, which had perswaded mine owne soule,

not onely that <hi>the Presbyterian Discipline is a meere humane inuention, and new deuise, hauing no ground eyther in the Scriptures, or other monuments of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie: but also that the Episcopall function is of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall and Diuine institution.</hi> And whereas my Sermon published in defence of the holy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable calling of Bishops, hath been eagerly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by a namelesse refuter; I thought my selfe bound in conscience to deliuer the truth, which I had defended, from his sophisticall cauillations. The which, through Gods good blessing vpon my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours I haue so performed, that there is scarce any one sentence of the Sermon (if any at all) oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the aduersarie, which I haue not defended by plaine, euidence of truth. These my labours I haue presumed to dedicate to your Maiestie, as the principall Patrone (vnder Christ) of that truth which I defend; not onely intreating your Highnes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in good part my poore endeauours; but also commending my selfe, and them, to your most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Patronage and Royall protection.

            <head>An Ansvvere to the Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE scope of the refuter in his preface is as of Orators in their Proemes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Reader, and if he be such a one as will be led with shewes to draw his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to himselfe, and to withdrawe them from me.</p>
            <p>It containeth a <hi>Prologue</hi> to the Reader, &amp; an <hi>Epilogue</hi> concluding with prayer, and with praise to God. The former consisteth of a <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and of a <hi>direction,</hi> to the Reader. He declareth three things, first, the weightie <hi>causes</hi> mouing him to vndertake this worthie worke: secondly, his valiant <hi>resolution</hi> in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking it; thirdly, his <hi>manner</hi> of performance.</p>
            <p>As touching the first:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ad pag</hi>
               </note> that you may not thinke him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of factious spirits, blinded with erroneous <hi>conceits,</hi> and transported with vnquiet <hi>passions,</hi> vnaduisedly or headily to haue attempted this busines; he telleth you, that there were two motiues, that moued him thereto; the one, his strong <hi>opinion,</hi> pag. 3: the other, his vnquiet <hi>desire,</hi> pag. 7. His opinion was, that my sermon, defending the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable function of Bishops, was most needfull to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: for so he saith, <hi>I deemed it as needfull to be answered, as any booke our Opposites haue at any time set forth.</hi> And that no man should thinke this his opinion to be fantasticall or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, hee confirmeth it with diuers reasons: but such, as who shall compare them either with the truth, or with his opinion (for the proofe whereof they are brought) or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10663:7"/>
one with another, he shall see a pleasant representation of the <hi>Matachine,</hi> euery one fighting with another. The first reason;<note place="margin">¶</note> because he sawe the Sermon <hi>tended directly to proue, that the calling of our L. BB. (as they now exercise it in the Church of England) is to be holden</hi> Iure diuino, <hi>by diuine right, not as an humane ordinance, their ancient and wonted tenure, &amp;c.</hi> In which speech are diuerse vntruthes. For first, with what eye did hee see that directly proclaimed in the Sermon, which directly and expressely I did disclaime, pag. 92. where I did professe, that although I hold the calling of BB. in respect of their first <hi>institution,</hi> to be an <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> and so a diuine ordinance; yet, that I doe not maintaine it to be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uini juris,</hi> as intending thereby, that it is generally, perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and immutably necessarie; as though there could not be a true Church without it, which himselfe also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, pag. 90. of his booke. 2. where I spake of the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of their calling,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 52.</note> with what eye did he see me defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their exercise of it? As if he would make the reader belieue, that I went about to iustifie all the exercise of their function, which in all, euen the best gouernements whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, is subiect to personall abuses. 3. Neither is it true, that the ancient tenure of BB. was onely <hi>Iure humano,</hi> vnlesse he restraine the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tnesse he speakes of, to these latter times, which are but as yesterday. For in the primitiue Church as hereafter shalbe plainely proued, the function of BB. was without contradiction acknowledged to be a tradition or ordinance Apostolicall, and the first Bishops certainely knowne to haue bene ordained by the Apostles.</p>
            <p>And as his first reason fighteth with the truth, so the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond both with his opinion, and with it selfe. For why was the sermon most needfull to be answered? because saith he, <hi>it is euident that the doctrine therein contained, howsoeuer M. D. saith it is true,</hi>
               <note place="margin">¶</note> 
               <hi>profitable and necessarie, is vtterly false, very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obnoxious, necessarie indeed to be confused, at no hand to be belieued.</hi> In which words 3. reasons are propunded, which now come to be examined.<note place="margin">¶</note> 
               <hi>It is euident</hi> saith, he <hi>that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in the sermon, is vtterly false, therefore it is most needfull to be confuted.</hi> But say I, if it be euidently false, it needs no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10663:7"/>
Things manifestly false or true, are so iudged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disputation or discourse. Neither doth any thing need to be argued or disputed, but that which is not euident. This reason therefore if it were true, would with better reason conclude against his opinion. It is euident, saith he, that it is vtterly false, therefore it needeth not to be confuted. The second br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anch: <hi>It is very hurtfull and obnoxious, therfore &amp;c. Obnoxious?</hi> what is this? subiect or in danger to be hurt with euill tongues, subiect to sophistical cauillations, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calumniations. But hurtfull it is not, for I not onely said but proued also both in the preface &amp; conclusion of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that it is both profitable and necessarie. The third, <hi>It is necessarie indeed to be confuted.</hi> As if he had said, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie indeed to be confuted, therefore it is most needfull to be answered.</p>
            <p>Of these reasons, the two first he proueth in the words following, the third being as you see, nothing else but an absurd begging of the question.</p>
            <p>The first he proueth by diuerse arguments, such as they be. First then the doctrine of the Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is proued to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly false, because, <hi>it is repugnant to the truth, to the word of truth, to the scripture of truth.</hi> But how, after al these <hi>ridiculous</hi> amplifications, is the doctrine of the sermon proued to be repugnant to the word of truth? he had rather take it for granted, then that you should put him to proue it. But I shall make it cleare in this defence of my sermon, that as there is not a sillable in the scripture to proue the pretended disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, so the Episcopall function hath good warrant in the word of God. But when in the second place he proueth the doctrine of the sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vtterly false, because it is <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the iudgement &amp; practise of the prime Churches next after Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>&amp; his Apostles,</hi> I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tel whether to wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at more, the blindnesse or the impudencie of the man. Seeing I haue made it manifest that the gouernement of the Church by BB. hath the full consent of antiquitie; there being not one testimonie of the ancient writers for their Iudgement, nor one example of the primitiue churches, for their practise, to be alleadged to the contrarie. How durst he mention the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10663:8"/>
iudgement and practise of the primitiue Church, for the triall of the truth in this question, when there is not one testimonie for the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded discipline, nor one example of it, in all antiquitie? let them bring any one pregnant either testimonie or example, and I will yeeld in the whole cause.</p>
            <p>And where he addeth, that it is contrarie to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practise <hi>of all reformed Churches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">¶</note> 
               <hi>since the reestabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the Gospell by the worthies in these latter times:</hi> is it not strange, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> professing sinceritie should so ouerreach, seeing a farre greater part of the reformed Churches is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by BB. and Superintendents, then by the presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian discipline, as I haue shewed in the latter ende of this booke. But he addeth foure notorious vntruthes, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our owne land,<note place="margin">¶</note> saying, that it is <hi>against the doctrine of our Martyrs, contrarie to the professed iudgement of all our worthie writers, contrariant to the lawes of our land, and contrarying the doctrine of the Church of England.</hi> The first he expresseth thus,<note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Against the doctrine of our immediate forefathers (some of whom were worthy Martyrs,</hi> he quoteth in the Margent, <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Cranmer, &amp;c) who in their submission to king</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 8. <hi>at the abolishing of the Popes authoritie out of England, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with subscription, that the disparitie of Ministers &amp; Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly primacy of B B. was but a politicke deuise of the Fathers, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ordinance of Christ Iesus: and that the gouernement of the Church by the Minister, &amp; certaine Seniors or Elders in euery pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, was the ancient discipline.</hi> Which allegations would make a faire shew, if they might passe vnexamined. The witnesses which he quoteth for both, were Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther BB. who allowing the Episcopall function both in iudgement and practise, it is almost vncredible, that any testimonies can from them be soundly alleadged against the same. And I doe greatly wonder at the large conscience of our re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uter in this behalfe, who throughout the booke taketh wonderfull libertie in citing Authors, alleadging as their testimonies his owne conceits, which he brought not from their writings, but to them. For the former, he allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the booke of Martyrs, whereunto that part of the BB.

               </note> that which is said, concerneth the superioritie of BB. among themselues, all whom, with the ancient Fathers, I do confesse in respect of the power of Order to be equall, as were also the Apostles whose succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours they are. But we may not inferre, because the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were equall among themselues, that therefore they were not superiour to the 72. disciples; or because BB. are equall among themselues, that therefore they are not supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to other ministers. For the latter, he quoteth the book called <hi>Reformatio legum Ecclesiasticaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Which was a proiect of Ecclesiasticall lawes, which, if King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. had liued, should haue been set forth by his authoritie, drawne by Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> B. <hi>May,</hi> &amp; other Commissioners, and penned (as is supposed) by D. <hi>Haddon.</hi> In alleadging whereof, whiles the refuter goeth about to make the reader belieue, that they stood for Lay-Elders, and the pretended parish-discipline, he plaieth the part of an egregious falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier.

            <p>Againe, if it were true that the Bishops hauing better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themselues concerning their functions, had refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their iugdeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts according to the holy Scriptures and other writings of Antiquitie: would it follow that their lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughts, which commonly are the wiser, (according to the old saying, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, were false and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be confuted?</p>
            <p>And lastly, if this be a true proposition, which in the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Enthymeme is vnderstood, that what is repugnant to the doctrines formerly taught in the Church of England is euidently false, though it agree with the present doctrine thereof; how worthy then is the pretended discipline to be reiected, which is contrarie to the perpetuall doctrine of this Church, both former and latter: especially the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the newest stampe, I meane the new-found parish discipline published by the challengers of disputation, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, 1606 &amp; maintained by this refuter, which neither agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with our Church, nor as I suppose with any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church in the world?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The Papists</hi> (saith hee) <hi>would be much aduantaged, seeing that Antichristian doctrine (euen after the renewing and reuiuing of their ceremonies among vs) so freely preached and published, tending to the vpholding of their Hierarchy from the Pope to the Apparitor, as well as ours; his reasons being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very same with theirs, as in the answere to them it shall appeare.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:10663:12"/>The aduantage which ariseth to the Papists by this doctrine preached, and the ceremonies still retained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, may through Gods blessing be this. That when they see vs not so new-fangled as our Opposites, nor so carried with hatred to their persons, as to depart fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from them, then they haue departed from the primitiue Church, but are content to obserue the ancient gouernement, and lawfull Ceremonies vsed in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, though retained by them, they may be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ioyne with vs in reforming the Church according to the doctrine and example of the ancient and primitiue Church.</p>

In the Popish Clergy aboue BB. and Archbishops, the Pope and his consistorie of Cardinals are set as gouernours of the vniuersall Church, in whom the Popish Hierarchy so farre forth as it is properly Antichristian, consisteth. For seeing it is proper to Christ alone to be the head and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the vniuersall Church, he is said properly to be Antichrist, who taketh vpon him to be head and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the whole Church. And their gouernement is iustly called Antichristian who are his assistants in this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall gouernement. As for the gouernours of Prouinciall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10663:12"/>
and Diocesan Churches, that is to say, Archbishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are not Antichristian in respect of the large extent of their iurisdiction, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their subordination to the Pope, and dependance from him, as being members of that body whereof they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be the head. And therefore are no more Antichristian then their parish Priests. And as well might the refuter call the Persons or Pastors of parishes among vs, Antichristian, because the Popish parish-Priests are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, as our BB. Antichristian, because the Popish BB. are such. Neither is the function of Bishops, more or yet so much to be ascribed to the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that of parish Ministers. For Bishops, as we shall shew, were ordained by the Apostles, and set ouer Dioceses, but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes were first distinguished in the westerne Churches, and Presbyters peculiarly assigned to them by the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose example other Churches did imitate, as diuerse Authors report.</p>
            <p>Againe, vnder the Deacons the Papists reckon fiue other orders which they esteeme so many Sacraments: whereas we, with the primitiue Church, and in the same sense with it, doe reckon onely 3. orders or degrees of Ministers or Clergy men, Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons. It is strange therefore that the doctrine of my Sermon concerning Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops alone, should vphold the Popish Hierarchy from the highest to the lowest, or as they vse to speake, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope to the Apparitor, as well as our owne. This therefore was a shamelesse vntruth.</p>
            <p>Besides, howsoeuer the same three orders or degrees in name are still retained in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as in ours, yet with great difference. For their Priests be <hi>Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> sacrificing Priests, ordained to offer a proper, externall, reall sacrifice.

               <hi>profitable, and necessarie: that my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face is full of wittie calumniations to make them and their cause odious, and that my Sermon notwithstanding my great boasting, hath in it no one sound syllable of argument to proue my cause, and disproue theirs.</hi> What euidence he bringeth I shall not need here to relate, this defence of my Sermon will make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.

               <note place="margin">¶</note> as before he had said, that in my sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>I vttered scarse any one word of truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">¶</note> The proofes which I haue vsed are such (I take God to witnesse) as satisfie mine owne conscience. And I trust I may, without any great boasting, assume vnto my selfe as good skill to iudge of an argument, as this refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or some others of his side. Of his blasphemie against the truth which I deliuered, I pray God giue him grace to repent. And what was it that he hath thus censured? A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vttered in the presence of God, in the roome of Christ, before a most honourable auditorie, by a Minister of the Gospell, shall I say as sound and faithfull as himselfe, no I disdaine the comparison (for by his fruites in his booke whereby alone I can iudge of him, he hath to my seeming
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10663:14"/>
plainely bewrayed an vnsound iudgement, an euill consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and an vnsanctified heart) I trust I may say, by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Gospell as sound and orthodoxall as his betters, as conscionable in all Sermons &amp; writings, and as carefull to deliuer nothing but the truth of God. Me thinkes he should rather haue trembled to thinke of confuting a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of such a one, as he (iudging according to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charitie) cannot denie to be a faithfull Minister and Orthodoxall diuine, then haue dared thus to censure it, as hauing scarce one word of truth, and not one syllable of a sound proofe. Is this the reuerent estimation that you would worke in the peoples minds of the word preached, or must they thinke that none make conscience of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the truth, but your selues? But if it shall appeare to any indifferent and iudicious Reader, comparing this my defence with his refutation of my Sermon, that hee hath not beene able to disproue any one of my proofes, nor to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince me of any one vntruth throughout the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of my Sermon, as in my conscience I am perswaded he hath not; then doe those two censures of his, the one, that thereis scarce a true word, the other, that there is not one syllable of a sound proofe in all the Sermon, containe so many vntruthes, as there are sentences or proofes in the whole Sermon.</p>
            <p>More particularly he telleth you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 9.</note> both what he did not, and what he hath done. He hath <hi>made no large discourses to teach ouer anew the discipline of Christ</hi> (so hee doubteth not to call their owne deuises) onely he hath said, what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the abortiue booke, and himselfe with their Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iutors were able to say, either for it, or against the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Bishops. The thing which he hath done, is that he hath fulfilled my <hi>desire,</hi> in <hi>applying distinctly his answeres to my arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my desire was not, that he should balke those which he could not answere, or depraue and weak on those which he did, by fitting them to his owne strength. Neither desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I alone that their answeres might be applied to euery argument in order, but also that their proofes might be

produced. But forasmuch as hee had none such as I told them theirs had need to be, that is to say, very pregnant and demonstratiue, whereby they might hope to perswade both the abolishing of that forme of gouernement which euen from the Apostles times hath beene perpetually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the Church, and setting vp of another which was neuer heard of till now of late, therfore in the chiefe points of controuersie he hath beene (for prooe need) very sparing to vse any other proofe besides the testimonies of newe Diuines, who are incompetent witnesses in a question of story concerning things done or not done, 14. or 1500. yeares before their time, themselues also for the most part being parties in the cause.</p>
            <p>Now follow his directions to the Reader. And first, that <hi>he should w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vs seeketh more to be belieued without proofes, I dare appeale to his iudgement, when he hath perused what is alledged on both sides.

            <p>His second direction is vnreasonable, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ad. pag.</hi> 10.</note> and the reasons thereof such as both contradict what he said euen now, and are contradicted by that which he affirmeth afterwards. <hi>If thou findest</hi> (saith he) <hi>no sufficiencie in his reasons to inforce thee to acknowledge his doctrine for true, iustly thinke with thy selfe, it is not else where to be had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an vnreasonable motion, that the weight of the whole cause should lye vpon one short Sermon, vttered by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10663:15"/>
so meane a man as my selfe. What reasons can he bring to perswade the Reader to accept this motion? forsooth, <hi>all men knowe me to be a Scholler.</hi> Not vnlike, for so haue I beene euer since I was fiue yeares old. But what manner of Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, our Refuter will tell you in the very beginning of the confutation of my Sermon, such a one as in this Sermon doe shewe my selfe to <hi>be little worth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">¶</note> 
               <hi>yea miserable poore indeed.</hi> His other reason is, that I hauing professed that I had read the <hi>chiefe treatises on both sides,</hi>
               <note place="margin">¶</note> the Reader may be sure that in my Sermon is <hi>the pith and substance of all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">¶</note> 
               <hi>that all of vs can say, either for our selues, or against them.</hi> But how can this be, seeing he chargeth me to speake without proofe, and that there is not one sound syllable of proofe in all the Sermon, and that I seeke to be credited vpon my bare word, like an other <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> without authoritie or good reason? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it possible, that all, which all of vs can say, can be comprised in so short a Sermon. Wherefore if the Reader be not satisfied with that which I haue written, let him haue recourse to the writings of men more learned and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who are able to giue him better satisfaction. Howbeit, this offer I will make him, that if in my Sermon, and this defence thereof, there be not better euidence for the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall gouernement, then is to be found for the pretended discipline, I say not in the refuters booke, but in all the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Disciplinarians, I will be well content that he shall credit me in nothing.</p>
            <p>There remaineth his Epilogue, consisting, partly of prayer vnto God,<note place="margin">¶</note> that he would <hi>open our eyes to see his truth, and sanctifie our hearts vnto the loue of it,</hi> and that hee would <hi>grant vs his peace</hi>;<note place="margin">¶</note> and partly of <hi>praise</hi> and thankesgiuing, in the last words. Whereunto, as I most willingly subscribe and say <hi>Amen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 17.1.</note> so am I to giue this warning, that we pray not with fained lippes, asking that with our mouthes, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we desire in our hearts, nor seeke in our liues. For it will not suffice vs in that day of the Lord, that we haue desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him either to open our eyes to see the truth, if we doe shut our eyes against it; or to sanctifie our hearts vnto the loue of it, if when our consciences be conuicted with the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10663:16"/>
euidence of truth, we cease not to oppugne it; or to sue for peace, when we be so farre from ensuing it, that when our brethren either speake vnto vs of peace, we make our selues readie to battle, or secke to heale the rupture and Schisme which is in our Church, wee Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus haue I answered his preface. As for his answere to mine, being a meere libell consisting of notorius cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, malicious calumniations, and personall inuectiues: forasmuch as there is not any materiall thing in it, which is not fully answered in the defence of my Sermon, I will not vouchsafe a reply vnto it; the rather, because my defence of the Sermon it selfe being growne to a greater volume then at the first I intended, I should greatly wrong both the Reader and my selfe, if I should hold him, or trouble my selfe with personall discourses, which, if I should followe the refuters veine, would require a newe volume. In making whereof, I would be loth to be imployed, seeing personall quarrells breed endles &amp; fruitles contentions, &amp; being the chiefe blemish of all books of controuersie, ought in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of controuersies wholy to be forborne. Besides, I doe consider, that he being in the darke, and my selfe in the light, it would be a very vnequall combat, for me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him in this kind. Whereinto also though I did knowe his person, as indeed I doe not, I should be loth to descend: seeing thereby we should but present a pleasant spectacle to the common aduersarie, who would take no small delight in beholding vs casting mire and dirt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smere one another, to the disgrace of our common faith.</p>
            <p>But if any shall obiect, that it is a great disgrace and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement vnto me, to passe ouer in silence such reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as in the answere to my preface and confutation of my Sermon hee hath cast vpon me: he shall say nothing, but what mine owne corruption hath alreadie obiected. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I answer, that it behoueth me to commit to the presse, and by it to commend, not onely to the generation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but also to the posteritie; not what my aduersarie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth to heare, but what becommeth me to write: that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10663:16"/>
our Sauiour Christ, by his owne example and precept, hath taught vs, when we are reuiled, not to reuile againe: that in this kind of contention it is better to be vanquished, then to ouercome: that the testimonie of mine owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, &amp; of all that best knowe me, wilbe a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t defence against flanders: that it is a happie thing to be euill spoken of for well doing. For my conscience is clearely and vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolued, that I defend the truth; and it beareth me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that the end which I propounded to my selfe in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing that Sermon, was the peace of the Church; which I hoped to procure by giuing satisfaction to those that were of a contrarie iudgement. Neither doe I doubt, but my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour in this kind (though vngratefull to some whose good I intended) is acceptable to God and to his Church.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in steed of answering that which is past, I will aduise them for the time to come, that if they would be esteemed men of sinceritie, who seeke to keepe their consciences cleare, both towards God &amp; men; they would, when they publish any booke, (especially such as they dare not set their names vnto,) haue especiall regard, that they seeke not to defame or disgrace any mans person; least they make themselues guiltie of that most base and odious crime of libelling, which is so much worse in print then in writing, as the presse is more fit to diuulge then the pen: least they subiect themselues to the fearefull curse of God,<note place="margin">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10663:17"/>
that whereas those, who shall vouchsafe them answere, would if they knewe them, respect them according to the measure of Gods graces, which they should acknowledge in them: by these libelling courses, they drawe vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues such answeres, as are fit to be returned vpon libellers. Truely for my part, if I had knowne the person of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer, and could (in the iudgement of charity) haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him to be a man of a good spirit, I would haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him sometimes with better respect. But seeing I knowe him no otherwise but by his fruites, as he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this worke, wherein he hath shewed himselfe to be, in points materiall, a very cauilling Sophister; and in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters personall, a malicious libeller: let him take such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres as doe not like him, not as directed to his person, which I knowe not, but to the person or vizard vnder which he masketh of a wrangling Sophister, and a spitefull libeller, to whom the sharpest answeres which I haue made, are but too milde.</p>

To which obiection I answere, that if it were true, it would proue the refuter to be but a childish, and yet an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wrangler. Childish, for it is the fashion of wrangling boyes in their Sophemes and disputations, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to answere an argument, to tell the opponent, he had it in such a booke. And it is the part of an odious wrangler to seeke the disgrace of my person, by that which doth no whit aduantage his cause. For what aduantage is this to his cause, to obiect, that my proofes are the same
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10663:19"/>
with <hi>D. Bilsons</hi>; seeing his proofes be such, as neuer were, and neuer wilbe answered. But if the obiection be false, as euery man that compareth the treatises may easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne; then, besides the testimonie of odious wrangling, he shall gaine to himselfe the commendation of a slanderous libeller. For, besides my consent in iudgement with that most reuerend learned man, which I most willingly and gladly professse, there is not any thing almost besides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in diuerse allegations, which should breed any iust occasion of this surmile. And as for them, I doe professe, that the most of them are of mine owne reading, and those, which before I had either not read, or not obserued, I did not content my selfe to alleadge them as it were at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand; but to examine the allegations, and to cite them out of the Authors themselues. So that, although the liquor many times is the same, yet I drewe it at the fountaine, and not at the streame; remembring who saith, <hi>Tardi est ingenij riuulos consectari,</hi>

The former, <hi>what manner of persons are meant by the Angels of the Churches.</hi> And why this question was to be discussed, I alleadged, as he saith, 2. reasons.

               <p>The second reason is propounded <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a secret obiection against the former reason, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10663:21"/>
might be this: though the interpretation be <hi>allegoricall,</hi> yet the exposition of the allegorie is agreed vpon, to wit, that by the Angels are meant the Bishops of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and therefore further explication needeth not: to this I answere in a discretiue sentence, granting the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, but denying the consequence, that, although it be agreed vpon, <hi>that the Angels are the Bishops of the Churches</hi>; yet, in these times it is become a great controuersie, and needfull to bee decided, what manner of Bishops they were, which in former ages was not wont to be called into question.</p>

                     </gap> &amp;c.</hi> Whereunto I haue answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the meaning of the allegory is on both sides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon, and that our aduersaries themselues confesse, that the Angels were the Bishops of the Churches: and therefore, by their owne confession, the text was as fitly chosen, as if it had beene said, the 7. starres are the Bishops of the 7. Churches. <hi>Yea but,</hi> saith he, <hi>though it be granted that the Angels be the Bishops, yet not such Bishops as you speake of.</hi> Then the vnfitnes of the text (be like) is not because it is allegoricall, but because in his conceit it is impertinent. Which his conceit proueth the exposition of this text to be needfull, as I shewed in the second reason.</p>
               <p>Yea, but hereby, saith hee, <q>
                     <hi>the first reason appeareth to be superfluous.</hi>
                  </q>
It followeth not. Of the same thing there are many times giuen two expositions, a shorter called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a larger called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of both there was need in this place. The necessitie of the former ariseth from the allegory, which I breefly expound according to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued interpretation, viz. <hi>that the Angels signifie the Bishops of the Churches.</hi> The necessitie of the latter, ariseth from the controuersie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> which some haue raised in these times, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After hee hath shewed that my first reason might well
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10663:21"/>
haue beene spared, he telleth me, that I<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Whether the Angels vvere 7</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <q>might haue spent my paines better in opening a doubt, which either I did not, or would not see.</q>And what is that I pray you? For it is great pittie, I had not your helpe.<q>  If I would needs haue these Angels to be Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san Bishops, I should haue giuen some reason, why the number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not limited, as well as of the Churches, to seuen &amp; no more.</q>
And from hence reasoneth thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If the holy Ghost by Angels had meant Diocesan Bishops (whereof there is but one in a Church) then would heehaue limited them, as well as the Churches, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of seuen:</p>
                  <p>But he hath not limited them to seuen:</p>
                  <p>Therefore by Angels he meaneth not Diocesan BB.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The assumption he proueth, because <hi>if the holy Ghost had intended to signifie no more but</hi> 7. <hi>Angels, he would haue said, the</hi> 7. <hi>starres are the</hi> 7. <hi>Angels of the</hi> 7. <hi>Churches.</hi> And hauing so doughtily proued that the number of the Angels is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, from thence (as if he had made all Cocke-sure) he inferreth 2. things: 1. that <hi>the holy Ghost, in not limiting the number, would haue vs to vnderstand, there were more Angels or Bishops then</hi> 7. <hi>in these Churches:</hi> 2. that <hi>where euery Epistle is directed to the Angell of each Church as to one, we are not literally to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one, but by a synecdoche more then one.</hi> Which light as he calleth it, <hi>standing at the entry dore,</hi> if I had had his eyes to haue discerned, I should no doubt haue seene an high point in a lowe house.</p>
               <p>But were not I pray you the Angels or BB. to whom <hi>S. Iohn</hi> writeth, iust seuen? helpe me, I beseech you, to remoue this veile, which hideth the light, you speake of from me.

               </p>
               <p>Whereto I answere, that he hath more plainely limited the number, then if hee had said so. For if hee had said, they are the 7. Angels of the 7.

But when hee saith, the 7. starres are the Angels of the 7. Churches: he plainly signifieth, that there were iust so many of them, as of the Churches: that is to say seuen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10663:22"/>Seeing therfore the number of the Angels is limited to seuen, it is not materiall what the refuter inferreth from the not limitation of them.</p>
               <p>And whereas he saith, that by the Angel in each inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are to vnderstand more then one: I would know of him, first, what reason he hath to forsake the grammaticall sense? And where the holy Ghost speaketh but as of one, how he dare without good reason expound him as speaking of more then one?

For whereas they are said to be the Angels of the Churches, we are first to consider what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Churches they were, whereof they were the Angels; and secondly, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of preheminence they had in those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in regard wherof they are called the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Churches.</p>
               <p>As touching the first: wee are to trie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these Churches whereof they were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or BB. were Parishes or Dioceses, and consequently, whether they were Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or Diocesan BB. &amp;c: to pag. 5. own case.</p>
               <p>That these 2. things are offered to our consideration (saith the refuter) wee denie not: but if he had walked with a right foote in the path hee entred into,<note place="margin">For the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer question, 2 things are to be knowne, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Text is explaned.</note> hee should by his Text haue taught vs the meaning of these 2. points, and not quite contrarie, as hee goes about, by these two points to teach vs the meaning of his Text.</p>
               <p>To whom I will not giue that answere which <hi>Festus</hi> did to <hi>Paul,</hi> that too much learning hath made him madde: for hee seemeth not to be greatly sicke of that disease: but I may truely say that too much anger and wrath (which is <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror breuis</hi>) which he vnmeasurably sheweth in this Section, hath made him so to forget himselfe, that hee wrangleth without witte and against sense. Vnlesse any man that is in his wittes will say, that it is not lawfull for a Preacher to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane
<pb facs="tcp:10663:24"/>
his Text. For what was it that in this Section I had in hand? was it not to indeuour the explication of my Text, and to shew what manner of BB: are here meant by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Churches? for the explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof, what could more fitly be propounded, then the consideration of these 2. things? <hi>viz:</hi> what manner of Churches they were, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were the Angels or BB: and what manner of prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence they had in those Churches, in regard wherof they are termed the Angels of the Churches; that from my Text rightly expounded of <hi>Diocesan BB.</hi> I might deduce the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the lawfulnes of their calling, and from it inferre the vse.</p>
               <p>Indeed if I had bene now propounding the doctrine gathered out of the Text, or vrging the vse therevpon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, there had bene reason I should prooue them, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I doe, by the Text already explicated. But when I am about to explicate the Text, &amp; propound the points that are therein questionable to be discussed for the clearing of the Text, who seeth not that the handling of these points is the very explication of the Text, and the Text that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated? And if the Text be that which is explicated, who could bee so senselesse, as either to require that the points should be explaned by the Text, or to finde fault, that by the handling of them the Text is explaned.</p>

               <p>Out of which words they frame this proposition;

                     <hi>They which haue not onely supreme, but also sole authoritie in causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall are absolute Popelings:</hi> hereto they adde an assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their owne, <hi>All Diocesan Bishops, haue not onely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reme, but also sole authoritie in causes Ecclesiasticall</hi>; and from thence inferre their victorious &amp; triumphing conclusion; <hi>therefore all Diocesan Bishops are absolute Popelings.</hi> And this, they say, is mine owne reason, whereby I make Diocesan Bishops absolute Popelings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mine owne reason? in which there is nothing mine, but the proposition, which also is stretched beyond, not onely my meaning, but euen my words? this proposition (I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not) may bee framed out of my words: <hi>they who giue to a Bishop, not onely supreme, but also sole authoritie in causes Ecclesiasticall, doe seeme to set vp an absolute Popeling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which words, if they had bene retained, this might haue bene concluded, if I did giue to our Bishops, both su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and sole authoritie in causes Ecclesiasticall, as I doe not, that then I might seeme to set vp absolute Popelings. But it were well with my aduersaries, if <hi>to seeme,</hi> and <hi>to bee,</hi> were all one. And yet, I doe not so much as seeme, to anie that is wise and indifferent, to make our Bishops, as they say, absolute Popelings. The application of this to the BB. is made in the assumption, which is both false and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and is not mine, but theirs.</p>
               <p>They say, it is not onely impleyed and intended, but is one of the chiefe and principall points I vndertake to proue throughout my Sermon.
But their saying is false and friuolous. How doe they prooue it?<q> For the question bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>(saith our refuter)</hi> whether the Churches should bee gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Pastors and Elders, or by Diocesan Bishops: whereas they say, by Pastors and Elders, adioyning the Elders to the Pastors,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10663:26"/>
and making them both subiect to the whole congregation, &amp;c. M.D. taketh all from them all, and putteth the reynes into his Diocesan alone, so making him by his owne rule the absolute Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here I intreate the Reader, to keepe in store for future vse, the state of the question, as it is here propounded by the refuter. In the meane time, let vs after his owne manner examine his argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The question being whether the Churches should be gouerned by Pastors and Elders </q>(for I will for your credites sake leaue out that Brownisticall and Anabaptisticall dotage concerning the chiefe authoritie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)</p>
               <q>
                  <p> or by Diocesan BB. whosoeuer taketh all from Pastors and Elders, <hi>and (shall I adde)</hi> the people too, and putteth the reynes into the hands of the Diocesan alone, he giueth him not onely supreme but also sole authoritie in causes Ecclesiasticall, and so maketh him an absolute Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>But the question being as I said, M. D. taketh all authoritie from the Pastors, Elders and people, and putteth the reynes into the hands of the Diocesan Bishop alone.</p>
                  <p>Therefore M. D. giueth to the Diocesan, not onely supreme, but also sole authoritie in causes Ecclesiasticall, and so by his owne rule maketh him an absolute Popeling.</p>

First, that I take all authoritie from the Pastors, Elders, and people. The Elders, indeed, I reiect as a new deuise: in the parishioners, I acknowledge some authoritie in choosing, or consenting to the choyse, of some Church-officers; but authoritie to gouerne, much lesse to ordaine, depose, and depriue their Pastor, I know not any. They are the sheepe, which must heare their pastors voyce, and be obedient to their spirituall guides: They are the flocke which must be ruled and taught, not followed and obeyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:10663:27"/>As touching the pastors of parishes, I leaue to them that pastorall power, which euer was granted to them since the first distinguishing of parishes, and allotting of seuerall Presbyters to them, that is to say, both <hi>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>By which power they rule and guide their flocke, not onely in their publike Ministery, but also in their priuate attendance, or if yee will so call it, superintendence, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion shalbe offered. For as touching their publicke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery; they are the leaders and guides of the people in Gods seruice; they preach the word, therein teaching, confuting, instructing, reprouing, correcting their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; they administer the sacraments, as the stewards of Gods house; by the one, admitting into Gods family, those which belong to his couenant; by the other, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing the houshold of Christ, in due season: and both by the word and sacraments, exercising so much of the power of the keyes,<note place="margin">

                  </note> as of right belongeth to them, as well bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the notoriously scandalous and impenitent, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the threatnings of God against them in the word, and by repelling them for the time from the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as also loosing the penitent belieuers, by applying to them the gracious promises of the Gospell, and adding thereto the sacraments as seales.</p>
               <p>So that all power is not taken from the pastors: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is all giuen to the Bishop alone. For in the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, others are ioyned with him: some vnder him, some aboue him. Vnder him, in the mother Church or Cathedrall, the Deane and Chapter, which in the ancient Church as hereafter wee shall shewe, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Archpresbyters, and <hi>presbyteri ciuitatis:</hi> in the other Churches of the Diocesse diuided into seuerall precincts, the Archdeacons and rurall Deanes, gouerning them as the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were wont in the primitiue Church.

Not to speake of the Chancellers and Officials, the former being adioyned to the Bishops, the latter to the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, by reason of their skill in the Ecclesiasticall lawes.

In making where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though the Ecclesiasticall authoritie especially appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, yet neither all the Bishops alone, and much lesse any one Bishop, concludeth any thing, but with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Presbytery. And therefore this may to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer authoritie of Ministers be added, that in making Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall lawes, they haue a voyce, either by themselues, if they be sent to the Synode, or by such as themselues shall choose.</p>

But when besides and aboue the gouernement not onely parishionall but also Diocesan, we acknowledge a superiour authoritie in the Archbishop and his courts, in the prouinciall synodes, especially that authoritie of making Church-lawes, whereby both Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses and parishes are to be ruled: it is apparent, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I did take all authoritie from parish-bishops and their Elders, yet it would not follow that I giue the whole authoritie Ecclesiasticall to the Diocesan alone.</p>

So that in this section are 2. things, first the proposition of the second point, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preheminence of BB. in respect whereof they were called the Angels of the Churches, secondly, a reason thereof. To the proposition he answereth,<q> 
                     <hi>that they had this name Angels, in regard of their generall calling of the ministerie, not because of any soueraignetie or supremacie ouer other their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Ministers, as (he saith) I imply here, and plainely but vntrue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme afterwards.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by disproouing the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian discipline, wherein I intended a disiunctiue argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, that (the question beeing, whether the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were gouerned by presbyteries, as they say, consisting for the greater part of Lay-men, or by BB: as wee holde,) the disproofe of their presbyteries, might bee a proofe for our Bishops: and also <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, by shewing what the authoritie of the Angels or ancient Bishops was, as well <hi>extensiuè,</hi> against our newe disciplinarians, (<hi>viz:</hi>) that the Churches whereof they were Byshops, were Dioceses, and themselues Diocesan Bishops; as <hi>intensiuè,</hi> against the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and more learned disciplinarians, that BB. were superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to other Ministers, not onely in order, but in degree also. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And for the proofe of the 2 Assertion, which is a doctrine arising out of the Text before explaned, concerning the lawfulnesse of the Bishops calling, this is proposed to bee proued, that <hi>the fanction of Byshops, is of Apostolicall and diuine institution</hi>; and this, as in the ende of the Section is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, was the thing chiefely intended by mee.

The refuter by a forced A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalysis, hath put the frame of the Sermon out of frame, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe worke.</note>Beholde, to how great trouble too much Learning will put a man! <hi>Nimia est miseria doctum esse hominem nimis.</hi> If his skill in the <hi>Analysis</hi> of a Treatise had not bene extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, all this stirre had bene needlesse. But if you marke the ende of his ouerbusying himselfe in resoluing my Sermon, and then putting the endes together to make vp his owne frame, perphaps he will not seeme so skilfull in resoluing, as wilfull in dissoluing the same. The end of his double dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, appeareth in the sequele to haue bene double.</p>
               <p>For first, whereas there are of the fiue points which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, two of principall vse, seruing directly, the one to disproue their Presbyterian discipline, the other to approue the gouernement by Bishops, (both which, hee could wish that I had spared) hee would faine make his Reader belieue, that of these two,<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> the former, is impertinent; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, superfluous;<note place="margin">Pag. 107.</note> or as else-where hee speaketh, the former bootlesse, the other needlesse. 2. When hee could not tell how to wrangle with the other 3. points, hee bringeth them to his frame,<note place="margin">Pag. 53.70.84.</note> as it were to the racke: first, finding fault, that they doe not directly prooue, that which hee would haue them: and then, by torture, making them to say what hee pleaseth, that he may the more easily contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict them.</p>
               <p>To countenance these sophisticall shifts, he hath brought my Sermon to the Smiths forge, and hauing hammered it well, hee hath reduced the whole body of it into one syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, with the proofs thereof. Vsing this syllogisme for the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10663:34"/>
parts of my Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the tyrant vsed his bed for his ghests, cutting off those parts which seeme to reach ouer, and ret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out those which seeme to come short.</p>
               <p>But let vs examine his Syllogisme which with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syllogisme of the assumption hee propoundeth as the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysis of the whole body of my Sermon. <hi>The function of the Bishops of the seauen Churches is lawfull and good, &amp;c.</hi> I doe not deny but that out of diuerse places of my Sermon patched together, some such Syllogisme as this may be framed. But in Analysing we must respect, not what we can deuise or collect, but what the writer did intend, and our Analysis must be answerable to his Genesis. It is apparant that I propounded two things to be distinctly proued, the one as the explication of the text shewing what manner of Bishops the Angels were: the other as a doctrine collected out of the text, concerning the qualitie of their function, viz. that the calling of Diocesan Bishops is lawfull and good. This, which I propounded as a doctrine to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the text, pag. 2. and as a conclusion to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the last part, pag. 55. and is indeed not the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the conclusion of the Syllogisme which himselfe frameth, he would against sense make the Reader belieue was by me propounded as the proposition of his Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme. As for the proposition which he assigneth to me, I did not expresse, but tooke it for granted in the collection of the doctrine out of the text, which may be collected af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: <hi>Bishops are such as are here meant by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Churches, therefore their function is lawfull and good.</hi> Of which collection if any man should make doubt, the consequence would be proued by the addition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. <hi>The calling of such, as are here meant by the Angels of the Churches, is lawfull and good, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore as there were two distinct parts propounded by me, so if he had drawne the same into two distinct Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logismes concluding the same question, and not confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the parts of the Sermon to make the principall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thereof to seeme heterogeneall or superfluous, he had not much missed of my proiect. The former Syllogisme as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10663:35"/>
I haue said might be this.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The calling of such as are here meant by the Angels is lawfull and good.</p>
                  <p>Diocesan BB. are such as are here meant by the Angels, therefore the calling of Diocesan BB. is lawfull and good.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The proposition I tooke for granted, and therefore did not expresse it. The assumption is the same with the former assertion, and is proued by the foure first points. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion I did not expresse, being implyed in the collection of the doctrine out of the text.</p>
               <q>The latter <hi>Syllogisme</hi> is this. That calling which is of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall and diuine institution is lawfull and good:</q>
               <p>The calling of Diocesan BB. is of apostolical &amp; diuine institution, Therefore it is lawfull and good: of this <hi>Syllogis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> the assumption, is the same with the fift point here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p>So that of the fiue points, which I propounded, not any one is either impertinent or superfluous, the foure former seruing to proue the former assertion which is the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> the fift and last being the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the second <hi>Syllogisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the second <hi>Syllogisme</hi> which he assigneth to me, I vtterly disclaime it: because as no one part thereof is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by me, so both the premisses are false and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to my meaning. For neither to the Angels of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor to the Bishops, doe I ascribe that sole power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and iurisdiction which he speaketh of, as after shall appeare.</p>
               <p>But that his Analysis of my Sermon was meerely forced against the light of his owne conscience, appeareth, first, by the quarrels which thereout he hath raised, seeing by his Analysis, of the fiue parts the first seemeth impertinent, the last superfluous, the three in the middes not prouing that for which as he saith they are brought. For could he perswade himselfe that his <hi>Analysis</hi> or resolution was answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to my <hi>Genesis</hi> or composition of the Sermon, when he saw two parts of the fiue could not be brought to his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10663:35"/>
frame, and the other three not to be sutable vnto it? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the distribution of my Sermon, and the transitions which I vse, wholy disagreeing from his <hi>Analysis.</hi> Thirdly, by the <hi>Analysis</hi> propounded here by my selfe, and by the defence of the seuerall parts here ensuing, wherein I shall by the helpe of God manifestly proue, that neither the first of the fiue was impertinent, nor the last superfluous, nor the other three concluding besides the purpose. But now we are to intreate of them seuerally, hauing first giuen you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that he diuideth the body of my Sermon as he calleth it into fiue parts, &amp; euery part into diuerse sections: as namely, the first, which concerneth the Eldership, into eight sections, in all which the summe of that which I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is this, that there were no other Presbyters in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, but Ministers.</p>

And charitie would (which selfe loue would not) that if he discerned not the affinitie of this point with his pretended assumption; he should rather haue suspected his owne Analysis to be forced, then haue blamed me for his owne want of iudgement. But that he may discerne this passage concerning Elders to be pertinent to the matter in question; I would but intreat him, to take notice what is in question betweene vs. The question, discussed in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, is twofold. The first <hi>de facto,</hi> whether the primitiue Church were gouerned by Diocesan Bishops, as we say; or by Presbyteries of such Elders, as they spake of. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>de iure,</hi> whether the Church may lawfully be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Bishops, as we hold; or must needs be gouerned by their Presbyteries, as they affirme. The first questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the former part of the Sermon, the second in the latter.</p>
               <p>The question debated in the former part of the Sermon, I say againe, is this; whether the primitiue Churches were gouerned by Diocesan Bishops, such as (for the substance of their calling) ours be; or by such Presbyteries, as the Presbyterians stand for. And those, either parishionall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the Parish-Bishop, and a company of lay or onely gouerning Elders, as the new and shallow sort of disciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians doe boldly, though ignorantly affirme: or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in the cities, consisting of the president and other Presbyters, whereof some are Ministers, but the greater some lay or onely gouerning Elders, as the Elder and more learned sort of disciplinarians doe teach.</p>

                  </note> as the Phylosopher saith. And that this is the question betweene vs, the refuter hath truely wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed in respect of the parts of the disiunction, though in the latter he falsifieth my assertion, where he saith, <hi>the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion betweene vs is, whether the Churches should be gouerned by Pastors and Elders, or by Diocesan Bishops.</hi> The question in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>de facto</hi> for the time past, is, whether the primitiue Church were gouerned by Diocesan BB. or such Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as they speake of. The question <hi>de iure</hi> respecting also the time present and to come, is, whether the Church may or should be gouerned by Bishops as we say, or must be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by their Presbyteries, as they affirme. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being the question, whether by our Bishops, or their Presbyteries, and this question implying a necessarie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction: who seeth not that the disproofe of their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, is a direct proofe for our Bishops. The disiunctiue argumentation standeth thus.</p>
               <q>Either the primitiue Church was gouerned by Diocesan Bishops, or by such Presbyteries as they stand for: But not by such Presbyteries as they stand for: Therefore by Diocesan Bishops.</q>
               <p>The proposition is implyed in the very question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs: and the disiunction is therein by both parties presupposed as necessarie.</p>
               <p>The assumption is, that first point of the fiue, which now we haue in hand. The conclusion determineth the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which in the former part of the Sermon was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be proued, viz. that the primitiue Church was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by Diocesan Bishops.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:10663:37"/>This passage therefore concerning Lay-Elders, will I hope be acknowledged not to be impertinent.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The summe of that which in the Sermon was said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Lay-Elders.</note>Now that the Church was not gouerned by such Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries as they speake of, I proued in this passage. Because howsoeuer with great vehemencie the Presbyterian disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline by lay or only gouerning Elders hath beene by them vrged and obtruded vpon vs; yet they are not able to proue that euer there were any Presbyters which were not Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>For, the question, which now we haue in hand, being, whether there were any such Presbyters in the primitiue Church, as were not Ministers: forasmuch as the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians are the opponents and plaintiffes, not onely holding the affirmatiue, that there were such, but vehemently vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that still there ought to be such; we contrariwise the respondents and defendants, holding the negatiue, to wit, that neither there were such, nor now need to be: the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore is to vnderstand, that, this burden of prouing, lieth vpon them which hold and vrge the affirmatiue, that there were and still ought to be Lay-Elders: and that in vs it is a sufficient proofe of the negatiue, if we can maintaine, that they are not able to proue the affirmatiue. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all their proofes may be reduced to two heads, for either they be such testimonies where the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Presbyter is named, or where at the least the function it selfe is (as they suppose) meant; to these two heads there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I oppose two contrarie assertions. The one, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Presbyter, doth alwayes signifie a Minister: the other, that there is no one pregnant testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie mentioning or meaning the lay or onely gouerning Elder. The former of them, being affirmatiue, I doe briefly confirme by three reasons; the latter, being such a negatiue as cannot otherwise be proued (for the induction of the particulars were infinite) I doe therefore maintaine it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the principall instances of the aduersaries. And this is the summe of this passage. Now I come to his cauils, with the particulars.</p>

               <q>If in the writings of the Apostles, the ancient fathers and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In the antecedent of the proposition he noteth two parts:<note place="margin">

For though it alway sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a Minister, yet it may also signifie him that is no Minister.</hi> But in mine vnderstanding, if it alwaies signifie a Minister, it neuer signifieth him that is not a Minister.

               <p>And much lesse the other.

because by common speech a priest was taken for a Sacrificer, and the Translators had no other name, whereby to call the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Lawe, but priests, to make and obserue that difference which the holie Ghost alwayes obserueth in the Newe Testament, they call the one Priests, the other Elders.
<hi>But if they had called the one Sacrificers, and the other priests, that priests might haue bene knowne to differ from Sacrificers, it had bene a small matter, and perhaps hindered you of this vaine quarrell.</hi> It is not a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish abuse therefore to call Ministers priests, but to giue the name priest, to Sacrificers.</p>

               <p>But how I pray you doth hee conuince mee of falshood? with an <hi>if</hi> begging the question, <q>if Presbyter doth not signifie onely a Minister, then question may be made of Lay-Presbyters, though not of annuall Ministers or Lay-Priests.</q>
As if hee should haue said, if you will graunt mee the question, and denie that which you haue already prooued, and I could not answere, then I shalbe able to charge you with vntruth. Yea, <q>
                     <hi>but the vntruth of my speech was before manifest in the former

part of the answere to the proposition</hi>
                  </q>.
His words there, be these: that the <q>consequence is weake, because there might be other Presbyters in the primitiue Church, though the word Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did euermore signifie a Minister.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that this was but a poore shift for want of proofe to referre the Reader as oft he doth to another place, where he should find little to the purpose. In both places, as you see, all that he can say is, that seeing it might be there were Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters that were not Ministers, and if there were such, which I haue disproued, then that would appeare to be false, which I haue proued to be most true.</p>
               <p>I come to his third accusation:<note place="margin">

                  <q>It would be noted <hi>saith he,</hi> with what contempt and scorne he calleth the Elders in question, Lay-annuall-onely-gouerning Elders.</q>
And it would be noted say I, with how bad a conscience he wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praueth the manner of vttering my words, to giue some small colour both to his vnconscionable denyall of the proposition which himselfe contradicted in answere to the assumption; and also to this forged calumniation. For whereas I propounded the words distinctly with a Comma or note of distinction, lay, annuall, onely-gouerning Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, vsing these diuers titles more fully and certainely to expresse whom I meant; he hath ioyned them with notes of vnion <q>
                     <hi>Lay-annuall-onely-gouerning Elders</hi>
                  </q>, as if I had in contempt &amp; scorne of them, framed a nickname for them, compounded of all these words.</p>
               <p>And whereas he saith, that I call them lay<q> in disgrace of the Elders, and reproach of those who stand for them, as though they committed the gouernement of the Church to such as are base and priuate persons: </q>the truth is, that he disgraceth the laitie intollerably, as if there were no lay persons but base and priuate men.
Indeed if I had said, that such men as be not of the Clergie, are to be called <hi>idiotae,</hi> (as some of your side would haue them called, rather then lay men) you might haue had some colourable pretence for this accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

as priuate, and men of excellent gifts as well as Idiots.</p>
               <p>And it is but a seely exception, which you doe vsually make, that you would not haue them called <hi>lay,</hi> but <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.</hi> For first, that word doth not distinguish them from the Ministers. And secondly, because <hi>Ecclesia the Church,</hi> being diuided into the Clergie, and laitie, those which be lay men (as not being of the Clergie,) may haue Ecclesiasticall offices, and in regard thereof may be called Ecclesiasticall officers, as Church wardens among vs, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, Chancellers, and commissioners in causes Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall, as well as your Elders, whom though you make Ecclesiasticall officers, yet you cannot denie them to be Lay-Elders.</p>

               <p>Where the words of the abortiue booke seemed bitter and spitefull enough,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 1.</note> there our refuter followeth that copy: otherwise to that potion of worme-wood, he addeth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of gall, as in this place.
<q>It is strange <hi>saith the abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue booke,</hi> that a man of such skill in logicke as I acknowledge D.

For if we cannot answere his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, nor take away his answeres, let vs disgrace his person: so will our followers be sure to preiudge any thing he saith, and which is our desire, the people whom he thought to satisfie, shalbe kept in the same tearmes they were wont. But my purpose is not by reciting his words to spread this part of his spitefull libell, and much lesse by vouchsafing an answere to multiply words in this kind with so odious a wrangler. To passe by therefore his barking eloquence, or dogge-rhetoricke, the reader is to vnderstand that in this section and those which follow, I endeuour to defend the two former assertions, viz. that they can neither proue that the word Presbyter doth signifie any but a Minister, nor yet produce any one pregnant testimonie mentioning or meaning their lay or onely-gouerning-Elders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:10663:44"/>Now I would know of my aduersarie for my learning, how such a negatiue as this should be maintained. Whether, by induction of particulars, or by speciall insisting vpon the instances which the aduersaries giue: not the former, for that were to examine euery sentence in the scriptures, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and fathers, which were infinite. If the latter, should I in one of the least parts intended in the Sermon, where I had promised breuitie, stand vpon euery particular allegation which could hardly haue beene discussed in a whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? or should I make choise of some of the principall, which are of more weight then all the rest? the latter course I was necessarily to make choise of. And therefore suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our opposites to insist on those two testimonies, which are of more weight then all the rest, yea then all, that all of them can say besides in this cause, I endeuoured to defend my assertions against them. And although I did not intend to dispute Syllogistically as the opponent, but to defend the truth as the respondent; yet this my defensiue answere is brought to the anuill, and forged into a Syllogisme after this manner.</p>

First at my want of modestie, in that I gloriously despise, and insolently reiect the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of those diuines, who besides those two, alledge many other testimonies, when I say, I esteeme these two onely worth the answering. Whereunto I answere, that I esteemed no other, <hi>in that shortnesse of time,</hi> worthy to be stood vpon but those two.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:10663:44"/>And if that answere will not suffice him, I plainely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and yet without despising the iudgement of any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, that these two testimonies are the two maine pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, whereon their whole building leaneth: and that, as their other testimonies depend vpon the presupposall of these as giuing witnesse to their Lay-Elders: so these being taken from them, the rest haue scarcely any probabilitie in them, but may as easily be reiected, as obiected. And this I will say, because I am so indignely prouoked, that if my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, or any of his copartners, can produce but any one testimonie, either out of scriptures, or fathers, that either may be compared with either of these, or that in it selfe, without an eye to these, hath so much as any shew of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary or demonstratiue proofe, I will then be content, that they should wonder, &amp; wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der again, at my want of modestie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he wonders at my want of logicke in making so feeble a consequence. The consequence, though it be not absolutely necessarie, yet vpon supposall, that these are the two chiefe proofes, without which, all they can say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides for their Elders, is scarce worth the answering, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie. For, if any testimonies proue their Elders, then certainely the chiefe, and which be, as it were, all in all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he wondreth at the weake proppe, whereby this consequence is vnderset; which is my vnfained pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that to my knowledge, there were onely these two allegations, which I esteemed (in that shortnesse of time) worth the answering; which was reason sufficient for my insisting on those two alone. If this proppe be so weake, let his knowledge, and the skill of all his adherents, shew but one other testimonie comparable to these two. But that he may leaue both wondring and wandring, I doe againe plainely and confidently affirme, that the whole cause of the Lay-Elders relieth on these two places; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in the former negatiue assertion I did imply; so now I expresse, a challenge to him and all his partakers, to produce any one such testimonie if they can. This chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge I say was implyed, when I professed that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alledge out of the scriptures, Councels, or Fathers, any

one pregnant testimonie mentioning or meaning, any lay, or onely gouerning Elders.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In which words, though he dares not, as you see, accept the challenge, yet he setteth a good face vpon it. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I said, and say againe, that besides these two testimonies, they can produce no more of any moment in comparison; he saith, that hee both could and would produce many more. He would, I doe not doubt, if he could: but because he doth not, you may be assured, he cannot. What he, and all of them can doe, he performeth afterwards, when he will let you see that they can strike also; and yet that all, is as nothing to these two.</p>
               <p>The reasons of his refusall are two; the one, because <q>
                     <hi>others before now, haue said enough to that purpose</hi>
                  </q>; but that I denied vpon certaine knowledge. And what they haue said to any purpose, hath beene confuted also before now; and that, though often repeated, and oft refuted, as threed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare as it is, himselfe doth afterwards produce, hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say, that hath so much as a good shew of a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie proofe, as hereafter shall appeare.
The other, because <q>he being the answerer onely, and not the opponent, it is not his part, neither can it reasonably be expected at his hands, that he should dispute the questions, but onely defend the truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The which is a sophisticall, and if I may freely speake what I truely thinke, a lewde shift, to elude my answeres and the reasons thereof, and to delude the vnlearned Reader.</p>
               <p>For who I pray you, be the opponents and plaintiffes in this controuersie, wee or they? Those which be in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session doe not vse to be plaintiffes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:10663:45"/>Neither would there haue beene any controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs, if they did not oppose: forasmuch therefore as they are the opponents, vrging the pretended discipline; we the defendants maintaining the established discipline among vs; it is a sufficient defence of our cause, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where wee hold the negatiue, if wee shewe that their proofes are not sufficient; and their proofes are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, which doe not necessarily and ineuitably proue, that which they vrge.</p>
               <p>Neither let them euer hope to bring in their Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, till they haue necessarily proued that they ought to be admitted.</p>
               <p>But the lewdnes of this shift is then most manifest, when as I <hi>ex professo</hi> vndertaking to answere their obiections, he will needs make me the opponent: and where it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, necessarily to proue what they say, and is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for me, to shew that their proofe is not necessarie; absurdly, against all order of disputation, he maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the respondent, and me the opponent. So that my answeres must be put into Syllogismes, and his proofes be thought sufficient, if he can but say, that they make not against his cause, though they doe not proue it. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this shamefull dealing wee shall not want long. For in the discussing of their allegation out of 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. which is their chiefe obiection, it is most manifest, that they are the opponents, and I the answerer. But my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie maketh me the opponent, and my answeres must be oppositions, and so put into Syllogismes: and in the end as you shall see, whereas that is the onely place in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they can with any shew of necessarie proofe alledge for their Elders; hee would make the Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that he hath acquited himselfe well, if their Elders be not necessarily disproued out of that place. When indeed, if they be not necessarily and ineuitably proued out of it, they haue no ground nor warrant for them in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Againe in my preface (where the refuter vnderstandeth me to haue made a challenge,<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.</note> &amp; as it were to haue cast down
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10663:46"/>
the gantlet) as I desired they would distinctly answere my arguments, so also that they would produce their proofes, (for it is an easier thing to pull downe, at least to seeme so, then to set vp:) in his answere to my preface, he accepteth of the offer, acknowledging that I <q>
                     <hi>desire nothing but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>;</q> and doth not onely promise to satisfie my desire, but also beareth the Reader in hand, that hee hath brought <q>
                     <hi>sound demonstrations, pregnant proofes, arguments strongly grounded vpon the scriptures, &amp;c:</hi>
                  </q> but now, when he should come to the performance, when I againe renew the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge; auerring, that they haue no such proofes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting that he should produce them, if he haue any: his answere is, that alas he is the respondent, and it cannot with any reason be exspected, that he should bring proofes or dispute the questions.</p>
               <p>And that you may yet more fully note the absurditie of this disputer, (of whose great acts in this booke, I heare no small vants) though he say, it is not his part to produce proofes, neither can it with reason be exspected of him, which afore he confessed to be reason: yet this is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of needfull proofes, whereby hee might proue something, which is by vs denied. But if there be any thing, which seemeth to make for his cause, and which we freely confesse, as for example, the consent of diuerse protestant writers with them in some things, there he will be sure, to be plentifull in prouing of that, which no man doth denie.</p>
               <p>And this is the chiefe thing, which he and his consorts in compiling this booke, haue laboured. As if they should haue said: doe you indeed grant, that diuerse protestant writers expound such and such places as we doe? and doe you not denie, but that diuerse of them agree with vs in some things? Mary that will we proue at large, and although reason grounded on scripture, testimonie of antiquitie, and no small consent of newe writers be against vs: yet we will make a faire muster of those newe writers which be for vs: and though the greatest part of them be parties in the cause as well as our selues, yet we will alledge them as witnesses without exception, and will neuer haue done with alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10663:46"/>
their testimonies. For though the learned will easily discerne the desperatenesse of our cause, yet the vnlearned sort, who are carried away with shewes, seeing such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of learned men on our side, will still cleaue vnto vs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this shall suffice</hi> (saith hee) <hi>for his proposition. To his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption I answere, by denying it, and affirming that both these places doe speake of onely gouerning Elders, and that I will cleare</hi> (as the opponent, no doubt) <hi>by the places themselues, which now come to be handled.</hi>

Wherevnto I answere, that not any of the Fathers, nor any other before our age, did euer vnderstand this text of anie other, but of the Ministers of the word; they conceiuing of it, as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle had saide, Let those Ministers or Priests which rule well, &amp;c.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THeir reason briefly standeth thus: The Apostle in this place, doth set downe 2. sorts of Elders, the one, onely ruling; the other labouring also, in the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:10663:47"/>Therefore besides the Ministers which laboured in the Word and Doctrine, there were other <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Elders, which were no Ministers.</p>
               <p>This, as I sayd, is the principall reason that is alleadged for the Lay-Elders, wherewith the Disciplinarians doe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully please themselues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T. B.</hi> is so confident, that hee iudgeth them to be of no sound iudgement that will not acknowledge two sorts of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be contained in this place.<note place="margin">

C.</hi> setting some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour vpon <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. to make it shewe for Lay-Elders, at length he saith, Why should wee follow coniectures? when <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. doth declare what these Elders are? The author of the counterpoison affirmeth, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in expresse words, doth in this place set downe their two sorts of Elders. And this is vsuall with them all, to confirme their exposition of other places which are ambiguous, by this which they esteeme most cleare.</p>
               <p>To their reason I answered, by denying their antecedent, and because I would not shake off the opponents with a bare deniall as enemies, but satisfie them as bretheren, I yeelded some reasons of my deniall, which I set downe in 2. degrees. For whereas they vrge the Lay-Elders, as necessarily collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of this place;</p>
               <p>First, I answere, there is no necessitie that the place should be vnderstood of any other but Ministers. And secondlie, that this place is so farre from concluding Lay-Elders, that it doth exclude them, or conclude against them.</p>
               <p>The former againe, I maintaine by two reasons: The which I can well bee content that my aduersary shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into Syllogismes, so hee would frame them, as beeing the reasons of a respondent, that is, such as bee propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to shew that there is no necessitie of their inference from this Text. For that as I saide, is a sufficient defence for the respondent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:10663:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>The first reason is this;
<q>If none of the Fathers, nor any other before our age, did euer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this text of Lay-Elders, but all with one consent, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of it, as spoken onely of Ministers: Then is it not necessary, nor yet likely, that Lay-Elders are meant in this place.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For surely if there had beene anie such Elders in the Apostles times, the ancient Fathers, which were neere those times, had bene more likely to haue noted these two sortes of Elders, then those who came so manie hundred yeares after.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But none of the ancient Fathers, nor any other before our age, euer vnderstood this Text of Lay-Elders: but all with one consent, conceiued of it as spoken of Ministers.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is not necessarie, nor yet likely, that Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are here meant.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Of this Syllogisme he denyeth both the the parts.<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 2 <hi>Ad Pag.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note> And of his deniall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the consequence in the proposition, hee giueth three reasons.</p>
               <p>The first, because wee <hi>may not argue negatiuely, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the sense of the Scriptures, from the authoritie of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherevnto I answere, that I argue as affirmatiuely from the consent of the Fathers, and of all before our age, who alwaies conceiued of these words, as if the Apostle had said, <hi>Let the Ministers or Priests which rule well, &amp;c:</hi> as negatiuely: Neither doe I reason as he would make me to argue, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because this place is not by the Fathers expounded, of Lay-Elders, therefore that exposition is necessarily to be reiected: or because it is alwaies by them interpreted, as spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Ministers onely: Therefore this interpretation is necessarily to be receiued. But thus I reason, that this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is more likely, which hath the perpetuall and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall consent of the Fathers, and of all writers before our age, then that which not onely hath not their allowance, but is cleane contrarie to their interpretation.</p>
               <p>Wherevnto I now adde that, which my aduersarie will neuer be able to answere.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:10663:48"/>
                  <p>That exposition of the word <hi>Presbyters. 1. Tim. 5.17.</hi> which is agreable to the perpetuall vse of the word in Scriptures, Councells, and Fathers, is to be admitted, <hi>and contrariwise,</hi> that exposition thereof, which cannot bee warranted by any one example or testimony, either of Scriptures, Councells, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (it being a word in all of them of frequent vse) may not be admitted, and much lesse vrged, as the onely true sense of that place.</p>
                  <p>But by the word Presbyteri to vnderstand the Ministers of the Word and Sacraments alone, is an exposition thereof, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the perpetuall vse of the word, in Scriptures, Councels, and Fathers; and not one testimony can be alleadged, where the word (signifying an Ecclesiasticall function) doth import any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but a Minister: <hi>and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywise,</hi> to vnderstand the word Presbyters in that place, as containing in the signification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Lay-Elders, is such an exposition of that word as cannot be warranted by any one example or testimony, either of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Councels, or Fathers.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the former interpretation, expounding that word of Ministers alone, is to be receiued; and the other, including Lay-Elders, is not to be admitted, and much lesse is it to be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as the onely true sense of that place.</p>
               </q>
               <p>For my part, vntill my aduersarie shall bee able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue this assumption by some one instance, which I am well assured hee shall neuer be able to doe: I will take it for graunted, and in my conscience am fully resolued, that the Apostles meaning in this place, is all one, as if he had said; <hi>Let the Ministers or Priests which rule well, &amp;c</hi>: which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if no more could bee added, is sufficient to shew, that Lay-Elders cannot be prooued out of this Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. His 2. reason, because their exposition fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring Lay-Elders, hath the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of new writers.</note>His second reason is this:
<q>
                     <p>That interpretation which hath the consent of the new writers, though contrary to the exposition of the Fathers, is to be preferred before that which hath the consent of the Fathers.</p>
                     <p>The Interpretation of the word Presbyters, as implying Lay-Elders, hath the consent of new writers.</p>
                     <p>Therefore that is to bee preferred. The proposition is propounded.

pag. <hi>20.</hi> lin. <hi>22. &amp;c: the assumption is set downe,</hi> pag. <hi>16.</hi> lin. <hi>17.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To the parts of which syllogisme before I answere, I must knowe of the disputer, whether he meane the consent of all the new writers, or not, for if the word <hi>all</hi> bee not added, the proposition is absolutely to be denied. For it is against sense, that the opinions of some new writers should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, not onely to other, and perhaps as many, and as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned new writers; but also to the generall and perpetuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all writers before our time. If it be added, then is the assumption manifestly false. For that exposition hath not the consent of all, nor as I am perswaded, of the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant diuines. Notwithstanding, hee endeuoureth to prooue both.</p>
               <p>That the proposition is true,<note place="margin">His propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> examined, and whether the authority of old writers, or new is to be preferred.</note> hee appealeth to my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Whence he shall receiue this resolution. Where the contrary expositions of the old and new writers concerne a point of doctrine, I would not encline to the authoritie of the new, vnlesse they haue better reason then the olde. For where the question is simplie of authoritie, which is the greater; I say with the Philosopher, that whereas witnesses be of two sorts <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ancient are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test credit. If it concerne a matter of story or fact, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any Lay-Elders in the primitiue Church, or not; I would without comparison, giue credit to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers, who liued in, or neere those times, then to them who liued 13. or 14. hundred yeares after them.</p>
               <p>Yea, but <q>the points being in question in these dayes, and not in the Fathers, the newe writers haue beene the more occasioned to search into them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Tell me then, why was not this point called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in the Fathers times? Was it not because there was none to contradict their iudgement? And doth not this proue, that the Assertion, which in this cause is opposite to antiquitie, is to be condemned of noueltie?</p>
               <p>Againe, you say the iudgement of the new writers is to be preferred, because they haue more searched into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

as being now in question.</p>
               <p>Wherevnto I answere, that in this very respect, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ancient is to bee preferred, for the reason which the Philosopher giueth in the place before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. <gap reason="foreign">

For it were foolish presumption to rely vpon their iudgements, who, either did not write of it, or whose writings are not extant, whereby their iudgement might be knowne. Secondly, that I am in this point the respondent, answering their allegation out of this place; and that the refuter is the opponent; who, if he will say any thing to the purpose, must proue by good instance the affirmatiue, <hi>that some one of the Fathers, or some other before our age hath expounded this place of Lay-Elders</hi>; and not absurdly vrge me, being the respondent, to proue the negatiue; which as it cannot be otherwise proued, but by alledging, <hi>that no instance can be giuen to the contrarie</hi>; so might it be easily disproued by any one instance, if any such could be giuen.

               <p>But I thought it sufficient to insist in this one exposition, which seemeth to me to haue beene the very meaning of the Apostle. For seeing the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or Presbyter, as it noteth an Ecclesiasticall person, doth alwaies in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, in the writings both of the Apostles &amp; Fathers, signifie a Minister or Priest, and no one testimonie can be alledged to the contrarie: what sense is there, that it should otherwise be expounded here, vnlesse the other words of the sentence did inforce so much.

I had once thought, that the especiall dueties of a Minister had here beene mentioned, the one respecting his behauiour onely; the other, the ministerie of the word, vnto which all the duties of a Minister may be referred. But I did consider, it would be obiected, that the meaning of the Apostle was not, that double honour should be giuen to Ministers, that onely liued well, vnlesse they did also preach: for in another place where he would haue Ministers to be honored and loued <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>vnfitly and vnkindly</hi>
                  </q>. vnfitly,
when I say the Apostle doth here note two duties of Ministers, <q>
                     <hi>the one generall, the other speciall. What logicke or reason is there in this kind of speech,</hi> saith he. <hi>What opposition betwixt these two duties?</hi> 
                  </q>so much is he set vpon opposition and diuision, that hee thinkes there is no reason in that speech, where is no opposition.</p>
               <p>And what is the logicke that this logicaster doth teach me? forsooth I should haue said, <hi>that the Apostle first spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Ministers dutie in generall, and afterwards in speciall.</hi> Thus, in disprouing the manner of my speech he doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly approue it: such is his iudgement. For if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle first speaketh of the dutie in generall, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in speciall; then doth hee speake of two duties, the one generall, the other speciall. For when you speake of a dutie in generall, doe you not meane a generall dutie? and when you mention a dutie in speciall, doe you not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10663:53"/>
meane a speciall dutie?
Yes, your selfe doe speake so pag. 25. where you say, <q>
                     <hi>the duties are in the former clause, generall; in the latter, speciall.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Neither doth that need to offend you, that I call them two, when you speake of them in the same place in the plurall number. For if the one be not the other, as you will grant, then there is no question, but they are two. But, if want of opposition was the fault of my speech, what opposition I beseech you is in yours? or what lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke was in this, to require opposition betwixt the whole and the part? or if you conceiued of <hi>Dutie</hi> as the <hi>Genus,</hi> and of this speech as a distribution thereof, what logicke was it, not to discerne an opposition in a distribution of duties into generall and speciall? for <hi>generall</hi> and <hi>speciall</hi> I hope be opposite.</p>
               <p>All this notwithstanding, my logicke maister chideth me for want of logicke.<q> If a man <hi>saith he</hi> should say, there are two duties of a Logician, the one generall, to reason well, the other speciall, to iudge well, would he not be thought to speake of logicke, without logicke?</q>
Yes verily, if in so spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hee should intend a perfect distribution of logicall duties: Which, notwithstanding your cauills, might thus be performed.</p>
               <p>The duties of a Logician are either generall, as that which is comprehended in the definition of Logicke, <hi>to reason well:</hi> or speciall, as those which be contained in the distribution of Logicke, <hi>to inuent well, and to iudge well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, if in imitation of the Apostles speech, you should say, <hi>Logicians that reason well, that is all good Logicians, are to be honoured, especially those which are iudicious,</hi> or which doe excell in iudgement, I might note out of this speech, not two sorts of Logicians, but two duties or faculties of all Logicians, in respect whereof they are to be honoured; the one generall, to reason well, the other speciall to iudge well, disposed not in a distribution, but in a comparatiue sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which some Logicians call <hi>axioma relatae qnantitatis,</hi> wherin the duties of a Logician are thus compared; that whereas Logicians are to be honoured for the performance of their

                  </gap>e, by so much the lesse necessitie there is to admit your exposition of Lay-Elders.</p>
               <p>But our men doe thus reason: <hi>D. Bilson, pag:</hi> 130. <hi>The fourth reason</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that holdeth mee from receiuing this construction</hi> (implying Lay-Elders) <hi>is, that I finde diuerse and sundry interpretations more agreeable to the Text, and more answerable to S. Paules meaning then this.</hi> His reason standeth thus. If diuerse and sundry interpretations are found more agreeable, &amp;c. then that for Lay-Elders, then haue wee no reason to yeelde that Lay-Elders are meant in this place. But diuerse and sundry such interpretations may be giuen, which he proueth, by producing foure of them.</p>
               <p>Likewise D. <hi>King,</hi> as your selfe doe cite him, arguing to the same purpose, saith, <hi>How many interpretations may bee brought to diuert and disappoint Lay-gouernours?</hi> and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth diuerse.</p>
               <p>Of all which interpretations, (which by <hi>Presbyters</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Ministers) it may truely be affirmed, that they are more agreeable to the meaning of the Apostle, then yours. Seeing they expound the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> according to the perpetuall vse of it, in the writings both of the Apostles and Fathers: wheras of your vse of the word, after all your paines and laying your heads, and helps together, you are not able to produce any one testimonie, no not one.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, looke how manie such probable expositions may be giuen, vnderstanding this place of Ministers onely, they are so manie proofes, that there is no necessitie of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting your interpretation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note>But let vs now examine your reasons, whereby you would prooue my exposition to be but a bare shift, and such as will not serue my turne.</p>

                     <note place="margin">His 1. Reason that my exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a bare shift.</note>
                     <hi>The first. If</hi> others opposing to Lay-Elders haue brought <hi>8.</hi> or <hi>9.</hi> expositions, which are but shifts to auoid them, all of them
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10663:55"/>
being diuerse among themselues, and from that which M. D. brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, then this <hi>10.</hi> of his, is but a shift also: but the former is true, therefore the latter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If the reader desire to haue examples of such lame legs, as the refuter talketh of, here hee may haue a couple. For as touching the proposition: seeing among different exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one onely is the true and proper meaning of the place: may not this exception be taken against any exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be it neuer so true, being but one amongst manie? For suppose the other 9. were but shifts, how will it follow, that therefore the tenth is so: Must all expositions bee false or vnfit, because the most are such?</p>
               <p>If those 9. expositions be shifts as you say, and if yours be false as I haue proued, this is so farre from preiudging the truth of mine, which is the eleuenth, as that it is a strong presumption to confirme it.</p>
               <p>For, seeing it is to be presumed, that some one true expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of this Text is knowne; and seeing all other knowne expositions of this place, are either supposed by you, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by mee to be false: it remaineth therefore, that this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth is true: The consequence therefore of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is starke lame.</p>
               <p>The assumption also is false. For those diuers expositions are not shifts, as this shifting Sophister cauilleth, but being all (I meane so many as by <hi>Presbyters</hi> vnderstand Ministers) more probable then that which sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth for Lay-Elders: (for that doth not so much as touch the subiect wherof the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh) they are so many proofes to auoid the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their Lay-Elders, which by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are as necessary, vrged and obtruded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. And this was his first reason, which he brought, to <q>

                  </q>.</p>
               <p>His second, brought to the same purpose, either proueth it thus,<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>5. His 2. Reason.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>By the refuters maine conclusion, it is euident, that hee hath gotten the wrong end of the staffe.

               <p>But the Reader must remember, that it lieth vpon my aduersarie, and those of his side, out of this place, invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and ineuitably to inforce Lay-Elders, or to confesse that they cannot be proued out of the Scriptures. Neither will it suffice him to say, they may be here meant, vnlesse he can necessarily proue and demonstrate, that they are, and must necessarily be meant in this place.</p>

                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:10663:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>Otherwise I may graunt his maine conclusion, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie preiudice to our cause: when the chiefe thing which he proueth is, that the principall, and almost onely place obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by themselues for Lay-Elders, doth not make against them. But if the onely place, which can to any purpose bee alledged for them, doe exclude them, which in the last rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I doe endeuour to proue; being as yet not proceeded so farre, but onely to maintaine that they be not heere inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; then is the cause of the Lay-Elders most desperate. The which, that it may appeare, I will not refuse, seeing my aduersarie hath found this starting hole, to examine his proofes.</p>
               <p>And first, I denie the connexion or consequence of his proposition.<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Answere to his first syllogisme</note> For though neither of the things by him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med did exclude Lay-Elders; yet there are two words in the Text, which doe plainely shew they are not included. The one is, the word <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which alwayes signifieth the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and neuer signifieth the supposed Lay-Elders.</p>
               <p>For if this Text include them, then are they included in this word <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> the Text speaking of none but such. But that word, being a word of order proper to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters or Priests, doth not include them, nor can any one example or testimonie produced to that purpose: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Lay-Elders are not included in this Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To the 2.</note>The other is <hi>double honour,</hi> or maintenance appointed to all the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> of whome <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh; from which Lay Elders are excluded, as I shall shew in my third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>As touching his second Syllogisme, I answere first to the proposition, that the persons here mentioned, are not noted to be of two sorts: but that the comparison is betweene two duties belonging to one sort or order of men; or if you will, betweene men of the same order, in respect of their duties; the words being as plaine in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage of the Apostles, and of all the Fathers, both Greeke and Latine, as if it had bene said in our language, <hi>Let the Ministers or Priests, &amp;c:</hi> And this I hold for a most certaine and vndeniable truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:10663:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>The comparison betweene the dueties, I explane thus, that as to <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Ministers double honour is due, for their dutie in generall: So especially, for that which is the principall: the comaprison being betweene the generall or whole duety, &amp; a particular, or part of the duty, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, as being the principall. The comparison betweene the persons, in regard of those duties, and depending vpon the former standeth thus: that as all they that performe the generall are to be honoured, so especially they, who in speciall sort performe the principall.</p>
               <p>Thus much then the words import, that as all <hi>Presbyters</hi> who demeane themselues well in their places, are to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy of double honour: so especially those that labour painefully in the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs consider the like examples. <hi>All Counsellours that demeane themselues well in their functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are highly to be honored, especially, those that are good Patriotes,</hi> or Comon-wealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. From whence it were absurde to inferre, that there is a sort of good counsellours that bee not good Patriotes. But in this speech I note, in respect of the duties of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours, that this is the principall; and in respect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that they are chiefly to be honored, who are in speciall manner such. Likewise (to vse the refuters owne example) <hi>All Logicians that reason well, that is, all good Logicians are to bee honoured, or well esteemed of: especially, those that are iudicious, or that haue a speciall facultie of iudging well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may not hence be gathered, that there are any good Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, that are not iudicious, or that cannot iudge well. But I note, that as among the faculties of a Logician, good iudgement is the principall; so they which be iudicious, are most to be esteemed.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>all good Seruants are worthie to bee rewarded, especially, those that are faithfull, &amp;c:</hi> In like manner, when the Apostle saith, <hi>All Presbyters or Ministers, that demeane themselues well:</hi> (that is, all good Ministers) <hi>are to be accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie double honour: especiallie those which labour in the Word and Doctrine:</hi> Wee may not collect from hence, that there is a sort of <hi>Presbyters</hi> worthie of double honour, which doe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10663:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not labour in the word. But the meaning of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, that as among the duties of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or Ministers, Preaching is the principall: so they chiefly are to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthie of double honour, who labour; or if you will, who in speciall manner doe labour therein. And this speciall manner is noted in the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: For <gap reason="foreign">

And the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test distinction of persons, that can hence bee gathered is this, that among good Ministers, there are some, who are more especially to be counted worthy of double honour for their paines in Preaching.</p>

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common, then by this kind of speech to note as well two diuerse qualities in one man, as two sundry sorts of men; yea thereby to preferre a part before the generall comprising that part.

               </p>
               <p>To the assumption affirming that Elders are the persons here mentioned, I answere, that no Elders are here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but Ministers, and that <hi>Presbyteri</hi> in this place are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly

But hereof I haue alreadie spoken.</p>
               <p>There remaineth his third Syllogisme,<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. His 3. Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> concluding as before, that their two sorts of Elders are not excluded in the distinction of the duties into generall and speciall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the generall dutie which is to gouerne well, agreeth to the Lay-Elders as wel as to Ministers. To omit that which hath beene said of his conclusion, not concluding as he ought Lay-Elders, if he will vrge them, out of this place, but prouing onely that they are not excluded, which is but a poore proofe, prouing nothing so well as that the cause of the Lay-Elders is come to a low ebbe. And yet for this, all his proofe is, that the generall dutie agreeth to them: which indeed is false, for the generall dutie meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> besides godly life and such attendance of the flocke as might be common to lay Presbyters, implyeth the fulfilling of their ministerie, their going before the flocke in the duties of Gods seruice: their feeding of them with the word and Sacraments. Neither can hee be said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the Apostles meaning in this place; that doth not (which a Lay-Elder may not doe) attend and superintend his flocke in these respects.
This prosillogisme of his proposition, which is his onely proofe, hee seeth and acknowledgeth to be before denied by me, holding that as well the generall as speciall dutie (as they are here meant) be peculiar to Ministers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not agreeing to their Elders, making me thus to say, <q>
                     <hi>yes saith hee but for all that, they be indeed two duties of the Ministers onely.</hi>
                  </q>
His proofe therefore was nothing else but a meere begging of the question. And when he should haue proued that in the former part of the sentence <hi>(Let the Elders that gouerne well)</hi> the Lay-Elders are comprised, or else haue ceassed to vrge them: faire and mannerly he slippeth his necke out of the collar, putting me to disproue

The first is the principall, and alreadie proued; though the refuter had rather seeme not to haue seene the reasons, which he did not see how to answere, then goe about either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them, or to bring any testimonie where Presbyter doth signifie a Lay-Elder. But as he would not see the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reasons, so either he doth not, or will not see the force of the latter.<note place="margin">The first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> For wheras I proue that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </q> verified of Lay-Elders, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But say I, when you vrge your Elders as from this place, your inference is not, that what is said of Presbyters gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning well, <hi>may be</hi> vnderstood of Lay-Elders, but <hi>must</hi> be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10663:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of them, or else you speake to no purpose. Now, although there be some shew of an inference, if by <hi>gouerning well</hi> were meant onely so much as might be common to Lay-Elders; yet if you vnderstand these words in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sense, you shall see not so much as a shew of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, nor any reason to moue a man to make such an inference: which I did verily thinke, that all men of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing would readily haue conceiued: and yet my lot is, to light vpon such an aduersary, as either doth not, or will not see it, vnles it be beaten into him. Goe too then: Is not this your inference from this text, that because the Apostle requireth double honour to be giuen to such Elders as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne well, though especially to those which labour in the word, that therfore besides those which labour in the word, there are certaine onely-gouerning Elders? Vnderstand therefore those former words in the general sense which I giue, and your inference will be both senelesse and false. Senelesse thus: the Presbyters that fulfill their office, or that demeane themselues well in their place, are worthy of double honour, especially those, that labour in the word; therefore besides those which labour in the word, there are certain onely gouerning Elders: for of this inference there is no sence, vnlesse it be supposed, that none can fulfill their office or demeane themselues well, but your Lay-Elders. If therefore you will ground them vpon this place accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the generall sence which you seeme to allow, call them no more the onely-gouerning Elders, but the onely good, or well demeaned Presbyters. False, because the words being generally vnderstood of the whole dutie of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie can be vnderstood of none but Ministers; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, which includeth the speciall, being peculiar to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister as well as the speciall. Thus therefore I reason:
<q>
                     <p>Those words which import the performance of the whole dutie of the ministerie, cannot be vnderstood of Lay-Elders but of Ministers onely:</p>

               <p>Besides the former proofe, I produce for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my exposition, the speech of the same Apostle, to the same Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus, Act.</hi> 20.28. to paralel this. And whereas of my exposition there are two parts, the one concerning the subiect or parties here mentioned, whom I expound to be ministers onely, the other concerning their duties, in regard whereof double honour is due to them, the one generall, the other speciall: in both respects, the one text doth answere the other, as face answereth to face in the water. For first that Presbyters here are Ministers onely, I proue thus:
<q>
                     <p>The Presbyters to whom <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh Act. <hi>20.</hi> were Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters onely:</p>
                     <p>The Presbyters of whom he speaketh <hi>1. Tim. 5.17.</hi> were the same to whom he spake, <hi>Act. 20.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the Presbyters of whom he speaketh, <hi>1. Tim. 5.17.</hi> were Ministers onely.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly that the duties both generall and speciall are peculiar to Ministers, I proue by this argument:
<q>
                     <p>The duties which <hi>Paul</hi> requireth, <hi>Act. 20.28.</hi> are duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired peculiarly of Ministers.</p>
                     <p>The duties for which double honour is due, <hi>1. Tim. 5.17.</hi> both generall and speciall are the same with those which <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, <hi>Act. 20.28.</hi> therefore the duties for which double honour is due, <hi>1. Tim. 5 17.</hi> are duties peculiarly required of Ministers.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:10663:60"/>This latter Syllogisme my expert aduersarie obserued not: the former he flingeth after his manner into a connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iue Syllogisme. For though his forge doe scarcely afford any other, yet hee hath gotten a pretie smacke of Syllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing that way, were it not that his Syllogismes for the most part, are too long by the halfe. But here he surpasseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for hee hath cast my whole Syllogisme into his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexiue proposition, and in his minor repeateth at large both the proposition and assumption.</p>
               <p>But let vs see what he saith to these Syllogismes. In the first he onely denieth my proposition, viz. that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. were none but Ministers: which I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in that breuitie I tooke for granted, because I thought it needed not to be proued.

I did presume, that it was to be vnderstood of such onely as are Ministers at the least. But that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was for breuitie omitted, shall now be supplyed. First therfore I argue thus: <hi>All those that are called BB. in the acts and writings of the Apostles are Ministers of the word.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>All the Presbyters to whom <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>Act. 20.28.</hi> are called BB.</p>
                     <p>Therefore all the Presbyters to whom <hi>Paul</hi> spake, <hi>Act. 20.28.</hi> were Ministers of the word.</p>
                  </q>
Or thus: <hi>Lay-Elders are no where called BB.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>All the Presbyters, <hi>Act. 20.28.</hi> are called Bishops:</p>
                  <p>Therefore none of those Presbyters were Lay-Elders.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Shall I need to proue any of the premisses. Are our Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians of late growne so absurd as to denie them? What? are not all BB.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 11.</note>But if either reason or authoritie will preuaile with him, he may easily be confuted: my reason I frame thus:

               </p>
               <p>But not Lay-Elders, nor any but Ministers, doe need by the Apostles rule to be <gap reason="foreign">

<q>Againe, all pastors of Christs flocke are Ministers onely: All the Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> were pastors of Christs flocke: therefore they were Ministers onely.</q>
Or thus: Lay-Elders are not Pastors of Christs flocke (of other flocks perhaps they may.)</p>
               <p>All the Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were Pastors of Christs flocke:</p>

               <p>That they were pastors I proue thus: Bishops set ouer the flocke of Christ by the holy Ghost to feed the Church of God, are pastors:</p>
               <p>The Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were such, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>

               <p>The Angels were pastors saith our refuter,
<q>The Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were Angels, therefore the Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were pastors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But why should so plaine a thing seeme to be made doubtfull with longer proofe? for if such Presbyters as were also Bishops and pastors, were any but Ministers: then Presbyters, Bishops and pastors were Lay-Elders also; and Lay-Elders were all in all.</p>
               <p>And whereas he obiecteth, that Lay-Elders may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder the name Presbyter and <hi>Episcopus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause D. B. saith, that these words <gap reason="foreign">

duties which hee requireth of them onely in that place; he requireth peculiarly of Ministers. The assumption affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the duties both generall and speciall, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. are the same with those, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.

               <p>The refuter though he saw not the reason, yet he would be sure to contradict my assertion, and therefore stumbling vpon the proposition,<note place="margin">

to his Lay-Elders. For whereas hee for want of better proofe saith, that hee hath already iustified it by the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of mine, it is a most vaine bragge, as I hope it doth sufficiently appeare to the reader.

But what one reason doth he, or can he alledge to perswade this, or where doth he go about to perswade it? If he say, according to the iudgement and practise of all Churches whatsoeuer, which either haue them, or haue them not, that this honour of maintenance is not due vnto them; why doth he not inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously confesse, that which is ineuitably proued out of the words, that Lay-Elders are neither mentioned nor meant in this place.

               <p>That there should be onely gouerning Elders, elected out of the people or Laitie, without maintenance to be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them, was prescribed by the learned reformers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God as they pretended.</p>
               <p>Therefore, that there sho'uld be Elders, elected out of the Laitie, without maintenance to be yeelded to them, was the Doctrine of the learned reformers.</p>
               <p>The proposition needs no proofe:</p>
               <p>The assumption I confirme thus;</p>
               <p>That which is practised according to the lawes of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, in all those reformed churches: where the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> be erected, was prescribed by the learned reformers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God, as they pretended.</p>
               <p>The election of only-gouerning Elders, out of the Laity, without maintenance to be yelded to them, is practised in all those reformed churches, according to the laws of discipline</p>
               <p>Therefore the election of only gouerning-Elders, out of the Laitie, without maintenance to be yeelded to them, was prescribed by the learned reformers, according to the word of God, as they pretended. And consequently, that Lay-Elders are not to haue maintenance, is both the Doctrine of the learned reformers, and the practise of all those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reformed by them.</p>
               <p>The proposition is manifest, because the lawes of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in those Churches, were either prescribed by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reformers, or framed according to their prescript.

But this is one of his colours, whereby he would perswade, that the Eldership should rather now be admitted, then in the Apostles times. Because <hi>if the Apostle would charge the Churches being in persecution, and therefore poore with maintaining Elders, which being poore, were not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times able to liue without some reliefe from the Church, &amp;c: how much more ought there now to be Seniors, when the Churches be in peace, and therefore not so poore, and when there may be chosen such for the most part throughout the realme, as are able to liue without charging the Church any whit, as the practise of these daies doth manifestly declare.</hi> For if it had beene his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Lay-Elders are to be maintained otherwise then for need, he would haue argued thus.</p>

               <p>What a profane mockerie is this, to expound the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles words, as though hee would haue the people thinke they had discharged their dutie in esteeming onely their Ministers worthy of double honour, when in fact they doe not yeeld them sufficient maintenance.

The words of the Apostle are generall, <hi>the Presbyters that rule well, let them be counted worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour.</hi> Wherefore let them either acknowledge that the Lay-Elders are not meant in this place, or else teach the people before they admit Lay-Elders, to thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues bound by the Apostles rule, to yeeld them double honour,<note place="margin">

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to any purpose which he obiecteth concerning either <q>

can proue, that order being taken in those Churches for the maintenance of their Elders, which they may readily receiue if they will, themselues doe voluntarily, and freely refuse it.
For if those Elders be comprised vnder Presbyters in this text, there must the like order be taken for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of all by the Apostles rule, though the painefull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are chiefely to be respected.</p>
               <p>But the contrarie course is taken. Neither is there not hauing of maintenance to be ascribed to their owne refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, as in the example of Paul, and the wealthy Ministers; but to the Churches not allowing them maintenance.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 4.</note>To the like purpose is that which he saith, that I<q> need not insult ouer those reformed Churches, which with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Elders themselues, thinke it best to ease the people of that charge, seeing the paines to be taken in the office of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership is not such, but that they may attend their ciuill callings and meanes of liuing, as well as our Churchwardens, and ciuill officers.</q>
In which words, first, he wrongfully chargeth me with insulting ouer those Churches. Secondly, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth himselfe, who hauing before denied them to be Lay-Elders, here confesseth they haue <hi>ciuill callings,</hi> which they may attend vpon, as well as our Churchwardens. Thirdly, where hee speaketh of the Elders consent in not taking maintenance, it is the consent of obedience to the lawes and orders of the Church, such as is in our Churchwardens, who by the like consent haue no maintenance. But to leaue his words, and to come to the substance of his speech; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their paines are not such, but that they may follow their ciuill callings and worldly busines, and seeing they haue ciuill callings to attend vpon, and other sufficient meanes of liuelihood, being in all these respects like, if not superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to our Churchwardens, it may not be thought that the Apostle who was desirous the Churches should be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as much as might be, would require them to giue dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour to such, as neither deserued nor needed such maintenance.</p>
               <p>And therfore he did not comprise them vnder the name of Presbyters (which indeed signifieth Priests or Ministers)
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:10663:68"/>
or if he did, no Church must thinke it selfe to haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to dispense with the Apostle, but must acknowledge it selfe bound, if it vnderstand Lay-Elders to be comprised in this text, willingly and gratefully to giue double (that is sufficient and plentifull) maintenance to them, esteeming them worthy of it for their worke sake.</p>

                  </note> that as all Elders are to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained if they need, so especially Preachers; whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Apostle would haue, according to equitie and iustice, maintained with an honourable stipend for their worke sake, and not onely by way of almes to be relieued for their need.</p>
               <p>But here the refuter behaueth himselfe as one that is at a nonplus <hi>for reason, and at an ouerplus for rancour: his words added to the last I cited, be these.</hi> 
                  <q>But to proue it, he propoundeth (out of the surueyour of discipline, cap. <hi>10.</hi>) an obiection, and then answereth it. The summe whereof is this, that the maintenance allowed them, is rather a beggarly almes giuen in charitie for need, then that honourable stipend, which iniustice is due to them for their worke sake.</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi>But to proue it,</hi> saith he, what would I proue? the refuter is confoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
Sure his eyes dazeled, and his witts were to seeke.
In the suruey is not so much as a shew of any such obiection: neither is it alledged to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but to proue that, whereunto the letter in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent directed him, that is, that they make choise of such as haue no need. But what is it?<q> 
                     <hi>the summe whereof is this, that the maintenance allowed them is rather a beggerly almes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
Is this the summe of the obiection? that is senselesse, and yet he seemes to say so: What then? is it the summe of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10663:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
answere, or of both? no man that were not at a losse would say it. I professe I haue not often read a speech more sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. To helpe him out of the maze, and to make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that hee was at a <hi>nonplus,</hi> I will explaine my words. <hi>For whereas some obiect</hi> said I, &amp;c: My meaning was this, the onely thing which is obiected to disproue my assumption, <hi>that to the Lay-Elders the honour of maintenance is not due for their worke sake,</hi> is this: that Lay-Elders if they stand in need are to be maintained. Which obiection hath beene made personally to me, I will not say by the refuter, though some thinke so, for I take that obiector to be an honester man: and that which is obiected, is that conceit not onely of <hi>T. C.</hi> the maister, and the demonstrator his scholler, but of <hi>Danaeus</hi> also writing on that place:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.</note> To this obiection of their need, I answered first, that it is needlesse, (as the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter also in the words following doth censure it) as being preuented by all those reformed Churches where the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters be erected, in which order is taken, that none shall be chosen into the seigniorie, but such as be of good abilitie. To which purpose I cited the tenth chapter of the <hi>Suruey:</hi> the argument wherof is this. <hi>Their Aldermen must be</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne positions) <hi>men of good calling:</hi> and among other things in that chapter, are cited the lawes of <hi>Geneua,</hi> requiring, that all their twelue Lay-Elders should be men of state &amp;c: as I said before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I answered, if they chance to haue need (which is a case that happeneth as seldome at the least to them, as to our Church-wardens) and if they be relieued (as our Church-wardens also should in the like case) that then the maintenance which is allowed, is for their need, and not for their worke sake. But the Apostle saith, the Presbyters are worthy of double honour, and the workeman is worthy of his stipend, &amp;c. As if I had said: the reliefe which is giuen to Lay-Elders for their need (if euer that doe happen) doth not disproue my assumption, nor proue that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this text.

                  </q> to which I reply: if it were a maintenance in iustice due for their worke sake, and not a reliefe giuen onely in charitie by way of almes for their need; that then it ought in iustice to be giuen to them, whether they be in need or not.
For the workeman is worthy of his stipend for his worke sake; and willingly it must be giuen him as deseruing it, whether he need or not. For although it be a crying sinne, and doe offend more against charitie to hold it from him if he need: yet it offendeth as much against iustice, to withhold the stipend from the workeman, that is not in need. The stipend, which <hi>Paul</hi> appointeth to Presbyters, in respect of their paines in edifying the Church, which is the house of God, is as due in iustice to them for their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10663:70"/>
worke sake, as the stipend is due to a Carpenter, that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an house. And as it were iniustice ioyned with folly, for a man not to thinke himselfe bound to giue the Carpenter his stipend, vnlesse he be poore: the like is to be conceiued of the stipend denied to Presbyters for their wealth, which is due for their worke.</p>
               <p>The rest of his speech is vttered in rancour and gall: but the points be these. First, that<q> 
                     <hi>it doth not become me, &amp;c: to call it a beggerly maintenance.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>it is more then is giuen to our Church-wardens that are crept into their roomes.</hi> The third, which is more plainely vttered in the abortiue booke, <hi>that the like perhaps will not make D. D. rich.</hi>
                  </q>
In what sense I called it beggarly almes, giuen onely in charitie, opposing it to honourable stipend, due in iustice, I haue already explaned. To the second I answere, our Church-wardens, hauing lesse trouble, haue notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing no lesse allowance, then your Elders, for they haue none at all. And where you say, our Church-wardens are crept into their roomes: you must first proue that euer they had a roome in the Church. For we will neuer grant that our Church-wardens be your Elders successours, till you haue proued your Elders to haue beene their predecessors. And whereas you make your selues merrie with my want of riches, as you did before with my want of preferment; I tell you plainely, I had rather be poorer then <hi>M.</hi>D. is with a good conscience, then to be as rich as some of you by maintaining a faction, to be maintained by it.</p>

Nay, I most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently auow, that they themselues are concealed in the Scriptures, which doe not once mention them in anie place. And therefore, if there bee cases omitted, that the Scripture hath not assigned to other Elders or officers; We may thinke it hath referred them to the wisedome of the Church, and authoritie of the Soueraigne, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>er then to them, whom it neuer mentioneth. Secondly I answere, that there are many necessarie duties, the performance whereof the holy Ghost hath not assigned to any publike Officers at all, as though there should bee speciall offices appointed for them; but are to be performed by euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; as the aforesaid duties which concerne the auoyding of scandales, the duties of Charitie and Communion of Saints. Likewise, there are duties respecting outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decencie, which the Scripture doth not prescribe in particular, and much lesse assigne to any peculiar office.</p>
               <p>But the determination of these particulars, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the functions or persons wherevnto they shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be assigned, is left to the discretion of the Church, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Soueraigne.</p>
               <p>And to such purposes, other Churches may appoint Lay-Elders, as well as ours doth Churchwardens, so they doe not vrge them as the ordinance of Christ, nor giue them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to intermeddle with things aboue their reach, as being peculiar either to the Ministers of the Word, or the Ciuil Magistrate.</p>

                     <p>First, All <hi>Presbyters</hi> who in the Scriptures are said to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and gouerne, hauing not that ouersight, which respecteth doctrine and religion, haue the ouersight of manners, and care of auoyding offences: for these are the two parts of ouersight:</p>
                     <p>The Lay-Elders, are such <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as in the Scriptures are said to ouersee &amp; gouerne, hauing not that ouersight, which respecteth doctrine and religion.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Lay-Elders haue the ouersight of manners, and care of auoyding offences.</p>
                     <p>The 2. If the Apostle expressely name 2. sorts of Elders, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, according to the 2. parts of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or ouersight, <hi>viz:</hi> Ministers and Lay-Elders, then it doth necessarily follow, that as the Ministers, haue the care and ouersight of doctrine and religion; so the Lay-Elders haue the ouersight of manners and care of auoiding offences.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Antecedent is true. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.</p>
               <p>Therefore the consequent.</p>
               <p>To the assumption of the former Syllogisme, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that Lay-Elders are no wheres said in the Scriptures to be <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: to gouerne or ouersee, but all those places, which be alleadged to this purpose, are to bee vnderstood of Ministers onely.</p>
               <p>Besides, the same Author hath confessed; that Lay Elders are not Byshops, neither will he say, that they be Pastors.</p>
               <p>But the places which he quoteth, are to be vnderstood of Bishops &amp; Pastors. Of <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. &amp; 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. I haue already spoken, as also of 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12. Why <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. should be applpyed to Lay-Elders, there is no reason; vnlesse whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is spoken of Spirituall gouernors, is to be vnderstood of them. The Writers, both olde and new, expound it of Bishops and Pastors.</p>
               <p>The assumption also of the second syllogisme is vntrue, neither hath it any thing to support it, but their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. which I haue proued to be false. Neither is that true, which is presupposed in both syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes:
<pb facs="tcp:10663:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that there must be two sorts of Elders answerable to the two parts of ouersight. For both the parts of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ouersight, belong to those which be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ouerseers, that is Bishops and Pastors, whose dutie is, both to teach and to gouerne.</p>
               <p>Their third Argument is taken from the practise of the primitiue Church next succeeding the Apostles. Which of all their Arguments is most friuolous, there being not anie testimonie of any writer, or example of any Church to bee alledged, that euer there was such an office in the Church.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer these duties to be performed by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders seuerally, might be borne with, so they were not obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the ordinances of Christ: yet the ioynt office of their Lay-<hi>presbyteryes</hi> is intollerable. For what reason can they alledge for their intruding into the sacred office of Bishops and Pastors, &amp; vsurping the keyes of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which our Sauiour Christ committed to none, but to the Apostles, and their successors? That Lay-men should haue authoritie, and that by the ordinance of Christ, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Ministers by imposition of hands, to remit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine sinnes, to excommunicate the obstinate, or to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the penitent, is an opinion too absurde to be confuted.</p>
               <p>Thus therefore I reason, according to their owne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. No office in the Church is lawfull, as themselues say, which hath not expresse warrant in the scriptures, which is all one, as if they had said,
<q>All lawfull offices in the church, haue expresse warrant in Gods word.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The office of the Lay-Elders seuerally, and of their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derships yearely, hath not expresse warrant in Gods word:
<q>Therfore it is vnlawfull.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To their office wee will ioyne the consideration of their qualities:<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. The qualitie of Elders, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in Gods word.</note> for surely, if the holy Ghost had prescribed in the scriptures, an office of such importance, it is to bee thought, that he would also haue described what manner of men were to be chosen to it, and how qualified for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of an office of so high a nature. And although he omitted their qualities in other places, yet mee thinks if

All which I will not denie to haue beene politickely deuised, so it may be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged an humane deuise, and not a diuine ordinance.

               <p>But perhaps there may be mention sufficient of them in the scriptures to warrant their calling, though neither their office nor their qualities be described in the word of God.

                     <hi>faine know of me why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>. I answere, because it was necessarie to be added: for in such comparatiue sentences, where one part seemeh to be preferred before all the rest, we are not alwaies to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10663:75"/>
that part simply to be the chiefe, but in the estimation of the speaker, who in some respect preferreth it to the rest. As for example, if that you should say, all good Ministers or Preachers are greatly to be honoured, especially they, who goe before their people in the example of a godly life: I would expound your meaning (as I did the Apostles) to be this, that whereas double honour is due to all Ministers or Preachers, for the performance of their dutie in generall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they are especially to be honoured for their godly life, that being in your estimation the chiefe commendation of a Minister. Or to vse the refuters owne example, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I explaned: all logicians that reason well, are to be well accounted of, especially they that iudge well, or are iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

                  <hi>In like manner I explane the Apostles speech, as hath beene shewed before.</hi>
                  <q> I but <hi>saith he,</hi> if this be true that those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are especially worthy of double honour, that labour in the word and doctrine; then some poore Ministers that continually preach or would doe, if they might be suffered, are more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be honoured then some great prelates, that seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer preach: and it was the enuy of this illation, which by saying <hi>in Pauls estimation,</hi> you would deriue from your selfe to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Answ. The Apostles comparison is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of them which be of the same degree, being Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and no more. Neither was it <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, writing to <hi>Timothie</hi> the Bishop, that any of the Presbyters should

                  <q> that in other places, viz. pag. <hi>42.45.53.</hi> I haue through flatterie contradicted this assertion, making gouerning a labour of greater honour then preaching.</q>
Answ. In none of those places doe I compare preaching with go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning, but Bishops with Presbyters, saying and prouing that Bishops are superiour to Presbyters in the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and iurisdiction, and that the Bishops are the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles successors in the gouernement of the Church. But doth it follow because Bishops are superiour to Presbyters, that therefore preaching is a worke inferiour to gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I trust Bishops are equall at the least with Presbyters in the power of order, as it respecteth the ministerie of the word and sacraments, so that what can be said in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the order of Presbyters in respect of the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, belongeth also to Bishops. If therefore BB. being at the least equall with Presbyters in the power of order, respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ministerie of the word and sacraments, be aboue them not onely in the exercise of that power, but also in the power of ordination and iurisdiction; they may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disparagement to the ministerie of the word, be said to be superiour to other Ministers.</p>
               <p>To your third cauill I might answere as to the first,<note place="margin">His 3. cauill</note> that the Apostle speaketh to the Bishop of Presbyters, not to a Presbyter; as you doe, of Bishops. But indeed our Bishops, as they ought all, so the most of them (as I trust) doe thinke themselues bound to preach, when they haue opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and leysure in respect of their other weightie imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10663:76"/>
in regard whereof I haue alwaies thought, that one good Bishop, though hee haue not opportunitie to preach very oft, may doe more good in the Church of God, then a dozen good Preachers. So that in these three cauilles the refuter hath gained nothing, but the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne malice, which I pray God to forgiue him.</p>

In that translation, as also in the exposition, I intended to giue them satisfaction, who (as I thought) were not satisfied with the iudgement of our learned men, who by the word <hi>doctorum</hi> vnderstand <hi>Bishops</hi> onely. For indeed if it be read <hi>Doctors</hi> or teachers (a title in these times appropriated to Bishops) the allegation out of <hi>Ambrose</hi> is as easily answered, as alledged, <hi>Ambrose</hi> his meaning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plainely this; that whereas the Bishops in former times were wont to doe nothing of importance without the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10663:77"/>
counsell and aduise of certaine ancient Ministers, who were his assistants; this was now growne out of vse, either through the negligence, or pride of the Bishops. But because I thought it might be obiected, that the word may signifie the learned as well as Teachers; and so an opposition might be conceiued as well of the learned to the vnlearned Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, as of the Doctors that is Bishops to the Presbyters (who though they were learned were not called Doctors, neither did vsually preach) I therefore endeuoured so to expound it, as that they, who should so vnderstand this place, might be satisfied, shewing that although the word <hi>doctorum</hi> should signifie <hi>learned,</hi> and although they would gather from thence, that the Seniors which were excluded from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation were vnlearned. And consequently lay men: yet notwithstanding that the speech of <hi>Ambrose</hi> needeth not to be vnderstood of Lay-Elders. But seeing my aduersarie, in the profundnesse of his iudgement, reiecteth that reading as vnlearned and without example, (of which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>doctorum esto iudicium</hi> let the learned iudge) I wil cleaue to that interpretation, which by <hi>Doctorum</hi> vnderstandeth Doctors or Teachers, as the best, and keepe the other in store as a secondary exposition to satisfie them, who by <hi>doctorum</hi> shall vnderstand the <hi>Learned,</hi> and thereof inferre seeing the learned are blamed for excluding the Seniors, that therefore the Seniors who were excluded, were vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And although my antagonist fighting <hi>Andabatarum more</hi> and as cowards vse to doe, winking, smote he saw not what, nor cared what, so as he might deale his blowes apace, condemning me in that for which he had cause to thanke me: notwithstanding I will acknowledge my thankefulnes to him, for handling this matter so well, that in this point he hath left our cause better then he found it. For whereas there being two expositions of this place according to the two significations of the word <hi>doctorum,</hi> the sentence hath almost no shew of probabilitie for Lay-Elders, if <hi>doctorum</hi> be translated Doctors, but seemeth very fauourable to them if <hi>doctorum</hi> signifie the <hi>Learned:</hi> my aduersarie, I thanke him, hath freed me from the difficultie of the latter, (if his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10663:78"/>
exceptions against it be good) and hath permitted me to rest securely in the former. The reader therefore is not to expect from me an ample defence of that latter sense against his exceptions, which make for vs.
For if his exceptions be good, and that sense vntrue (as he saith, <q>
                     <hi>it is certaine and plaine that it is</hi>
                  </q>) then will there be no difficultie at all in answering this testimonie of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that translation which seemed most to fauour Lay-Elders, being reiected.</p>

If these new writers proue their exposition of <hi>Ambrose</hi> by any sound reason, why be not their arguments produced? if they speake without reason, why is their bare authoritie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected against, both so many reasons as haue beene vsed to shew there neuer were such Elders, and also against the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall consent of antiquitie, which neuer acknowledged any Presbyters or Ecclesiasticall Elders, but Ministers only.</p>
               <p>Of my denyall he acknowledgeth two reasons:<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 5. The reason why their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position was to be reiected.</note> which though they were lighter then they be, are of more weight then bare testimonies, especially of parties, who are not to depose in their owne cause. Howbeit I acknowledge but one reason, though my speech may be resolued into two Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10663:79"/>
whereof the one is a prosyllogisme to the other: and because he saith, in steed of prouing, I doe nothing but begge the question, I will resolue the reason of my answere into this Syllogisme.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>They which make <hi>Ambrose</hi> against his meaning to testify that which hath no warrant, either in the scriptures, or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der writings of antiquitie, doe wrongfully expound him: But those which expound <hi>Ambrose,</hi> as giuing testimonie to Lay-Elders, doe make him against his meaning, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie that which hath no warrant either in Scriptures, or elder writings of antiquitie:</p>
                  <p>Therefore those who expound <hi>Ambrose</hi> as giuing testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to Lay-Elders, doe wrongfully expound him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The proposition is manifest. The assumption hath 2. parts, the one that Lay-Elders haue no warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t either in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or in the elder writings of antiquitie. The other, that the sense which they giue to his words, is against his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The former was prooued in my former challenge, that not any one testimony can be produced out of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apostles and Fathers, mentioning or meaning any Lay-Elders. The which is a sufficient allegation in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent holding the negatiue, vntill the opponent by suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient instance can proue the affirmatiue.
And therefore his cauill in saying, either that<q> 
                     <hi>I do but begge the question,</hi> which himselfe should proue, is false and foolish: or that <hi>if it were granted: it would not proue their exposition to be against his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, (for he might testifie that which hath no warrant either in scriptures, or elder monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of antiquitie)</hi>
                  </q> is both an ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mistaking (for those words as you see, were not inserted to that end,) and a needlesse extenuating of <hi>Ambrose</hi> his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, as being such a one, of whom it may be said, that he testifieth that which hath no warrant either in scriptures or other monuments of antiquitie.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Pag.</hi> 36.</note>
The rest of his words are meere babbling. The latter I prooue, by this Reason:
<q>
                     <p>To whom Ambrose giueth testimonie, hee complaineth that their councel and assistance in causes Ecclesiasticall was grown out of vse, &amp; seemeth to charge the bishops with slothfulnes, or pride therefore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:10663:79"/>But it was not <hi>Ambrose</hi> his meaning to complaine that the councell or assistance of Lay-Elders was growne out of vse, nor to charge the BB: with slothfulnes or pride for it:</p>
                     <p>Therefore it was not his meaning to giue testimonie to Lay-Elders.</p>
                     <p>The truth of the proposition is euident, by the words of of <hi>Ambrose</hi> himelfe.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The assumption is thus proued: A Diocesan Bishop, who not onely approoued, but laboured to magnifie his owne calling, and was as farre as any from subiecting either Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops or Ministers, to the Presbyteries of Lay-men (as the Presbyterians doe) would not complaine that the councell or assistance of Lay-Elders, (such as the Disciplinarians meane) was not vsed, or charge the Bishops with slothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or pride for it:</p>
               <p>But such a one was <hi>Ambrose:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore hee would not complaine for want of Lay-Elders, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The proposition if it bee explaned, will need no further proofe. The Elderships of Lay-men, such as the Disciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians stand for, 1. were neuer in vse together with Bishops, but either were deuised to supplie the gouernement of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, when they were depressed, as in <hi>Geneua, Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> or where orthodoxall Bishops were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as in <hi>France,</hi> or are vrged to extrude Bishops, as among vs: 2. in their Presbyteries consisting for the greatest part of Lay-Elders, all hauing equall right of Suffrage, and all things beeing carried by pluralitie of voyces, it is euident that the Ministers, which in parish presbyteries are but one or two at the most, and in others the farre lesse number, are subiected to the Lay-Elders, as being the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>It is manifest therefore, that a Diocesan Bishop, who not onely approued but sought to magnifie his calling, and was as farre as anie from subiecting Bishops or Ministers to the Presbyteries of Lay-men, would not complaine of the want of such Elderships.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:10663:80"/>Now that <hi>Ambrose</hi> was such a one as I affirme in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, I will manifestly proue in answering the refuters cauills. For hee (as being ledde with a spirit of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) after his vsuall manner, graunteth neither propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor assumption, nor any one braunch of them to bee true. Which course (mee thinks) should discredit him with all indifferent Readers, who may discerne him to write, not out of conscience, but out of a resolution to cauill and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict: especallie, if they consider that hitherto (though he would scarcely graunt any thing to be true that I had saide: yea, in his preface auowed, that I haue scarce vttered one true word) yet he hath not bene able to proue any one thing which I deliuered to be false. And such will his successe be in the rest.</p>

                  <note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. His answere to the Reason.</note>That hee might fit this Argument to his owne strength, he hath cast it (as his manner is) into a connexiue syllogisme: For it is an easy thing to frame a connexion, &amp; when he hath done to denie the consequence. But yet belike this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was too strong for him to deale with, whiles the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> consisting of 3. branches, was bound together: therfore he dissolueth it, taking euery branch by it selfe, indeuouring like a grosse headed Sophister, to perswade the Reader, that because hee can bow euery twigge seuerally: therefore the whole bundle or fagot is weake.

               <p>The testimony, which <hi>D.

These examples, vnlesse they had beene better fitted, are to little purpose. If he could haue said, A Monarch labouring not onely to iustifie but to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the royall calling, and not enduring that Monarches and Princes should be subiected, either to the Senate or people, would notwithstanding complaine that the state is not either Aristocraticall or popular, he had fitted the example, though he had spoken vntruely; For if <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> had beene Emperours and such as did magnifie the Monarchicall gouernement and could not abide either that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth should be ruled by the multitude, or themselues ouer-ruled of the greater part of the senate, then would they not complaine that the gouernement was not Democratical, or Aristocratical.

                     <hi>consequence thereof is of the same feather with the former</hi>
                  </q>.
If <hi>Ambrose</hi> could not endure that Bishops or Ministers should be subiected to Lay-persons, then would he not complaine that Lay-Presbyters were out of vse. <q>
                     <hi>It followeth not</hi> saith he, <hi>there may be Presbyters wherein are Lay-Elders and yet the Bishops and Ministers not be subiected to them.</hi>
                  </q>
But say I, where the farre greater part of the Presbyteries consisteth of Lay-men, as alwaies it hath done according to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and alwaies would doe according to the new Parish-discipline, it cannot be auoided, but that the fewer number of Ministers would be subiected to the farre greater number of Lay-Elders; especially, if they (according to the wise conceit of our new disciplinarians) may be perpetuall. But whether these three branches seuerally doe inferre a necessary consequence or no, it is not materiall, seeing they were ioyntly propounded, and seeing from them vnited a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10663:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
necessary consequence dependeth. Wherfore the seuering of them to weaken the consequence, and to breede matter of cauil, was a sophisticall, if not a leaud trick. The leaudnes whereof will the better appeare, if we consider his dealing with the assumption: for he, that hauing seuered the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the proposition, exacted from euery one seuerally a necessary consequence: in the assumption, he will haue them all taken together. For before he taketh the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in pieces, meaning to cauill with euery part seuerally, he vseth this Caution: <hi>Prouided alwaies, and be it remembred of the Reader, that if any one of the three parts thereof proue false, though the other two be neuer so true, the whole assumption is in law of true reason, vtterly void and of none effect:</hi> But if in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position I be vrged to make good the consequence from each part seuerally, the assuming of any one part will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the question.

                  </q>
                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> &amp; others thought it needful, that a presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of graue &amp; ancient ministers, should with their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell &amp; aduise assist the Bishops in cases of doubt (as D. Bilson saith) of daunger and importance, when as yet nether Synodes could assemble, nor Christian Magistrates could be found to help and assist the Church. But this, as it doth nothing further the cause of Lay-Elders: so doth it no more detract from the dignitie of Bishops, to vse the counsell of wise and learned men; then it doth derogate from the Maiestie of Kings, to vse the aduise of their wise &amp; faithfull Counsellors.</p>
               <p>There remaineth the third branch.<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. The 3. branche of the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
Wherevnto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his rayling against our Bishops for subiecting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to their Chancellours, Commissaries, and Officialls, which are but lay-men, hee answereth onely<q> That if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning Presbyters to the Byshop bee a subiecting him to them, I doubt not but this testimony will prooue, that <hi>Ambrose</hi> was not willing, that Ministers should bee subiected to the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Lay-men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There are two differences between that which <hi>Ambrose</hi> holdeth and our new Disciplinarians. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh of an assistance of ancient ministers; they, of Lay-Elders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambrose,</hi> of an assistance to aduise and direct, such as is the aduise of Counsellers to a Prince; they of an assistance to ouerrule, as in the Romane Senate, by plurality of voices, giuing their Bishop not so much as one negatiue voice, <hi>Ambrose</hi> therfore requireth an assistance of ministers sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Bishop: they an assistance of Lay-Elders, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Bishops to them. Neither should they of all men raile against the BB. for submitting ministers to Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, &amp;c. seeing it is not so vntollerable, that ministers should be subjected to the censure of men wise and learned in the lawes, and that so farre onely as the B. shall thinke fit, as that they should not onely be ouerruled by such as the Lay-Elders must needs be in most countrey-parishes, but also stand to the curtesie of them and their neighbours, to be deposed and depriued at their pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:10663:84"/>Now, how farre <hi>Ambrose</hi> was from subiecting BB: or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in causes Ecclesiasticall, to the Consistories of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, may appeare, first, by his sentence giuen against <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius,</hi> the <hi>Arfian.</hi> Bishop, in the Councell of <hi>Aquileia</hi> For when <hi>Palladius</hi> refused to answere,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And againe, <hi>though hee bee found guiltie of manie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, notwithstanding we are abashed, that hee which challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Priesthood to himselfe, should seeme to be condemned of Lay-men. And therefore forasmuch as heerein hee is to be condemned, who expecteth the sentence of Lay-men (seeing rather priests ought to iudge of Laymen) according to those things which to day wee haue heard Palladius professing, and according to those things which he refused to condemne. I pronounce him</hi> (saith Ambrose) <hi>vnworthie of Priest-hood.</hi>

When did you euer heare most gracious Emperor, that Lay-men in a cause of faith iudged of BB: Are wee therefore so bowed with flatterie, that wee forget the right of BB? And that I should thinke what God hath giuen mee, is to bee committed to others?

meaning, as it seemeth, the reason of the answere, which was this: for <hi>euen the Synagogue had Seniors of the Priests, as well as of the people.</hi> My reason may thus be explained:
<q>If not onely the Church had Seniors, that were ministers, whose aduise was neglected in <hi>Ambrose</hi> his time, but euen also the Sinagogue (meaning <hi>Israell,</hi> or the state of the <hi>Iewes</hi>) had Seniors of the Priests; then it followeth not, that the Seniors of whom <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh, were Lay-Elders.</q>
But the antecedent is true in both the parts of it:</p>
               <p>Therefore the consequent:</p>
               <p>The consequent of the proposition is necessarie: for an argument from the <hi>genus</hi> to the <hi>species,</hi> doth not hold affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiuely. <hi>Genus</hi> saith <hi>Fabius,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As touching the assumption: the former part, <hi>viz:</hi> that the Church had seniors, which were ministers, I tooke for granted, because either all those places of Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as I say, or at least some, as my aduersarie will confesse,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10663:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where Presbyters be named, Ministers are vnderstood.</p>
               <p>The second part I proue out of<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ier. 19.1. Ps. 37.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Ierem:</hi> 19.1. where the Prophet is commanded to take with him some, not onely of the Seniors of the people, but also of the Seniors of the Priests, that is, men of authoritie as well of the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call state as of ciuill.</p>
               <p>Which words, though the refuter vnderstand as I doe, as prouing, not that the <hi>Iewes</hi> had an Eccclesiasticall Senate, consisting partly of the Priests, and partly of the Elders of the people (for of such a presbyterie, though there be much talke, yet there is no proofe) but that in the Iewish state there were as well Seniors of the priests, as Seniors of the people: notwithstanding the seely Philosopher, would faine make the Reader belieue, that I confesse (which most confidently I doe denie) that in the Church of the Iewes, there was an Ecclesiasticall Eldership, consisting both of the priests and Seniors of the people: and therevpon would inferre, that this testimonie maketh mee:
<q>Because <hi>(forsooth)</hi> Ambrose acknowledgeth that there was such an Eldership in the Church, as had beene among the Iewes. But among the Iewes there was <hi>as hee saith,</hi> I confesse, an Ecclesiasticall Senate consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of the Priests, and Elders of the people, therefore Ambrose acknowledgeth such a Presbyterie to haue bene in the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Ministers, and Lay-Elders.</q>
               </p>
               <p>First for <hi>Ambrose:</hi> hee doth not speake of <hi>Eldership,</hi> either among Iewes or Christians; but sheweth, that because both the Iewes and Christians had Seniors, this is an Argument, that age is honorable, seeing that ancient men were of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, both among the Iewes, who had Seniors as well in the Ecclesiasticall as ciuil state, and also among Christians.</p>
               <p>Now, to inferre from hence, that either the Iewes or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians had an Ecclesiasticall senate consisting in part of Lay-Elders, is a vaine collection. For if by <hi>Synagogue</hi> is meant the state of the Iewes (they might haue) as indeed they had) a Senate consisting of Priests and Leuites, and chiefe of the people; but that was not an Ecclesiasticall Senate, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shall be shewed, but their chiefe Counsell of state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in that, ther were no other <hi>seniors,</hi> but of the Clergie of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for my confession, I protest, that I meant nothing lesse, then that the Church of the Iewes had an Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Senate consisting of the Seniors of the Priests and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people. For I know it to be an idle conceit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other warrant, but the <hi>probabile est,</hi> of a new writer, a chiefe party in this cause. But hereof more in my answer to his allegation, out of <hi>Matth:</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Besides, can any man that doth not wilfully peruert my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, vnderstand me to speake of any, but the Seniors of the priests, saying, <hi>&amp; of such Ambrose speaketh, when he saith, in the Church,</hi>

                  <hi>or Church-causes, nothing was don without their consent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be, that your former consequence may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, if the testimonie of <hi>Ambrose</hi> be better pressed vpon vs, to which purpose I say in the Sermon: <hi>If it be saide that Ambrose speaketh, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <q>If it be said? <hi>saith the refuter,</hi> he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it well enough, that it is said, and shalbe maintained, that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose speaketh of such Seniors, whose aduise was neglected, through the default of the teachers, (not learned or teachers, as M. D. set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it downe) and therefore of such Seniors as were not teachers. Cunningly therefore and to weaken the force of our argument, doth hee here so produce and alledge it, as if it were rather conceiued for our helpe by himselfe then propounded and expressed by vs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let him therefore, for his honestie and credits sake, shew the Reader where this testimonie of <hi>Ambrose</hi> is thus vrged. In the mean time, the Reader shal vnderstand these 2. things</p>
               <p>First, that the disciplinarians, knowing that their proofes out of Scriptures and Fathers, will not necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for them, if they should seeme to inforce them by discourse: Therefore they vse this poore pollicie, to holde them out, (as it were <hi>Mineruaes shield,</hi> as if they were so preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that they need not to be vrged, but the very naming of them were sufficient to put vs to silence.—</p>
               <p>They thinke it therfore, their best course, in all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings almost to take it for graunted, that their discipline is the very discipline and kingdome of Christ, their presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, the very ordinance of Christ: and when they should proue it, as they would seeme most sufficiently to doe, they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10663:87"/>
holde out a few places of the Scriptures and Fathers, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quoted, being so farre from vrging them, as that for the most part, they doe not so much as cite the words: (thus in the booke of <hi>H. I.</hi> dedicated to the King.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag:</hi> 67. <hi>Pag:</hi> 26.29.31.</note> 1604. vrging a reformation after the newe-cut. Thus in the protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that came out of the North, made in the yeare 1606. and printed Anno 1608. Thus in this worthy worke of the refuter, as after you shall heare, when he commeth to deale his blowes) thinking belike that the very naming of such witnesses will sufficiently, if not daunt vs, yet satisfie their simple followers, who are too easily ledde with shewes.</p>
               <p>The other thing is, that I haue vrged this testimony for them, and (to speake the trueth) haue inforced it better, and made it stronger for them, then euer they made it, or haue yet the witte to conceiue.</p>
               <p>But to answere their argument, for now it is theirs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must my wordes be retained, <hi>learned,</hi> or <hi>teachers, &amp;c:</hi> The Reader therfore is to remember what before was saide, that the word <hi>Doctorum,</hi> being ambiguous, signifying either <hi>learned,</hi> or <hi>teachers,</hi> this place of <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth accordingly admit two interpretations.</p>
               <p>The one, as it signifieth <hi>Learned,</hi> and is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon title to the Bishops and Presbyters: the other, as it signifieth <hi>Doctors</hi> or <hi>Teachers,</hi> and was a title in those times peculiar to the BB. as shalbe proued. The former of these, which seemeth more to fauor the Lay-Elders, my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary doth reiect, &amp; insisteth in the latter. But he doth not shew (as me thinkes he should) how this testimony then will conclude for Lay-Elders. It was sufficient for him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict mee, though hee left his cause in w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rse case then he found it. For my part, I am so farre from this spirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that I doe agree with him in preferring the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exposition, which by <hi>Doctorum,</hi> vnderstandeth Doctors, before the other.</p>
               <p>Let vs see then, how that sense being retained, this place doth conclude for Lay-Elders.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Seniors</hi> that were not called <hi>Doctors,</hi> in those times, were Lay-Elders.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:10663:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>The Seniors, whose counsell was neglected by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, were such Seniors, as in those times were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Doctors:</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Seniors, whose counsell was neglected by the Doctors, were Lay-Elders.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I denie the proposition: because in those times the title of Doctor or Teacher was peculiar to BB: we therefore may with more truth affirme that all Seniors or Presbyters that were not called Doctors in that time, were Ministers; and thereupon conclude, that therefore the Seniors, whose Counsell was neglected by the Doctors, were Ministers.</p>

               <p>But both the parts of the Antecedent is true, therefore the consequent.</p>
               <p>But let vs heare his Reasons.</p>

                     <hi>The first,</hi> If <hi>Ambrose</hi> had meant to ascribe slouthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to the Seniors, hee would haue saide, that their assistance grew out of vse, either by their owne slothfulnes, or rather by the pryde of the BB.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The second: <q>he <hi>would haue said</hi> not <hi>Doctorum,</hi> but <hi>Ipfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum desidiâm</hi>
                  </q>, which reason is the latine of the first, and the first the english of this: Such iudgment heere is shewed in distinguishing of arguments. But who knoweth not, that the same sentence may very manie wayes bee varied, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the words, the same sence remaining? so that this exception might be made against any exposition almost. If I should say:</p>
               <p>As in Christs Colledge, so in some others, Elections were wont to bee caryed by the voyces of the iuniors, as well as the Seniors, which thing is now grown out of vse, by what meanes I know not, vnlesse perhaps, by the remisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the fellowes, or rather arrogancie whiles they would rule alone, I might not vnfitly so speake, ascribing remiss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the iunior fellowes, and arrogancie to the Seniors.</p>
               <p>His third and fourth reasons are impertinent, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the word <hi>Doctorum</hi> of <hi>Doctors,</hi> a title in those times, peculiar to Bishops, &amp; not of <hi>learned,</hi> which is common to both. For though the speciall title of <hi>Doctors</hi> according to the former interpretation, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the Seniors or presbyters, who were not called <hi>Doctors</hi>; yet to a common title, neither of the specials, to which it is common, are to be opposed, but both to be subiected.</p>
               <p>The 5. that <hi>Ambrose chargeth both slothfulnes and pride vpon the same persons, called Doctors, &amp;c.</hi> But this should haue bene prooued and not begged: especially, seeing I disprooue it in the reason following.</p>
               <p>For that which he pratteleth of amplifying the fault, by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the lesse to the greater, hath not so much as a shew of a good reason, to dsproue my exposition; seeing of the 2. causes, <hi>Ambrose</hi> seemeth to make the slothfulnesse of the learned, that is, the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> not so principall as the pride of the learned, that is to say, the <q>
                     <hi>BB. vnles perhaps saith he, by the slothfulnes</hi> of the presbyters, or <hi>rather pride</hi> of the BB.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, saith he,<q> If we make diuers sorts of teachers <hi>(he should haue said learned)</hi> Ambrose his speech were defectiue, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what must be added, as either by the slothfulnes of the teachers, or rather pride of the Bishops, or some of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, if the word <hi>Learned</hi> be vsed, being a title com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, both to the <hi>Seniors</hi> and the <hi>Doctors,</hi> there needs no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make the sentence perfect; but a distinct applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the common title to the speciall sorts, according to their seuerall faultes, by which they are to be distinguished; Slothfulnesse beeing the fault of the one, and pride of the other, as before you heard, in the example of <hi>fellowes.</hi>

bare word. Whereas in truth, both heere and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where I am the Answerer, I render more reasons then were needfull, were it not, that I sought to satisfie, in hope that men will at the length be satisfied with reason.</p>
               <p>As for example, this place of <hi>Ambrose</hi> is objected, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing testimonie to Lay-Elders.</p>
               <p>I answere there is no necessitie, this place should so bee vnderstood. Here might I haue rested, and put the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents to inforce this testimonie, which by them is barely propounded. But being desirous to giue satisfaction, I vrge it for them thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, there were Seniors in the primitiue Church, whose councell was now neglected, therefore he giueth testimonie to Lay-Elders. I denie the consequence, giuing a reason, because those Seniors were of the Clergie and not of the Laitie.</p>
               <p>Against this answere I make them replie thus; The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors aduise was neglected by the learned: Therfore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were such as were not learned, or of the Clergie.</p>
               <p>To this I answere, that if the word <hi>Doctorum</hi> signifie lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Notwithstanding this place may be vnderstood of the Seniors of the clergie onely: If wee conceiue <hi>Doctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>learned,</hi> as a common title, both to the BB: &amp; Seniors, and of this answeare I giue a reason by explaning this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Ambrose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas I did foresee that it would be objected that <hi>Doctorum</hi> was to be vnderstood either of pastors of parishes alone, according to the conceite of the new Disciplinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or of BB. a lone according to the rest: I therfore sought to preuent this obiection in those words, for if you expound <hi>Doctorum</hi> for pastors, &amp;c. Wherein a sufficient reason is concluded, holding strongly against the parish B. &amp; his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And not contented with all this, in desire to giue satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I rendred the true causes besides arrogancy of BB. which I knewe was presupposed, why the assistance of the ancient ministers, called Seniors, was growne out of vse: and yet forsooth, like another <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I looke that my bare word should be credited without reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:10663:94"/>Yea, but saith hee,
<q>that which is added in steed of a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, hath no more reason in it, but his owne blindnes, saying, that I cannot see how, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But is it not strange, that hee, who is so sharpe sighted to finde out Syllogismes where none were intended, could see no reason heere?</p>
               <p>Or shall we not thinke, that he chose rather like a shifting sophister, to take adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage of that modest phrase, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with the reason it selfe, which may thus be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That which is a matter of great labour and paines, to the vndertaker, and ease to the relinquisher, is not to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to slothfulnes in him that taketh it vpon him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in them who are eased.</p>
                  <p>But the taking of the whole burden, and cumbersome imployment of hearing suites, and managing all causes Ecclesiasticall, vpon the BB: is a matter of great labour and paines to them, and ease to the Seniors.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Bishops, vnderaking the whole burden, and cumbersome imployment of hearing suites, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging all causes Ecclesiasticall, is not to be ascribed to slothfulnes in them, but rather to the Seniors.</p>
               </q>
               <p>One of these premisses should haue bene denyed,<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect.</hi> 11.

               <p>And first, he denyeth that <hi>Ambrose</hi> spake by guesse, as I say, but certaienly and vpon knowledge; when <hi>Ambrose</hi> his expresse words bee these, <hi>Quod qua negligentia obsoleuerit nescio, nisi forte, &amp;c:</hi> which by what negligence it is growne out of vse <hi>I know not,</hi>

                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 44.</note> vnlesse <hi>perhaps</hi> by the slouthfulnes, &amp;c. 2.
<hi>He saith,</hi>
                  <q> it might be a matter of slothfulnes, in the BB: to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the seniors to neglect their duties. But not to their own so great trouble, will M, D. say, we might belieue him, if wee saw not pride driue men to vndertake, more then they either need to be charged with, or are able to weeld.</q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:10663:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>Then is it not their slothfulnes belike, that caused them to take the whole burden vpon themselues, but their pride, which made them winke at the seniors slothfulnes, as giuing way to their owne ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, he saith,</hi> 
                  <q>the Bishops might prouide for their owne ease, by putting off the burthen to their Chancellors, Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Officialls,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Whether the BB. did put off the burden to their Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> &amp;c: &amp; therefore it might be imputed to them as a matter of sloth or idlenesse, &amp; pride to: and so the word <hi>Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> rightly expounded, for Pastors of Parishes alone, and not to Diocesan Bishops. <hi>As thogh their Parish-Bishops were more likely to haue had Chauncellours, &amp;c: then Diocesan BB: But I answere, 1. the question is not what they might haue done, but what they did.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now it is euident, that in <hi>Ambrose</hi> his time, and a good while after, till the Presbyteries were in a manner whollie neglected, the Bishops had not ordinary vicars, or chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, or ordinary Commissaries, which were not of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie; But what they did without the aduise of their Seniors, they performed ordinarily in their owne persons, or else ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily delegated the same to some of speciall trust. In some cases, it is euident, that both then, and long after, they vsed the assistance of their Presbyterie, as in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heresie, or for deposing of a clergie man, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>By all which it is more then euident, that as in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times they had <hi>Cathedrall</hi> churches as well as we, and those endowed with great reuenewes, as it is easie to proue: so the Deanes and chapters of our <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Churches are

the remainder of their Presbyteries, our Deanes being those who were called Archpresbyters, our Prebendaries, those which were called Presbyteri <hi>vrbani,</hi> our chapters those which they called Presbyteries.</p>
               <p>Neither doth that hinder which our refuter obiecteth, that our BB: haue not the like assistance of the Deane and chapter that the ancient BB: had of their Presbyteries. For <hi>Ambrose</hi> complaineth, that euen in his time their counsell was neglected. And yet in these times, as the Bishop may vse their aduise if he please, so in some cases their assistance is necessarily required, the acts of the Bishop being void without their consent. Besides <hi>sede vacante,</hi> in the vacancy of the <hi>See,</hi> the custodie of the Bishopricke &amp; <hi>Episcopall</hi> rights, as also the election of the new Bishop, is after a sort refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them.<note place="margin">

If therefore they will sue for reformation according to the precedent of the primitiue Churches, let them seeke and sue, that the Bishops may vse the counsell and assistance of the Presbyterie of the citie, which we call the Deane and Chapter, and they may hope to preuaile, if none of the reasons why their assistance is forborne be sufficient, which now come to be examined.</p>

They may say confidently, there were Lay-Elders in the time of the Apostles, yea from the time of <hi>Moses</hi> vntill Christ, and that after the example of the Iewes (who indeed neuer had such Presbyteries) they are to be erected in euery parish: and yet haue no better warrant for these things, then their owne coniectures. They may take vpon them to auow without reason, that to haue beene done in the Apostles times, whereunto neither scripture nor Father giueth testimonie: and in me it is great immodestie to affirme that, which but one of the Fathers seemed to doubt of, though I alleage suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reason of my affirmation. For in the first three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Christ, when Christians neither had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Synodes to determine doubts, nor Synodall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions to direct the Bishops, nor the authoritie of the Christian Magistrate to rectifie what was amisse in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Church, there was great necessitie that the Bishop should vse the aduise and counsell of other wise and learned men: otherwise, his will would haue seemed to stand for a law, and his gouernement would haue beene subiect to ouersight in himselfe, to remedilesse wrong towards the clergie and people, and to the obloquy and scandall of all. But when as prouinciall Synodes were frequently <note n="*" place="margin">viz: Twice a yeare. <hi>Conc.

Euen so, when it was found trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and tedious to the Presbyters, and hurtfull to the Church, that their time which might better be spent in stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Diuinitie, to furnish them for the publike Ministery, should be taken vp in hearing brabbles and quarrels, and also their assistance seemed not needfull to the Bishops for the causes aforesaid; it is not to be maruelled, that their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance grew out of vse. For whereas the refuter obiecteth, and is the onely thing worth the mentioning which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth, that the Presbyteries continued in <hi>Ambroses</hi> time, and long after: I answere, that they continue to this day. But as their assistance now in matters of gouernement is not much vsed, so before <hi>Ambrose</hi> his time it began to be neglected.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the testimonie of <hi>Ambrose:</hi> which hauing cleared as well as that, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. being the onely places of moment, which vse to be produced in this cause, I might safely conclude from all the premisses, that therfore there were no Lay-Elders in the primitiue Church: From whence, besides the maine conclusion, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     </gap>oofe of Lay-Elders.</note> the two particular assertions concluding against our new sect of disciplinarians will necessarily follow. The first, that therefore there were no parishionall Presbyteries: the second that therefore parish Bishops or pastors were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Diocesan Bishops.</p>
               <p>Against the former,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.155.</note> he obiecteth a speech of <hi>D. Bilson</hi> affirming that euery Church in the Apostles times had many Prophets Pastors and Teachers, which, as the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 49.</note> might make a Presbyterie. But the Churches <hi>D. Bilson</hi> speaketh of, were not in seuerall parishes, but as he saith in populous cities, such as that of <hi>Ephesus Act.</hi> 20: and those prouided, not for any one parish, but for the whole citie and countrey adioyning, that is to say, the Diocesse. For when my aduersarie shall produce any one pregnant testimonie that in such congregations, as we call parishes, there was a Presbyterie of Ministers, I will also grant, that there were no other but parish Bishops. In the meane time let the Reader hold this for a certaine and vndeniable truth, that there were no Presbyteries of Ministers, but onely in cities and Cathedrall Churches, but hereof I shall haue occasion to speake in the second booke.</p>
               <p>As touching the second conclusion, it followeth thus: the parish pastor had either a Presbyterie to assist him, or he was subiect to superiors, as namely the Diocesan and prouinciall Bishops, to ouerrule him, or else he ruled like a Pope; for a fourth thing cannot be named, before there were Christian Magistrates. But it is absurd to imagine, that in the primitiue Church they had an absolute popeling, who neither had assistants nor superiors, for that were to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe not onely supreme, but also sole power to them: and it is as false, that in seuerall parishes there was a Presbyterie to assist him, therefore it remaineth that the parish Bishops were subiect to the authoritie of the Diocesan and prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Bishops.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10663:101"/>
there may be question, whether <hi>Ecclesia</hi> signifie the whole congregation of the people, or an assembly of iudges or gouernours: if the former sense be followed, there is no shew for Lay-Elders. If the latter, which is the more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, question againe may be made, whether Christ speake of the <hi>Synedrion</hi> of the Iewes, as <hi>Caluin</hi> and some others sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or of Christian gouernours: if of the <hi>Synedrion,</hi> which was a ciuill senate and indeed the high counsell of estate in the policie of the Iewes, what doth that make for Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Elders in the Church of Christ, and that in euery parish?</p>
               <p>If of christian gouernours, as the Fathers expound it; what sense is there to vnderstand the words of Lay-Elders, vnlesse it can otherwise be proued, either that Christ had alreadie ordained them, or that afterwards they were in vse in the Church of Christ. But the former is absurd: and for the latter they haue not so much as a faire shew, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed of the two places, which I haue vindicated out of their hands, viz: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and <hi>Ambrose</hi> in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1. Nay further I adde, that if it could be proued (as it neuer will) that euer there were Lay-Elders in the Church before this our age, yet they should but argue from the <hi>Genus</hi> to the <hi>Species</hi> affirmatiuely, <hi>tell the gouernours, ergo Lay-Elders:</hi> wherefore this is a very seely argument.</p>
               <p>Yea but other diuines say, that Christ spake of Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. What others say it is not greatly materiall in this kind, so long as we plainely see, there is no necessitie nor probabilitie so to vnderstand him.

durst make shew of.<note place="margin">A common exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these allegations.</note> Whereof not any one can be said with any shew of probabilitie to speake one word for Lay-Elders. If Lay-Elders were first proued by other arguments or presupposed, the best argument that could out of these places be raised, were from the <hi>Genus</hi> to the <hi>species affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi>; as if they should say, the <hi>scriptures speake of gouernours, therefore of Lay-Elders; of Presbyters, therefore of onely gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Presbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But seeing they neuer were, nor euer will be proued by other arguments; the reason taken from these places, is from the <hi>Genus,</hi> to a fancied and platonicall Idea, or poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>species,</hi> and that <hi>affirmatiuè.</hi> If I should say, <hi>it is a bird, therefore a Swanne,</hi> it were but a simple argument: but if thus, <hi>it is a Bird, therefore a blacke Swanne,</hi> it were too ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. Such are the arguments of this disputer: for if he should say, the holy Ghost speaketh in three of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of gouernours, therefore of Presbyters, it were a weake argument; but when he inferreth therefore Lay-presbyters, who were more rare then blacke Swannes, it is very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. If the worst argument in my Sermon, euen when he made the worst of it, had concluded no better then the best of these, he would neuer haue done insulting and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing. But I cannot blame him, they be the best proofes his cause can afford; they are the testimonies, which the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall patrones of the Presbyterie doe vse to alledge.</p>
               <p>But you will say, this is a strange kind of arguing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from men, who allow no office in the Church but what hath expresse and direct warrant in the scriptures: <hi>this is the meaning of the scriptures, because some new diuines doe thinke so.</hi> We are wont to hold, that scripture is to be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by scripture, as by conference of other paralell scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or by inference out of the context it selfe, diduced by some artificiall argument; or if these faile, especially, in such places as concerne matters of storie or fact, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether there were any Lay-Elders in the primitiue Church, we fly to the expositions of the Fathers, &amp; testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of antiquitie. But what would you haue a man doe, these proofes and testimonies fayling, the best glosse they can set
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:10663:103"/>
vpon their cause, and the fairest excuse for themselues is, that some other new writers, in matters of substance for the most part Orthodoxall, haue beene partly of their minde, and yet if we consider, that two or three principall men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vpon necessitie deuised the Presbyterie, to supply the roome of the Bishop before eiected, and afterwards (being growne into liking with their owne deuise, because a few places of the scriptures and Fathers especially, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and <hi>Ambrose</hi> in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1. seemed to fauour the same) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it to others, as warranted by scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; others, taking it vpon their word without sufficient tryall, haue yeelded their consent, and by their writings commended the same to posteritie: I say, if these things be considered, we haue no great reason, much to esteeme the testimonies either of the principall Authors, or of the peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fautors of the Presbyterian discipline, being all parties in the cause.</p>

Therefore</hi> dubium non est, <hi>it is not to be doubted, but that Christ spake of such an assembly as was then in vse alluding to the order of the olde Church, wherein, after their returne from Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, a select Councell was established, which they called</hi> Sinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim, <hi>in Greek</hi> Synedrion, <hi>whervnto the censure of Doctrine and manners was committed. Which</hi> Synedrion, <hi>besides some Priests and Leuites, consisted of the Elders of the people. And although the discipline was corrupted amongst the Iewes in our Sauiour Christs time, and therefore it is not likely that our Sauiour would send his Disciples to their Assemblies to haue their causes heard; yet</hi> dubium non est, <hi>it is not to be doubted, but that forme of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline which had beene vnder the Law, was by Christ transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vs: and that the forme of discipline, which was in vse in the Church of Christ succeeded in the roome thereof.</hi>

               <p>If against this exposition it shalbe obiected, that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches hearing and censuring of offences would be prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to Magistrates: I answere, offences and offenders admitte diuers distinctions. Of offences, some are open &amp; notorious, some are secrete &amp; priuate. Some againe are grieuous and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital crimes, which may not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed or left vnpunished, other be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces not so hainous or enormous, but they may be concealed and pardoned, where is hope of amendment: For notorious and enormous crimes our Sauiour doth not prescribe this course, but for the priuate and lesse offences. Againe, offenders are either (in the iudgment of charity) our brethren in Christ, or the sonnes of <hi>Belial:</hi> For the latter, we may take the ciuile course of Iustice, for the former we must take a spirituall course of Christian charitie, that wee may winne our brother vnto Christ, or recouer him beeing fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, which course our Sauiour heere prescribeth.</p>
               <p>By Church therefore or assemblie, our Sauiour meaneth neither the supposed <hi>Ecclesiasticall senate</hi> of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor yet a <hi>Presbyterie</hi> of Christians answerable therto, consisting for the most part of Lay-elders. Not the former: for Christ spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of such, as should meet in his name, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, what they bind vpon earth, shalbe bound in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we to think, that our Sauior would send his disciples to the corrupt Consistories of the vnbelieuing <hi>Iewes,</hi> as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> also saith. It was a strange conceit therefore of <hi>Beza,</hi> not
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:10663:108"/>
only to imagine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Matt:</hi> 18 17. <hi>&amp; in Marc:</hi> 5.22.</note> that the name Church is here attributed to the <hi>Iews,</hi> but that the <hi>Archisynagogi</hi> assembled together were they who are meant by Church in this place. Or if that were true, how should this direction belong to vs, seeing not only the imaginarie <hi>Ecclesiasticall Senate</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> is vanished, but also the true <hi>Synedrion</hi> is long since abolished, and their whole policie abrogated. Not the latter, for our Sauiour, by Church vnderstandeth such as should haue power to bind &amp; loose sinnes, as appeareth by the words following.

vnder such a Tyrant, they should haue Magistrates of their owne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere briefly: the state of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> if you respect the whole people, was neither a settled Church, nor establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed common-wealth.

to any company of Christians, be it but of two or three meeting in the name of Christ, doth fitly agree.

               </p>
               <p>But for all this T.C. <hi>seeth not, why it may not be referred to Elders,</hi> meaning Lay-Elders, <hi>as well as too BB:</hi> meaning Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. But say I, you must see that Lay-Elders not onely may, but must necessarily be vnderstood in this place, or else it is absurdly alleaged by you to proue them. Yes, he and the Author of the counter poison will proue, that they are meant here: <hi>for the word Elders is set downe generally signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying as well Lay-Elders as Ministers, therefore</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas <hi>ordained Lay-Elders as well as Ministers.</hi> To the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence I first answere, that if Elders were a generall name comprising more sorts then one, and if <hi>Luke</hi> had said, that they ordained all sorts of Elders, this consequence would haue held: for from the <hi>Genus</hi> vniuersally taken, we may affirmatiuely conclude the speciall sorts. But <hi>Luke</hi> not spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so, it is sufficient for the truth of the historie, if they ordained any sort of Elders. Now it is confessed of all, that they ordained Ministers, therefore though Elders were the <hi>Genus,</hi> yet this were a very weake argument. Yea but saith T.C. <hi>S. Luke there setteth forth, how they set a full order in the Church:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Counterpois. arg.</hi> 6. <hi>for Elders.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>his purpose was</hi> saith another <hi>to declare how the Apostles brought the Churches to a perfect and full order of Church gouernement,</hi> Whereunto I answere first, that the Church might haue a perfect and full order of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without them, And secondly that Lukes meaning was not to signifie that they brought those Churches to a full and perfect order of gouernement at their first conuersion, which was not to be expected; but that now they began to establish Churches, placing among them Presbyters or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:10663:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as being necessarie for the very being of visible Churches, without mention (I say not of Bishops, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding were added before they were brought to the full and perfect order of gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but euen) of Deacons.</p>
               <p>The consequence therefore were naught, though the antecedent were true, that is, though Presbyter were the <hi>Genus,</hi> or generall word, signifying as well Lay-Elders as Ministers; for it were onely an argument from the <hi>Genus</hi> to the <hi>Species</hi> affirmatiuely. But the antecedent I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proued to be most false: there being not any testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to be produced out of scriptures, Counsels, Fathers, or histories of the Church where Presbyter signifieth an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall function in the Church of Christ, doth signifie any other but a Minister of the word. And therefore it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to imagine, that Luke <hi>Act.</hi> 14. doth by Presbyters meane any other then Ministers.</p>
               <p>

Where it is said, that <hi>Iames willing them, when they be weake, to send for the Elders of the Church, thereby plainely declareth, that the Church ought not onely to haue a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor and a doctor, whose chiefe attendance must be on reading ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and doctrine; but also many, who ought alwaies to be readie at an instant calling of diuerse and many at once, that none in that necessarie worke be neglected. It followeth thereby that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides them, there ought to be such other Elders as may admonish the vnruly, comfort the weake minded, and be patient towards all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all this were granted as it is propounded, it would not follow thereupon, that therefore there should be any Lay-Elders, but many Ministers in euery Church: for such were those in the place cited,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thessa. 5.</hi>12.14.</note> and it is the duetie of those, whom <hi>Iames</hi> would haue sent for, to attend vnto reading, doctrine and exhortation.</p>
               <p>But his meaning (no doubt) was this: <hi>There ought to be many Elders in euery Church, therefore some Lay-Elders.</hi> The consequence he taketh for granted: the antecedent he proueth thus. There were many Elders in euery Church in S. <hi>Iames</hi> time, therefore there ought to be many now.</p>
               <p>For answere to his antecedent and proofe thereof, we are
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10663:114"/>
to distinguish of the word <hi>Church.</hi> For if thereby he meane the Church of a whole citie and countrey adioyning, there were, and are many Presbyters in euery Church: but if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he meane euery seuerall congregation, meeting, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Christians: there neither are, nor were many Presbyters appointed to euery such Church. In S. <hi>Iames</hi> time, though in each Church there were diuerse assemblies of Christians meeting as they could; yet were not parishes distinguished, nor Presbyters seuerally and certainely allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; but to the Church of a whole citie and countrey adioyning, there was one Bishop, and many Presbyters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided. But when parishes were distinguished, to each of them seuerally a Presbyter was assigned out of the Clergy or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie of the citie; the residue of the Presbyters remaining with the Bishop, who (as before the diuision of parishes) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained still the charge of the whole Diocesse, as I will God willing shew in the next booke. Wherefore, though in S. <hi>Iames</hi> time, before the diuision of parishes, there were in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church (that is Diocesse) many Presbyters; yet it doth not follow, that therefore in euery parish there should be diuerse Presbyters.</p>
               <p>But his consequence is especially to be insisted vpon: for though there were in each Church many Presbyters, as at <hi>Ephesus Act.</hi> 20. and at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> where <hi>Iames</hi> himselfe was Bishop <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 21. of which number <hi>Iames</hi> would haue the weake to send for some; yet in that number there was not one, who was not a Minister. Neither can any sound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be alleaged, why we should conceiue these Presbyters, of whom <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, to haue beene any other then Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. First the title which is giuen them, viz: Presbyters of the Church as <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17. is peculiar to Ministers, not one instance to be giuen to the contrarie. Secondly, the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the performance wherof they were to visit the sicke, chiefely, if not onely pertaining to Ministers, and that was not onely to pray ouer the partie, and that (as it seemeth by the phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) with imposition of hands,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bez. in Iam.</hi> 5.</note> but also to annoint him with the oile in the name of the Lord, that by the oile, as an outward, though temporarie Sacrament, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed

               <p>Wherefore I make no question, but the speach of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> is to be vnderstoode, according to the perpetuall vse of the word, the generall interpretation of all writers both old and new,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zanch. de relig pag.</hi> 168.</note> (excepting not all that be parties in the cause,) and the generall and continuall practise of the Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding him, as if he had said, let him call for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, &amp;c.</p>

                  </note>The fourth testimonie is thus vrged. <hi>If the Apostle setting downe the ordinary members of Christ his Church, which differ in their proper action, doe set downe the Elder to be ouer the people with diligence, and not to be occupied in the ministerie of the word either by exhortation or doctrine, but to admonish them and rule them; then the onely-gouerning Elders were ordained by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: but the first</hi> say they <hi>is manifest,</hi> Rom. 12.6.7.8. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the first, say I, is so farre from being manifest, that it cannot so much as obscurely be gathered out of the text. It is true, the Apostle speaketh of the members of the body of Christ, and of the diuerse gifts bestowed vpon them, which the Apostle exhorteth euery one knowing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or measure, in all humilitie and modestie to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to the common good of the whole body. But you must vnderstand, First, that the members of Christ are not onely officers in the state Ecclesiasticall, but all Christians whatsoeuer, as well in the body politicke, as Ecclesiasticke, whether publicke or priuate. Secondly, that the Apostle doth not speake of distinct offices which are not coincident to the same persons, but of the diuerse gifts, and graces of Gods spirit:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>But the first is testified by the Apostle,</hi> 1. Cor. 12.28. <hi>therefore God hath ordained lay or onely gouerning Elders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Syllogisme no part is sound: for first the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the proposition is naught: for by Church as it is taken in the assumption, citing 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. is meant the whole body of Christ, and by the members of his body, all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; among whom God hath established degrees of superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to gouerne, and inferiors to obey in all societies, as well in the family &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, as in the Ecclesiasticall state.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the assumption is false: for, although it be true that in Christs body there are gouernours Occonomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call &amp; politicall distinct from the Ministers; yet <hi>Paul</hi> doth not in this place testifie, that Christ hath set in his Church gouernours distinct from the Ministers; and much lesse doth he testifie, that in the Church, that is the state Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, he hath ordained gouernours which are not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. Nay, which is more, the Apostle doth not once mention gouernours in this text: for it is the fault of the translation, for <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is <hi>helpes and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernements,</hi> to read <hi>helpers and gouernours:</hi> it being the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the holy Ghost in all the 12.13. and 14. chapters, to discourse of the diuerse gifts wherewith God doth adorne the membes of his Church: &amp; in this context, in the midsts of other gifts, which are expressed in the abstract, he placeth these two, for so he saith, <hi>powers, gifts of healing, helpes, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, kindes of tongues.</hi> Now it is no better reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make two distinct offices of helpers and gouernours out of these words, then to raise three others out of the other three, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, gifts of healing and kinds of tongues. But it were ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to make three distinct offices of these three; so is it of the other. And if the other three are to be accounted as gifts, and not as offices; why should we not so conceiue of helpings and gouernings, that is to say, the gift of helping and gouerning? Yea I say further, that although in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the verse, the Apostle doth reckon three offices, Apostles, Prophets, Teachers: yet his purpose was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to distinguish Ecclesiasticall functions, but to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

               <p>For if the Apostle had meant in this place to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Functions and Offices of the Church: then from this Text should eight distinct offices bee collected; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should these gifts haue bene coincident into the same persons; so that teachers might not gouerne, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours might not teach,<note place="margin">

               <p>It is plaine therefore, that the Apostle did not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the offices of the Church, but orderlie recount the gifts and graces, wherewith the Lord doth beautifie diuers members of the Church.</p>

               <p>Did they heare them say so, or did they read their writings?

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this second conflict I find the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very confident, like the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> (though not vpon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) as though my forces were not able to stand before him. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in the former assault I haue taken the Acropolis &amp; chiefe hold of the Presbyterian Discipline, I doubt not, but that when he shall with the men of <hi>Ai</hi> looke backe, and see the chiefe Tower of his defence, I meane the Presbytery, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing as it were a smoake, his courage will bee abated. For the Presbytery being downe, what hath he where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10663:124"/>
to hold out Bishoppes? For seeing the Primitiue Churches were gouerned eyther by Diocesan Bishoppes, as we hold, or by Pastors of Parishes, assisted with Lay-Elders as they imagine, who seeth not that vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of the Presbyteries, the gouernment by Bishops is necessarily inferred? Hauing therefore proued the first point of the fiue, with such euidence of truth, as I am wel assured all the gainesayers thereof will neuer bee able soundly and substantially to confute, I need not doubt of preuailing in the rest.
As for the 2. next points which I handle, concerning Dioceses, and Diocesans; the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thinketh they be <q>
                     <hi>the weakest of all the fiue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>and the worst appointed</hi>
                  </q>, and thereupon would take occasion to cauill at my order, (as if I were to learne Methode of him) whereas indeed his imputation of weakenesse to these 2. parts, if it were true, would commend my disposition of them as Homericall, seeing I haue marshalled them <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storio more,</hi> after the manner of <hi>Nestor, in medio infirma,</hi> placing the weakest in the middest.
The chiefest points in my estimation being the first, and the two last. The truth is, I did more lightly passe ouer these two then the rest, but not out of an opinion of weakenes in the points them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but partly in a conceit of their euidence, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in consideration that they were not either so worthie or so needfull to be insisted vpon as the rest. For first, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them to be so euident, that howsoeuer <hi>T. C.</hi> in whose steppes our new Disciplinarians tread, vpon wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker grounds then a man of learning &amp; iudgement should haue stood vpon, doth deny them; yet scarsly any other man of learning &amp; iudgement besides him would gain-say them. Secondly, that the three weightiest points which are most contradicted, and in which these 2. are presupposed, were most worthy in that breuity (whereto I was confined) to be stood vpon. And thirdly, that J needed not to bee so carefull in prouing of them, seeing the chiefest patrones of the pretended Discipline, as <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp;c. doe herein ioin with vs against our new sect of Disciplinarians, as hath already beene proued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:10663:124"/>Now whereas I brought forth these forces, intending only a light skirmish, <hi>&amp; velitationem quandam tanquam le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis armaturae</hi>; my aduersary bringeth his maine battel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field, as if the euent of this whole warfare depended vpon this encounter. I will therefore not onely bring a new supply like those of the Israelites which came vpon the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> as they were pursuing the other companies of Israel; but also cause these Arguments, which now like the troupes of Israel seem in his conceit to flie before him, to returne vpon him a fresh.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as here we are to entreat of Churches,<note place="margin">§. 2.

For whereas all mankind is to be diuided into two Companies; the one is the world, which is the kingdome of darkenesse, containing manie particular companies which are all the Synagogues of Sathan, the other, the Kingdome of God; this latter is called <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> signifying a Company of men as redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, so also called out of the world,<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10663:125"/>The significations of the word Church being so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">§. 3. What is to be called a Church.</note> it may bee demanded what is truly and properly a Church vpon earth. Whereunto I answer by warrant of the word, that euery company of men profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the true faith of Christ, is both truly a Church, and also a true Church. So is the whole company of the faithfull vpon earth the true Church and spouse of Christ, the piller and ground of truth.</p>
               <p>So is the company of Christians professing the true faith of Christ in any Nation or part of the world to bee termed by the name of a Church. For euen as the whole people of Israel professing the true religion, were one Church, though containing verie many particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations or Synagogues, which also were so many Churches: euen so the whole people of England, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through Gods mercy, the true Catholike and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke faith, is to bee called the Church of England. For whereas some alleage, that the Church of the Iewes was one, because it was vnder one high Priest, who was a figure, and therefore ceased: it is euident that it was one Church, because it was one people or commonwealth, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the same lawes, professing the same religion, both before there was one high Priest, and after there were through corruption more then one. Neither was the high Priest in respect of his preeminence and gouernment ouer the priests and people a type of Christ (for then had he, as well as <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> been a type of Christs gouernment and kingly office, as well as of his priesthood, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Christ might haue bin a priest of the order of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> as well as of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> but in respect of his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the whole people, and intercession for them, and his entrance alone within the sanctuary, bearing the names of the twelue Tribes: for Christs gouernment appertaineth to his kingdome, and not to his priesthood.</p>
               <p>Likewise the Christian people of any Citie and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try adioyning, whether that which wee call a prouince or diocesse, though consisting of many particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, is rightly termed a Church, as the Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10663:126"/>
Antioch, Ephesus, Smyrna, Sardes, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Jn like manner, the Christian people of one Towne or Village, containing but one congregation, which we call a parish, is truly called a church, as perhaps that of Cenchreae. And to conclude, the company of faithfull in one fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doe deserue the name of a Church, as hath bin shewed. Indeed that any particular Chruch of a whole Nation, Citie and Country, Towne, Parish, or family, (family I say being alone, and not a part of a congregation, but as an entire Church or parish by itselfe) may bee accounted a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, there is required besides the profession of the true faith, wherein the life and being of a Church consisteth, the ministery of the word and sacraments, and eutaxy, or some good order of gouernment. Not that all gouernours are to be placed in euery society or Church, but that the effect and benefit of the gouernment is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to euery particular. For as well might an high Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of State, or Parliament, such as was the synedrion of the Iewes, which was but one for the whole Nation, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in euery Citie, and a Maior and Aldermen (such as be in London and other chiefe Cities) in euery village, as a Bishop and Presbytery in euery parish.</p>

Indeed at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry first conuersion of Cities, the whole number of the people conuerted (being sometimes not much greater then the number of the Presbyters placed among them) were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make but a small congregation.

or Pastor, their Presbytery and Deacons; without which <hi>Ignatius</hi> saith, there was no Church: meaning no accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished or fully constituted Church. Neither was the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and the Presbytery, which at the first was placed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Citie, prouided onely for that set number which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conuerted; but they were there placed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of the whole Citie and country thereto belonging: their ministery being like to the leuen put into three pecks of meale, which by degrees seasoneth the whole lumpe. Neither was it meant, that the whole number of Christians of each Citie and territory, being much increased, should continue but one particular ordinary congregation assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in one place; but that vpon the multiplication of Christians, diuision should be made of the whole Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers particular congregations, which after happened in all Churches accordingly. But vpon this diuision, there was not to euery seuerall congregation allotted a Bishop and a Presbytery, but only seuerall Presbyters assigned, <hi>singuli sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis,</hi> some of the Presbyters continuing with the Bishop. The Bishop himselfe remaining, as it was first intended, and as the Church of God euery where throughout the world expounded that intent, by their practise, the Pastor or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent of the whole Citie and country adioyning. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are all the Disciplinarians in the world able to shew, that there were, or ought to haue been, after the diuision of parishes and assignement of seuerall Presbyters vnto them, any more then one Bishop and one Presbytery for a whole diocesse.

               <head>CHAP. IJ. Prouing by other Arguments that the ancient Churches which had Bishops, were not Parishes, but Dioceses.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus much may suffice to haue spoken of the names, about which the testimonies which I haue brought, haue beene almost so many euidences for the Diocesan, and against the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishionall Bishops.</p>
               <p>Now I proceede to other arguments; desiring the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to remember that the question is concerning such Churches, as were endued with power of Ecclesiastical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and iurisdiction, to wit, whether in the Apostles times, and the ages following, they were <hi>Parishes,</hi> as we cal them, or <hi>Dioceses.</hi> And first I will shew they were not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, and after, that they were Dioceses.</p>
               <p>For, if Parishes, then the Parishes either in the Countries, or Cities were such: but neyther the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10663:132"/>
parishes in the Country, nor in the Citie, had a Bishop of their owne and a Presbytery. Which is so euident a truth to them that haue read the Councels, Histories, and Fathers of the antient Church, that it is to be wondred, how men of learning and reading, being also men of conscience, can deny it. But seeing it is denied, I must be content to proue it, viz. that regularly, lawfully, ordinarily Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries were not placed in the seuerall parishes. For these words I hope may be added with the Refuters leaue, seeing neither it can be preiudicious to mee what was at any time vnlawfully done, nor aduantagious to him, vnlesse hee will vrge a reformation, according to the paterne of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (if there were any such) which were irregularly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, and vnlawfully gouerned.</p>
               <p>First therefore for Country parishes, because I maintaine the negatiue, and the proofe of the affirmatiue lieth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my aduersary, I challenge him to produce some proofe, if he bee able, within 400. yeeres after Christ, of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try parishes lawfully, regularly, ordinarily furnished with power of ecclesiasticall gouernment, and gouerned by their owne Bishoppes, such as they speake of, assisted with their Presbyteries. Which if hee bee not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, (as I am well assured hee is not) hee must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his parish Bishoppe to bee of the same stampe. with his lay-presbyters, that is to say, a meere counterfet. But not expecting his proofe, J will prooue, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had Bishoppe of their owne, nor yet Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. As touching the former, it cannot be denied, but in some places the Presbyters of parishes growing ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, haue desired to bee Bishoppes of their parish, and their people vaine glorious haue seconded their desire. But in all well ordered Churches, their presumption hath been resisted, and their vaine desires frustrated. I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that in Africke, which alwaies bringeth forth some noueltie, and from whence all <hi>T. C.</hi> his newes in this cause doe come, some parts of the diocesse being very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, haue obtained a Bishoppe of their owne. But

when?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Carth. gr. c.</hi> 54. <hi>&amp;</hi> 101.</note> when the charge was so great, as that by it selfe it seemed to deserue a Bishop. And how? First, with the leaue of the Bishop of the city, in whose diocesse it was. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, with the approbation of the Metropolitane and the prouinciall Synode. Thirdly, hee which obtained the honour of beeing a bishoppe was aduanced to a higher degree, then himselfe had before, or other country pastors haue, and was ordained a Bishop by the Metropolitan and two other Bishops at the least.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by whom from the beginning they haue been inioied. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as some hauing obtained this honor abused it ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically, and withdrew themselues schismatically from the communion of other Bishops: and forasmuch as also certaine Presbyters lifting vp their neckes against their BB. vsed indirect meanes to allure their people, that themselues might be made Bishoppes; therefore it was ordained, that such a people in the <hi>paroecia</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or diocesse, which is subiect
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10663:133"/>
to the antient Bishoppe, and neuer had a Bishoppe of their owne, should not obtaine a proper Doctor, meaning Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe. And as touching those which had attained to this honour vnlawfully, and withdrew themselues from the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods of Bishoppes, it was determined that they should not onely lose their diocesse, but also their owne Church. For it is fit the Bishops which are vnited to all their brethren, and to the whole synod, should iustly retaine not onely their owne Cathedra or See, but also that they should pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse such dioceses. And whereas some <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 46. <hi>Carth. gr. c.</hi> 57.</note> being made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in part of other mens dioceses, with their leaue and consent, did incroach vpon parts of the diocesse not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them, it was concluded, that he which in the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse is preferred to be Bishoppe, by the consent of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Bishoppe, who holdeth the mother or cathedrall Church, shall only retain that people vnto which he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. Finally, in another Councell <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Afr. c.</hi> 65. <hi>Carth. gr. c.</hi> 101</note> of Africke, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that such people as neuer had B. of their own, should in no wise obtaine a B. vnlesse it be by the decree of the whole synod of euery prouince, and of the primate, and also by the consent of him vnder whose diocesse the said Church is placed.</p>
               <p>Out of which canons, we may obserue these things. First, that the Country churches belonged to the iurisdiction of the Bishop in the Citie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that euer from the beginning, they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Bishop of the Citie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that those parts of dioceses, which then had no Bishop of their owne, neuer had.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the number of Bishopricks was not wont to be diminished, or the circuits of them inlarged, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, if there were cause, the number was increased, and the circuits or dioceses lessened.</p>

These Chorepicsopi at the first, had Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall ordination, by the imposition of the hands of three Bishops, insomuch that of the three hundred and eighteene Bishoppes assembled at the Councill of Nice, there were fifteeene Countrie-Bishoppes: For which fifteene, if all pastors of parishes had beene Countrie-Bishoppes, there might haue beene, I doubt not, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred, if not fifteene thousand: But when these Countrie-Bishoppes, beeing but the Bishoppes suffraganes, and substitutes, placed in the Countrie to supplie the Bishoppes roome, and to exercise some matters of lesse moment appertaining to the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall function, began to encroach vpon the Bishoppes right, and to vsurpe Episcopall authoritie, and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beyond their commission; they were by little and little restrained; and when they would not be kept within their compasse, their order (at least as they were Bishops) bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but an humane-ordinance, deuised for the ease of the Bishoppes in the citie, was in most places aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>

Againe, if the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were subiect to the Bishop of the Citie, and the Countrey whereof they were Bishops was part of the diocesse belonging to the Bishop of the Citie; then much more the Presbyters of parishes (who were inferiour, and in some things subiect to the <hi>Chorepis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi,</hi> as the Bishops substitutes) were subiect to the Bishop; and their parishes, being but a part of the Country whereof the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were called Bishops, were but a part of the diocesse. So farre were either the parish Presbyters from being Bishops, or their parishes from being entire Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, endued with the power of ecclesiasticall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the former is true, as hath beene proued, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were superiour to them, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, because not onely they had some iurisdiction ouer diuers parishes, but for a time had episcopall ordination, and had authoritie to ordaine Subdeacons, and to place Readers in parishes, as also they might send <hi>Formatas,</hi> or Canonicall Epistles, which the Presbyters might not doe. Likewise, when Bishops were at any time conuerted from heresie, <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Con. Nic. c.</hi> 8.</note> though they were not permitted to be Bishops of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10663:137"/>
the City, yet they were gratified with the name and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of <hi>Chorepiscopi.</hi> In the time of <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> a certaine Bishop had beene ordained by two Bishops only: but this ordination the Councell of Rhegium <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Rhegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens. c.</hi> 1.2.3.4.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced void, and censured the ordainers. As for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ordained, because hee had of himselfe renounced the Bishopricke, they thought good to follow the example of the Councell of Nice, and to gratifie him with the name and title of a <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi>; but so, as that hee should not ordaine, nor exercise any other episcopall function, but only confirme Nouices, and consecrate Virgins, and in all things behaue himselfe as inferiour to a Bishop, and as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to a Presbyter. And this was my second argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby I haue prooued, that Countrey parishes had no Bishops.</p>
               <p>Neither had each of them a Presbyterie,<note place="margin">§. 6. Parishes had not Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</note> but seuerall Presbyters assigned to them, as sufficient for such a charge as was determined by the Councell of Sardica<note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Sardic. c.</hi> 6.</note>, and by the iudgement of <hi>Leo</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Leo epist.</hi> 87.</note>. Yea not Presbyters only did seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie gouerne parishes, as with vs, but sometimes Deacons also were by themselues set ouer charges. You heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diuers testimonies of the Presbyters of parishes, as namely that <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Carth.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 102.</note> of the Councel of Carthage, <hi>Presbyter qui Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeciae praest, &amp;c. the Presbyter which gouerneth the parish.</hi> The like is presupposed of Deacons in the Councell of Elibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <note n="s" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Againe, if parishes besides their Presbyter or Pastor had a presbytery, then was it either of the Ministery, or of the Laitie. But Presbyteries of Ministers were only in Cities, and Cathedrall Churches, and not any examples can bee alleged of Presbyteries in the Country, no not to assist the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> much lesse to assist the Presbyters of parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: and Presbyteries of Lay men were neuer heard of till this last age: Therefore the seuerall parishes had not Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Moreouer, Churches endued with power ecclesiasticall

                  <p>But Countrey parishes had not the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Countrey parishes were not indued with power ecclesiasticall, neither had they a Bishop or Presbyterie of their owne.</p>
               </q>
               <p>For the Assumption, let the Refuter consider with mee, what course was taken in Countrey parishes, when their Minister was departed. Among themselues they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily none; or if by chance they had, they could not ordaine him, but were (as sometimes it happened in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) to offer him to the Bishop to be ordained. Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they had none from whence to fetch a learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: out of other dioceses they were not to bee supplied, vnlesse first it did appeare, that their owne Bishop was not able out of his Clergie to furnish them. To the Bishop of the Citie therefore they did resort, who out of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie belonging to the Cathedrall Church, (wherein, as the Nurserie of the diocesse, diuers were brought vp in the studie of diuinitie) did supply their want, assigning some one of his Clergie vnto them. But if there were none fit, (as sometimes their store was drawne drie, by supplying the wants of many) they might not ordaine a Minister of another diocesse, whom they called another Bishops Clerke, without his leaue and dimissorie letters: for that in the Canons was condemned as a great wrong; and such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations were to be disanulled. If therefore the Bishop neither had of his owne, nor knew not readily where to be supplied out of a neighbour diocesse, with the consent of his neighbour Bishop, he sent to the Metropolitan, <note n="t" place="margin">

And this, as it is euident to them who haue read any thing concerning the state of the ancient Churches; so is it confessed by <hi>Caluin. Each City</hi> (saith he) <note n="u" place="margin">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10663:138"/>
&amp;c. to the people, and also that they might leaue seede behinde them, they were diligently imploied in instructing the younger sort of the Clergie. To euery Citie a certaine region was attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, which should receiue their Ministers from thence, and be accounted of the body of that Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore euident, that Countrey parishes had not each of them a Bishop and Presbyterie, nor that power of ecclesiasticall gouernment which they talke of.</p>
               <p>And much lesse had the parishes in the Cities.<note place="margin">§ 7. The parishes of the Cities had not seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Bishops.</note> For it was neuer almost heard of, that there were at any time more Bishops (so properly called) then one in a City, where notwithstanding were many Presbyters, when schisme or heresie was not the cause of setting vp a second or third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the one only lawfull Bishop: excepting that in the same Church sometimes a second either hath beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the title of a Bishop without episcopall authoritie, or else ordained as a coadiutor to the first. And when there haue beene more then one by schisme or heresie, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the orthodoxall and Catholike Bishop, nor yet the schismaticall or hereticall Bishop, was a parishionall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, but each of them was Bishop of all that were of the same faith with them, in the Citie and Countrey adioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there hauing beene diuers times in the Cities onely more parishes then one, not onely of the true Christians, but also of the heretikes and schismatickes, as before was noted concerning Antioch.</p>

                  <p>For, Churches containing within their circuit not onely Cities with their Suburbs, but also whole Countries subiect to them, were dioceses.</p>

               <p>The assumption is prooued by these reasons: first, The circuit of a Bishops charge was anciently diuided into these parts, the Citie with the suburbs, and Country sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to it.

then doe I hope, that our Disciplinarians themselues will be perswaded to speake no more for the new found parish Discipline. But before I enter into this second conflict, I am to take a suruey of his forces, which I perceiue are diuided into 2. troopes, the one encountering with my forces, the other fortifying their hold of the parish discipline.</p>
               <p>In his encounter or refutations;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 53.</note> first he findeth fault, that I doe not conclude in this second part, what he would haue me to conclude according to his forced Analysis. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere whereof let my words be considered.</p>
               <q>(<hi>Serm. s.</hi> 1 <hi>pag.</hi> 17. I come now to the second: which is, to shew that in the Apostles time and in the ages following, the Churches wherof the Bishops are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Angels, (or to vse their own words, the visible Churches indued with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Ecclesiastical gouernment) were Dioceses properly, and not parishes. This is prooued out of this place &amp;c.)</q>
               <p>The assertion which I indeuour to prooue in the foure first points of my Sermon, was this, that the Angels or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors of the primitiue Church, were Diocesan Bishops, and for the substance of their calling, such as ours be. This assertion, after I had prooued it in the first point <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by disproouing their Presbyteries: in the three next points I indeuour to prooue it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, shewing that they were such as ours are, both in respect of the largenesse of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; to which end I shew that their Churches were Dioceses in the second point, and themselues Diocesans in the third: and in respect of the height of their authoritie and Preheminence, that they were superiour in degree to other ministers &amp;c. which I prooue in the fourth. In this second
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10663:143"/>
point therefore, if I indeauour to prooue that the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churches, which had Bishops, and Presbyteries, and were indued with power of Ecclesiastical gouernment, were not parishes properly, but Dioceses; nothing could be more directly, and pertinently deliuered. But the onely thing, which I seeke to prooue and maintaine in this part, as euery man seeth, is, that the Churches which had Bishops and Presbyteries, &amp;c. were not parishes properly, but Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses. And this I first prooue by mine owne arguments, and secondly maintaine against theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§. 2. That the 7. Churches were Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note>My arguments were two. The former grounded on the text, and is thus to be framed:
<q>
                     <p>Churches, whose circuit contained not onely cities, but also countries adioyning, were Dioceses.</p>
                     <p>The circuit of the 7. churches, wherof the 7. Angels were Bishops, (and whereto other Churches hauing Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Presbyteries, indued with power of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall gouernment, were like) contained the cities and Countries adjoyning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the 7. Churches &amp;c. were Dioceses.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition I did not expresse, but did presuppose it, and take it for granted. Likewise that part of the assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (inclosed in the parenthesis) affirming that to the 7. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, all others which had Bishops, and Presbyteries, and consequently were indued with the power of Ecclesiasticall gouernment, were like, I also presupposed: because it is not to be doubted but that the primitiue Churches indued with the power of Ecclesiasticall gouernment, were of the like nature and constitution.
And vpon this hypothesis, the onely argument which this great disputer bringeth to make good his cause,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag. 66.</hi>
                  </note> is grounded: affirming that<q> 
                     <hi>it is clear by all learned</hi> (I know not what) <hi>that the constitution of the visible Churches, was at the first one &amp; the same in al places.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the 7. Churches within their circuit contained both the cities and Countries thereto adjoyning, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; first, ioyntly. For if the 7. Churches within their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit comprised all the Churches in Asia, then all both in cities and countries: but the first is true; for our Sauiour
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10663:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christ writing to the churches in <hi>Asia</hi> compriseth all vnder these 7. as being the principall, and containing within their circuit all the rest.</p>
               <p>Then, seuerally: The church of Ephesus, contained a great and ample citie (indeed a Metropolis or mother city) and the country subiect to it: the church of Smyrna a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther city &amp; the country belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to it: the church of Sardes a mother city and the country adioyning: the church of Laoidcea, a mother city and the country vnder it: the Church of Pergamus, or Pergamu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a famous city, (which had beene the fear of the Kings of Asia) and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey belonging to it: the churches also of Thyatira and Philadelphia contained a cities with their territories.</p>
               <p>Now let vs see how our refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>
                     <p>If the churches of Asia to which our sauiour Christ writ,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> were great and ample cities, and not the cities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but also the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries adioyning, then they were dioceses properly and not parishes:</p>
                     <p>But the churches of Asia were such. Therefore they were Dioceses &amp;c.</p>

               <p>That which is presupposed in this consequence is the proposition of the syllogisme which is vnderstood: viz.

               <p>Churches whose circuit contained both cities and countreys adioyning, were dioceses: Therfore the 7. churches were dioceses: in this consequence the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption were presupposed, viz. that the circuit of euerie of the seuen churches contained both the citie, and country adioyning.

For the forme and constitution of all the Primitiue Churches, being one and the same, as the Refuter confesseth; it is euident that what is truely said of other Primitiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in respect of their constitution, is verified of these seuen: And what is verified of these seuen, may bee truely affirmed of the rest. Not that all churches had within their circuit great and ample Cities, (that was spoken concerning fiue of these in Asia) it is sufficient that they had Cities with the countries adioining. And so had all Churches which had a Bishop and a Presbytery, or were (as you speake and meane) indued with power of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall gouernement.<note place="margin">§ 4.

               </p>
               <p>J distinguish of the word Church. For I denie not but the company of Presbyters in a family is a Church, much more in a village or towne. But the question is of such a church, as had a Bishop assisted with a Presbytery, and had, as they speake, the power of Ecclesiasticall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such a Church was seated onely in Cities, or great towns answerable to Cities. And therefore, if they meane (as they doe: or else they might aswell hold their peace) that in Cenchreae was such a Church; I deny the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Cenchreae was subiect to the church of Corinth, as al other towns thereabouts, and neuer had a Bishoppe or a Presbytery of her owne. Yea, but she had a Deacon. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that were so, what then? seuerall Deacons, and seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Presbyters were placed in parish Churches, where was neither B. nor Presbytery, nor the power (which they speake of) of Ecclesiasticall gouernment. And yet their Deacon was but a Diaconisse, namely <hi>Phoebe.</hi> Of whom also it may be doubted, whether <hi>Paul</hi> calleth her <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one that ministred to the Church in Cenchreae, in respect of an office imposed vpon her to minister to the needy, &amp; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine strangers on the churches cost, or in regard of her voluntary ministring to the faithful there, of her own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. For if she were, as <hi>Bullinger,</hi> and diuers before him report, <hi>nobilissima &amp; ditissima foemina, a most noble, and most wealthy woman</hi>; it is not like, that she was a widow main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the church;<note place="margin">Luke 8.3.</note> but one, which (like to <hi>Mary, Ioanna, Chusa,</hi> &amp; <hi>Susanna</hi> mentioned in the Gospell, which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Paul</hi> saith of her,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.2.</note> that she had been <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronesse of many, yea of the Apostle himselfe. Neither is it likely that a widdow maintained of the church, as hauing little or nothing of her owne, should haue such busines in Rome, or (as it is thought) at the Emperours Court, as that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10663:145"/>
the Apostle should write to the faithfull in Rome to assist her in her affaires.
But it may be you desire to heare some further reason of his deniall of that consequence: you shal heare it. For, saith he, <q>
                     <hi>though it were granted, that these</hi> 7. <hi>were great Cities, &amp; the Countries adioyning; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>et there might be diuers others, which were small, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
See you not how he seeketh about for starting holes? What if there were (and that is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be) other smal churches? (as indeed there was none such as we speak of, but they were seated in the Cities, neither was any so small, but if it were indued with power of ecclesiastical gouernment, it was of the same constitution with those which were greater). What is that to this consequence? <hi>If these Churches contained ech of them not onely the City, but the country adioining, then they were not Parishes properly, but Dioceses.</hi> His answere if it bee well weighed, is an exception against the conclusion. As if hee should say, though I would fain wrangle with your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not (for how is it possible, but that if these chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did containe ample Cities with the countries, such as we cal shires, belonging to them, they were not dioceses but parishes?) &amp; although your assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should bee granted, namely, that these churches contained not only the cities, but countries: notwithstanding your conclusion is to be excepted against. For though these were dioceses, yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might be parishes. Such a froward aduersary I haue met withall; who in other places accusing mee, for not concluding what these churches, or the angels of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were, here findeth fault that J co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude what they were. But both his accusations are alike vniust; seeing the constitution of them, and all others (indued with power of ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gouernment) was the same; and what is said of the one, is to be vnderstood of the other.</p>
               <p>His second reason why the consequence is naught:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>§. 5.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth not appeare, (neither is it true) that euery one of these Churches was diuided into diuers seuerall ordinary as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> depending vpon some one as the chiefe, without power of ecclesiastical gouernment apart in themselus.</q>
Is this the denial of any thing but the conclusion? is not the deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the conclusion, an euidence that the answerer is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10663:146"/>
confounded? and is not confusion a manifest signe of one that writeth against his conscience, resolued not to bee perswaded, though his conscience be conuicted?</p>
               <p>As touching his assertion opposed to my conclusion, that they were not Dioceses, because they were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided. &amp;c. it containeth three branches: First, that they were not diuided into diuers ordinary assemblies. Secondly, If they were, yet they did not all depend vpon some one as the chiefe. Thirdly, That they had the power of ecclesiastical gouernement in themselues. These assertions would haue beene proued by them that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, and will needes perswade vs to admitte of their parish Discipline. But I am well assured that they are notable to proue any one of them. And although it were sufficient for me to deny these assertions, and to put them to proue them: yet because I desire from my soule to satisfie our opposites in this cause, as Brethren; and because they containe the very grounds of the parish-discipline, I will briefly disproue them. For, as touching the first, I haue often wondred what our brethren meane to argue from the example of the churches which were not diuided into parishes; to those that bee. Would they haue the Church of a City, and country belonging to it, to bee all but one congregation, asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling ordinarily in one place? If they would, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are they too absurd to be thought worthy to be confuted. But though they would, the ancient chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians would not; who when their multitude was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in all places of the world were diuided into diuers particular assemblies. If they would haue them diuided, as of necessity they must: then let them tell mee, whether wee (that doe, and of necessity must, consist of diuers congregations) are to follow the example of any anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent church, as it was before it was diuided, or as it was after it was diuided. If the former, then are they absurd againe: If the latter, then haue I that which I desire. They will say perhaps, that each congregation after the diuision, was as that one before. Nothing lesse: Let them proue that, and I will yeeld in the whole cause. The one
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10663:146"/>
before had a Bishop, and a Presbytery, as they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse which were to attend the whole flocke, but after the diuision, not each parish had a Bishop and a Presbytery, but one of the Presbyters assigned to it, the rest remaining with the Bishop, who (as before) assisted with his Presbytery, had a generall superintendencie ouer them, as well diuided as vndiuided, and was but one in euery diocesse, as well after the diuision as before. Which is so manifest a truth, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by testimonies before cited, so testified by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall consent and practise of the Christian world, not one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to be giuen to the contrary, as that it cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the conscience, I hope also it will perswade. For tell mee I pray you, were not parishes distinguished in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantines</hi> time and before, as well as now? Yes question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. Were any other assigned to them seuerally, then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Presbyters, euen as they be now? That also is out of doubt. Was it euer, or at any time otherwise, after the diuision of parishes? No without question. There remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but one Bishop, and one Presbytery for the whole citie and country, as well after the diuision as before. And that is so euident a truth, by that which hath bin said, that no man of learning can with a good conscience any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it.</p>
               <p>But it will be said,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> that the Churches before they were diuided, were not dioceses. Whereto I answere, that the circuit of the Church, in the intention of the Apostle or first founder of it, was the same as well before the diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of parishes, as after. Euen as the subiect of the leauen is the whole bach, in the intention of him that putteth it into the lumpe, though the loaues bee not yet diuided, yea though but a little of the dough bee yet (after it is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in) seasoned. If you aske mee how J know this? I answere. First, because the whole Church of God, euer since the Apostles daies vnto our age, hath so vnderstood the intention of the Apostles, and of their first founders: the circuit of euery Church hauing from the beginning included not onely the citie, but the country thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. Secondly, because that diuision of Churches which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10663:147"/>
was three or foure hundred yeeres after Christ, with their limits and circuits, were ordinarily the same which had been from the beginning, as before hath been testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by diuers antient Councels. Thirdly, because it is confessed by <note n="a" place="margin">

And as the Church followed the ciuill distribution at the beginning, so also if there were any new citie erected by the authority of the Emperour, it was decreed by the Councell of Constantinople <note n="d" place="margin">

For if there were but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe for the Church, both of the citie and country, (as there were but seuen in all these seuen Churches) and but one Presbytery: if the Churches both of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and country were subiect to the Bishoppe of the citie: if the parishes both of citie and country had neither Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe nor Presbytery, but Presbyters seuerally assigned to them: if the Presbyters of the country were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Bishoppe of the citie, and not onely they, but the rurall Bishoppes also were subiect to his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; all which, I haue by most euident arguments and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies proued already: then did the seuerall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and parishes, which J haue also prooued were all but members of one body, depend vpon the chiefe Church in the citie as the head, which afterwards was called <hi>Matrix ecclesia, cathedra episcopi,</hi> or the cathedrall Church, neither had the power of ecclesiasticall iurisdiction whereof they speake, as I haue also proued before.</p>

               <p>This title giuen to Bishops after the diuision of parishes, plainly prooueth also, that they were not Bishops of any one parish, but of all the Churches in the Citie, and of the whole diocesse.</p>
               <p>My assertion therefore, that each of the seuen Churches was not only the Citie, but the countrey also adioining, would according to the true meaning thereof haue beene consuted, if hee had beene able, and not the words fondlie cauilled with.
But not contended heere with, he stretcheth my words beyond that which his owne conscience would tell him was my meaning; as if I had said, <q>

And therefore full soberly he goeth about it, telling vs, <q>

when euery body knoweth, that in all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Countries, for the space of almost 300. yeeres, the Christians were persecuted by the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>If any man aske, how it may bee said, that the Church contained the Citie and Country, when but a few Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in comparison of the heathen, were in either of both: I answer (as before) that the circuit of the Church or dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse was the same, when there were few, and when there were many, yea when all were Christians. Neither were there more Bishops set ouer the Citie and Country when all were Christians, then when there were but a few; the same Bishop of the Citie hauing iurisdiction ouer all the Christians both in the Citie and country, as well when all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10663:149"/>
were Christians, as when but a few: which J prooued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the generall consent and perpetuall practise of all Christendome euer since the Apostles times; which ought without comparison to preuaile with vs aboue the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of a few selfe-conceited persons among vs, who are not so singular for learning, as they are singular in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whose pride and arrogancie in aduancing themselues against the iudgment and practise of the vniuersall church in all places, and in all ages since the Apostles times, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea but saith hee,</hi> 
                  <q>the Church of Smyrna writing <note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> of the said Martyrdome of Polycarpus, intituleth her selfe the Church of God which is at Smyrna. Was there a whole Diocesse or Countrey of Christians inhabiting Smyrna?</q>
Which is an obiection scarce worth the answering. For whether by the Church of Smyrna you vnderstand the whole Diocesse, it was seated chiefely in the Citie (as the soule, which is in all the bodie, is said to bee in the head; and God, who is in all places, to be in heauen) or but that part which did inhabit the Citie, you are not to maruell, if the whole companie of Christians inhabiting a City, are called a Church, seeing the companie of Christians in a parish, or in a familie, deserueth that name. Neither doth the naming of it selfe the Church which is at Smyrna, exclude the Churches in the Countrey from being of the same bodie or diocesse with it. And thus much may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to haue spoken concerning the first syllogisme which he framed for mee.</p>
               <p>Now are wee to examine the second.<note place="margin">§ 7. The 1. proofe of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, viz. that the seuen Churches contained both the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Countries adioining.</note>
                  <q>M.D. <hi>(saith he)</hi> perceiuing that this assumption wanted strength, sought to fortifie it by two reasons.</q>
This is my aduersaries vsuall, though odious, fashion, sophistically to argue euery as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of weaknesse, for which I bring proofe: when ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the proofe (if it bee good, as hitherto hee hath not beene able to disprooue any) doth argue the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their iudgement, who denie or doubt of the truth which is prooued, and the strength also of the assertion, which is armed with such proofe.</p>

                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 55.</note>The former reason he propoundeth thus:
<q>
                     <p>If our Sauiour writing to the Churches of Asia, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth but seuen, and some of them mother Cities, then were they great and ample Cities, and not the Cities alone, but the Countries adioining.</p>
                     <p>But our Sauiour writing to the Churches of Asia, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth but seuen. &amp;c.</p>
                  </q>
To let passe his vnmannerly gibing, not worth the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, and to referre you to the manner how this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme is to be framed, before <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Supr.</hi> §. 2.</note> mentioned, let vs see how hee dealeth with this frame which himselfe hath fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He denieth, after his vsuall manner, both the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and the assumption. So hard is my happe, that scarce any one proposition or assumption, which hee fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth for me, may be acknowledged to be true: and yet so hard is his happe, that he is not able to prooue any one ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proposition or assumption of mine to be vntrue.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The proposition hee would confute by an <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>though it were granted that our Sauiour wrote these epistles to all the Churches of Asia, yet it will not follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the rest depended vpon these, as children vpon the mother.</hi> To which he addeth the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in denying the former part of the assumption, viz. <hi>that our Sauiour did not write to all the Churches of Asia.</hi> His deniall of the consequence he confirmeth by <hi>putting a case: If the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour finding some abuses commonly raigning in the whole Country of Asia, should haue written to these principall and mother Cities for the reforming of those abuses, with intent</hi> (saith he) <hi>that all other Cities and Townes should be warned by his reproofe of them,</hi> (which put-case with that intent is worthy to be put into a cap-case) <hi>might a man conclude thereupon, that all other Townes and Cities of Asia were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the gouernment of these seuen?</hi>
                  </q>
But say I, put the case, that the Emperor so should doe, with that intent, which is, and also hath beene vsuall in such cases, that is, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that what hee writeth to them, might by and from them be notified to those Townes and Villages which were within the circuit of their iurisdiction: would it not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10663:150"/>
strongly proue, that all those other townes and villages were subiect to them? Come we to our selues. When the King or his Counsell would haue any thing intimated to all his Subiects in certaine Counties, are not warrants di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Lieutenants of each County, from them to the high Constables of euery hundred, from them to the Constables of euery towne? and doth not this shew that the officers of the towne are subordinate to those of the hundred, and much more to the gouernours of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? In like manner when the Archbishop would haue any thing imparted to euery parish, hee directeth his letters to the Bishops, they, to the Archdeacons, they, to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in euery Dean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, they acquaint (in particular) eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parish. Euen so by Christ his writing to the 7. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, what he would haue imparted to all the particular Churches, it may bee gathered, that the rest of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches were subiect to them. And it may well be, that when our Sauiour writing to euery one of the Angels seuerally, &amp; concluding each Epistle with this Epiphone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, <hi>Let him that hath an eare, heare what the Spirite saith to the Churches,</hi> would haue it vnderstood what he writeth to the Angell, he writeth to the Churches, which be vnder his charge.</p>
               <p>And thus you haue heard, how he hath fared with the Proposition. The Assumption hee distinguisheth into two parts, the former,<note place="margin">§ 10. Whether Christ wrote to all the churches in Asia.</note> 
                  <hi>affirming that Christ wrote to all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Asia</hi>: the latter, <hi>that some of these seuen Churches were Mother-Cities:</hi> both hee denieth as false.
<q>
                     <hi>The former,</hi> because it is vnlikely, <hi>as he saith,</hi> if not impossible, that our Sauior writing to that third part of the world which was not much lesse then both the other, Africa and Europe, would write but to these <hi>7.</hi> which were all together in one little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it.</q>
Here I appeale to my aduersary, if he be a man of learning, whether hee doth not cauill against the light of his conscience, seeing he could not be so ignorant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to thinke, that by Asia mentioned in the Apocalypse, and else where in the Epistles and Acts of the Apostles, is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10663:151"/>
not meant Asia the great, nor yet that which is called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia <hi>minor,</hi> being the whole Chersonesus, now called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia, bounded on the north with Pontus Euxinus, on the west with the Hellespont, &amp; <hi>mare Aegaeum,</hi> on the south, with the Mediterranean sea, including<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> eight countries, whereof Asia (so properly called) is one.
And albeit he knoweth (as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded) that by Asia in the Apocalypse, is meant onely that, which is so properly called; yet he maketh a great flourish, partly to shew some small skill in Geography; but chiefly (that I may vse his owne terme,) to dazell the eyes of the simple;<note place="margin">Ad pag. 56.</note> shewing how vnlikely it is,<q> 
                     <hi>either that the great Kingdomes of Asia maior should bee Parishes vnder the seuen Churches: or that those many famous Churches of Asia Minor, as the Churches of Derbe, Lystria, Iconium, Antioch in Pisidia, Pergain Pamphylia, of Galatia, which were many, were but dependants vpon these seuen.</hi>
                  </q>
If hee doth not know, that none of these Countries are contained in that Asia whereof the holy Ghost speaketh: let him compare but these few testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture. Act. 2.9.10. &amp; 6.9. &amp; 16.6.7. &amp; 1.

                     <hi>It is cleare therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>that our Sauiour intended not to write to all the Churches of Asia, but onely to those seven which he nameth; to no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e of which, so many and so famous Churches could belong.</hi>
                  </q>
Whereto I aunswere, according to that which I haue prooued, that euery Church that was in Asia in these times, was either one of these seuen, or depending on them. As for those Churches which he mentioneth in Asia <hi>maior,</hi> or Asia <hi>minor,</hi> yea euen those which were in Phrygia <hi>minor,</hi> or Troas, or in Phrygia <hi>maior,</hi> as Hierapolis, and Colossae, were not any of them in Asia so properly called: there remaine only Magnesia, and Tralles to prooue his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. Which either he cannot prooue to haue beene Churches at this time; or if they were, hee cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, that they belonged to one of these seuen. So that nothing, which he can obiect, doth hinder, but that vnder these seuen, our Sauiour did write to all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Asia.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§. 12. That some of the seuen Churches were mother Cities.</note>Thus the former parte of the assumption remaineth true; and so will the latter, though he say <q>

                     </gap>ed, that they were neither mother cities, nor cities at all. And whereas he obiecteth, <hi>that the Epistles were directed to the Angell of the Church in Ephesus, in Smyrna &amp;c. and not of Ephesus the Church, Smyrna the Church, as of the whole cities were the Churches:</hi>
                  </q> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that although the whole citie of Ephesus meaning <hi>Civitas,</hi> was not the Church vntill it was wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the profession of Christianitie: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the whole citie, meaning <hi>vrbs,</hi> was contained within the circuite of the Church intended by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and acknowledged by the iudgement and practise of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10663:153"/>
that Church, conformable to the iudgement and practise of all other churches in christendome.
Neither is that mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall that the church is said to haue bin in Ephesus (as it also was when the whole city was conuerted to christianity) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>vrbe,</hi> in the city, the church was chiefly seated, as was said before.</p>
               <p>Now that some of these were Metropoleis, that is, as I said, not onely mother cities, but also Metropolitan churches, I wil briefly declare. Those cities which were <hi>capita</hi>

But the 3, which is indeed the assumption it selfe, and which is inferred on the former as I set them downe (that if the Apostles intending the conuersion of the nation, as they began themselues to preach in the cheefe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so they placed Presbyters to the same intent, hoping by them to conuert both city and countrey: then were they appointed and it was their duty to labour the conuersion of all belonging to God both in city and country) the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, I say, it selfe he doth deny, saying, <q>
                     <hi>it was the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of those Presbyters, to attend vpon the flock,</hi> that is, the company already conuerted, <hi>but that it can neuer be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor may reasonably be thought that it was any part of their proper duty to labour the conuersion of the residue either in citie or country.</hi>
                  </q>
By which few words the deepe wisedom of the parish-disciplinarians may easily be sounded. 1. They conceiue that churches in the first constitution of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when there were but a few conuerted, and before parishes were distinguished, were in the same estate that now they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully constituted, al being conuerted to the profession of the faith, &amp; parishes distinguished, pastors being seuerally as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to certain particular ordinary set co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. 2. That the flocke ouer which they were set, was onely that number of christians already conuerted, and not the whole number which in those parts pertained to God. But our Sauiour cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the elect not conuerted his sheepe.<note place="margin">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10663:155"/>
the conuersion and saluation of no more, then of those few which at the first were conuerted. But for the better manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of their wisedome, they shall giue mee leaue to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them with a few questions. The Presbyters which the Apostles ordained, were they not ministers of the word? <hi>Caluin</hi> confesseth it; and if you should deny it, I haue manifestly proued that they were not lay, nay that there were not any lay presbyters. Were not the presbyters many? in some places more, in some fewer, according to the proportion of the cities, or countreys where they were placed? were these many Presbyters (who at the first were sometimes as many, as those who were besides conuerted, the Apostles conueying by imposition of hands the gifts of the spirit, on them whom they had first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, who thereby were inabled for the ministry, as <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6.) Were they, I say, being many, intended onely to attend that smal number which at the first was conuerted? Did not the Apostles in ordaining many Presbyters, when few others were conuerted, intend the conuersion of more then those fewe? and was it not their office the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to labour their conuersion? Jf they were not to labour their conuersion, how were they to bee conuerted? Nay if they did not labour it, how were they conuerted? Were all these Presbyters pastors properly of that one flocke, or was there but one who properly was the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor or Bishoppe; the rest beeing his assistants, as the Presbytery? When therefore more were conuerted then could well assemble together in one ordinarie congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, were not the congregations diuided? Vpon this diuision was there a Bishoppe and presbyterie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to euerie seuerall congregation, or onely a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter; the Bishoppe assisted with his Presbyterie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a generall superintendencie ouer all, not onelie to attend those who were already conuerted, but also to procure the conuersion of the rest; and still as people in diuers places were conuerted, to furnish them with a Presbyter, and to guide and gouerne both them and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10663:156"/>
their Presbyter after their constitution to bee a seuerall Church, and his institution to bee their Minister. To imagine therefore that the state of the Churches and charge of the Ministers was so the same before the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of parishes and after, that as either before there was ouer one congregation a Bishoppe and presbyterie, so there should after to euery particular congregation be assigned a Bishoppe and presbyterie: or after, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per office of the ministers appointed to their seuerall charges was to attend them; so before the Bishoppe and presbytery should haue beene prouided properly for that number alone which was conuerted, and they should not haue thought it to belong to their charge, to seeke or to labour the conuersion of the residue: I say, to thinke this, argueth the parish-disciplinarians to bee of shallow iudgement, and the parish-discipline to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of vnd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Vpon the proposition therfore and the assumption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propounded, this conclusion notwithstanding al his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, doth follow:
<q>Therefore the Presbyteries ordained by the Apostles,<note place="margin">

               <p>The second argument whereby the same assertion in these words is proued may thus be framed:
<q>
                     <p>When the Churches were not diuided into seueral pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes nor Presbyters assigned to their seuerall titles or cures, but werein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the whole flock feding
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10663:156"/>
them that were already conuerted, and labouring the conuersion of the rest, so farre as they were able both in citie and country: then were not the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries appointed to parishes, but to dioceses.</p>
                     <p>In the Apostles times the churches were not diuided into seuerall parishes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the Apostles times the Presbyteries were appointed not to parishes, but to dioceses.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition seemeth to be of necessary and euident truth: for when there were no parishes distinguished, how could the Presbyters be assigned to seuerall parishes? And if they were appointed to labour the conuersion of all which belonged to God, both in citie and countrey, how were they not appointed to dioceses? For can hee thinke, that all the people which belonged to God in the city and country, and which after also were conuerted, belonged to one parish? Is it not euident, that after their conuersion they were diuided into many both in citie and countrey? And what though at the very first all the Christians in the citie and countrey, if they had beene assembled together, would haue made but a small congregation? were they therefore of one parish before there was any parish at all? Was not the circuit of the Church, as before hath beene prooued, and of the Bishop and Presbyteries charge, the same in purpose and intention at the first, when they were but a few, which it was afterwards in execution, when all were conuerted?</p>
               <p>The assumption also is that which the Refuter himselfe holdeth, that there were not in any Church many parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the Apostles times. Howbeit, I except the Church of Alexandria, as after you shall heare. But though he know not how to answer directly to either of both, yet he wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth with both, and as a man confounded, yet resolued to contradict, though against the light of his conscience, he denieth the conclusion, and contradicteth himselfe.</p>
               <p>The proposition after his perpetuall manner, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth connexiuely: If the parishes were not distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, &amp;c. then were not the Presbyters appointed for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10663:157"/>
&amp;c. The force of the connexion, as it inferreth they were appointed to dioceses, he suppresseth, leauing out the words of greatest force, viz. that they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to labour the conuersion of those that belong to God, so farre as they should be able, both in the citie, and in the countries adioining. And as it inferreth that they were not appointed to parishes, he answereth not: only he maketh a flourish with the shew of regestion; which kinde of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer best fitteth him that is at a Nonplus. Howsoeuer the world goeth, the consequence must be denied: that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued vpon, though he haue nothing to oppose against it. Yes he hath two things to oppose; the first a question,
<q>What if euery one of the Churches then were but one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish?</q>
As if hee should say, What if the maine questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene vs bee true, in that part which wee hold, viz. that the Churches were parishes, and not dioceses? Where are you then? Why, but I prooue they were not parishes, because the presbyteries were not appointed to parishes, but to dioceses. And come you now with this question, What if they were? Yea but I will prooue they were. You will neede your proofes in a fitter place. Yea but in the meane time I disprooue your conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. You will say something perhaps to bleare the eies of the simple: but you doe not indeede denie, and much lesse doe you disprooue the consequence. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the consequence were this: Though it bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that parishes were not distinguished, and that the Presbyteries were appointed for the conuersion of all both in Citie and Countrey; yet it doth not follow, that they were appointed to dioceses, and not to seuerall parishes: and not this, nay but the Churches were each of them but one parish. This is to denie the maine conclusion which is already prooued. Yea but the proofe of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall disprooueth your consequence. The consequent perhaps, which is the conclusion, but the consequence it cannot, without supposing as it doth not, those things which are supposed in the proposition, thus: Though there were no parishes, yet they were assigned to parishes:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10663:157"/>
though they were appointed both for Citie and Country, yet they were not appointed for dioceses. You deny there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a man amazed, the maine conclusion: the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the proposition you touch not.</p>
               <p>But let vs see how he disproueth the conclusion,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> though his argument come out of time, and be here vsed only for a poore shift. It may thus be framed:
<q>Such as are the French and Duch Churches here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, such were the Churches in the Apostles times. But the French and Duch Churches here in England are not diocesan, but distinct parishionall assemblies. Therefore the Churches in the Apostles times were not diocesan, but distinct parishionall assemblies.</q>
First, I denie the proposition, not onely because the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Churches (in the Apostles intention) was not included within a Citie, as of the French and Duch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with vs; but chiefly because the French Church (for example) in London is but one Church, among many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the same religion, being a certaine and set num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hauing a Presbytery consisting for the most part of lay men, placed among vs, not with purpose to conuert ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the City or Country to them, but to attend them of their owne Church; whereas contrariwise the Churches in the Apostles times, before the diuision of parishes, were not each of them one among many, but were planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong heathen people, hauing a Bishop and a Presbyterie of learned men placed among them, as leauen is put into the lumpe, with purpose to conuert the rest both in Citie and Country. The Church which had the Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery first placed in it, was <hi>Matrix Ecclesia,</hi> as after it was called, begetting other Churches and spirituall Fathers for them; which being begotten in Citie and Countrey, were all (euen when the whole Citie and Country were filled with her off-spring) to bee subordinate and subiect to her, as their mother. But no such thing can be imagined of the Duch and French Churches among vs.</p>
               <p>As touching the assumption, I say, that the French and Duch Churches with vs are not properly parishes, nor such
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10663:158"/>
as the ancient parishes were, after the first diuision of them, seeing the members thereof dwell in many distinct pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, either of them being endued with power of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall gouernement, and not subordinate to another Church as members thereof, but being entire bodies by themselues are models (as it were) of diocesan Churches, hauing a Presbytery (as the Church of Geneua hath) to supply the want of a Bishop, which once <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Alasco.</hi>
                  </note> they had, and still might haue, in imitation of the ancient Christians, who when the Citie where they dwelt was replenished, and the Mother Church occupied with men of another faith, (as with Arians sometimes in Antioch and Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria) as ours be with men of another Language, had a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of their owne in all respects like other Bishops, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that they held not the Mother Church, and therefore had neither the like Clergie, nor the like reuenewes to maintaine them.</p>
               <p>The second thing which hee opposeth, is (as I said) a shew of regestion: which he propoundeth with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, as if hee had mee at no small aduantage saying, <q>that I pull downe with one hand that I set vp with another. If there were at that time no parishes, how could there bee dioceses, seeing euery diocesse consisteth of diuers distinct parishes? Thus <hi>(saith he)</hi> the light will breake out, though men shut their eies against it.</q>
You see how bragge hee would seeme to bee. But good sir, what is this to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence? If there were no parishes in the Apostles times, then the Presbyteries were not appointed to parishes. You answer, If there were no parishes, then there were no dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses. To what end is this spoken? To denie my conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or the maine conclusion? Assume, But you say there were no parishes, therefore there were no dioceses; which is the contradictorie to the maine conclusion. But where doe I say there were no parishes? Not in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, where it is only supposed; but in the assumption: for that which is supposed in the antecedent of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, is positiuely set downe in the assumption. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he would seeme to deny the consequence of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10663:158"/>
proposition, he doth not so much as touch it. But by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a supposed aduantage, against the Assumption, hee denieth the principall conclusion.</p>
               <p>But let vs examine his argument. <hi>If there were no pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes in the Apostles times, there were no Dioceses.</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence I deny. For the Diocesse was the same before the Parishes were diuided and after. And the circuit of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall iurisdiction intended the same before parishes were diuided, with that it was after they were diuided, that is answerable to the ciuill. The same circuit belonging to the Church both in the intention, before all were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in execution after all were conuerted, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the ciuill state, Yea, but saith he; <hi>euery Diocesse consisteth of distinct Parishes.</hi> It is true after the distinction of Parishes, but not before, as a bach of bread consisteth of many distinct loaues after the distinction, which before it contained vndistinguished in the lumpe. A man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of many distinct members after they are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, which at his first conception were not distinct.</p>
               <p>The Proposition being thus recouered out of his hands, J am now to rescue the Assumption.<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> Which saith that the Churches in the Apostles times were not diuided into pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, &amp;c. Which is to be vnderstood, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as true of the most Churches. Here I expect a direct answere. were they diuided into parishes, or were they not? If they were (as at Alexandria it seemeth to haue beene, euen in the Apostles times) then was not euery Church but one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish: if they were not, then the Presbyters were not assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to seuerall parishes, and so the assumption is true. Nay, rather then the assumption shall goe for currant, we will deny each Church to haue beene but a parish. Is it credible that any man should bee so transported with the spirit of contradiction, as that hee should not care so hee may gainesay his aduersaries present assertion, how shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hee contradicteth himselfe? yet thus it fareth with our refuter. In oppugning the proposition hee said, and laboured to proue it, that each church was but one parish, the same he saith, and saith againe, in defending their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections,

                  </q>, and (therefore not of ignorance by him omitted in the proposition) the which though hee call an errour, yet I proued to be an euident truth, and discouered the shallownes of their iudgement, which do denie it.
Besides that errour, he chargeth the maine points in the assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as altogether void of truth. The points are these: 1. that parishes were not distinguished in the apostles times 2. that Presbyters were not then assigned to their seuerall titles or cures: 3. that they were in common to attend the whole flocke conuerted. For that which is added of labouring the conuersion of the residue, &amp;c. is the errour forsooth which before he noted.
How proueth he these points to be false? Thus:<q> whome can M.D. perswade that the Apostles would either appoint or allow of such confused assemblies, wherein the teachers and hearers should euery day so disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly be changed?</q>
And then putteth the like case of a schoole, himselfe being worthy to be put into a cloake-bagge. For in which of these points doth this orderly &amp; vnconfounded man, note such disorder and confusion? or was not the confused conceite he speaketh of, in his own braine?
Let him call to mind what euen now hee said in oppugning the proposition;<q> that euery one of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches then, was but one parish, which by reason of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the people had many teachers. Do we not see the like, <hi>saith he,</hi> in the French &amp; Duch churches here in England? <hi>&amp; concludeth,</hi> that such Parishes there were in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times, and none but such.</q>
Tell me then, is the French or Duch Church in London distinguished either of them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10663:159"/>
into seuerall parishes, which is the first point? If they be, how are they but one Parish? Are their ministers, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to be as he saith many, (as there were many Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in the Apostles times in each Church before the diuision of the parishes) are they assigned to seueral titles, that is, parishes or cures? If their Church be not diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers parishes, how can their Presbyters be assigned to diuers? which is the 2. point. Thirdly, doe not their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <hi>communi consilio &amp; mutuo auxilio,</hi> by common counsel and mutuall helpe attend their whole flocke, none of them being appointed to a seuerall charge? And yet all this (I hope) without disorder or confusion. That therefore which hee bableth in the greatest part of the page, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning disorder and confusion, is wholy to be ascribed to his owne distemper and confusion.</p>
               <p>Yea,<note place="margin">§ 7.</note> but <q>
                     <hi>M.D. telleth vs that the Presbyters were to attend the whole flocke</hi>
                  </q>. So saith S. <hi>Luke,</hi> Act. 20.28.
What of that? if they were to attend the whole flocke in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, then were they not assigned to seuerall parishes, which were but parts of the flocke,<note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> to which purpose the place of the Acts was quoted.<q> 
                     <hi>Doth either of them say, that a flocke was any more then one ordinarie assembly, and might not that be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish as well as a Diocesse?</hi>
                  </q>
Either of whome? hee had me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned none but S. <hi>Luke</hi> onely. But let that passe. For to what purpose doth he aske, whether <hi>Luke</hi> said, that a flocke was any more then one assembly? If the flocke were but one asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly, that which I proposed is the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. For if they were to attend al one assembly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were they not assigned to seueral parishes. But yet I would haue him know, that the word flock, the word <hi>ecclesia</hi> or church which there, &amp; the word people, which in other places is vsed as a word of the same signification, is of a larger exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then to signifie onely one assembly. The flocke is that, for which Christ the good shepheard did giue his life;<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.16.</note> vnto which appertained the sheep which his father gaue him, not only amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iewes, but the Gentiles also. And this flock is that Church which God (meaning Christ,<note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> who is God) in that place of the Acts is said to haue redeemed with his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10663:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bloud, &amp; that people of his which he saueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their sins. And as this is spoken of the Church in generall; so the company of them that belong to Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> in any Nation, Prouince, Diocesse, City or Parish, may bee called <hi>the Flocke,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>people</hi> of God.
Neither doe I doubt, for the reasons before alleadged, but that the flock in which those Presbyters, Act. 20. were set as ouerseers, was the people belonging to God in the City of Ephesus, and the Country adioyning, where he saith, <q>
                     <hi>the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, is ordinarily vsed of beasts and fowles that heard and flocke together.</hi>
                  </q>
I confesse it is beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of my reading, who neuer read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, applied to fowles, but haue found the word vsed properly for a flocke of sheepe, and metaphorically for the flocke of Christs sheepe; but that flocke is not one onely particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregation. For <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.16. as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the word <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> which he denieth to signifie any other outward company of men, then a particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation only, I haue already said more to confute that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant conceit then will be answered in hast.
But heare his conclusion:<note place="margin">Sup. cap. 1.</note>
                  <q> 
                     <hi>if my,</hi> (that is, if the word <hi>Ecclesia</hi> doth not signifie any other then a particular congregation) <hi>what truth is there in his assumption,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ad pag. 60.</note> 
                     <hi>that denieth parishes to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,</hi> (he would haue said to haue beene distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,) <hi>in the Apostles times, and the Presbyters to haue been assigned to their seuerall titles or cures?</hi>
                  </q>
This conclusion I desire may be kept in remembrance, vntill as you haue seene him deny it before, so you shall see him againe and againe to deny it. Jn the meane time I beseech you how is it inferred? If the word Church signifie onely a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregation, (and such a one was that flock in which the Presbyters were set, Act. 20.28.) therefore there is no truth in the assumption which denieth the parishes to haue beene distinguished, and the Presbyters assigned to their seuerall titles or cures. Who seeth not, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is to bee inferred? Jf the word Church did signifie one congregation, and was in euery City but one, and if such was the flocke which the Presbyters were appointed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10663:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to attend wholly and in common, then it followeth that the flocke was not diuided into particular parishes, nor the Presbyters assigned to seuerall cure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And so the assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his owne inference is proued to be true.</p>
               <p>This and thus weakly, saith the refuter, hath M.D. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the point of so great importance: And thus and thus stongly, say I, hath our refuter disproued it.

No doubt he would appeare to be some tall man, if he durst shew his head.

               <p>First, he premiseth a syllogisme concluding the maine question, that the Churches in the Apostles times (hee should haue added as I did, and the age following, for themselues in their question include two hundred yeeres) were not dioceses properly, but parishes.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If the Presbyteries and presidents therof in the great Cities <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ere assigned but to one particular ordinary congregation assembled together in one place: then the Churches in the Apostles times (<hi>and in the age following</hi>) were not dioceses properly, but parishes. But the Presbyteries and presidents thereof in the great Cities were assigned but to one particular ordinary congregation assembled together in one place.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Churches in the Apostles times (<hi>and in the age following</hi>) were not dioceses properly but parishes.</p>
                  <p>The consequence of the proposition is cleare by that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered a little before, where I said that ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cesse must needs consist of distinct congregations.</p>
               </q>
               <p>But if this proposition haue no better <hi>hypothesis</hi> to support it, I may deny it: seeing I haue proued before, that there were dioceses in the first conception of the Churches before distinction of parishes.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10663:161"/>
So that the addition of this syllogisme hath made his cause somewhat worse then it was before.</p>

                     <p>Therefore both the Presbyteries and presidents ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of were assigned but to one congregation.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The former syllogisme for breuity I omitted, desiring in few words to bring their argument to the issue, presuming that any man might from my conclusion deduce the maine question, after this manner:
<q>
                     <p>They were prouided but for one particular ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation assemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Therefore not for a diocesse.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The second which containeth the issue, I propounded as forcibly as he hath done. But my aduersary is one of those disputers, who when the consequence of an <hi>Enthymeme</hi> is denied, make it good by a connexiue syllogisme. When as an <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> for disputation, is by somuch better then a connexiue syllogisme, by how much it is shorter: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence being thesame with the connexion of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, the antecedent all one with the assumption, and the consequent the very same with the conclusion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexiue syllogisme. Such disputers are good to waste paper, and spend time.</p>
               <p>But to the point.<note place="margin">§. 2. His conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</note> I deny, as before, both the consequence and the antecedent of the <hi>Enthymeme</hi>; so now, both the proposition and the assumption of his syllogisme.
The proofe of the consequence hee slubbereth ouer, for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is better in denying consequences, then in prouing of them.<q> For, <hi>saith hee,</hi> seeing the deniall is vpon this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10663:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ground, that the Prestbyters were appointed not onely to take charge of them that were conuerted, but also to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the conuersion of the rest, which we haue shewed to bee false, it wil remaine good notwithstanding.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But I haue proued that it is an vndigested fancy &amp; rare conceit of shallow (if not giddy) heads, which see no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their nose end, to imagine that the Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending (as they cannot deny) the conuersion of the citie and country, did place in the citie a Bishop and Presbytery, to take charge only of that small number which at the first was conuerted; but chiefly from hence to infer, that euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parish should haue the like B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shop and Presbytery. The antient Church of God in all places vnderstood the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles intent as I expound the same. And therefore when all both in citie and country, were conuerted to the profession of the faith, they acknowledged the generall care and inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ouer them all, to belong to that one B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shop of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and themselues as I said in the Sermon, to be part of that Church: and neuer did, vnlesse it were in time of schisme or heresie, set vp another B. and Presbytery within the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: but euery congregation contented it selfe with a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Presbyter, if it could bee so well prouided for. And this is so manifest a truth, that I doubt not to pronounce him void either of a sound iudgement, or good conscience, that shall deny it. This consequence therefore will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee made good. And therefore the Refuter might haue saued his labour if it were ought worth, which he spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the assumption, vntill he had proued the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>Yea but this consequence belike might haue been made stronger. For<q> he did wisely, <hi>saith he,</hi> to digge the pit no dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but that he might be able to fill it againe: so could hee not haue done, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e gone as low as we doe, who thus frame our reason:<p>All the Christians in any one great Citie and the townes about it (vnlesse there were distinct Churches in those townes) did make but one particular ordinary congregation, assembled in one place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:10663:162"/>
Therefore both the Presbyters and Presidents thereof, were assigned but to one congregation.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I mislike not his addition of the townes about, so he will bee pleased, as hee addeth them to strengthen his conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, so not to forget (as I doubt he will) to take them into the defence of his antecedent. But where he speaketh of his digging deeper; others as good Pioners as hee, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the state of our Church, went no deepeer: and I durst not adde more to their antecedent, as he hath done, lest I should make it too absurd.</p>
               <p>But what meaneth that parenthesis, <q>(vnlesse there were distinct Churches in those townes?)</q>
I feare to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented with this inclosure. Belike there were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations then one in the cities and townes (as he said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cenchrea</hi> was a distinct Church from Corinth) and then, how shall all both in citie and country, be said to bee but one congregation? Tush, wee haue a bush for that gap. We will except all other congregations but that one, and so they being excepted, all will bee but one. <hi>Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum caput!</hi> As if you had said, all the congregations of Christians both in citie and country were but one, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there were more then one. I promise you you haue digged well, and haue hedged your ditch with a strong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure. But why had you not the like hedge or wall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the citie? (vnlesse there were distinct Churches in the citie) for then all had been cockesure. This hedge for the townes, and this wall for the citie, would haue suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently fenced the antecedent. But then the consequence had been ridiculous: and as it is now propounded, (with this inclosure in the antecedent) is altogether as weake as it was before. For to what purpose are the townes added, if the parishes be excepted? And by this inclosure the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent it selfe is bewraied of falshood. For if there were in the citie and country more distinct Churches, or parishes, (as here is supposed) and these all subordinate to one (as I haue manifestly proued before) then all these will make a diocesse. I say therefore againe, that though their antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent were true, yet the consequence were to be denied.</p>

               <p>Therefore in the first two hundred yeeres, all the Christians in any great Citie (and the townes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, which he should haue added) did make more then one particular congregation ordinarily assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in one place.</p>
               <p>Did not I tell you that hee would forget to adde to the Cities, the Townes about them, which hee did adde to his Antecedent to make the former consequence good, but dares not adde it now for feare of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all?</p>

First, hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilleth, and meerely cauilleth with the consequence, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting such things as hee is perswaded in his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, neither were in the primitiue Church, nor ought to haue been. Themselues doe teach, that parishes ought to bee so well compact and trussed together,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>T. C. H.I.</hi>
                  </note> as that all of the same Church may conueniently and ordinarily meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and also that where the multitude is greater, then that all can well meete together, they ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10663:163"/>
themselues into diuers congregations. And now he telleth vs of great parishes, either in the suburbs of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or in some parts of the land, which were at their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out nothing so populous as now they are: both which sorts being so mightily increased in respect of the number of their parishioners, himselfe I dare say is of opinion that they ought to bee diuided.
And therefore ought not (but that hee meant to cauill) to haue sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the practise of the primitiue Church (which hee and his consorts doe alwaies vrge as a precedent for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) to bee sutable to those instances, which though hee giueth, yet hee and all his partners doe vtterly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as swaruing from the practise of the primitiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And where he saith,<q> 
                     <hi>M. D. doth mistake the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whiles hee thinketh that wee hold, that all and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Christians in the great Cities did, or could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies meete in the same place:</hi>
                  </q>
hee vtterly mistaketh me in so conceiuing (though I am not ignorant they hold very strange things) but this J conceiue you to hold, that each visible Church was, and still ought to bee a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ordinary constant congregation of Christians, which not onely may conueniently, but also must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (if they bee not by sufficient causes hindered) assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together ordinarily to praier, and to the ministery of the word and Sacraments. And I say, that in respect of the number, or rather innumerable company of Christians (which <hi>T. C.</hi> himselfe thinketh to haue been greater in those times then now) in respect of the times wherein they liued, raging with persecution, and in regard of the places, vncapeable of such multitudes, it is vncredible, yea impossible, that all the Christians in the greatest cities and countries about them, should make but one particular congregation, ordinarily and constantly meeting in one place.
Neither doth that further his cause, which hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to be their assertion<q>, that the Christians which dwelt in and about any great Citie, and were called the Church of the Citie, were members of one body:</q>
for not onely they, but also those that dwelt in the remotest parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10663:164"/>
(though distinguished into many particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations) did not hold themselues to bee entire bodies by themselues (vnlesse they were schismatickes or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes) but all members of the same outward body and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, whereof the mother Church in the citie was the chiefe or head, by which they were denominated, and also distinguished (as now they are) from other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

And first for the number: hee would examine my proofes: but <q>
                     <hi>what should hee speake of proofes, when all I say is but vpon imagination?</hi>
                  </q>
Verily, for ought I see, my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are better reasons then your strongest proofes. And that here appeareth where you weaken my imagination, J will not say falsifie it, by propounding it after your maner. But could a man professing sincerity, so cast off all shame, as to affirm that all I say, is but vpon imagination, when of that which I say there are foure proofes set downe in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? first, by comparison of the lesse to the greater: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an instance of Rome: thirdly, the testimony of <hi>Cornelius:</hi> fourthly, the testimony of <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
The first he propun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thus:<q> If the multitude of Christians at Ierusalem within a few weekes after Christ was very great, then was it great in such cities. But the former is true: Therefore the latter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is your fashion to make my consequences not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the proportion of your owne imagined ability in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering them. My reason standeth thus:
<q>
                     <p>If the multitude of Christians at Ierusalem was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great within a few weekes after the ascension of Christ; then in all likelihood the number of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in greater cities hauing the like (though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies so great) meanes, was within two hundred yeeres increased so much, as to exceed the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one particular assembly, ordinarily meeting in one place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:10663:164"/>But the former is true:<note place="margin">Act. 2.41. Act 4 4. Act. 6.1.7.</note> (for at the Feast of Pentecost 3000. were conuerted in one day, and shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their number was growne to 5000. which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards daily and mightily increased) therefore the latter.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In my argument (as you see) comparison is made not onely betweene Ierusalem and other greater Cities, but chiefly (which was omitted by the Refuter) betweene the short time of a few weekes, and the continuance of 200. yeeres. Jf at Ierusalem, within a few weekes, the Christians were become many thousands; how may wee thinke they were increased before the end of 200. yeeres, in Rome, Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria, Ephesus, Antioch, and such like Cities?
So that I doubt not, but the consequence is strong enough (contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an argument from the lesse to the greater) though I prooue none of those foure things which hee would haue prooued: as first,<q> 
                     <hi>that all which were conuerted in Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem at that time, remained members of that Church.</hi>
                  </q>Which maketh not against the consequence, but rather for it, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those which remained not in Ierusalem, were by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution dispersed to other Cities, to helpe forward the plough of Christ there. Secondly,
<q>
                     <hi>that all the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had the like meanes to that of Ierusalem:</hi>
                  </q>
which nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to be proued, seeing the meanes which had beene vsed, and the miracles which had beene wrought at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, were also effectuall in other places, and are at this day, besides the like meanes of their owne.
Thirdlie, <q>
                     <hi>though the meanes were alike, that yet the effects were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable:</hi>
                  </q>which also needeth not to be prooued, seeing wee know by the report of the best Writers, how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and miraculously the Church was multiplied in the greatest Cities within that time. Fourthly, <q> 
                     <hi>that there was neuer any apostasie in any of those Churches with which Paul</hi> (in his conceit) <hi>doth seeme to charge them of Asia,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</q>
Which exception also is friuolous,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.15.</note> seeing not only the Churches of the greatest Cities, Rome, Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria and Antioch, but euen these seuen of Asia, were famous in those times for the profession of the faith. Thus
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10663:165"/>
you see, how he seeketh all the corners of his wit, to finde, if it were possible, some starting hole, whereby to escape the force of this consequence. But these points are not worth the standing on.</p>

But what kinde of desertion <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, whereinto those of Asia did fall, it appeareth by the contrary practise of <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> whom he commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the same place, who often refreshed <hi>Paul,</hi> and was not ashamed of his chaine: but when he was at Rome, hee was so farre from shrinking from <hi>Paul,</hi> that hee most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently sought him out and found him.

               </p>
               <p>As for the assumption,<note place="margin">§. 6. Of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 64.</note> viz. <q>
                     <hi>that the multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians at Ierusalem within a few weekes was great, it maketh nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>for him, or against vs.</hi>
                  </q>
Which is a strange speech, seeing it is one of the premisses whereupon the conclusion is inferred, and which being granted, their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion cannot be true.
But heere againe hee telleth vs of<q> the great parishes about London, <hi>saying,</hi> that they of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem did all meet together as well as they.</q>
Which is spoken against reason, and against sense: for first, it was not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should meet, as those of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> which be of one parish, after their multitude was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Secondly, neither might they (being vnder persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) meet in great multitudes, as those of <hi>London,</hi> which through Gods goodnes enioy peace and liberty. Thirdly, neither had they such places of meeting for great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes. But where I said, it was not intended, when their multitude should bee great, that they of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should assemble together, as they who are of one parish about <hi>London</hi>; that needeth some explanation. The parishes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London,</hi> and euery where from the beginning, are each of them one among many, seuered from the rest, with purpose that all within that precinct should make an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie set congregation, hauing one Presbyter, and not a presbyterie, much lesse a Bishop assigned to them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrariwise, the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whereunto <hi>Iames</hi> was appointed Bishop, assisted with a presbyterie of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, was neuer intended to be one parish among many, but to bee a mother Church, which should by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing beget others to bee seuered from it in particular as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and yet to remaine subordinate and subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as children to the mother. It was neuer meant, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> nor in any other Citie, that the Bishop
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10663:166"/>
and his presbyterie should bee set ouer no more but one particular congregation; or that as more congregations should bee constituted, euerie one should haue a Bishop and a presbyterie. But they were prouided for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that either then were in the Citie and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or after should bee; which as it increased, was to be diuided into seuerall Congregations, whereunto Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters seuerally were to bee assigned; all being members of one bodie, subiected to the Bishop and Presbyterie of the mother Church, which was (as it were) the head of that bodie.</p>

                     <p>If the Christians in Ierusalem were not so many but that still they continued one parishionall assemblis, meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place; then the Christians of other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might be, and did so in like sort.</p>
                     <p>But the antecedents is crue: therefore the consequent.</p>

                     <hi>Of the consequence</hi> (hee saith) <hi>no reasonableman can make any doubt</hi>: and so taketh it for granted, wanting reason to prooue it.</q>Me thinkes there is great reason, why I should not onely doubt of it, but plainely denie it: for when he saith,
<q>

There bee three reasons to be giuen, why the Church at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should not bee at the end of one hundred or two hundred yeeres, so great as in other Cities. First, the persecution begunne with the martyrdome of <hi>Steuen,</hi> and continued vntill the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: vpon the beginning of which persecution,<note place="margin">Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.1. Rom. 9.10.11.</note> all the faithfull in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (except the Apostles) were dispersed into other parts. Secondly,

                  </gap>he reiection of the Iewes, (for the generality of them) when the Gentiles were to be called. 3. The destruction of Ierusalem by <hi>Titus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">After which time the BB of Ierusalem were of the Gentiles, who till then had beene of the circumcision.</note> about the yeare 72. and finall extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewes out of Ierusalem by <hi>Aelius Hadrianus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare 137. who called it <hi>Aelia</hi> after his owne name, prohibiting any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew to come any more within that City. So that if it were true, that the number of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in Ierusalem within the first 200. yeares had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer exceeded the proportion of a parishional assembly: yet hereof it would not follow, that the number of Christians in other Cities, should for 200. yeares continue so smal. No reasonable man therefore would looke to haue that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence granted him.</p>
               <p>The Assumption also is false.<note place="margin">§ 8.

                  </gap>y should be vnder the Bishop of Jerusalem, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued vntill the destruction thereof. Afterwardes, because that City being destroied, <hi>Caesarea</hi> was made by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans the Metropolis of Iewry; it came to passe (the church following the common-wealth) that the Bishop of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarea was the Metropolitan. The Bishop of Ierusalem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Bishopricke of the City, &amp; the places adioining.

               <p>Nether is it probable, that the Church at Ierusalem after they once came to the number of 5000 (as quickly it did, &amp; continued with great increase vntil the death of <hi>Steue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>) did ordinarily meete all in one place. We reade of some Panegyricall meetings, as it were, in <hi>Salomons</hi> porch, and in the temple, such as be the meetings at Paules Crosse, or at the Spittle; but their ordinarie, &amp; as it were parishionall meetings, were by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies in more priuate places. Nay, I say further, that the meetings either of the 12. Apostles,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10663:167"/>
(who neuer were intended to be members, either all, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, of one parish) with the Disciples, Act. 6.1. or of some of them with the Presbyters, and whole as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, Act. 15.22.26.

               <p>As for those other places in the Acts: some of them are ignorantly, some absurdly alleadged. In the 2. of the Acts he quoteth three places, viz. the two first verses, 6. &amp; 44. In the first, it is said, that when the day of Pentecost was come, they were all with one accord in the same place. <hi>All,</hi> that is, all the Apostles, whose mutuall society, and conuersing together is noted. So doe some old Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrpts reade, saith <hi>Beza, <gap reason="foreign">

Or if by all, were ment the 120. Disciples assembled before the descending of the holy Ghost; how doth it proue, either that they were a parishionall assembly, wherein the 12. Patriarches of Christendome were met; or that they continued for an 100. or 200. yeares, so small a company as a parishionall assembly; seeing within a few dayes, yea the very same day, they grew to bee many thousands?</p>
               <p>In the 6. verse it is said, that when this voice or rumor was spread in the streetes concerning the Apostles, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with variety of tongues, great multitudes of people flocked together, not of Christians (to make a parishionall assembly,) but of all sorts to behold this wonder: whereat when some had wondred, and some had scoffed, by <hi>Peters</hi> sermon, 3000. of them were conuerted.</p>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:10663:167"/>In the 44. verse, <hi>Luke</hi> saith, that all they which belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, were <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, doth either signifie they conuersed together in one place, and kept company one with another, and so speaketh not of their assemblies, for vers. 46. hee speaketh of their meeting in the temple, (where they could not meet alone,) wherein nationall, rather then parishionall meetings vsed to bee assembled: or else it signifieth they were in one, that is, they were ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together in heart and affection, as it is said Act. 4.32. which sense <hi>Caluin</hi> preferreth. There remaineth Act. 21.22. where the Presbyters of Ierusalem, who were with <hi>Iames</hi> their Bishop, when <hi>Paul</hi> came to him, tell <hi>Paul</hi> that it cannot be auoided, but the multitude would come together, hearing that he was come.

For the 2. of the Acts speaketh of that which was done within a fortnight after Christs Ascension. The 6. before the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome of <hi>Steuen</hi>: the 15. aboue 20. yeares, the 21. about 15. years before the destruction of Ierusalem, that is, almost 150. yeares before the period of that time whereof we speake. And yet in Act. 21. there is mention of I know not how many ten thousands of belieuing Iewes; ver. 20. You see, say they to <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <p>To this instance his answere is twofold. First, <q>
                     <hi>that it is but a tale of no credite, nor truth</hi>
                  </q>. Of no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite; because, both the author deserueth no credite, and the matter reported by him, is vnlikely and vntrue. The Author, either because wrongfully hee beareth the name of <hi>Damasus</hi>; or if it be <hi>Damasus</hi> himselfe, hee is not to be credited in reporting a matter done 300. yeares before his time.
So that wee are resolued to deny it, let the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor bee who hee will. Yea, but the<q>

Doth hee in this particular disagree from approued histories? Or is there any reason, why he should be suspected of forgery in this particular? In all writings of the Romanists, which are suspected of forgery, there is something contained which seemeth to bee coined, or foisted in for an aduantage. Now I would gladly know, to what end they should faine this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? serueth it to magnifie the Papall supremacy, or to maintaine any of their corruptions, or to contradict their opposites in any thing which they held in former times? Nothing lesse. For to begin with the last; It could not bee counterfeited with purpose to contradict any body; for, that one and the same Church, was and ought to be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Parishes, and that Presbyters were and ought to be seuerally appointed to them, neuer any man that J haue read or heard of, denied before <hi>T.

Likewise, that which is reported, was a godly and necessary act, which had been practised long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this in Alexandria (though I knew not so much when I made the Sermon, but you shall heare of it in due place) which also was practised vpon the like occasion in all the Churches of the world: that is to say, when the number of Christians was so increased, that they could not all conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently meet in one place; they were by their B. diuided into diuers assemblies. Was not this done in all Churches what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer yea ought it not to haue bene done? In Rome it was done, long before the time of Damasus (for before his time there were aboue 40. parish Churches built in <hi>Rome</hi>) and no doubt but it had a beginning, and a beginner; which, if it were not <hi>Euaristus,</hi> let it be shewed who it was. It was done, as J will straight waies note, before <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, who flourished about the year 180.

the iniquity of the time) if they did meete in greater nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers.</p>
               <p>As touching the matter, he saith. <q>1. <hi>it is vnlikely that the Presbyters attended the flocke promiscuously,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>and the people met in diuers places vncertainely:</hi>
                  </q> and yet that which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth against as the matter, is not so much as material.
The question is, whether <hi>Euaristus</hi> diuided the Church of Rome into diuers seuerall congregations, and assigned seuerall Presbyters to them, as Damasus reporteth. But whether the Presbyters before attended them promiscuously, or the people mette vncertainly, that is not the question. But seing hee is pleased to except against those words which are not in Damasus, but Onuphrius &amp; my selfe added as a reason of <hi>Euaristus</hi> his act; let him also be pleased to answer me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole Christian people of Rome in the city, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs &amp; country adioyning, did vsually &amp; ordinarily meete together in one assembly throghout the whole term of 200. years; or in diuers assemblies, as they could most conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If they alwaies or most vsually met together; then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alwaies in one certain place, or in diuers vncertainly &amp; occasionally. The former himselfe denieth. If the latter, then the Presbyters had not charge of them seuerally, but of them al promiscuously: then also the people met vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If they did not ordinarily meet all together, but in diuers assemblies (which is the truth) then, whether were the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meetings set and certain, and seueral Presbyters appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them: or were the meetings and Presbyters for the instructing of those assemblies, appointed vncertainely, as occasion and opportunity serued. If the latter, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue beene the vse before <hi>Euaristus</hi> his time: then that is true, which hee excepteth against. If the former, which was brought to passe by <hi>Euaristus,</hi> then the maine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion which he oppugneth, is true.</p>

                  </note>Now these reports are easily reconciled, with the afore ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted testimony of Damasus.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try parishes.
Which distinction, if it wil salue their credits, who haue said that <hi>Dionysius</hi> first diuided parishes, I wil not be against it. His 2. answere is, <q>
                     <hi>that if Euaristus did any such thing, he diuided the titles to only gouerning elders</hi> &amp;c.</q>
A likely matter.

               <p>But, saith the Refuter<q>, Let them bee as little as he would make them, yet it doth not follow hereof, that the Churches in the Cities alone, contained many particular congregations or parishes.<note place="margin">

To which purpose againe, he alleageth his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of ease for a meere euasion, seeing himselfe is perswaded there was none such in those times.
And where he saith, that<q> 
                     <hi>although there were diuers places of meeting in those times, yet all appertained to one congregation</hi>
                  </q>; I confesse it to be true: for euen after the distinction of parishes both in citie and country, all of them belonged to one Church, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the same body.
Yea but, saith he, <hi>if there were many particular congregations in euery city, how chanceth it, he told vs before, that the parishes were not distinguished?</hi> Distinguish the times, and the answere is easie. In the first hundred yeeres, though Christians met in diuers places, as they could; yet neither, were there in the most cities certaine set places

of meeting, nor certaine Presbyters assigned to them, as to their perpetuall and peculiar charge.

                  </q>

                  </gap> this whole terme at the least, the churches were each of them but a parish, and that in all this time there were no dioceses.</p>
               <p>His argumentation containeth two ranckes of instances: the former taken out of the scriptures; the latter out of the Fathers. The former he concludeth thus:

                     <p>But the Churches of Corinth, Ephesus and Antioch, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing visible Churches endued with power of ecclesiasticall gouernment) were each of them but one parish (<hi>for the first 200. yeeres.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:10663:172"/>
Therefore the other visible Churches endued with the like power, were also (<hi>for the like terme</hi>) each of them but one parish.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition I will be content to yeeld to my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, so it may be lawfull for me to vse the like: for then I would conclude thus:
<q>
                     <p>If the Churches of Alexandria and Rome were not parishionall Churches in the first 200. yeeres, neither were the Churches of other Cities.</p>
                     <p>But the antecedent is true: therefore the consequent.</p>
                  </q>
The consequence is the same with his, and grounded on the same hypothesis: viz. <hi>that all Churches endued with power of ecclesiasticall gouernment, were at the first of the same nature and constitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former part of the assumption, concerning Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, I will manifestly prooue when I come to the third point, concerning Diocesans: viz. that it was not one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but contained diuers parishes, euen in the first 100. yeeres. Concerning Rome, I haue proued already, that within the first 200. yeeres it was diuided into many parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: and therefore although there bee not so good eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for other Cities in particular, yet the like is to bee concluded of them, seeing they were all of the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
               <p>Passing by therefore his proposition, I take hold of his assumption, and doe plainely denie, the Churches he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, or any other, which had a Bishop and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to haue beene for the first two hundred yeeres, no more but parishes: for J doubt not, but it is easier to proue that within this terme, not onely the Presbyters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the said dioceses, but also the Bishops in the same Prouinces, were subiect to the Bishops of these three Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For as it is euident of Antioch, by the testimonie of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who calleth himselfe the Bishop of Syria; so no reason can bee alleged why the Bishops of Ephesus and Corinth, who in the third centurie, and in the ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, were Metropolitans, were not so in the second; or if they were Metropolitans in the third, and in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10663:173"/>
following, (as most certainely they were) why they should not haue beene Diocesans at the least in the second.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The assumption (<hi>hee saith</hi>) appeareth plaine by the proofe of the particulars.<note place="margin">§ 2. Whether the Churches of Corinth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus, and Antioch were each of them but a parish.</note>
                  </q>
But what doth he prooue of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars? Are his syllogismes so soone come to an end? His chiefe proofes be, that in the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> time each of them vsed to assemble in one Congregation. Was this your assumption? You that are so strict in exacting syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes and direct proofes, should not haue sought to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie away the matter, as it were, in the cloudes. Yea but that which he prooueth, doth prooue the assumption. That shall thus bee tried by his owne forme of argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
<q>
                     <p>If those Churches of Corinth, Ephesus, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, in the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> time, were each of them no more then ordinarily assembled in one place, then were they for the first 200. yeeres each of them but one parish.</p>
                     <p>But the Churches of Corinth, Ephesus, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, in the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> time, were each of them no more then ordinarily assembled in one place. Therefore for the first 200. yeeres they were each of them but one parish.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition is omitted by the disputer, as taken for granted: but therein he hath plaied the sophister; for he that meaneth truly, doth not vse to omit any part of his argument, but that which is certaine, or confessed. But the consequence of this proposition is worse then naught: for if hee had onely said thus, <hi>If in the Apostles times they were each of them but one Congregation, therefore for</hi> 200. <hi>yeeres they were so</hi>; the consequence had beene starke naught: or if he had onely said, <hi>If in the Apostles time they were each but one Congregation, then were they each one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi>; that consequence also had beene naught: but when he saith, <hi>If in the Apostles times each was but one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore for</hi> 200. <hi>yeeres each of them was but a parish</hi>; that consequence is, as I said, worse then naught.</p>
               <p>That the first of the two consequences is naught, it is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10663:173"/>
euident: for though at the first conuersion of any great City, and for a while after, the number vsually was so small, that they might haue assembled in one place; yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that within 200. yeeres, their number was growne to bee almost innumerable, as hath beene shewed, and therefore too great to make one ordinarie congregation. This one exception (if no more should bee added) ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth all his dispute.</p>
               <p>As touching the second: though it should bee granted, that each of these Churches in the Apostles time, did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarilie assemble together in one place; yet would it not follow, that therefore each of them was but a parish; and much lesse (which is the end of all this disputation) that all Churches endued with ecclesiasticall power should be but parishes; and consequently, that euery parish should haue a Bishop and presbyterie. The reasons of my deniall of these consequences I haue before set downe at large, Chap. 3. § 5. and 6. and therefore this disputation I haue sufficiently ouerthrowne already. For a surplussage I adde these two reasons:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>If these Churches, because they were each of them but one Congregation, were parishes before the diuision of parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; then were they such Churches, as after the diuision, parishes were.</hi> This consequence may not be denied, especially by them who would haue all parishes framed to the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the first Churches. <hi>But they were not such:</hi> for the parishes, after their diuision, had not a Bishop and presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, but only a Presbyter assigned to them: neither was the Pastor thereof superintendent ouer others, neither was any of them intended to bee a mother Church. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if that assumption was false which denied parishes to haue beene distinguished in the Apostles times, then these Churches were not onely many congregations, but many parishes also.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 60.</note> But he said before, that that assumption had no truth in it. These two iust exceptions I haue against his consequence. If against the former it bee obiected, that some of his testimonies doe seeme to prooue, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apostles times these Churches were each of them
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10663:174"/>
but one congregation: I answer, that his maine argument and proofes thereof, doe speake of the Apostles time. Those which are extended further, shall bee further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§ 3. Whether the Churches of Corinth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus, and Antioch, were each but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.

               <p>The reasons why the first Translaters of the Bible into English in these latter times did auoid the name <hi>Church,</hi> and insteed thereof vsed <hi>Congregation,</hi> doe seeme to haue been these two.

                  </gap>, doth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly signifie the place of meeting, then the congregation it selfe, which is meant by <hi>ecclesia:</hi> and therefore the word Congregation thought to be the fitter translation. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, because the Papists had abused the word <hi>Church,</hi> whether it were generally vsed, to signifie the Romish Church; or particularly, to import the Romish clergy.

                  <note place="margin">Tindal. pag. 250.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore I translated the word Ecclesia, by this word Congregation.</hi> For when the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that by <hi>Church</hi> was meant the company of men professing the faith of Christ, the name <hi>Church</hi> is euery where vsed, as the translation of <hi>ecclesia.</hi>

Which allegation sheweth extreame want, either of iudgement, or honesty: for what church or congregation is there mentioned? the Church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, or the vniuersall Church of Christ? when it is said, as <hi>Christ is the head of the Church</hi>? Vpon which words, when

                  <hi>that the Translator rather vsed the word</hi> Congregation <hi>then</hi> Church, <hi>to auoide ambiguity, because this word</hi> Church <hi>is commonly taken for the house of the assembly of Christians: and that the people might know, that the</hi> Church <hi>is a gathering together of al the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers into one body, which in the name of church doth not appeare.

or at the least intended by the Apostles, appeareth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: That euer since their times, in all prouinces, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Christian world, there haue been Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, neuer misliked or contradicted by any, vntil this our age.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Refuter obiecteth,<note place="margin">§ 8. Metropolitan Churches are proofs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of Diocesan.</note> that this maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Diocesan Bishops, I say it maketh for them. For euery Metropolitan is also a diocesan Bishop: hauing a peculiar diocesse of his owne, whereof he is Bishop; as the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Canterbury, hath Canterbury, and part of Kent, besides some other peculiar Churches; the Archbishop of Yorke, hath Yorkeshire (excepting the County of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, which belongeth to the Bishop of Chester) and the County of Nottingham.</p>
               <p>To his question therefore demanding, <q>
                     <hi>where then are our Diocesan Churches become?</hi>
                  </q>
I answere, there remaine 24 of them, where they were wont to be, for any thing that he can say to the contrary, besides the Churches of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury and Yorke; which, as they be prouinciall Churches in respect of the 2. prouinces; so are they Diocesan in respect of the peculiar dioceses belonging vnto them. And where he saith, <q>
                     <hi>the Cathedrall Churches are as it were parishes</hi>
                  </q>, he saith he knowes not what. For Cathedral Churches, which are the mother Churches of euery diocesse, neither are, nor euer were parishes; nor the Bishop, nor Presbyteries of them, euer intended to one parish. And if it so fall out, that to some part of the Cathedrall Church a particular parish belong; therto a seuerall Presbyter is appointed as to other Parishes. The meetings in Cathedral Churches whereof the Bishops haue beene presidents, were neuer <hi>Parishionall,</hi> but rather <hi>Panegyricall,</hi> euen in the most ancient and purest Churches, vnder the best and most renowned Bishops since the Apostles times.</p>
               <p>In the conclusion the Refuter pusheth at me with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma, as it were with a paire of rams hornes. For such is his wisdome, that he thinketh diocesan &amp; prouinciall Churches (which are subordinate one to the other) to be so opposite, as that to hold the one, is to deny the other.

                     <hi>Ad page</hi> 70.</note> because he seemeth to confesse that if I can demonstrate that the ancient Churches, were dioceses, that then the other points will follow of their owne accord. But, that I haue so demonstrated, that I neuer expect any sound answere thereto. As for this point which now I haue in hand, it is not onely demonstrated already, in the proof of the former, but is also by necessary consequence deduced therefrom. My purpose therefore is to bee as briefe in propugning this truth, as hee is in oppugning the same.</p>
               <p>J will therefore omit his friuolous cauill, which now the fourth time he repeateth for my not concluding, what he, according to his forced Analysis, would haue concluded: because the Reader cannot but discerne, that I directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what before was propounded, viz. that the Angels or Pastors of the primitiue Church were diocesan Bishoppes, which I proue in the Sermon by degrees: first seuerally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diuision of parishes, and after the distribution of them, both in the city and in the country: then iointly, both before and after. For hauing concluded the former point with these words, <hi>that the Churches contained many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregations, vnto all which there was but one Presbytery, or Colledge of Presbyters assigned</hi>: and hauing here signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that by the confession of the most learned Disciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, each Presbytery had a President, which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth the <hi>Angell of the Church,</hi> and the Fathers, <hi>a Bishop</hi>; I proue from that which hath already been proued, that the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Presbytery, the Angell, of the B. of the Church, was not a parishionall, but a diocesan Bishop.</p>
               <p>But before I come to the proofe contained in this secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I am to note, how those last words of the former part, which are very materiall, are by this refuter passed ouer in silence. For it would be knowne, whether there were in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (where were many congregations) yea in whole dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses, any more Presbyteries or Colledges of Presbyters, then that one belonging to the mother Church in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If to shew either his ignorance, or want of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he shall say there were (as indeed that is their asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10663:182"/>
that in euery parish both in citie and country, there ought to bee a Presbytery or senate of ruling Elders) let him giue but one approued instance to proue his assertion in the first foure hundred yeeres, and I will yeeld, that where was a parish Presbytery, there was a parish Bishop. If <hi>Calum</hi> and the reformers of other Churches, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended discipline, had been of that iudgement, they would not haue appointed one onely Presbytery for many pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes. If he shall confesse that in a whole circuit, which wee call a diocesse, there was but one colledge or senate of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, consisting of those who were called the Presbyters of the citie, (which is a most certaine and vndeniable truth) then must he confesse his platforme of parish discipline to be a meere nouelty, and an vndisgested fancy, hauing no warrant of scriptures, nor testimony of antiquity; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wise, that there was but one Presbytery, and one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop set ouer a whole diocesse. Hee that catcheth at euery word, yea at the least letter whereat hee hopeth to haue the least aduantage, (as at the terme <hi>pagani</hi> in this passage, and at the little letters, in the word Cretians) would not swallow vp in silence such pregnant arguments, if silence were not his best answere.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§. 2. This third point dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the second.</note>But though he would not see that argument, yet in my propounding of the question here to bee concluded, hee hath spied a syllogisme, which I did not intend, out of that which I propounded in axiomaticall disposition, as taking it for granted. But the Refuter maketh me reason thus:
<q>
                     <p>The presidents of the Presbyteries were diocesan BB. The Angels of the seauen Churches were presidents of the Presbyteries.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Angels of the seauen Churches were diocesan BB.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Which is the hansomest syllogisme he hath bestowed on me as yet, neither wil I refuse to maintaine any one part of it, if he will be pleased to take notice of that, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen now was proued; that there was but one Presbytery for a whole diocesse. So the proposition will be manifest, that the presidents of Presbyteries (which were prouided for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10663:182"/>
whole dioceses) whom the fathers call BB. were diocesan BB. for so much might haue been added to the proposition out of my words.</p>
               <p>The assumption I haue made good before by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of <hi>Caluin and Beza.</hi>
But he beginneth with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, saying that<q> he hath good cause to doubt of it, and that I doe but threapen kindnesse on them when I talke of their Confessions.</q>
For plentifull proofe whereof I referre you to that which before hath been alledged out of <hi>Caluin and Beza.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. §. 16.</note> But what will not this Refuter quarrell with? for if the Churches had been such as he conceipteth, that is to say parishes, hauing euery one a Bishop and a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of gouerning Elders; would any man doubt, either that the Bishop was called the Angell of the Church, or that he was president of the Presbytery?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now to the proposition <hi>(saith the Refuter)</hi> for answere whereto in one word,<note place="margin">Ad pag. <hi>71.</hi>
                     </note> I say it is false: let vs examine the proofe of it, <hi>and then frameth a syllogisme, the conclusion whereof is this;</hi> therefore the Bishop who was set ouer a whole diocesse, and who was President of the Presbytery, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to a whole diocesse, was vndoubtedly a diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</q>
Was this the proposition which he denied? or was he so vnreasonable to deny it? What can be more euident? But hee seeth by this time what a goodly analysis he hath here made.</p>
               <p>To returne therefore to mine owne analysis. In this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I proue, that the antient Bishops were diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, euen before the diuision of parishes, by three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which for breuity sake I ioined together.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The first. If the Churches whereof they were BB. were dioceses, and not parishes, then were they diocesan BB. But the Antecedent is true, as hath already been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the second point.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the consequent.</p>
                  <p>The second: If the parishes were not distinguished in the Apostles time, nor ministers appointed to peculiar ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles or seuerall cures, then there could be no Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Bishops in that time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:10663:183"/>But the former hath already been proued; Therefore the latter is true.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The assumption is to be vnderstood, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as I said before, that is, as true for the most part. For it admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth some exceptions, as namely the Church of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, (and perhaps some others) wherein I acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the parishes to haue been distinguished in the Apostles times; but so, as seuerall Presbyters being assigned to them, there remained one Bishop ouer all.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The third. If the Presbyteries were allotted to whole dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses, and not to seuerall parishes, then the Bishops who were Presidents of those Presbyteries, were not parishionall, but diocesan.</p>
                  <p>But the first is true, as hath been already prooued: Therefore the second.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To all three, he answereth by denying the assumption: the truth whereof dependeth vpon the proofes of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, which haue been so many, and so manifest, as I hope to heare no more of the new-found parish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The analysis of this secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</note>Here I prooue, that after the diuision of parishes, the Bishops were diocesan: albeit in this section is contained but part of my argument, which standeth thus:
<q>
                     <p>Those Bishops who were ouer all the parishes both in the citie and country, were diocesan, and not parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Bishops.</p>
                     <p>The antient Bishops in the first two hundred yeeres, were ouer all the parishes both in the citie and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, viz. after they were distinguished:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:10663:183"/>Therefore the antient Bishops in the first two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres were diocesan, and not parishionall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition is most euident. The assumption stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on two parts: first, that the Bishops were ouer all the parishes in the citie, after they were diuided. The second, that the Bishops were ouer all the parishes in the country, after their diuision. The former I proue in this section by induction of particulars: the latter in the next.</p>
               <p>The Analysis being here mistaken by him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 72. <hi>&amp;</hi> 73.</note> I wil not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with that, which hee hath thereby taken occasion to speake besides the purpose: because heere I finde him more modest, then hitherto he hath shewed himselfe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I shame him with his owne friends, when for an euasion he supposeth, that in the primitiue Church, some Ministers might haue more Churches vnder them, <q>
                     <hi>like our double beneficed men and pluralists, euen those that haue tot quot, and yet be no Bishops.</hi>
                  </q>
Onely I will touch those things, which contradict that which I haue deliuered. And first, he obserueth a contradiction in my speech. I said, <hi>that parishes</hi> (in cities) <hi>were not</hi> (for the most part) <hi>distinguished in the Apostles times.</hi> Here I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay, that in the end of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times, viz. about the yeere one hundred, they began to be distinguished at Rome, by <hi>Euaristus</hi> the Bishop there. A shrewd contradiction J promise you, especially if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that all the Apostles, but S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> were dead before this time, and that this was in the very end of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time.
<q>Yea but after I say,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.12.</note> 
                     <hi>that Titus was Bishop of the Cretians,</hi> (I cry you mercy, I should haue said <hi>Cretans,</hi> and yet by his leaue, the Geneua translation and others, read Cretians) <hi>and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy of them in Asia, therefore parishes were distinguished in the Apostles times.</hi>
                  </q>
Neither is this a contradiction: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Timothy</hi> was Bishop of Asia, and <hi>Titus</hi> of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Creet; yet it followeth not, that the parishes in the Churches of Asia or Creet, were distinguished. They were both by <hi>Pauls</hi> direction, as well by letter as example, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Presbyters in the seuerall cities; but that they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced any in the country, or assigned the Presbyters to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:10663:184"/>
cures in the Cities, wee reade not.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had the charge of all the parishes in the city after they were diuided or set out.</note>To returne therefore to my proofes: The induction stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thus:
<q>
                     <p>In Rome, and Alexandria, and so in other cities, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes being once diuided, were assigned to seuerall Presbyters, the Bishop remaining superintendent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them all:</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Bishops were ouer all the parishes in the cities, after they were once diuided.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As touching Rome, I shew that the parishes were first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by <hi>Euaristus,</hi> about the 100. yeare; and not a Presbytery, but seuerall Presbyters assigned to them, as hath beene prooued heeretofore. At Alexandria I proue, that the Bishop had the charge of many Churches, within the first 200. yeares.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>But what I say</hi> concerning Alexandria,<note place="margin">Ad page <hi>74.</hi>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10663:185"/>
very vncharitable and vnlearned part, that I say no worse, to imagine that <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> would, of their owne heads, testifie these things, and not by the relation of those which liued in former ages: especially, seeing <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, it is recorded in histories.

In the meane time, let it bee acknowledged, as a point of intollerable impudency, that in a matter of fact, so agreeable with the scriptures (I meane especially the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> written to them, as to Bishops) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs should deny credit to the constant, generall and perpetuall consent of the ancient writers, whereof some li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued 13 or 1400 yeares before vs.</p>

Good sir, sauing your wisedome, you shall seldome reade in ancient records of enlarging of dioceses: but of the contracting of them, by erecting new Bishopricks, very oft. It was testified before, <note n="h" place="margin">

               <p>In this section I proue the latter part of the former as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, concerning country parishes. viz. that the Bishop of the citie was ouer them also: which I proue by this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymeme:
<q>The B. and the Presbytery of the City in all places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>em to belong to their charge: Therefore the Bishop was ouer them, as being part of his Diocesse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The antecedent I proue by their care ouer them, both before they were conuerted, and after. Before, because they labored their conuersion; after, because the Bishop out of his Presbytery assigned to each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Presbyter, not a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, or a B. 2. Where the diocesse was large, he substituted a Chorepiscopus, or country B.
Of these points, the last, our refuter wery conscionably concealeth: all the former, very learnedly he denieth. He denieth, I say:<q> 1. <hi>That the Bishop and Presbytery of the city acknowledged the country to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10663:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
long to their charge.</hi>
                  </q>
Which, as it is a most ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, as hath beene proued before: so would it haue beene most precious to the church of God, if the BB. and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of those times, had so conceiued.
Now that both they and the country churches so conceiued, as J said, the vniuersall &amp; perpetuall practise of the church of Christ, subiecting in al places the country parishes to the Bishop of the city, doth ineuitably proue. <q>2. <hi>That they did not labour their conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by vertue of their office, but were to attend those who were conuerted.</hi>
                  </q>
As if the Bishop, and presbytery had beene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained onely for those fewe, that were at the first conuerted; and were not rather, as leauen put into the meale, to season the whole lump. I would gladly know therefore, who after the death of the Apostles and apostolicall men (which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in the cities) were appointed or prouided for the conuersion of the country towns? If it were not the office of the Bishop and Presbytery of the city, to which they were subiect; much lesse was it the office of others, who being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostles, nor Euangelists, were tied to their own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; might not by the most ancient canons of the church, exercise any mysteriall function out of their owne bounds. Besides the bounds of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction followed the ciuill ordinarily; so that those countries were subiect to the Bishop of the City in respect of ecclesiasticall iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which were subiect to the city it self. And therfore as they were actually vnder the Bishops charge, after their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; so were they intentionally, before. This is a point clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confessed by <hi>Caluin,</hi> as you shall heare. So is the third, though this learned man deny it; viz, <hi>that Presbyters were by the Bishops of the city assigned to country parishes out of the clergy of the city.</hi> For the clergy of the city was the seminary of the ministery for the whole diocesse. Neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ordinary meanes to supply the Churches which wanted. Schollers of their own, fitte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be ministers, country parishes had not: vniuersities there were none: learned men from other dioceses were not to be expected, vnlesse the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the city were not able out of his clergy to furnish them. But hereof I haue spoken before:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:10663:186"/>As touching the last, that where the diocesse was large, the Bishop in certaine places appointed <hi>Chorepiscopos,</hi> as his substitutes, who together with their charge remained subiect to the Bishop of the city (which is a thing most notorious, and confessed by <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> being also a most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofe, that the churches were dioceses, and the Bishops diocesan, as J haue shewed before) our refuter pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it ouer in silence; with what conscience, let the refuter Iudge.</p>
               <p>Passing therefore by this, which in no wise he was able to answer,<note place="margin">§. 7. That the B. of the city assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned seuerall Presbyters to the countrie parishes. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 77.</note> he oppugneth the 3. point, bringing an insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his owne, and taking exception against my proofe. We haue, saith hee, a plaine instance to the contrary in the churches of <hi>Cenchrea</hi> and <hi>Corinth.</hi> A plain instance? to what purpose? that <hi>Cenchrea</hi> had a Bishoppe and a presbytery, and not a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall presbyter assigned to it? that when it wanted a presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was not furnished from the clergy of <hi>Corinth?</hi> It is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>Cenchrea</hi> was a village belonging to <hi>Corinth</hi> and subiect vnto it, as were al other townes and villages in those parts: and as the rest, so it (euen by his <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 57.</note> own confession) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the gospell from Corinth. That it euer had a Bishop it is incredible: for by the lawes of the church, those church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which at the first had Bishops, were to haue them stil. Let him shew, that euer it had a Bishop or a presbytery, or that it was not subiect to the Bishop of Corinth, as well as other towns and villages of Achaia; that ordinarily it receiued not their presbyter from Corinth, from whence, by his owne confession, it receiued the Gospel; and I wil yeeld to him. If none of these things can be necessarily proued; nay if none of them be probable or likely, how could he say that this was <q>
                     <hi>a plaine instance to the contrary</hi>
                  </q>. And yet this is the fourth time that the church of Cenchreae hath been obiected to no purpose, vnlesse it be to confute himselfe.</p>
               <p>Against my allegation of the councell of Sardica, hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth great exception, obiecting two contrary things vnto me: whereof, if either were true, the one would take away the other. The former, <q>
                     <hi>is subtilty and craft, as though I went about to delude my auditors at Lambith, and readers euery
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10663:187"/>
where. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>when was this Councell held? was it not about the yeere</hi> 347. <hi>almost</hi> 150. <hi>yeeres after the time in question?</hi>
                  </q>
If I had alleaged that canon, only to testifie the practise of the Church at that time, not permitting Bishops in country townes and villages, there had been some small colour for this obiection: and yet but a colour, seeing they doe not (as you shall heare) prohibit the ordaining of Bishops in any Church where they had formerly been. And therefore the practise of the Church for multitude of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops now, was as it had been before; sauing that by this canon order was taken for erecting Bishoprickes, where none had been, but not for dissoluing of Bishopricks, where any were. But it was the iudgement and determination of that Councell, which chiefely I alledged; which was, <hi>that one Presbyter is sufficient for a village or towne.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing was in this respect to bee innouated, but as they had hitherto no Bishops or Presbyteries, but Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters seuerally assigned to them, so they should continue. The iudgement of these men (I hope) was not much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to theirs, who liued in the first two hundred yeeres. This being a councel of three hundred orthodoxall Bishops who confirmed the decrees of the councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> among whom was <hi>Osius</hi> the famous confessour,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theod. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 15 <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> and <hi>Athanasius</hi> (then whom there hath not bene a more famous Bishop for piety, wisdome, learning and soundnesse in religion since the Apostles times) whose iudgement also in this particular was approued, as hath bene shewed, by the decrees of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, by the iudgment of other fathers, by the practise of all churches, and neuer gaine said or misliked by any in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, nor yet by the reformers of the church in our age according to the pretended discipline, <hi>T. C.</hi> and perhaps some one or 2. others excepted. Now I would gladly know, what either reasons our refuter hath to confute their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or testimonies to ouerweigh their authority. There was therefore no subtill purpose in mee to delude any in this allegation, but an euill conscience in him that sought with so friuolous an euasion to elude so plaine and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant euidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:10663:187"/>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The other thing which hee obiecteth is simple</hi> follie, in alledging a Canon, <hi>which, as he saith,</hi> maketh so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mee. For, <hi>saith hee,</hi> what greater proofe can there bee, that villages or little cities or townes vsually had BB. ouer them euen till that time, viz. the yeare <hi>347,</hi> then that the councill of Sardica was faine to make such a decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it?</q>
For the vntruth of which obiection, his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance must bee his best excuse. It is plaine, that in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non direction is giuen chiefely for erecting of new Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks; authorizing the Metropolitane and the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of the prouince, if the people of cities and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous places desired a Bishop, to erect a new Bishopricke: but forbidding this to be done in villages or petite cities or townes, for which they iudged the ministery of one Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter to be sufficient. Besides, the councill of <hi>Nice</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that the priuiledges of all churches should bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued; and the councils of Africke more then once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that what Church soeuer had in former times had a Bishop, should still haue a B. and the ancient custome of the church was euer held as a law among them, in this behalfe. So that I hold it for a certaine truth, that what Church in the end of the first 400 yeares had not a Bishop, the same had none in the beginning: and what Church soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had in the first 200. yeares a B. was at the end of 400. yeares acknowledged to haue right to a B.</p>

                     <hi>C.

And if he shall be conuinced to haue done this without the consent of them, who hold those Cities or Countries, let him be deposed, and those also whom he hath ordained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This syllogisme being too strong to be refuted, his best course was not to see it. Notwithstanding he cauilleth with some points therein.
For whereas his chiefe proofe before, was, that the Church of Antioch, of Ephesus, of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, of Alexandria &amp;c. were each of them but one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregation &amp;c. because <hi>Eusebius</hi> calleth each of them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thereby abusing the Reader, as if <hi>Eusebius</hi> had by that name ment that which we cal a parish; here he disauoweth the authority of <hi>Eusebius</hi> alledged according to his true meaning,<q> 
                     <hi>vnlesse he had said it was of that signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the end of the Apostles time, and the age follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </q>
Which is a silly shift: seeing <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaking of the Churches of whole Cities in the first two hundred yeeres, euen of such as he had expressly mentioned as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many Churches, he calleth them by that name. As at Alexandria he acknowledged the Churches to haue beene instituted by Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> and yet he comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10663:191"/>
them all afterwards, yea after the number of them was increased, vnder the name of the <hi>paroecia</hi> in Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, as I haue shewed before. And where besides <hi>Eusebius,</hi> I quote <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and the Councell of Antioch, he saith,
<q>It is to no purpose to cloy the Reader with multitude of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, concerning the decrees or practises of latter ages.</q>
Which also is a very friuolous exception, seeing it is easie to shew, that the dioceses or circuits of Churches were vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lessened: but that they were any wheres inlarged, he will hardly shew. Therefore, looke what the circuits of the Churches or Bishops charges were in <hi>Eusebius</hi> or <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his time, the same, at the least, they were in the first two hundred yeeres.</p>

But let vs heare what he can say against them, for my mind giueth me, he will leaue them in better credit then hee found them.<q> If wee were so simple <hi>saith he,</hi> as to take them for their doing, yet should not a man of his profession so abuse our simplicity: He knoweth there was a time, when Rome her selfe saw too much in them, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them for the Apostles: See Gratians decree dist. <hi>15.</hi> c. sancta Romana, &amp; dist. <hi>16.</hi> cap. canones.</q>
In both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it is said, that they are apohryphall (as we call the bookes of Ecclesiasticus and Wisdome) not because they are either false or counterfet, but because they are not acknowledged to be of the Apostles owne writing: for if they were, they ought to be esteemed of canonicall authority, like the other scriptures. Notwithstanding they are ecclesiasticall canons, which for their great antiquity and authentike authority, are commonly called Apostolicall, receiued of antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and approoued by Councels.

                  </q>, but as one that taketh part with vs, against our new sect of Disciplinarians, especially in the second and third point, (which their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting from <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> and other learned Authors of discipline, he alwaies cunningly dissembleth.) And that his authority may be of more weight, as I confesse him to haue bin a worthy seruant of Christ, whose memory with me is blessed; so I professe him to haue bin the first or chiefe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Presbyterian or Geneuian discipline: in setting vp whereof, the Bishopricke being dissolued, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale reduced to a popular State, I acknowledge him to haue dealt very wisely, his proiect of discipline being the best, that that Citie did seeme at that time capable of, there being no hope, that either a Bishop or a Presbytery consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting wholly of Ministers, would be admitted. But he cannot indure to heare, that <hi>Caluin</hi> should bee esteemed the first founder of this discipline.
For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation whereof, he telleth vs (what we haue heard an hundred times, but neuer shall see proued) that this <q>
                     <hi>discipline was both practised in the Apostles times, and primitiue Church, and hath testimony from many learned men, Ignatius, Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, &amp;c. Wickliffe, the Waldenses, Luther and diuers others hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be named, that liued before Caluin writ</hi>:</q> hee should haue said, that writ before <hi>Caluin</hi> liued, and then not one
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10663:192"/>
word of all this goodly speech had been true; which as I haue manifested already in respect of <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, Luther,</hi> so farre as they haue been allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: so shall I in respect of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and the Waldenses, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuer once dreamed of their lay presbyteries, and much lesse of their new-found parish discipline.</p>
               <p>Neither can he abide that <hi>Caluin</hi> should be said to agree with vs in these three points; but he must abide it, for truth will preuaile. <q>But <hi>that were exceeding strange,</hi> saith hee, <hi>that he should ouerthrow that discipline which he was so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to establish.</hi>
                  </q>
Let him not abuse the Reader; his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with vs in the second and third point, ouerthroweth the new-found parish discipline, but agreeth with the doctrine of the learned Reformers, and with the practise of Geneua, vnderstanding by B. (as they doe) the President of their Presbytery: their Church being a diocesse consisting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parishes, ouer which one Presbytery only is appointed. Of which Presbytery, if the President were perpetuall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>as he was in <hi>Caluins</hi> time, and (as alwaies he was in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, there being not one instance to be giuen to the contrary; which order <hi>Beza</hi> misliketh not, but sometimes wisheth it were restored) then should they come neerer the practise of the Apostolicall Churches, then now they doe. In the meane time, as their Church is a diocesse, and their Presbytery seruing for the whole diocesse; so the President for the time being, is diocesan.
<hi>But whether that be so or not; once,</hi> Caluins <hi>iudgement agreeth with mine in these three points:</hi>

As though we were destitute thereof, and they contrariwise, for their discipline, had the precept and practise of the Apostles. Which well may they take for granted, but neuer will bee able to prooue: and as though the vniuersall and perpetuall practise of all the Churches in Christendome, and consent of all the Fathers in the first three hundred yeeres, were not a sufficient demonstration to perswade a man that hath a sound iudgement, ioined with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10663:193"/>
a good conscience, what was the doctrine and practise of the Apostles. For if any man shall say, that all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Churches, and all the godly Fathers, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyrs, did euer from the Apostles times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue a discipline and gouernement of the Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to that which the Apostles had prescribed; I doubt not to say of such a man, that as hee is void of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, so hath he no great store either of iudgement or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.</p>

And first, concerning the Presbyteries hee saith, as before I allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <hi>euerie Citie had their Colledge of Presbyters, who were Pastors and Teachers, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <hi>The Refuter repeateth the words, which I cited out of</hi> Caluin <hi>thus:</hi> 
                  <q>that the Presbyteries consisted of Ministers. <hi>Thereof giuing this censure:</hi> Craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who denieth that the Presbyteries consisted of ministers? Wil it follow thence that therefore there were no other gouerning-Elders?

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10663:193"/>
no man being so</hi> ignorant <hi>and</hi> shamelesse?</q>
I hope to salue both presentlie. I confesse, good sir, that <hi>Caluin</hi> collecteth two sorts of Elders out of 1. Tim. 5.17. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse also, that speaking in generall of the practise of the Church, he saith coldly and in few words, <hi>the rest of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were set ouer the censure of maners and corrections.</hi> But when he commeth more particularly to relate the practise of the antient Church, he giueth full testimony to the truth. For can any man vnderstand <hi>Caluin,</hi> as saying, they had any other Presbyery, besides the colledge of Presbyters in euery Church? Doth not <hi>Caluin</hi> plainly say, euery citie had their colledge of Presbyters, who were Pastors and Teachers?
<q>Yes that he doth: but the word only was either <hi>craftily, or carelesly</hi> omitted.</q>
Heare then the words of <hi>Caluin: Habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant ergo singulae ciuitates Presbyterorum collegium, qui pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res erant ac Doctores. Nam &amp; apud populu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> munus docendi, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortandi &amp; corrigendi, quod Paulus episcopis iniungit, omnes obibant: &amp; quo semen post se relinquerent, iunioribus, qui sacra militae nomen dederant, crudiendis, nanabant operam: Euery citie therefore had a colledge of Presbyters, who were Pastors and Teachers. For both they exercised all of them the function of teaching, exhorting, and correcting, which Paul enioyneth to Bishoppes, and also that they might leaue a seed behind them, they imploied their labour in teaching the younger sort, who had giuen their names, to serue in the sacred warfare,</hi> that is, the younger sort of the Clergy. Thus therefore J reason:
<q>
                     <p>The Colledge of Presbyters, according to <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins</hi> iudgement, consisted onelie of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;</p>
                     <p>The Presbytery of each Citie was the colledge of the Presbyters:</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Presbyterie of each City, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement, consisted onely of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The assumption is euident: The proposition himselfe proueth, when hee saith <hi>omnes, all of them exercised the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10663:194"/>

Who therefore (to vse his owne words) could be either so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as not to see, or so shamelesse as not to acknowledge, that the Churches in <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement were dioceses?
How doth he auoid this? Forsooth <q>
                     <hi>Caluin doth not name dioceses.</hi>
                  </q>But doth he not meane dioceses, when he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Churches containing each of them a citie and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try adioyning? Yea but he
<q>
                     <hi>doth not tie the power of ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall gouernment to the Bishops Church.</hi>
                  </q>
No doth? he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth no Presbytery but in the cities, of which the Bishops were Presidents. As for country parishes, they had not Presbyteries, but seuerall Presbyters: and those they had, as <hi>Caluin</hi> saith, from the Presbytery of the citie. Besides, when he maketh the citie and country to be but one body, it cannot be doubted, but that he meant the Church in the citie was the head of this body, and the rest of the parts sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto it. Whereto you may adde that which after he saith of <hi>chorepiscopi</hi> placed in the diocesse, where it was large, as the Bishops deputy, in the country subiect to him. But what
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10663:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement was in this behalfe. let the Church of Geneua, framed thereby, test<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>But let vs heare what this Refuter doth confesse</hi> Caluin <hi>to haue acknowledged in this behalfe:</hi>
                  <q> He neither nameth dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, nortieth power of ecclesiasticall gouernment to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Church, but onely acknowledgeth that for orders sake some one Minister was chosen, to be, not a diocesan, but a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Bishop.</q>
Thus it fareth with men that wrangle against the light of their Conscience, being conuicted with eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth; but desirous to make a shew of opposition, when they know not what to say against it. Doth not <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> plainly say, <hi>that to each citt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> was attributed a certaine region,</hi> and that both were one Church as it were one body?
To what purpose doth he then say, that<q> 
                     <hi>he only acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that for orders sake, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
Is not his answere in effect this, <hi>Caluin doth confesse that the Churches indeed were dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and that the Bishops had vnder their charge both the citie and country adioyning,</hi> (for that also he confesseth in the next point) <hi>but they were not Bishops hauing such authority as you speake of?</hi> that is, <hi>I confesse he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> with you in the second and third point, as you say; but yet in the fourth</hi> (which also you confesse) <hi>he dissenteth from you.</hi>
Howbeit hee expresseth his mind absurdly, when he saith, <q>
                     <hi>not a diocesan, but a titular Bishop.</hi>
                  </q>For was not the Bishop a diocesan, if his Church was a diocesse? if he had vnder his charge both the city and country adioyning? Yea but
<q> 
                     <hi>he was not a diocesan, but a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Bishop.</hi>
                  </q>
Though <hi>Caluin</hi> acknowledgeth the Bishop to haue been only President of the Presbytery, like to the Consull in the senate of Rome (which you call a titular B.) wherein (being the fourth point) he dissenteth from vs; yet doth he acknowledge, that vnder his Bishopricke, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained both the citie and country, and consequently that he was a diocesan Bishop, vnlesse he that is Bishop of a diocesse, be not a diocesan Bishop.</p>
               <p>His testimony therefore to the third is cleere,<note place="margin">§ 15.</note> especially

For if euery parish had sufficient authority within themselues, what needed rurall Bishops to ouerlooke them? If the Bishop of the City had been Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop but of one parish, why doth <hi>Caluin</hi> say the Countrey was vnder his Bishopricke? Why doth he say, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke was sometimes so large, that there was need of Countrey Bishops as his deputies, to represent the Bishop in the prouince or countrey?
<hi>But what saith the Refuter to this? he confesseth (not ingenuously, but as it were</hi>

All the question concerning the Apostles times? doe not your selues extend your assertion to 200. yeares?

But to what purpose should I spend more words in this matter, seeing I haue heretofore proued, that the circuit of euery Bishops charge, was from the beginning as great, if not greater, then afterwards? And if nothing may be in the Church, but as it was in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times, then ought not the whole people of any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try be conuerted to the profession of Christianity, because none was then: and as well might they alleage, that no whole country ought to bee conuerted to the profession of the faith, because none was in the Apostles times, as to deny the people of a whole country to be a Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the fiue points which I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, three haue alreadie been handled: the first concerning Lay Elders, against both sorts of Disciplinarians, aswell the elder, as the younger; though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their opinions there is this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that the elder require such a presbyterie in each Citie or Diocesse; the yonger, in each Parish. In the second and third concerning Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Diocesans, I had to deale onely with our new sect of Disciplinarians, who vrge the new-found pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-discipline. In the fourth and fift which remaine, I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10663:197"/>
propounded to my selfe the confutation of the elder and more learned sort of disciplinarians, not greatly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, what our innouatours in these 2. points do hold, or deny; their proper opinions concerning the parish disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, being in the three former points sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. The which I doe the rather note, for 2. causes. The one, that the reader may vnderstand the refuters euasions, in disauowing such assertions as I ascribe vnto the discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians, to be to no purpose; seeing they are held by men more learned and iudicious, with whom principally I had to deale. The other that he may discerne the pouerty and weakenesse of their cause; the chiefe, and almost on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strength thereof, being the allegation of diuers prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant writers, (whom I called the learneder sort of Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians) who are parties in the cause.</p>
               <p>As touching the fourth point; the refuter, before hee come to my words, maketh an idle flourish: the summe whereof is this; that <q>
                     <hi>were it not, that by confuting the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie of Bishops, he should overthrow the Supremacy of the Pope, he would scarse haue vouchsafed an answeare to my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi>
                  </q>
Here therefore he sheweth two things; first, that by confuting the superioritie of Bishops, he shall withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the supremacie of the Pope. 2. that otherwise, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to me in this fourth point were needlesse.</p>
               <p>In the former, he seemeth ignorantly, and yet malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to presuppose, that the superioritie of Bishops, and the supremacie of the Pope, hang as it were vpon one pin; and that he which graunteth the one, must needs hold the other.
For the Basis or ground of his dispute, is this, such as is, and ought to be the gouernment of the whole Church, such is, and ought to be the gouernment of the parts or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Churches; and contrariwise. from hence he hath two inferences: the first thus: <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Such as is, and ought to be the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the whole Church, such is, and ought to be the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the parts or seuerall Churches.</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p>But the gouernment of the whole Church is Aristocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and not Monarchicall: therefore the gouernment of the parts or seuerall Churches is, and ought to be Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocraticall,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10663:197"/>
and not Monarchicall.</p>
                     <p>The proposition he taketh for graunted,<note place="margin">§ 2. Whether the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whol Church, and of the parts, must be of one forme.</note> noting it as an absurditie in me, <hi>To fight for that in the particulars, which in the generall I wish ouerthrowne.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But it would be knowne, what he meaneth by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, or parts of the Church, whose gouernment he would haue aunswerable to the vniuersal or whole Church. If he mean only parishionall Churches (as he needs must): For, <hi>there is no other visible Church indued with power of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall gouernment</hi> in his conceit <hi>but a Parish</hi>; Parishes (no doubt) may be proud of the comparison: for then, as some of them haue written in stately maner, as Rome had her Senate, Lacedaemon her Seigniorie, Athens her Areopage, Ierusalem her Synedrion, Venice (which our Refuter addeth) her councell of State; and lastly, (which exceedeth all) as the vniuersall Church hath her Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall synode, so the Church of euery Parish, in euery street, and in euery hamlet, must haue an Ecclesiasticall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. But what parts soeuer he vnderstand, whether Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, Nationall, or Diocesan Churches, the proposition is vntrue: for of Prouinciall, or Nationall Churches, the Metropolitans, and Bishops of dioceses, are, and ought to be the gouernors. But howsoeuer, in that respect the forme of gouernment may seeme to be Monarchicall; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the maner of gouerning, the Metropolis vsing the aduise of the Nationall, or Prouinciall synodes, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of his Presbyterie, they may be Aristocraticall. Who knoweth not that the common wealth of Rome somtimes was popular, and likewise that of Athens (for it is an errour of the Refuter to reckon Athens with Venice, as an example of Aristocracie;) yet the seuerall prouinces were ruled by seuerall gouernours, as Propraetors, and Proconsuls. The gouernment of this whole Island (bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God, for vniting the two Kingdomes in the person of our Soueraigne) is Monarchicall: yet the gouernment of seuerall parts by Counsels, and Presidents thereof, may seem so far Aristocraticall. The gouernment of the whole Church in Heauen and earth is Monarchicall vnder one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10663:198"/>
head and Monarch, which is Christ our King. And for the gouernment of the whole Church vpon earth, he hath no Vicar generall, but the holie Ghost, who appointeth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors vnder him, which may gouerne the seuerall parts of the Church in some respect monarchically, though the whole Church, by the mutuall consociation of her gouernours for the common good, and by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of them to an Occumenicall synode, is gouerned Aristocratically: for the whole Church beeing but one bodie, there ought to be a Christian consociation of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors thereof for the common good of the whole bodie. If among the Princes of the whole world, there were the like consociation, the vniuersall world should be gouerned in that respect Aristocratically, though the seuerall parts for the most part Monarchically. So much of the proposition.</p>
               <p>The assumption he prooueth by the testimonies of our writers against the Papists,<note place="margin">§. 3. The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Church Aristocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note> with whom himselfe, and his copartners do not agree. For, first, when they say that the regiment of the whole Church is Aristocraticall; they meane in respect of the gouernors of the seuerall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who as being seuered rule their Churches seuerally, there being no one visible Monarch ouer all; so being congregated in an Oecumenicall Synode, do make one Ecclesiasticall Senate. But our new Disciplinarians doe hold, that euery parish is an entire body by it selfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing within it selfe, for the gouernment of it selfe, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authority vnsubordinate and independent: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not acknowledge any lawful authoritie in Synodes <hi>to define, determine, or commaund,</hi> but onely to <hi>deliberat, and aduise,</hi> as H.

               <p>Secondly, Our writers hold the gouernment of the Church vniuersall to be Aristocraticall, because as our Sauiour Christ ascending into Heauen, left his twelue Apostles, as it were twelue Patriarches, aunswerable to the Princes of the twelue tribes <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </note> who as they gouerne the Churches seuerally, so ioyntly (with other gouernors) are the highest Senate of the vniuersall Church. But it was neuer practised in the Church of God, that any presbyters or pastors of parishes should be called to generall councils, to haue right of suffrage and authority to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine those matters which were debated in those councils; but both they and Deacons (I meane some of them) were to attend their Bishop, to assist him with their priuate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and aduice: which one argument (by the way) doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably set forth the superiority of Bishops ouer other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>But as his assumption crosseth the conceits of our new Disciplinarians, so is his conclusion repugnant to their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, who ascribing the supreme authority in their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Churches to the whole congregation, stand for a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar state, rather then Aristocraticall. Whereas indeed the gouernment of Churches, as they are prouinciall, are according to the ancient Canons which are in vse with vs, gouerned by prouinciall synodes, and therefore by a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Aristocraticall.</p>
               <p>So that of this syllogisme, the proposition is false, the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption is gainesaid by themselues, and the conclusion, confuting their owne assertion, agreeth with the practise of prouinciall churches with vs.<note place="margin">Though the gouernment of seuerall Churches be monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that therefore the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Vniuersall Church shold be monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. His other inference is this:
<q>If the gouernment of the seurall Churches may be monarchicall, then by the same reason the gouernment of the whole Church may be monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall. But the gouernment of the whole Church may not be monarchicall: therefore the gouernment of the seueral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This consequence is vnsound, there being not the like reason of the whole Church and of the parts. And that is the answere, which ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> men doe make to the papists, when they vrge this reason; <hi>as there was but one high priest, for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10663:199"/>
gouernment of the Church vnder the Law, so there should be, but one chiefe Bishop for the gouernment of the whole Church.</hi> They answere, there is not the like reason betweene the Church of one nation, and of the whole world. Cal. Inst. li. 4. ca. 6. s. 2. <hi>Gentis vnius &amp; totius orbis longè diuersa est ratio, perinde est, ac siquis contendat totum mundum a praefecto vno de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere regi, quia ager vnus non plures praefectos habeat.</hi> For of the vniuersall Church, Christ onely is the head; which su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame and vniuersal gouernment, if any man shall assume to himselfe, as the Pope of Rome doth; thereby he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himselfe to be Antichrist, or <hi>emulus Christi,</hi> sitting in the Church of God, as God, and lifting vp himselfe aboue all that is called God. But as touching the seuerall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, those who be the lieutenants of Christ, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the heads or gouernors thereof, as soueraigne princes of all states and persons within their dominions, Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans of prouinciall Churches, Bishops of their dioces, and Pastors of their seuerall flocks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas particular men are enabled by God to gouerne seuerall churches; no mortall man is able to weild the gouernment of the whole Church: which is one of the maine arguments, which our writers vse against the monarchicall gouernment of the whole Church: which this refuter seeketh in vaine to infringe. The Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, when their Empire was at the largest, and they esteemed themselues Lords of the world, enioying indeed not one third part of the whole, yet finding themselues vnable to weild so great a burden, were faine to assume col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues vnto them with whom they parted the Empire, when they might haue retained the whole.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the monarchicall gouernment of the whole Church would proue dangerous and pernicious to the same, if that one head or Monarch thereof should fall into errour or idolatry; especially, he being so aboue the whole Church as that he should not be subiect to a generall Councell.</p>
               <p>But the heads of seuerall Churches, if they erre or fall, may by the Synodes of other Bishops be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to order, or deposed. Examples whereof we haue in all,

               <p>The assumption is false in respect of Christ, who is the Monarch of the Church; otherwise I acknowledge it to be true,<note place="margin">

                  </q> But the Churches were dioceses and the BB. diocesan, as I haue manifestly proued before, and as those Disciplinarians do confesse, with whom chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I deale in this point: who granting that the Churches were dioceses,<note place="margin">Wherein the Disciplinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do agree, and wherein they discent from vs.</note> and the Bishops diocesan, doe notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding deny the superiority of Bishops in degree &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Now that the state of the controuersie betwixt vs and them may appeare, I shew wherein the Presbyterians agree

with vs, and wherein they dissent from vs. But first he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fault that I call them <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as sometimes I doe also <hi>Disciplinarians</hi>; though thereby I meane no other, but such as doe stand for the Presbytery, and for that discipline, being loth either to call them aduersaries (whom I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be brethren) or to offend them with the title of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, wherewith others doe vpbraid them.
And howsoeuer he in bitter scorne doth say, <q>
                     <hi>that of my charity I doe in scorne so call them:</hi>
                  </q>
I doe professe vnfainedly, that out of a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind, I did terme them Presbyterians, not knowing how to speake of them, as dissenting from vs, more charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
And whereas I say they agree with vs in this, that by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine institution there was in the primitiue Church, and still ought to be, one set ouer the Presbyters, he saith; <q>
                     <hi>I had need to be as mighty in eloquence as Pericles, if I would perswade that.</hi>
                  </q>
But small eloquence may serue, where there is such eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to proue the truth. Only the Reader must remember, that I speake not of my aduersary, and other new fangled disciplinarians, who are not to haue the credit of comming so neere the truth; but of men of greater learning, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desert in Gods Church: who as they agree with vs, that the Churches were dioceses, and the Presbyteries with the Presidents thereof prouided for diocesses, (which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10663:203"/>
but were hindred by persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in time of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their gouernment was not alwaies such as they would, but such as they could attaine vnto. And vnlesse we would haue the Churches to liue alwaies vnder persecution, it is madnesse to require them to be imitated in all things. But what was by generall consent receiued, and practised in the time of peace and prosperity, was that which in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to be done, and is of vs being in the like case, to be imitated. Now that in <hi>Constantines</hi> time the Bishops had superiority ouer other Ministers in degree, and a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar preheminence of power and authority, it is most euident. Neither was their superiority and authority increased by the accession of the Christian Magistrate, as their wealth was, but rather diminished, seeing while there was not a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrate, they were faine to supply that defect, and by their owne authority did many things, which afterward were done or assisted by the Magistrate.<note place="margin">The same forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and the like authority of diocesan B.B. throughout all the times of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church.</note> But though there can no colour of a good reason be giuen, why the superiority and authority of Bishoppes, as they were diocesan, should haue been greater in the fourth century, then in the third; or in the third, then in the second; or in the second, then the first; the first Bishops in all likelihood, hauing had rather a more eminent then lesse authority, yet our new Disciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, for a poore shift and euasion, deny this superiority of Bishops in degree and maiority in power to haue been in the first two hundred yeeres, because they conceiue there is not the like euidence for the second, as for the third. Now our Refuter perceiuing there is better euidence then he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined for the second century, will needs haue the times of the primitiue Church restrained to the time of the Apostles. And when they are driuen from that, they were best to flie to the time of Christs conuersation vpon the earth.</p>

Indeed, when the Churches multiplying, there was a consociation of dioceses in the prouince, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Alexandria became actually a Metropolitan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, which from the first might bee intended: and when there was a consociation of prouinces subiected to him, he became a Patriarch, the antient Fathers in godly policie so thinking it necessary. Now if any man shall thinke, that the Bishop of Alexandria was but a parish Bishop at the first, and vpon cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ciation of parishes subiected to him, became a diocesan, he is to vnderstand, that the diocesse, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church of the diocesse, was before any parish; that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes arise out of the distribution of the diocesse; that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Bishop and his Presbytery of the mother Church were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed not for one parish, but for the whole diocesse; that at Alexandria, in, and from S. <hi>Marks</hi> time, who constituted the Churches there, there haue been more Churches then one subiected to the Bishop of Alexandria.</p>
               <p>Vnlearned therefore and vngrounded is that distinction of Bishops into six sorts,<note place="margin">§. 10. Of <hi>H.I.</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 7.) his distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of BB. into 6. sorts.</note> viz. 1. Parishionall: 2. Diocesan titular Bishop, being the President or Moderator ouer the Pastors of a diocesse: 3. Diocesan ruling Bishop, though not solely: 4. Diocesan L. Bishop: 5. A Patriarchall Bishop: 6. An vniuersall Bishop. Of the first sort, it is said, all were in the first two hundred yeeres. Of the second, there beganne to be some in the end of the second century. The third be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan about the yeere 260. The fourth shortly after <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> time.

And how is all this proued? It is strange to see, how strong some mens conceits can be, when their reasons are full weake. The proofes for the parish Bishop, J haue before disproued.

               <p>His reason is this, some change there was therefore in the name Bishop. How weake a reason this is I shal not need to note, seeing I haue shewed wherein the change was, there being lesse likelihood of alceration in this kind, then in any other.

He saith, <hi>hee doubts not of it</hi>: though he be not able to shew, neither where, nor when, nor by whom, nor how the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops authority was increased after <hi>Augustines</hi> times. What if in <hi>Augustines</hi> time the authority and preheminence of Bishops was abated and restrained, namely in the fourth Councell of Carthage, more then euer before? For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the antient Canons referre the power both of ordination and iurisdiction to the Bishop, without mentioning the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Presbytery: And whereas Bishoppes before, such as were peaceable and well disposed, did voluntarily vse the aduice and assistance of their clergy: by that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the assistance of the clergy, both in ordination and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction in the Churches of Africk, became necessary. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I know any reason, why the authority of diocesan Bishops after <hi>Augustines</hi> time should bee thought to haue increased. For as by the lawfull authority of Christian Kings &amp; Princes, to whom they were subordinate, in regard of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good of the kingdom, whereof they were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers: so much more by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vsurped supremacy of the B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the yeer 607. y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> authority of bishops was lessened &amp; impaired.</p>
               <p>We are to come to his fift step,<note place="margin">Of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and when they began.</note> which is of patriarchal BB. but he hath cleane marred the staires that the refuter and his consorts vse to talke of, whereby the Bishoppes of Rome, from being as they say a parish Bishop, did arise to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; partly by denying such BB. as he esteemeth ours to be,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10663:206"/>
to haue been till after <hi>Augustines</hi> time; and partly, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skipping the Metropolitanes. For it cannot be denied, but that there were diocesan Bishoppes, such as ours be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were Metropolitanes, or Primates actually; and there were Metropolitanes before there were Patriarches. Now it would be knowne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Nic. can.</hi> 6.</note> when Patriarches begun. In the Councel of Nice (held about the yeere three hundred twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie foure) it is acknowledged to haue been an antient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, which there was ratified, that the Bishop of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria should haue authority of Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis: and the like custome for the Bishop of Rome in the West, and of Antioch in the East is mentioned; and the antient priuiledges to each Church, espcially to each Metropolis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. To say nothing of Rome, whereof the Papists say too much: it is plaine by that testimony of the Nicene Councell, of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> before alleaged, of <hi>Athanasius</hi> euen now cited, that the Bishops of Alexandria had of old, long before their time, patriarchall authority. For that of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, the testimony of <hi>Ignatius</hi> added to the authority of the Nicene Councell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ignat. Epist. ad Rom.</hi>
                  </note> is sufficient, calling himselfe <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Syria</hi>; whereby we cannot conceiue him to haue been lesse then an Archbishop. Now if I should aske <hi>H.I.</hi> or this Refuter, when Metropolitanes first began; they would not be able truly to assigne their originall after the Apostles times. And therefore cunningly were they omitted by <hi>H. I.</hi> though I cannot accuse him of any great skill in making a doubt, whether Caesarea in the Councell of Nice, be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as one of the foure seats of the Patriarches. For expresse mention is made of <hi>Aeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if Metropolitanes had not their beginning after the Apostles times, as no man is able to shew they had, then can it not be doubted, but that diocesan Bishops, much more were in the Apostles times: for euery Metropolita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was originally B. of his peculiar dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10663:206"/>
being not actually a Metropolitan, vntill diuers Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the same prouince, being constituted, there was a consociation among themselues, and subordination of them to him, as their primate.</p>
               <p>There was therefore no such difference betweene the first two ages of the Churches, and those which followed, as that either <hi>H. I.</hi> or the Refuter should restraine the times of the primitiue Church, either to the end of the second century, or of the first, with hope to escape that way. Wherefore what proofes I bring from the third or fourth, yea or fifth century, for the superiority of Bishops, they are to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med such as doe directly and sufficiently proue the question, vnlesse they shall be able to shew, not onely that no such thing was in vse, but also that it was not intended in the Apostles time, and the age following: for what was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and practised by generall consent in all Christendome, so soone as God gaue peace vnto his Church, was vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly desired and intended from the beginning.</p>
               <p>The second corner of his first starting hole,<note place="margin">§ 13. The Refuter would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the question to the seuen Angels onely.</note> wherewith the second also meeteth, is, <q>

And therefore what may be said ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the seuen Angels, in respect of the substance of their calling, may be concluded of other Bishops: and what may be said of the office of other Bishoppes in the primitiue Church, may be verified of these Angels.</p>

Where doe I deny either that the BB. did, or might vse the assistance of their Presbyters, for either of both, or that in the defect of Bishops, both the one and the other might be performed by Presbyters?

But the former is true; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter.</hi> First hee cauilleth with the consequence, (which no man bearing the face of a Diuine, I had almost said of a Christian, would doe) calling it, sore, poore, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and insufficient, vnlesse the consent of the Apostles and Euangelists be added. Where let the Reader consider, what is the question which is here concluded, viz. <hi>That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the primitiue Church were superiour to other Ministers in degree.</hi> This question plainly is <hi>de facto,</hi> of what was: for <hi>de iure,</hi> that is, of the quality &amp; lawfulnes, I intreat in the second assertion. Now for a man to deny credit to all antiquitie in a matter of fact not gainsaid by scripture, it is a plain euidence that he is addicted to nouelty and singularity, rather then the truth. Doth all antiquity testifie with one consent, that the Bishops in the primitiue Church were superior to other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in degree; and hath any of vs the forehead to deny it?

Where I doe with such euidence demonstrate, that the Bishops, described in the first assertion, are of Apostolicall institution; as I am well assured that this Refuter, with all his partakers, will neuer be able soundly and substantially to confute. For there is nothing written with such euidence of truth, but that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons may easily cauill with it. And although it had been sufficient for the demonstration of the first asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to haue produced such euidence as doth testifie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>de facto</hi>; yet many of the allegations which I bring, doe also giue testimony to the right.

For <hi>there is one order</hi> (saith he) <hi>of both, one honor, and one dignitie. The Bishop imposeth hands, so doth the Presbyter: the B. giueth the lauer (of Baptisme) so doth the Presbyter: the B. doth administer Gods worship, so doth the Presbyter: the B. sitteth on the throne, so also doth the Presbyter.</hi> But <hi>Ierome</hi> was not so mad (to vse the refuters words of <hi>Aërius,</hi> who indeed, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And therfore the refuter here hath deliuered two vntruthes: the one, that (he saith) <q>
                     <hi>Aërius did not deny the Superioritie of BB. de facto</hi>
                  </q>: which most manifestly he did, and did it no doubt with this mind, that though he missed of the Bishopricke, which ambitiously he had desired; yet he would be thought as good a man as a Bishop.
The other, that he saith, <q>
                     <hi>Ierome denied the Superiority of BB. de Iure</hi>
                  </q>. For it is most euident by many testimonies alledged in the Sermon, that <hi>Ierome</hi> held the Superiority of Bishops to be lawfull and necessary. For though somewheres he saith that Bishops are greater then Presbyters rather by the custome of the Church, then by the truth of Diuine disposition; yet he acknowledgeth that custome to be <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Euagr.</hi>
                  </note> an Apostolicall tradition; and therefore either he may be vnderstood as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10663:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
holding the superioritie of BB. to be not <hi>Diuini,</hi> but <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolici iuris:</hi> or he may be interpreted as speaking of the names, prouing by diuers testimonies of the Scripture, that Presbyters are called Bishops. But heereof wee may not conclude, that therefore Presbyters and Bishops are all one; for not onely Bishops, but also Apostles <note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet</hi> 5.1. 2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. and 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.</note>, are called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and the Apostleship <note n="c" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>For howsoeuer all Presbyters are in the Scriptures called <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi>; yet that one among many, who had singular preheminence aboue the rest, is by the warrant of the holy Ghost, called <hi>the Angell of the Church</hi>; and by the same warrant, may be called <hi>the Bishop.</hi> Now whereas <hi>Aëri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> for denying the superiority of Bishops, was by <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> iudged and heretike, hereby it appeareth that this alleagation not onely proueth the superiority <hi>de facto,</hi> but <hi>de iure</hi>: for seeing there is no heresie which is not repugnant to Gods word, it is euident that they who iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this opinion of <hi>Aerius</hi> to be an heresie, did also iudge it contrarie to Gods word.

               <p>
                  <q>Now, <hi>saith the refuter,</hi> let vs take a view of his great army of antiquity; the whole number of them is but fiue, and <hi>4.</hi> of them almost <hi>200.</hi> yeares vnder age.</q>
Marke here, either the skill, or conscience of this great Analyser. The first argument, which indeed is vnanswerable, that he swalloweth. And in stead of analysing and answearing the rest, he cauils at the number, and at their age. I will therefore propound my arguments and withall answere his cauils. And first, for their number; besides the fiue he speaketh of, I produced the testimonies of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> deliuering not only their own opinions, but the iudgement of the Church; <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reporting, that all Churches did reject and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <hi>Aërius</hi>; and <hi>Augustine</hi> testifying, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church did hold the contrary to <hi>Aërius</hi> his assertion; that as I said, was my first argument.</p>

                  </note>
                  <hi>My second argument is this:</hi> Antiquity did distinguish the ministers of the Church into <hi>3.</hi> degrees; viz, Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, answerable to the high Priest, the Priests and L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Therefore it giueth testimony to the superiority of BB. ouer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10663:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other ministers in degree.</p>
               <p>The antecedent I proue by the the testimony of the Councill of Sardica, of <hi>Optatus,</hi> of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the testimony of Fathers in Councils; in which, as I said, nothing is more vsuall then the distinction of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters into these 3. degrees. That clause, if it had pleased the refuter to haue taken notice of, it might haue preuented his cauill concerning either the number, or the age of my witnesses. But he (such is his conscience) passing by it, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth (wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h what face I know not) that I haue no antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which distinguisheth the ministrie into 3. degrees. Here therefore 3. things are to be shewen, which are so many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. 1. That antiquity distinguisheth the Clergy into 3. degrees. 2. That it termeth them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>degrees.</hi> 3. That they compare them to the high Priest, Priests and Leuits.</p>
               <p>As touching the first: this distinction of Ministers is so frequent in the ancient Canons, that if a man do but open the booke at all aduentures, he shall not often light vpon such a place, where this distinction is not to be found. Jn the ancient Canons, called the Apostles, it is mentioned 20. times at the least in the Council of Nice, 3. or 4. times; in the Councill of Ancyra, and Antioch often, and so in the rest.</p>
               <p>Which of the ancient Fathers doth not acknowledge this distinction of Ministers? <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as we shall heare, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth plentifull testimony to it. <hi>Clement</hi>

               <p>Now to reject these testimonies, as being vnder age, as though they did historically relate only what was in their own times, and not dogmatically set downe the orders, and degrees of the ministerie, perpetually obserued in the Church of Christ; is a verie vnlearned shift. If any one of these, as namely <hi>Ierome,</hi> shal but seeme to fauor any of their assertions, though in their sense he contradict himself, and gainsay all others, both Councils, &amp; fathers; against such a testimonie no exception, either of minoritie of age, or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie of opinion will be admitted; but that authoritie must ouerweigh all, that himself, and others say to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.

But of these blasphemous speeches, whereby they match the ordinance of Christ by his Apostles, with the height of Antichrists pride; I hope this Refuter, &amp; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts will one day haue the grace to repent.

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore they were not Ministers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition is proued by 2. reasons.
<q>
                     <hi>First, because</hi> it were a mockery of a ministerie to deny Ministers power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their office.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, because <hi>euery popish Priest had</hi> potestatem ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, <hi>that is, power to do all things that belong to his order.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>First, to the proposition it selfe, I say it is very false, and that the contradictorie in all the parts of it is true: viz <hi>that they who might, yea ought to preach, baptize, administer the Lords supper, and performe any other pastorall dutie, being therto licensed of the Bishop, were ministers.</hi> From which we may assume and conclude thus:
<q>But the ancient Presbyters might, yea ought to preach, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, administer the Lords supper, and performe any other pastorall duties, being therto authorized by the Bishop: Therefore they were ministers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And that the proposition is false, it may appeare by the practise of our owne Church, and of all the antient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whose Presbyters are, and were Ministers (as I haue sufficiently prooued before, for the conuiction, I doubt not, of the refuters conscience) and yet neither may, nor might preach, baptize, administer the Lords Supper, and performe other ministeriall functions, but by leaue or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Bishop. Neither yet is the ministery of our clergy now, nor of the Presbyters in times past, a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery, because it agreeth not with his fancy: but his fancy is a meere nouelty, disagreeing from the generall practise of the most antient Churches. For howsoeuer afterwards he malepertly chargeth mee with not vnderstanding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of ecclesiasticall power, <hi>in potestatem ordinis et iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictionis; into the power of order and iurisdiction:</hi> yet doth he both here and there bewray himself not to vnderstand it. For though euery Minister, as hee is a Presbyter hath <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatem
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10663:216"/>
ordinis</hi>; yet it doth not follow, that hee may at his owne pleasure exercise that power. We must therfore take knowledge of two distinctions: the one, of the power of order and of iurisdiction: for euery minister hath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of order as hee is a Presbyter simply; but the power of iurisdiction, as he is <hi>praelatus,</hi> or pastor. The former he hath giuen him in his ordination; the latter, in his institution. By the former, hee is qualified and authorized to preach and administer the sacraments, and to doe other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>spirituall actions peculiar to his order, which another man, who is not of that order, neither can doe, nor may haue leaue to doe. But hee may not performe these duties which belong to the power of his order to any congregation, as the Pastor therof, vnlesse that flocke be assigned and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by the Bishop, who hath the charge of the whole diocesse. A presbyter therefore though he haue <hi>potestatem ordinis,</hi> may not perform pastoral duties to any congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are part of the Bishops charge, vnlesse hee be authorized therto by the Bishop; from whom hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <hi>potestatem iurisdictionis, curamque animarum et regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ecclesia parochialis,</hi> in his institution.</p>
               <p>Againe, we must distinguish betweene the power it selfe and the exercise &amp; execution of it. For although euery mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister hath thesame power of order which is common to them with Bishops in respect of preaching the worde and administring Baptisme and the Lords Supper, yet the exercise of their power is, and alwaies hath been subiected to the authority of the Bishop, to be permitted, directed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and suspended by him. This subordination and subiection of the presbyters to the Bishop, for the exercise of their power, which euer hath beene practised in the Church, doth not make either their function to be a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of the ministery, as the refuter malepertly speaketh, nor themselues to be no ministers. But plainly proueth the contrary, as I haue shewed.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:10663:219"/>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly, because</hi> Bëllarmine alleageth the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mier: whose answer if I like not, he bids me try what I can say in defence of Bellarmine against it.</q>
To omit how odiously this is set downe, I doe professe, that I may with better credit agree with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> wherein he consenteth with all antiquity, then the Refuter and his consorts can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with <hi>Aërius</hi>; wherein he dissenting from all antiquity, was by <hi>Epiphanius, Philaster, Augustine,</hi> and all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church in his time, condemned for an heretike.
<q>
                     <hi>But let vs heare his answers. First,</hi> that Ierome proueth by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Church of Alexandria, that which before he had demonstrated out of the Scriptures, to wit, that a Presbyter and a Bishop differ not. Neither doth he call Marke a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, but an Euangelist.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This answere might become our refuter better then <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier.</hi> For first it is vntrue, that <hi>Ierome</hi> in these words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that a Bishop and a Presbyter differ not. For doth hee not plainly say that the Bishop was placed <hi>in a higher degree?</hi> and doth hee not compare him in respect of the Presbyters which chose him, to the <hi>Chieftaine</hi> or Generall, chosen of the Army?</p>
               <p>Secondly, he faileth in setting downe <hi>Ieromes</hi> purpose; which was not to prooue there was no difference betwixt Bishoppes and Presbyters; but to prooue, that Presbyters were superior to Deacons. That he proueth by many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. First, <hi>because the name</hi> Episcopus, <hi>Bishop, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is giuen to Presbyters.</hi> Secondly, because <hi>the Apostles and Bishops are in the Scriptures called Presbyters</hi>: to which purpose he alleageth 1. Tim. 4.13. 1. Pet. 5.1. 2. Iohn 1. and 3. Iohn 1.<note place="margin">2. Iohn 1. 3. Iohn 1.</note> And thirdly, whereas it might be obiected, <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were set ouer Presbyters</hi>; he confesseth it was done <hi>for auoiding of schisme</hi>; but yet so, as by the Presbyters the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was chosen out of the Presbyters, euer since S. <hi>Marks</hi> time, vntill <hi>Heracla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </hi> and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ysius,</hi> as a Generall by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or the Arch-deacon by the Deacons, out of their owne company. Whereby he would also insinuate, that a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10663:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is so much better then a Deacon, as a Bishop is superior to an Arch deacon.
<q>
                     <hi>Thirdly, where he saith, that</hi> Ierome doth not call Marke a Bishop, but an Euangelist, and saith else where, that he planted that Church:</q>
It is plaine, that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Prooem. in Matthaeum.</hi>
                  </note> he confesseth <hi>Marke</hi> to haue been the first Bishop of Alexandria. If <hi>Marke</hi> therefore were superiour in degree to the Presbyters at Alexandra, as no man wil deny; then must the same be confessed of <hi>Anianus,</hi> and the rest of his successors, as <hi>Ierome</hi> plainely testifieth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly he answeareth,</hi> That the order by which the Presbyters chose a Bishop from among themselues, continued to Heraclas and Dionysius time, whom he therefore calleth Bishops, to the end he might signifie, that in their daies after one hundred and forty yeers were expired from Marks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Alexandria, that order was changed. Then at the soonest, <hi>saith the refuter,</hi> began M. D. superiority of Bishops to creep in, &amp;c.</q>
Which answere, if his meaning be as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer conceiteth, is vnsound. For first where he saith the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was changed in <hi>Heraclas and Dionysius,</hi> that is spoken but by ghesse, because <hi>Ierome</hi> nameth them. Vpon which coniecture, <hi>T. C.</hi> and <hi>H. I.</hi> as you haue heard, did build their two diuers fancies. For <hi>Ieromes</hi> meaning was not to signifie that the superioritie of Bishops was altered: but as I haue shewed, that vntill <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who were not Presbyters, but Teachers of the schoole in Alexandria, the Presbyters euer since S. <hi>Marks</hi> time, did chuse one out of their owne number. That which the Refuter addeth, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, and against <hi>Ieromes</hi> plaine words:
<q>Then at the soonest began M. D. superiority of Bishops to creepe in: <hi>for the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority I spake of, is superiority in degree.</hi>
                  </q>
And <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, that euer from Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> and therefore euen in the Apostles times, the BB. had been placed in a higher degree.</p>
               <p>My fift argument is also from the authority of <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Euagriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ierome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 16. Another te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of <hi>Ierome.</hi>
                  </note> which yeeldeth a double proofe; the former, that the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Bishops ouer Presbyters, and Presbyters aboue Deacons, is an ordinance or <hi>tradition apostolicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:10663:220"/>Secondly, that as the high Preist was in degree superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the other Preists, and they to the Leuits: so by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall ordinance the Bishop is superiour to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and the Presbyters to the Deacons. <hi>That wee may know,</hi> saith he, <hi>the apostolicall traditions are taken out of the old testament, looke what Aaron</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The like he hath <hi>ad Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potian. Quod Aaron &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios eius, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>, <hi>and his sonnes and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits were in the Temple; the same let the Bishops, Preists and Deacons challenge in the Church.</hi> To this testimony contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning two impregnable proofs for the superiority of BB. not onely <hi>de facto,</hi> but also <hi>de iure</hi>; the refuter thought it his wisest course to say nothing.</p>
               <p>To these arguments this may be added: That as the new ordination of a Deacon, when he was made a Presbyter, doth proue that he was aduanced to a higher degree of the ministery: euen so when a Presbyter was chosen to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, he was by a new ordination promo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He superiority of Bishops ouer other Ministers, I place in three things: sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of preeminence during life, the power of ordination, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of iurisdiction: all which I ground on Tit. 1.5. But where I say, during life, hee saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 89.</note>
                  <q>
                     <hi>This addition needed not, seeing it is grounded vpon an erroneous conceit of mine owne, whereby I charge them as holding the contrary. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it is not proued out of the place alleaged.</hi>
                  </q> In the former hee sheweth how audacious he is, seeing, <hi>Beza</hi> the chiefe patron of the pretended discipline, holdeth that the Presidents of the Presbyteries (which afterwards, as he saith, were called Bishoppes) ought to be but for a short time, and that by course, and esteemeth them which had a perpetuall presidenship, to be Bishops humane <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. §. 17.</note>, as I haue shewed before.
The practise also of those Churches where the discipline is vsed, doth prooue what their Founders thought was agreeable to Gods word. This their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10663:221"/>
is euidently confuted by the Epistles to <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>to Timothy.</hi> For seeing they doe confesse, that they were the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Churches of Creet and Ephesus; it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they continued in this Presidentshippe, whiles they liued there. For it is absurd to imagine, that <hi>Titus</hi> was sent to Creet, and <hi>Timothy</hi> to Ephesus, to be presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents there in their turnes, and when their turnes were ended, to be subiected to other of the Presbyters there in their course. But these things the refuter doth but cauill at by the way.
For he granteth that <hi>Titus</hi> had this superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which we speake of: his maine answer is, <q>
                     <hi>that Titus was not a Bishop.</hi>
                  </q>
Which afterwards J proue in the Sermon, by the common consent of the antient and most approoued Writers of the Church; with whose affirmation, in a matter of fact, if this Refuters deniall shall be weighed in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of an vnpartiall iudgement, it will be found as light as vanitie it selfe. But of this question more hereafter <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 4 <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note>. In the meane time, J will but desire the Reader to take this for granted, because it cannot be denied, that if <hi>Titus</hi> was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Creet, then Bishops had this threefold superioritie which I speake of.</p>
               <p>Where I commend this order of Church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, consisting in the superiority of Bishoppes, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie of other Ministers; this graue and learned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer maketh a scorne at it, saying, <q>
                     <hi>It is a toy to please chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and a gay Epiphonema wanting a note of exclamation</hi> (he would haue said, acclamation) <hi>to grace it.</hi>
                  </q>
The which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his spite against the gouernment of Bishoppes, rather then his might, being neither able to endure the iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of episcopall gouernment, nor yet to confute it.
For what hath he but trifles and toies to obiect against it? For where hee saith, <q>
                     <hi>I begge the question, supposing ech Church to be a diocesse</hi>;</q> the conscience of the Reader, I hope also of the Refuter, will testifie, that what I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in this behalfe, hath beene before sufficiently proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Besides, those with whom I principally contend in this point, doe confesse the Churches indued with power
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10663:221"/>
of ecclesiasticall gouernement, to haue beene dioceses <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. §. 14</note>, as hath beene shewed. I say then (which also I proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued afterwards by the testimonies of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> whereto the authoritie of <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Basil, epist.</hi> 67. <hi>ad Ancyr.</hi> professeth that the members of the Church are by the gouernment of the Bishop, as it were of the soule, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and knit together. Whether the vnitie of ech Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the vnity of the B.</note> 
                  <hi>Basil</hi> may bee added) that the vnitie of each Church, meaning a diocesse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of the vnitie of the Bishoppe: and the setting vp of a second, vnlesse it were by way of coadiutorshippe, hath euer been esteemed the making of a schisme in the Church. But of this more anon.</p>
               <p>§. 2. But let vs heare, if it bee worth the hearing, what more particularly hee obiecteth against these three points. And first he trifleth to no purpose, when he asketh,
<q>
                     <hi>If there bee not as much vnity in a parish vnder one Pastor, as in a diocesse vnder a Bishoppe.</hi>
                  </q> For though ech pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, if it were, according to the new conceit, an entire body within it selfe, vnsubordinate to any other, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes haue vnitie within it selfe: yet in the Church of the diocesse or prouince, that may happen (which <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> affirmeth is like to happen, where is no Bishoppe) that there shall bee as many schismes as parishes.
And surely what man of iudgement and moderation, can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horrour thinke of those manifold schismes and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which would ensue, if euery parish should haue (according to the newe conceit) sufficient authoritie within it selfe vnsubordinate and independent, for the gouernment of it selfe, in all causes ecclesiasticall? Yea but saith he,
<q>If there bee not as great vnitie of the Church in a parish vnder one Pastor, as in a diocesse vnder one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe, then the more Churches are vnder one gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the greater is the vnitie. But the consequent is false, therefore the antecedent. <hi>The consequence of the proposition is true, being not extended without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the question.</hi>
                  </q>
The more particular Churches in any one visible Church are subordinate to one Bishoppe, the greater is the vnitie. But by one visible Church I meane the Christian people of one diocesse, or of one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, or at the most of one Nation. For the Christian
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10663:222"/>
people liuing vnder diuers lawes, as they be diuers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so are they diuers visible Churches, though the faithfull in them all are members of one and the same Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let vs heare how he prooueth the assumption.</hi>
                  <q> If the more Churches are vnder one gouernment the greater vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then welfare the Pope, who if this be true, maketh vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all Churches in the world.</q>
As who should say, all the Churches in the world are vnder the Popes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: so that whiles hee denieth the superiority of Bishoppes, hee seemeth (else there is no sense in his speech) to hold the Popes supremacie. If any man shall say, that as the vnity of ech Church dependeth on the singular preeminence of the Bishoppe: so the vnity of the whole Catholicke Church by the same reason shall depend of the Popes supremacy, (which seemeth to haue beene the Refuters meaning, who desireth as much as may bee that the superioritie of Bishoppes and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the Pope may seeme to bee of one tenure:) I answere, that the vnitie of the whole Church stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this; that it is one body, vnder one head Christ. And as in a diocesse, to set vp a second head, is to set vp an Antibishoppe, and to make a schisme from the true Bishoppe: so in the whole Church, to acknowledge a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond head, is to set vp Antichrist, and to make an aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie from Christ. Neither was it euer the meaning of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, that as euery particular Church should be vnder one Pastor, so the whole Church should be vnder one visible head, or earthly Monarch. For then would not he haue furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his twelue Apostles with equall power and authority, as I haue said before.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>
As touching the second, he confesseth all that I said, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that from the power of ordination the perpetuity of the Church dependeth; and yet cauilleth with mee, as if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had said, there could bee<q> 
                     <hi>no ordination at all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Bishoppe,</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 83.</note> or that the Bishop had the sole power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Thus being resolued to wrangle, if he finde not matter to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10663:222"/>
cauill at, he will faine it. I did not say there could be no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination without a Bishoppe: but that euer since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times to our age, it hath been the receiued opinion in the Church of God, that the right of ordination of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons, is such a peculiar prerogatiue of BB. as that ordinarily and regularly, there could be no lawfull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination but by a Bishop: otherwise I doe confesse in the sermon, that extraordinarily, and in case of necessity, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters may ordaine in the want of a Bishop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the third, he saith it</hi>
                  <q> is enough to preserue good order in Churches, if iurisdiction be in the ministers and Presbyters.</q>
Hee meaneth in the seuerall parishes, which may after a fashion be gouerned, where the supreame ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call officer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> (I meane the parish minister) assisted with such a senate, as ech parish is like to afford, hath the reines of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in all causes ecclesiasticall committed to them. But I pray you, how shall there be any good order in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Churches of a diocesse, or prouince, when euery parish is so according to the new conceipt an entire body of it selfe, (indeed a member by <hi>Schisme</hi> rent from the the rest) as it hath neither consociation with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to others? For they are not gouerned by consociation, who deny the definitiue power of synods, as our new Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarians do; neither do they acknowledge any subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for their Pastor forsooth is the supreme ecclesiasticall officer, and the power of ech parish is independent, immediatly deriued from Christ. Now, how is it possible there should be good order in the gouernment of so many pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes in a Kingdome, where is no subordination; no superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, nor inferiours, but all equall? But this is enough for our Disciplinarians, if they might be subiect to no superiors, but that each of them might be the supreme ecclesiasticall officer in euery Church.</p>
               <q>(<hi>Serm. sect.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 32. As touching the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10663:223"/>
first,<note place="margin">BB. superior in singularity of preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence for terme of life.</note> whereas there were many Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in one Citie, &amp;c. <hi>to pag.</hi> 36. <hi>l. a fine</hi> 8.)</q>
               <p>Jn this section I proue, that the Bishops of the primitiue Church were superior to other Ministers in singularity of preeminence for terme of life. Which is a point very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, prouing both against the new Disciplinarians, that the BB. were diocesan, there being but one for ech dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, as hath been touched before: and against the elder, that the BB. were not such as their Presidents of the Presbytery, or Moderators of assemblies among them, whose preeminence is but a priority of order, and but for a short time,<note place="margin">Lay Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, the two pillers of the new disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> and against both, disprouing the <hi>parity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> which is the other maine piller of the pretended discipline. Here therefore it behoued the Refuter, if his cause were such, as indeed he could maintaine with sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of learning, and euidence of truth, both to haue dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this superiority of BB. and to haue proued his parity of Ministers. But he passeth by in haste, touching only vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the points, as a dogge by the riuer Nilus, not daring to stay by it; &amp; yet so brag he is, that he would seem to haste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way not for feare, but rather in disdain, as not vouchsafing to waste time in a matter either so impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as the former part of this section, or so needlesse, as the latter. For this is his vsual guise, to cast off those points of the Sermon, which indeed are most materiall, as impertinent or needlesse.
<hi>The former is impertinent, because</hi>
                  <q> it is not prooued to belong to those seuen Angels, nor within the first two hundred yeeres.</q>
Which is a meere euasion, vnlearned, and J greatly doubt also vnconscionable. Doe I not plainely note that these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Angels had this singularity of preeminence, when as I say the holy Ghost teacheth, that whereas there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Presbyters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who also were Angels in euery Church: yet there was but one, who was the Angell of ech Church?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10663:223"/>
For to his obiection of their not being diocesan Bishops, I haue answered before. And for the time, doe I not affirme, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had this singularity of preeminence at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <hi>Titus</hi> in Creet, <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> in Philippi, <hi>Archippus</hi> at Colosse in the Apostles times? As for the rest of my witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, they doe either testifie <hi>de iure,</hi> which in their iudgement is perpetuall; or if they speak <hi>de facto,</hi> it is of that which was in the Apostles times. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the worthy martyr, who was Bishop of Rome about the yeere two hundred fifty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth, that there ought to be but <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist Cornel. apud Euseb. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 43.</note> one Bishop in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, though the number of Presbyters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clergy men were very great, and imputeth it as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great ignorance to <hi>Nouatian,</hi> that he did not know <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>there ought to be but one Bishop in a Catholike Church, wherein he knew there were forty six Presbyters, &amp;c.</hi> This testimony is reiected, because it was giuen fifty yeeres after the date: which were but an euasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it did testifie <hi>de facto</hi> onely. But seeing <hi>Cornelius</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>de iure,</hi> of what ought to be, I hope that which ought not to haue been in <hi>Cornelius</hi> his time, was not lawfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vnlesse the Refuter can shew, that before <hi>Cornelius</hi> his time, plurality of Bishops in one Church was counted lawfull.</p>
               <p>§. 5. The Councell of Nice <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Nic. cap.</hi> 8.</note> (whose testimonie I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so alleaged) was of this iudgement, that there ought not to bee two Bishoppes in one Citie. For hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that when the Catharists, that is, Puritans or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatians, returned to the Catholike Church, those who were of the clergy should retaine their degree, as hee that was a Deacon or a Presbyter should so continue, and likewise a Bishoppe (for euen the Puritanes or Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists themselues had their Bishoppes) if there were not another alreadie in the Catholike Church. But if there were a Bishoppe of the Catholike Church alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, then it is manifest <note n="c" place="margin">

the Catharists shall haue the honour of a Presbyter: vnlesse it please the Bishop to communicate vnto him the honour of the name. But if that like him not, he shall finde him out either a <hi>Chorepiscopus,</hi> that is, a country Bishops, or a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters place, that still he may be retained in the clergy, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>In Phil.</hi> 1.1.</note>, <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, Ambrose, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> on Phil. 1. All which (I confesse) liued after the two hundred yeeres: but they testifie, that in the Apostles times there could be no more Bishops then one. And the like hath <hi>Primasius</hi> on the same place.</p>
               <p>To all this hee answers, that <q>
                     <hi>he will not greatly striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mens deuices:</hi>
                  </q> which no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>withstanding he can neuer proue to bee humane; and I trust the singularity of preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in each of these Angels, in <hi>Timothy,</hi> in <hi>Titus,</hi> &amp;c. was no humane deuice.
But though he will not striue, yet he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth that little which hee was able, and that also more then himselfe doth beleeue to be true.
For he obiecteth that<q> Epiphanius and Eusebius also in his ecclesiasticall story, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon both Peter and Paul for Bishops of Rome at one time.</q>
Founders they both were of the Church of Rome, as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>

To what purpose then doth he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage that which himselfe is perswaded to be false? Would he haue his Reader beleeue that to be true, which himselfe beleeueth to be vntrue?</p>
               <p>That which he quoteth out of <hi>Athanasius</hi>

I would bee sory that hee should bee able with soundnesse of reason and euidence of truth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute any one sentence in the Sermon. All the refutation of this point, which hitherto wee haue had, was this: that I charged them with vntruths, that I threaten kindnesse on them, that I had need to be as eloquent as <hi>Pericles,</hi> if I could perswade that any of them haue said this, when as I haue brought foorth most plaine and euident al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations to this purpose.

               <p>Now because this point is of great moment,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> though the Refuter haue tripped ouer it so lightly, like a dog ouer a

Thus <hi>Ierome,</hi> if he agree not with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of some giddie heads, shall be judged wild-headed. And why so I pray you? For three reasons.
<hi>First, because</hi>
                  <q> Ierome in diuers places disputeth, and concludeth that BB. and Presbyters are equall by the word of God.</q>
Whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare, that this is all which <hi>Ierome</hi> in this cause saith, that <hi>Bishops, and Presbyters are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Scriptures.</hi> His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that before Bishops were ordained, the names <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus &amp; Presbyter</hi> were confounded, and the same men were called Presbyters, and Bishops; which I do not denie. But no wheres he saith, that Bishops and Presbyters were equall: for before BB. were ordained, he could not say that Presbyters and Bishops were equall: he saith they were the same. After Bishops were ordained, which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to haue been done in the Apostles times, and that by the Apostles, for which cause he calleth their institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>a tradition Apostolicall</hi>; he plainly confesseth, that one, who was chosen from among the Presbyters, and was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bishop of the Church, to haue been placed in a higher degree. But hereof we shall haue occasion hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10663:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to intreat more fully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His second reason:</hi>
                  <q> Ierome maketh Heraclas and Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius in Alexandria the first authors of aduancing one minister aboue another in power. <hi>The words are,</hi> Nam &amp; Alexandriae á Marco Euangelista vs<expan>

                  <hi>For euen at Alexandria euer since Mark the Euangelist, vntill the Bishops Heraclas and Dionysius, the Presbyters haue alwaies called one, being chosen out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and placed him in a higher degree, Bishop; euen as an armie chooseth their chiefetaine.</hi> Which words as so far from giuing the least inckling of the Refuters conceit, that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> should be the first authors of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Bishops, that they plainely declare the Bishops euer from Saint <hi>Marks</hi> time to <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> to haue been placed in a higher degree aboue the Presbyters, as the generall aboue the souldiours.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2.529.</note> And truely of the two, <hi>T. C.</hi> conceit, who collecteth the cleane contrarie to our refuter, hath the better glosse: for, he imagineth, that vntill <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> they who were chosen from among the Presbyters, were called Bishops, but then godly men mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking the appropriating of the name to one in a Church, ceased to call him so. And he might haue added with no lesse colour out of the words, that the Bishops till then had been placed in a higher degree aboue other ministers, but then good men misliking their aduancement aboue their fellow ministers, brought them a peg lower. To these conjectures the words would seeme to them that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not the right meaning thereof, (which heretofore I haue declared) to giue some colour of likelyhood, were it not that the practize of the Church did openly proclaime the contrarie.
Wherefore, of all collectors, my Refuter shal beare away the bell: For, he that can collect out of these words, <q>
                     <hi>Euer vntill Heraclas and Dionysius, the Bishop was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a higher degree,</hi> that <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> were the first that aduanced the Bishops, needs not doubt to collect,

                     <hi>Ad Euagr.</hi>
                  </note>His third reason that <q>
                     <hi>Ierome in the same Epistle doth teach the contrarie,</hi> is most false: For <hi>Ierome</hi> plainly confesseth the Bishop to be superiour in the power of ordination, and in the end concludeth, that <hi>what Aaron and his sonnes, and the Leuites were in the temple, the same let Bishops Presbyters, and Deacons, challenge to themselues in the Church.</hi>
                  </q>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§ 3.</note>
                  <hi>The Refuter hauing thus salued this testimonie of</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, <hi>in the end rejects it:</hi>
                  <q> For if this be true, that vnlesse the Bishop haue a peerelesse power, there will be as many Schismes in the Church, as there be Priests; then by the like reason Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine may argue, if there be not a peerelesse power giuen to the Pope, there will be as many Schismes in the Churches, as there ar Bishops.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>but this latter consequence is naught: so is the former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Ierome,</hi> on whose only authoritie among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the Disciplinarians in this cause relie, when he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any thing for the BB. his credit is no better with them, then if he had spoken for the Popes supremacie. But this is his desperate malice against the holy calling of Bishops, whereby he seeketh euery where to parallele the Christian superioritie of BB. with the Antichristian supremacy of the Pope. But all in vaine: For though it be true in <hi>Ieromes</hi> conceit, that if there were no Bishops, there would be as many Schismes almost as Priests; yet it doth not follow, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t if there were no Pope, there would bee as many Schismes as Bishops. For first, experience teacheth how to judge of this matter: for vntill the yeare 607. the Pope neuer attained to his supremacie; and yet the Church was more free from Schismes, before that time, then since, whereas contrariwise, when there were no Bishops for a short season, in the Apostles times, in most of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, euery one of the Presbyters, as <hi>Ierome</hi>

               <p>Secondly, there is great oddes betweene BB. and the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10663:229"/>
greatest number of Presbyters. One Bishop, say the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Africane councill <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Afr. c.</hi> 22. <hi>Carth. graec. c.</hi> 55.</note>, <hi>may ordaine many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but one man fit to be a Bishop is hard to be found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, before there was one supreme or vniuersall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, there was vnitie and communion betweene all the Bishops in Christendome, whose course to preserue vnitie in the Churches and to auoid Schisme, was to communicate the confessions of their faith one with an other by their communicatorie, pacificall or formed letters. And if any were in error, they sought first seuerally by their letters to reclaime them; and if they preuailed not, they assembled in Councils either to reduce them to vnitie, or to depose them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Li</hi> 4. <hi>Epist.</hi> 9.</note>, that the Catholike Church is one, not rent into Schismes nor diuided, but euery where knit togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>&amp; coharentium sibi inuicem Sacerdotum glutino copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata, and coupled with the glew</hi> as it were <hi>of Bishops agreeing mutually among themselues.</hi> And in another place <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Epist.</hi> 13.</note>, which before hath beene alledged; Therefore is the bodie of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops copious, coupled together with the glew of mutuall concord, and with the bond of vnitie, that if any of our companie shall be authour of an Heresie, &amp; shall endeuour to rend the flocke of Christ, and to make hauocke thereof, the rest may helpe &amp;c. Whereas contrariwise, if there were one supreme and vniuersall Bishop, whose authoritie were greater then of generall Councils, as the Papists teach; when he doth erre, who should reclame him, when he is exorbitant, who should reduce him into the way, when he shall draw with him innumerable troopes of soules into Hell, who may say vnto him, <hi>Domine, cur ita facis? Syr, why do you so?</hi> And as the Church is to be carefull for auoiding Schisme, and preseruation of itselfe in the vnitie of truth, which may be prouided for, as it was wont, yea, better then it was wont (where are Christian, and Orthodoxall magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates) by the BB. singularitie of preeminence in euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Church, and mutuall concord of them in the truth: so must it be as carefull to auoid conspiring &amp; consenting
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10663:230"/>
in vntruth. But where there is one supreme and vniuersall Bishop, when he erreth and goeth astray, he becommeth as we see in the Papacie, the head of a Catholike Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie from Christ. So that this pretended remedie against Schisme, causing a Catholike apostasy, is as much, or more, to be auoided then Schisme it selfe, the remedie being far worse then the feared maladie.</p>

                     <hi>Now at the last yet,</hi> saith he, (it seemeth that hee hath been long delaied, or that he hath greatly longed, in hope to do great matters, to deale in this matter of ordination) <hi>let vs see, how it is proued that Bishops must haue sole power of ordination.</hi>
                  </q>
But where good sir, do I say they must haue the sole power of ordination, which you haue so oft objected, and now againe do repeat? make you no conscience of publishing vntruthes? cannot BB. be superior to other ministers in the power of ordination, and jurisdiction, which is the thing which I maintaine, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they haue the sole power? or do I heere dispute what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10663:230"/>
Bishops must haue, when I onely shew what the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were wont to haue? If he shall say, that vnlesse they had the sole power of ordination, they had not the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie which our Bishops haue; I answer, that our BB. haue no more the sole power of ordination, then the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had. And this I added in the Sermon, that although the power of ordination was held in the primitiue Church to be so peculiar to Bishops, as that ordinarilie and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie the ordination was not thought lawfull, which was not done by a Bishop: yet it doth not follow, but that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, and in case of necessitie, Presbyters might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine. Howbeit, I must confesse, I am not able to alleage any approued examples thereof. If the Refuter can, which I do more then doubt of, he shall do well to produce them: it may tend to the credit of some other Churches, it cannot be preiudiciall to the cause which I maintaine</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore the Refuter doth alter the state of the question, making me to proue that which I did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, because he could not answeare that which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: I should neither wrong him, nor the Reader, If I vouchsafed him no further answeare in this point. But in very truth, he is so far from refuting the superioritie of Bishops in the power of ordination which J propounded, that he is not able to disproue their sole power, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath foisted into the question.</p>
               <p>For as touching my first argument;<note place="margin">§. 5. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 92. BB. superiour in the power of ordination. The 1. proofe.</note> whereas he frameth for me this consequence, <hi>It hath been the receiued opinion in the Church of God, euer since the Apostles times, that the right of ordination of Presbyters, is such a peculiar prerogatiue of Bishops, as that ordinarilie, and regularlie, there could be no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, but by a Bishop: therefore BB. haue sole authoritie of ordination,</hi> (he should haue said, therefore they are supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to other ministers in the power of ordination:) he passeth by this consequence, though he would faine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his Reader, that it is lyable to (he cannot tell what) just exception: and only insisteth on the antecedent, which is the assumption of his prolixe syllogisme.
<hi>But it is worth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10663:231"/>
the hearing, how he doth disproue it. Forsooth</hi>
                  <q> It halteth downe right, hauing no strength but from a false supposition (and so proued to be) that there were alwaies Diocesan Bishops.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Refuter, if he would haue said any thing to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Reader, should haue produced some approued example of ordination, either in the Apostles times, or since, performed by Presbyters without a Bishop; whereby he might haue disproued my assertion: but not being able so to doe, he betaketh himselfe to his ordinarie trade of answearing by meere cauillations. He talketh of a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, whereon the assumption is grounded; when as the speech is simple, and categoricall as they speake, and not hypotheticall; and the effect of his answeare is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of a supposition, but the taking away of the subiect of the question: as if he should say; <hi>Bishops were not, therefore they had not this power:</hi> For where he addeth <hi>Diocesan,</hi> that is spoken vnseasonably: for the question now is not what their authoritie was <hi>extensiuè</hi>: whether to a Diocese or not, which in this point is not materiall; but what it was <hi>intensiuè</hi> in respect of other ministers. By that starting hole therefore he cannot escape: especially, if it be added, that the supposition is not (as he vntruely saith) false: for that errour he will as I hope recant, when he shall haue read, what I haue alledged for the proofe of Dioceses and Diocesan Bishops. And whereas he saith, he hath proued it to be false; that also is vntrue: for he neuer went about it. <hi>Nec ausus est: nec potuit,</hi> onely he rejected it in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maner, as being so manifestly false, that he should not need to disproue it. But suppose for a little while, that the refuters, and the rest of the challengers conceit were true, that there were no Bishops but parishionall, and that the Presbyters joyned to them were lay elders: it would then be knowne, when the pastorall charge was voide, who did ordaine the new Bishop or Pastor. You will say, that is alreadie defined. It is one of the maine positions which the great challengers haue offred to prooue, <hi>that euery parish hath within it selfe authoritie to elect, ordaine depose, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10663:231"/>
their Minister</hi>: Not that the whole parish doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, but onely the Presbyterie. Very good: this then is the effect of the new Disciplinarians conceit, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ordination belongeth ordinarily neither to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, nor to other ministers, but to their Presbyterie consisting of lay elders. But if they can proue by any one approued example, that lay elders had euer, or at any time, right to ordaine, or to impose hands, I will yeeld in the whole cause.</p>
               <p>My second proofe he hath peruerted,<note place="margin">My second proofe.</note> proportioning it to his owne strength: for he should haue framed it thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If the power of ordination were not in the Presbyters of Ephesus and Creet, neither before <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were sent, but in the Apostles; nor after, but in the Bishops (that is to say, in <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and their successors); then the power of ordination is a prerogatiue peculiar to Bishops, wherein they are superior to other ministers.</p>
                  <p>But both the parts of the antecedent are true: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the consequent.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The former part of the antecedent I prooue by <hi>Pauls</hi> substituting <hi>Timothe</hi> at Ephesus, and <hi>Titus</hi> in Creet, to that end, that they might ordaine elders; notwithstanding that there were diuerse Presbyters in both those Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Whereto he answereth, that<q> it had been lawfull for the Presbyters, and people to haue ordained: but at the first, they were lesse fit for the purpose, then an Euangelist.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That the people sometimes haue had some stroake in election of their Bishops, I do not denie; but that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had any right to ordaine, can neuer be proued. That the Presbyters had right to haue done it, he should haue declared. But what Presbyters doth he speake of? mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? they I trust, if the new conceit be true, were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ech man to his own parish; neither might they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle in other parishes, euerie parish hauing suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authoritie within it selfe: neither can it be thought,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10663:232"/>
that the Presbyters of latter times should be fit, and that they which were ordained by the Apostles themselues, were not fit for the execution of their power? assuredly, if it were not fit for them to ordaine, but for <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>; by the same reason, neither is it fit for Presbyters after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but for Bishops, who succeeded <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> Jf he say, the lay Presbyters and the people had right to ordaine; he must first proue (which he will neuer be able to doe) that euer there were such Presbyters; and then he must proue, that they and the people had right to ordaine ministers: which when he hath performed, he may hope to proue any thing.</p>

                  <p>The latter part of the antecedent, I proue thus: Who were the successors of <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> for the gouernment of Ephesus and Creet, to them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their decease was their power of ordination de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued:</p>
                  <p>The Bishops of Ephesus and Creet were the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessours of <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> for the gouernment of those Churches, and not Presbyters. Therefore to the BB. and not to the Presbyters, was the power of Ordination deriued.</p>

Thus no part of my syllogisme is answeared, vnlesse it be the conclusion. But to answeare his reason, whereby he goeth about, <hi>

Neither is it greatly materiall, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force of this argument, whether they were Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, or Bishops: seeing the power which they had of ordination and jurisdiction, was not to dye with them; but to be transmitted to them, who should succeed them in the

gouernment of the Church. Now that the Bishops of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> and so of all other Churches, did succeed <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and other Apostolicall men, who were the first gouernors of the Churches; is a most certaine truth, as the singular succession of Bishops in those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the Apostles times, doth ineuitably euince. But hereof I shall haue better occasion hereafter to speake. Now that the Presbyters were not their successors, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: for they had the selfesame authoritie (and no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) vnder the Bishops, who were successors to <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> which before they had vnder them.

                  <p>If there be but two expositions which are giuen of the word Presbyterie, neither whereof doth fauour their presbyteries; then the authoritie of their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries cannot be concluded out of this place. But neither of the two expositions do fauour their Presbyteries:</p>
                  <p>Therefore their authoritie cannot be concluded hence.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:10663:233"/>The exceptions which he taketh against this answere are very friuolous. As first
<q>, that how many expositions soeuer any text in the conceit of men may admit, the holy ghost except by way of allegorie intendeth but one.</q>
Be it so: but yet there may be question, which of the diuerse expositions which be giuen, is the sense of the holy Ghost: vnlesse that must needs be alwaies the meaning of the holy Ghost, which the refuter fancieth. For my part, I did not take vpon me to determine, whether sense is the more likely: Jt was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for me, that whereas there be but these two exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are or can be giuen, neither of both maketh for the pretended Presbyteries. His first exception therefore is to no purpose.</p>
               <p>Now that the former exposition vnderstanding by <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterium</hi> the Priest-hood or office of a Presbyter, maketh nothing for their Presbyteries, it is more then euident. And that this exposition, which so plainly defeateth their Presbyteries, is very probable; I shewe first, because the word is in that sense oft vsed, though not in the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, yet in greeke writers of the Church. It suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Refuter, that it is not vsed in that sense in any other place of Scripture: and yet himselfe saying that the word is no wheres else vsed in all the Scriptures, doth as much prejudge his own exposition, as this. How be it I do not deny, but the worde is else where vsed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; onely this I say, that there is no other place, wherein it can be drawne to signifie the Christian Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, meaning either the company of Presbyters, or the office of a Presbyter. This then being the onely place where it is so vsed, we must not expect parallele places in the Scripture to confirme either sense. Secondly I shew that this may be the sense, because not onely diuerse in former times as <hi>Ierome, Primasius, Anselmus, Haymo, Lyra,</hi> but <hi>Caluin</hi> also doe so expound it.
To this his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is worse then friuolous, that though these writers doe so expound it, yet<q> 
                     <hi>Doctor Bilson doth not say that therefore it may be so vnderstood.</hi> And why so I pray you?
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10663:233"/>
because he confesseth <hi>that Chrysostome, Theodoret and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graecians expound it of the persons which did ordaine, not of the function whereto Timothe was ordained.</hi>
                  </q> Doth not Doctor <hi>Bilson</hi> say it may be so vnderstood, when more then once he mentioneth it as one of the receiued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of that place, approued by <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe the chiefe patron (for I must not say founder) of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Discipline?
neither doth his relating of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes exposition proue that he rejecteth the other; no more, then his alledging of <hi>Ieromes</hi> interpretation doth argue, that he refuseth that of Chrysostomes: but reciting both <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 129.252</note> indifferently he referreth it to the Readers choise whither to embrace.</p>
               <p>But let vs heare how the Refuter confuteth this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.<note place="margin">§. 8. The former exposition, of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, viz.</hi> that it may signifie the office of a Presbyter, defended.</note>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The exposition of Ierome, Primasius, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme; Haymo is not to be rested vpon; because where Paul saith the grace giuen by Prophecie, they say, the grace of Prophecie, plainely mistaking the Apostle:</hi>
                  </q> as who should say, because they mistooke the meaning of the word Prophecie, therefore they erred in expounding the word Presbyterie, by which reason we may argue that hee which mistaketh some one thing, vnderstadeth nothing aright.
What if the refuter himselfe doth mistake? for it is not all one to say the gift giuen <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and <q>
                     <hi>according to former Prophecies</hi>
                  </q>, as he expoundeth it. But by Prophecie, is, by the Reuelation and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the holy Ghost; whereby the Bishops, who were ordained by the Apostles, were designed and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. But what if they did not mistake? might not they meane by the gift of Prophecie, the gift which was giuen by Prophecie? yea, was not the gift of Prophecying, and preaching aright, which <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth him not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect (for he continueth the exhortation begun in the words going before <note n="b" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13.</note> attend to reading, exhortation and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) the gift which was giuen him by Prophecie at his ordination? <hi>Certes, Bullinger</hi> thinketh the words may so be vnderstood. <hi>Donu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quod tibi delegatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est ad prophet andum.</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:10663:234"/>
and this is all which <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, <hi>Prophetiae gratiam habebat tum ordinatione Episcopatus.</hi> But what if some of them did not call it the grace of Prophecie? <hi>Anselmus</hi> hath no such words, but calleth it <hi>gratiam Episcopalis of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But be it, that their exposition were not to be rested in, because of their other mistaking; what is this to <hi>Lyras</hi> and <hi>Caluins</hi> exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the same? What more? <q>
                     <hi>The three last, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmus, Haymo, and Lyra follow Ierome hand ouer head: For though they expound the word of the office, yet they reade it not Presbyterij, but Presbyteri.</hi>

                  <note n="d" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</note>, <hi>who imposed hands vpon him: for so Peter and Iohn call themselues in their Epistles.</hi> So that he readeth <hi>Presbyterij</hi>; though in one of his expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations he expoundeth it, as if the Apostle by <hi>Presbyterij,</hi> did meane <hi>Presbyteri.</hi> The ordinarie glosse indeed readeth <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> but so doth not <hi>Lyra</hi>: For expounding the word, he saith, <hi>Est autem Presbyterium,</hi> the Presbyterie is the dignitie or office of a Presbyter, <hi>&amp; accipitur hic Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterium pro Episcopatu and Presbyterie or Priesthood here is taken for the office of a Bishop.</hi> Thus you see how faithfully he hath dealt with these authors.

said</hi>;
<q>Endeuour that the grace which by imposition of hands thou didst receiue when I made thee Presbyter, be not in vaine: <hi>he saith thus,</hi> that Caluin in his former writings, leaued to that sense of the word, I deny not: but in his latter times, and namely in his Commentary on that place, though he say that exposition is not much <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <p>

For first he would make the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beleeue, that <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement in his Institutions, is the opinion of his younger head, and that his iudgement in his Commentary is to be preferred, as proceeding from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per yeeres. It would therefore first be knowne, whether that edition of his Institutions, which I alleaged set forth by himselfe, or his Commentaries on the Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> be the latter. Is it not euident that he wrote that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentary in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, whiles the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing? Whereas that edition of his Institutions, was set forth by him in the time of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Againe, where <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement seemeth to vary, who doubteth but that is to be esteemed his setled iudgement wherein he rested, which is set downe in the Jnstitutions, whereunto himselfe doth referre his Reader for this purpose: being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a most accurate and elaborate worke, often reuiewed, and polished by him? And therefore though the first draught of his Institutions was made in his younger daies, which in processe of time he did by little and little bring to perfection; yet the last edition much differing from the first, is as it were his last resolution, for those things which are contained therein. Whereas therefore of the two senses, which in his Commentaries he giueth of the word Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, misliking neither, he maketh choice in his Institutions of that which vnderstandeth the office, and plainely reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the other, which thereby vnderstandeth the Colledge of Presbyters, and that to proue, that sometimes no more then one did impose hands, which hee confirmeth by the Apostles owne testimony, who saith, that himselfe and no

more did impose hands on <hi>Timothy,</hi> and that the grace which was giuen him, was by the imposition of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, it cannot be denied, that <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement wherein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, was, that by the Presbytery, not the Colledge, but the office is meant.</p>

For he might as well require the words in Greeke and Latine, to be set downe in the order of construction, as to make the order of words in Greeke and Latine sentences to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the English. Howbeit, this exception is against his owne conceit, of the traiection of the words; it toucheth not the exposition of <hi>Ierome, Caluin,</hi> and the rest, which is without traiection.</p>
               <p>In his conclusion, where he bids me <q>
                     <hi>forbeare to bleare the eyes of the Readers with an exposition against reason, and mine owne conscience</hi>
                  </q>; he wrongeth me egregiously, and not me alone, but all the Authors whom I alleaged.
For first, I did not deliuer this as my exposition, but faithfully recited the interpretation giuen by these Authors. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if I had rested in this interpretation, as I did not, (though I see no reason why I may not) why should it be counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason, and against co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science in me, which I receiued from so approued Authors? But what a contumely is this to <hi>Ierome, Caluin,</hi> and the rest, whose exposition it is, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the testimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> to say, they bleare the eies of their Readers with an exposition against reason, and their owne conscience? I wish the Refuter, vnlesse his iudgement were better, to forbeare to condemne other mens expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as void of reason: and vnlesse his knowledge were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not to measure other mens conscience by his owne.

Which sheweth, that if any Presbyters did ioyne with <hi>Paul,</hi> it was no otherwise then as they vse to doe with BB. by the Canon <note n="n" place="margin">

And this answereth the first thing which the Refuter inferreth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this exposition, that <q>
                     <hi>if Presbytery signifie a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of seniors, as it must</hi> (for J tell you his word must stand for law) <hi>then it will follow that the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was not in one mans hand alone.</hi>
                  </q>
For though that <hi>alone</hi> bee of his owne adding, yet it is plaine, that <hi>Paul</hi> and antient BB. had this power as much <hi>alone,</hi> as our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes.</p>
               <p>Where I say, this place maketh nothing either for their parish Presbyteries, or lay Presbyteries whatsoeuer, hee saith,<note place="margin">§ 11.</note>

Besides, it skilleth something, that the Greeke Fathers vnderstand by <hi>Presbytery,</hi> a company of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: which, as it proueth the Prerogatiue of BB. in the ordaining of BB. so doth it not impeach their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie in ordaining Ministers.

                     <hi>But if they were not Presbyters,</hi> saith he, <hi>then was the Apostle to blame to call them so.</hi> 
                  </q>If the word bee vnderstood <hi>collectiuè,</hi> hee calleth the company of them which imposed hands on <hi>Timothy, the Presbytery.</hi>
And forasmuch as not onely inferior Ministers, but Bishops and Apostles are called Presbyters, it being a common name to all Ministers of the word and sacraments, it should not seeme strange that a company or senate of Bishops, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall men, should be called a Presbytery. Now that they were not meere Presbyters, the Fathers proue: <hi>Because Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters might not ordaine a Bishop: neque enim fas erat,</hi> saith <hi>Ambrose</hi>

But the Fathers that before I mentioned, take it for granted: and it is the generall consent of all the antient Fathers, as wee shall heare; the authoritie of some one whereof, in a matter of fact, ought to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the whole nation of Disciplinarians contradicting the same.</p>

               <p>But let me aske the Refuter this question: Seeing it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10663:238"/>
vpon by all, that <hi>Paul</hi> here speaketh of <hi>Timothy</hi> his ordination: to what function hee thinketh he was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? If to be a Presbyter, or Pastor, as <hi>Caluin</hi> saith, or to be a Bishoppe, as all the Fathers acknowledge, then was hee not onely ordained to an ordinary function in the Church, but also assigned to a particular Church, whereof hee was made Pastor, as <hi>Caluin</hi> speaketh, or Bishoppe, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirme. But that his last ordination, whereof the Apostle speaketh, was not to the degree of a Presbyter, but of a Bishoppe, appeareth by the whole Epistle; wherein his singularity of preeminence ouer Presbyters, and superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority in power both for ordination and iurisdiction, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed. If he say, that he was ordained to be an Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, to omit the singularity &amp; the nouelty of the conceit; it would be knowne what Presbytery this was, that imposed hands on <hi>Timothy.</hi> Had the Presbytery of any parish (such as our Disciplinarians dreame of, consisting for the most part of laymen) or the Presbytery of any particular Church, though consisting wholly of Ministers, authority by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands to ordaine an extraordinary function, and that to be exercised in other parts of the world, where them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues had nothing to doe?</p>

Yea but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Carthage (say they) commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth authority of imposing hands to Presbyters,<note place="margin">The obiection out of Conc.

               <p>Here the Refuter meaning to make short worke, hauing little to say, hath made a long section, which he might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter haue diuided into three. For three diuers things are heere performed. The first, an answere to the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our of the fourth Councell of Carthage. The second, a new supply of proofes for the superiority of BB. in the power of ordination. Thirdly a preuention of popish cauils,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10663:238"/>
in fauor of some reformed Churches, where the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian discipline is established.</p>
               <p>As touching the first, the Refuter saith, <q>
                     <hi>that canon may serue to shew,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ad pag</hi> 95.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Fathers of this Councell thought it not fit, no not to leaue ordination to the Bishop alone.</hi>
                  </q> But because he perceiueth, by that which I answered, that that Canon, though greatly vrged by the Disciplinarians, maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against the superiority of BB. in ordaining, and that it agreeth with the discipline of our Church, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conuicteth him of vntrue dealing:
(seeing he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that BB. by that canon haue not sole authority of ordaining, and yet will make his Reader beleeue, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their sole power of ordaining: which by the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of our Church, is no more sole in our BB. then it was by that canon in the BB. of <hi>Africke</hi>:) for thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> causes, I say, he refuseth to vrge this canon:
though hee pretend, hee <q>
                     <hi>will neither trouble the Reader, nor himselfe about the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of it; because,</hi> forsooth, <hi>it commeth not neere the time in question.</hi>
                  </q> Perhaps his conscience told him, that he knew of no testimony nor example of the Presbyters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the B. in ordination, before that time:
and that in the foresaid Councell, their assistance to the B. in ordaining, was first ordained: which if it did, as worthily it might, then had he no reason to vrge that canon to proue the practise of the Church in the first two hundred yeeres in a particular, which by that canon was first appointed.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus remoued their two maine obiections which stood in my way,<note place="margin">§. 13. Other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the BB. right in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining.</note> I proceeded in the proofe of my former as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, that the right of ordination was in the iudgement of the antient Church appropriated to BB. As first, that the Councels and Fathers speake of the ordainer as of one, and consequently presuppose the right of ordaining to bee in one, which I proued by foure testimonies. This reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Refuter did not well see how to answere, he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by it, as if hee had not seene it. To make it therefore more conspicuous, I will inlarge it; affirming, that both Scriptures, Councels, and Fathers speake of the ordainer as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10663:239"/>
of one. <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained by the imposition of <hi>Pauls</hi>

                  <hi>Aerius</hi> being a giddie-headed fellow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he perceiued the Presbyters to doe the same things, that the Bishops did in some particulars; by an insufficient enumeration or induction, concludeth, that therfore there was no difference betweene them. The parts of <hi>Aërius</hi> his induction concerne the superioritie and preeminence of the Ministerie in generall aboue the people, noting those things whch be common to Bishops, with other ministers, as their imposing hands on the penitent, their giuing of Baptisme, their executing of Diuine seruice, their sitting in the chaire or pulpit to instruct the people; but conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the respect which was between the Bishop and the Presbyters themselues. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> therefore sheweth, that although it were true, that Bishops and Presbyters did the same things, which argue their Preeminence in common aboue the Laity: yet this hindreth not, but that Bishops were superiour to the Presbyters: and this <hi>Epiphanius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by two instances, which <hi>Aërius</hi> himselfe could not denie: because the Bishops were ordainers of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, hauing the power of ordination of Presbyters and Deacons, which Presbyters had not; the second, because the Bishops were also gouernours and judges ouer Presbyters.

<q>For where <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were not able to beget Fathers: he asketh, <hi>What hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth them, but the vsurpation of Bishops?</hi>

In which words, two things are implied: The first, that the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which the BB. haue, is vsurped by them: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that Presbyters haue as good right to ordaine as they. But you will say, how are those things proued? you must be intreated to take them vpon his word: for proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e he hath none: and yet can he by no meanes abide begging of the question. But such is the boldnesse of our new Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinarians, that they doubt not to prefer their new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled opinions, &amp; self-set assertions, which haue no ground nor warrant in the word of God, or true reason, before the judgement and practize of all the ancient Fathers, of all the approued Councils, of all true Christian Churches of former times. We proue, that the Apostles had the right of ordaining; that this right was from them deriued to their substitutes, and to their successors; to their substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, as to <hi>Timothe</hi> in Ephesus, and <hi>Titus</hi> in Creet, to <hi>Mark</hi> at Alexandria, to <hi>Polycarpus</hi> at Smyrna, to <hi>Euodius</hi> at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, to <hi>Linus</hi> at Rome, &amp;c. to their successors, as to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> the successor of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> at Ierusalem, &amp;c. that from these substitutes and first succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the Apostles, the same was deriued to their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, which without all doubt were the BB. of the seuerall Churches. And hereunto we adde the generall consent of the Fathers, and Councils; many of them affirming and confirming, not one, I say not one, denying the superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of BB. in ordaining: the perpetuall practize of all true Christian Churches, not one approued instance to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the contrarie: and yet he shameth not to auouch the Bishops right in ordaining to be but vsurpation. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Presbyters, that they haue right to ordaine, we see no
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10663:243"/>
warrant in the word, but rather the contrarie; no testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Fathers, no decree of Councils for it, but many testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and decrees against it; no approued example to warrant it; how then could he say the Presbyters haue as good right to ordain as BB<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But because he shal not cary the matter without proofes, this I will offer him; that if he can bring any one pregnant testimonie or example out of the Scriptures, any approued authoritie or example out of the ancient Fathers, Councils or Histories of the Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that the Presbyters had by and of themselues an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie power or right to ordaine ministers, J meane Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and Deacons; I will promise to subscribe to his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.

               <p>Againe, whereas <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the assumption saith, that BB. beget Fathers, meaning that they haue power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ministers of the word, and sacraments, or as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth himselfe,<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>that ministers are no spirituall Fathers vntill they beget children vnto God.</hi>
                  </q> Why, but their calling is to be spirituall Fathers, ordained of God to this end, that they may by the lauer of regeneration &amp; ministery of the Gospell beget children vnto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when <hi>Stephen</hi> said <note n="b" place="margin">

euen so BB. are said to beget Fathers, because by ordination they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get such, as by the institution of their calling, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, are to be spirituall Fathers.<note place="margin">§. 19. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 96.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much of the assumption.
The proposition also he denieth, finding great fault with me, saying, that<q> it is a strange and fearefull thing that I hauing so worth: he set out in my former Sermon the excellencie of the ministers calling in regard of his labouring in the word, doe now turne all topsey tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

God, is more pretious then to beget a thousand Fathers to the Church, and of more comfort at the day of iudgement, &amp;c.</q>
But be of good comfort, this fault which he layeth to my charge, is but as he saith, <q>
                     <hi>in his poore vnderstanding</hi>
                  </q>. For there be three things which shew the pouertie of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt. The first, that he thinketh I do therefore preferre the ordaining of Ministers before preaching, because I say that Bishops are superiour to other ministers in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ordination. It seemeth he hath not learned the distinction of those three things wherein superioritie consisteth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, excellencie, imperie, and power. The magistrate is superior to the minister, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, and ciuill authoritie; but the minister notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is superior to the magistrate in excellencie. But the second thing doth much more shew the shallownesse of his conceipt: he conceiueth of ministers, as hauing alone the power of preaching; and of Bishops, as hauing onely the power of ordination: whereas if he had but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that the authoritie of preaching is common to the Bishop with other ministers, and the Bishop in respect of his office superior in the exercise; because he may licence, and he may vpon just occasion suspend this power in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (though perhaps in personall gifts the Presbyter may excell the Bishop:) he could not but haue discerned the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie of Bishops, without any disparagement to the ministerie of the word; for that they being at least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in (respect of their function) to other ministers in the power of preaching, are superior in the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining. The third, that he conceiueth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to haue made a comparison betweene preaching, and ordaining, which he doth not,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heres.</hi> 75.</note> but betweene baptizing, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. How is it possible, saith <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that a Bishop and a Presbyter should be equall? <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>For the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Bishops is an order generatiue of Fathers, begetting Fathers to the Church; but the order of Presbyters being not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10663:244"/>
able to beget Fathers, doth by the lauer of regeneration</hi> (that is baptisme) <hi>beget children to the Church, and not Fathers, verily, or teachers.</hi> And you are to marke how he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of begetting Fathers and children to the Church. And who can denie, but that it is a matter of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, the begetting of a Father to the Church, then of a child? But <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his meaning was, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop hauing power of baptizing common to them with Presbyters,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> had, though he did not greatly vse it, whereby they might beget children to the Church; hath also the power of ordaining, (which Presbyters haue not) whereby he begetteth spirituall Fathers to the Church. And so much of <hi>Epiphanius.</hi>

Act. 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. So the name Presbyter, to Apostles, and Bishops: as 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.

And this is <hi>Ieromes</hi> first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Presbyters are superiour to Deacons. But hence it doth not follow, that therefore the offices of a Bishop, and Presbyter, are confounded; especially, after the institution of a Bishop. Doth <hi>Ierome</hi> thinke, that euerie Presbyter is equall in degree with <hi>Timothe,</hi> because the office of <hi>Timothe</hi> in <hi>Ieromes</hi> vnderstanding is called <hi>Presbyterium</hi>? or that they are equall with <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> because they called themselues Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters? His second argument to prooue the superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Presbyters aboue Deacons, is, because Bishops were chosen out of Presbyters, and by Presbyters; whereas contrariwise, he that is chosen from among Deacons, by Deacons, is but an Archdeacon. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part he first illustrateth by the end, which was to auoid Schisme; and then prooueth it by the Practise of the Church of Alexandria. In his setting downe the end, he lets fall one word, which if it be not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourablie expounded, will make him contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and the truth. For vpon the allegation of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> second and third epistle he saith, <hi>Quòd autem poste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> vnus electus,</hi> that one afterwards was chosen
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10663:245"/>
who should be set ouer the rest, it was prouided as a remedie against Schisme, lest euerie one drawing after him should rend the Church of Christ. What say you <hi>Ierome,</hi> were Bishops first ordained after Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time? doe not your selfe testifie that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> a little after the ascension of Christ was by the Apostles made Bishop of Ierusalem, that <hi>Marke</hi> was Bishop of Alexandria? that euer since his time (and he dyed almost 40. yeares before Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) there hath beene a Bishop, in a degree su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to other Presdyters? that <hi>Timothe</hi> was Bishop of Ephesus &amp;c. That word <hi>afterwards</hi> therefore, is not to be referred to Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time, but to those testimonies where he prooued the name <hi>Episcopus</hi> to be giuen to Presbyters; which custome, as he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, continued, vntill one of the Presbyters, beeing chosen from among the rest, was called Bishop: for indeed whiles Apostles or Apostolicke men were made BB., BB. were called the Apostles of the Churches: But when out of the Presbyters one was chosen, he began for difference sake to be called, <hi>the Bishop, the Angell</hi> of the Church. Now that BB. were chosen out of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and by Presbyters, he prooueth by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Church at Alexandria: For euen at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, from <hi>Marke</hi> the Euangelist vnto <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> BB. (who were not chosen from among the Presbyters) the Presbyters haue alwaies called one, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from among themselues, and placed in a higher degree, the Bishop: euen as if an army doe choose their generall, or Deacons choose from among themselues one, whom they know to be industrious, and call him the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon.</p>
               <p>His fourth argument is this. There be many things which a Bishop by the power of his order may doe, which a Deacon cannot: but there is nothing which a Bishop may doe by the power of order, excepting ordination, which a Presbyter may not doe. A Presbyter is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by so much superior to a Deacon, by how much he is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:10663:246"/>
nearer to the Bishop: this is the verie scope of this place, and to the same are all the arguments following referred &amp;c. the summe whereof is, that the Presbyterie is a degree betweene the Bishops, and Deacons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§. 21.</note>You see then what <hi>Ierome</hi> prooueth out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; not that the office, but the name of Bishop, and Presbyter were for a time confounded.
<q>
                     <hi>Now let vs see what he prooueth</hi> by the practise of the Church at Antioch: <hi>he would say at Alexandria,</hi> that of old a Bishop, and a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter were all one.</q>
See you not how he prooueth it, when he saith, that euer since <hi>Marks</hi> time the Bishop hath beene <hi>placed in a higher degree aboue the Presbyters?</hi> Was this to prooue that a Bishop, and Presbyter are equall, or all one? or did <hi>Ierome</hi> intend any thing else, but to prooue the Presbyters superiour to Deacons, and that by such arguments as before I analysed?
We haue heard what <hi>Ierome</hi> prooueth out of the Scriptures, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Church at Alexandria; now at the last, let vs heare the end of his speech.<q> 
                     <hi>That he</hi> (I know not who) <hi>might see, that in his time also there remained a proofe thereof, because a Bishop euen then did nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ordination which a Presbyter could not doe.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Toto coelo errat</hi>: it was not <hi>Ieromes</hi> end, to prooue the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter equall with the Bishop, but superiour to the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con: For if the former had beene his intent; this, and the other from the practise of Alexandria: had beene very vntoward arguments to prooue his purpose. At Alexandria the Bishop euer since <hi>Marks</hi> time was supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Presbyters in degree, therefore they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. The Bishop is superiour in the power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore Presbyters be his equals.
Hath not the Refuter now great cause, thinke you, to crake of this answere? was this, among all the testimonies which I alledged, chosen as most misalledged, by occasion whereof, he <q>

of truth, that among all my allegations, the refuter hath not beene able to charge mee with misalledging any one. As for this; nothing could bee more pregnant, and pertinent to proue, that BB were superiour to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in ordination, then as I said in the sermon, that <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe, euen when, and where he seeketh to aduance the Presbyters, as high as hee can, aboue the Deacons; doth confesse ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be peculiar to Bishops.</p>

               <p>It is true, that some Popish writers make BB. and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to be but one order; but you must withall take the reason of that Popish conceipt: They hold, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the altar (as they call it) is the Sacrament of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, whereunto the Sacrament of orders is subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note n="h" place="margin">2.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> doth somewhat ridiculously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish their 7. orders, according to their diuers offices referred to that Sacrament. And forasmuch as in the whole power of order this is the supreme act, by pronouncing the words of consecration to make the very body of Christ, which is as well performed by a Priest, as a Bishop: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they teach <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Suppl. q.</hi> 40.5.</note>, that Bishops, and Priests are both of one order; and that the order of Bishops, as it is a Sacrament, is not superior to that of Presbyters, but only as it is an office, in respect of certaine sacred actions; &amp; in this sense, saith <hi>Thomas,</hi> that the Bishop hath power in sacred and Hierarchicall actions in respect of Christs mysticall body aboue the priest, the office of a Bishop is an order. For you must vnderstand that they make al Ecclesiasticall power to haue referrence to the <note n="k" place="margin">

               <p>This new Popish conceipt therefore of confounding Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters into one order, ariseth from their idol of the Masse, &amp; their doctrine of transubstantiation, wherby euery Priest is as able to make his maker, as the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.

                  <note place="margin">§. 24. That BB. are superiour in the power of order.</note>Wherefore laying aside these popish conceipts, let vs consider what is to bee determined concerning this matter according to the truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first, that ecclesiasticall power is to bee distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed into the power of order and iurisdiction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the power of order is a spirituall power, whereby ecclesiasticall persons are qualified and enabled to doe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred actions appertayning to the seruice of God and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, which they who are not of the same order at the least, may either not at all, or not ordinarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this power is that which is granted to ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical persons in their ordination, and appertaineth to them as they simply are of that order, though they haue no iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or charge, and therfore cannot be taken from them whiles they continue in that order.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That of Ecclesiasticall order there are three degrees, in Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons: and because neither of the two superiour orders may be granted to any <hi>per saltum</hi>: therfore each superiour order includeth the inferiour, so that a presbyter may doe that which belongeth to a Deacon, and a Bishop that which belongeth to to a presbyter, but not contrariwise.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:10663:248" rendition="simple:additions"/>5. That the power of the order of Presbyters is besides the performance of the diuine liturgy and power to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the sacrament of Baptisme and to preach, common to them with Deacons (who shall be thereunto authorized by the B.) a power also to minister the holy communion, and authority to remit and retaine the sinnes of men: which last I doe not doubt to referre to the power of order. First, because it is giuen to the minister in his ordination, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to him as he is simply a Presbyter, without iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or relation to a charge. And secondly, because it continueth with him whiles he is of the order, though his charge and iurisdiction should be taken from him. Besides, this power of remitting and retaining sinnes is called the key of order, and according to the Popish doctrine <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bell. de pont. R l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the conferring of the sacrament of penance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The power of order in B.B (besides all this power which is in the Presbyters) is power by imposition of hands to conuey grace <note n="o" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</note>, as the ordinary instrument of the holy ghost, either to parties baptized for their confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or to penitents, for their reconciliation; or to parties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the ministery, for their ordination. As touching the former, the ancient writers gather it to bee peculiar to BB. because howsoeuer many in the primitiue Church were conuerted and baptized by men of inferiour order, yet the Apostles alone, and after them the BB. had authority to put their hands vpon them that they might receiue the holy Ghost. Acts. 8. &amp; 19.</p>
               <p>And for the latter, we read, that both the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and such as they ordained Bishops, did ordaine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters by imposition of hands: insomuch that whereas at Ephesus and in Creet (where were diuers Presbyters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>Timothy and Titus</hi> were appointed to ordaine mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>I hold this authority to impose hands to belong to the power of order:<note place="margin">§ 25.

               <p>I say it is a sacred action of spirituall efficacie, consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a man to the seruice of God in the Ministery, conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him the power of that order whereunto hee is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, whereby he is qualified to performe sacred actions of spirituall and supernaturall efficacie. Wherefore I doe not see, why the power of begetting spirituall Fathers to the Church by ordination, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speaketh, should not be thought to belong to the power of order in BB. euen as the begetting of sonnes to the Church by baptisme, to the power of order in all Ministers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because this power is conferred vpon each Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in their consecration, and belongeth to him as being a Bishop simply, and cannot be taken from him whiles he remaines a Bishop, though his Bishopricke be taken from him, and may be exercised by him, where he hath no iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Whereof examples might be produced of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Eusebius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vercellensis,</hi> and other godly Fathers, who when they were turned out of their Bishoprickes, and others placed in their roomes, not onely retained their power, but also exercised the same, as occasion was offered in other Churches.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because all ecclesiasticall power, being referred either to the power of order or of iurisdiction, this must therefore be referred to the power of order, because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be referred truly to the power of iurisdiction: and that for these two reasons: both because the Bishop cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this power to others, as he may iurisdiction: and also because he doth not lose it with his iurisdiction, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth it when his Bishopricke is taken from him, and may as well exercise it without his diocesse, where he hath no iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, as another Minister may preach or baptize out of his owne parish.</p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:10663:249"/>Whenas therefore I expounded <hi>Ierome</hi> and some others, who say the B. is superior to the Presbyters onely in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as not meaning that he is not superiour also in the power of iurisdiction, but that in respect of the power of order, he was superior onely in the right of ordaining; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause whereas other parts of the power of order be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with Presbyters, that of ordaining is his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar right and prerogatiue, I did not speake without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. Contrariwise the Refuter, as in laying to my charge that I confound the power of order with ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he spake he knew not what: so in the inference which he bringeth vpon his former words, hee pratleth without vnderstanding.
<q>
                     <hi>Now if the power of ordination did belong properly to the office of BB. then were the BB. superior to the other Ministers potestate ordinis,</hi>

                        <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 97.</note> (but the former I haue manifestly proued, therefore the latter must be granted) <hi>but that is the question,</hi> saith he; as who should say, he were resolued to deny the conclusion.</q>
But heare him I pray you.
<q>Notwithstanding (to let him inioy his owne distinction) of BB. differ onely in ordination from Presbyters, quoad ordinis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatem, then in the power of iurisdiction, Presbyters are equall with them potestate ordinis, by the power of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Wherefore where afterwards he draweth vnto BB. the whole power of censuring vnder the name of potestas iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis, he maketh that to be adiuine, which is but an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane preeminence by his owne distinction. </q>All which is meere babling, without sense, or vnderstanding what he saith, as the Reader who vnderstandeth what I haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered concerning this distinction, will easily iudge.</p>
               <p>There remaineth the third part of this section; wherein out of a Christian and charitable desire to preserue the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of such reformed Churches as haue no BB. I endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to preuent the obiections of Papists,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> who reason thus against them: The right of ordination being peculiar to BB. it followeth, that where is no B. there is no ordination; where is no ordination, there are no Ministers; where are no Ministers, there is no Church. I answered, that although the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10663:250"/>
ordinary right of ordination belongeth to BB. in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the antient Church, that yet it was not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as so appropriating it to them, as that extraordinarily and in the case of necessitie it might not be lawfull for Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to ordaine, and much lesse teaching absolutely a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ordination, which is performed without a B. Which answer I confirmed by diuers reasons. Whereunto I now adde, that there seemeth to be the like reason for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, in confirmation of the baptized, in the reconciliation of publike penitents, as in the ordination of Ministers. But although the two former were reserued as well as the third, to the B. yet extraordinarily, in the case of necessity, and in the want or absence of the B. the antient Church held it lawfull for Ministers to impose hands either for the confirming of parties baptized, or for reconciliation of the penitents. The former is testified by <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>The thing which I was to prooue, if it had beene need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, was, that whereas Presbyters did gouerne each one the people of a parish, and that priuately, the Bishop go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth

the people of the whole diocese, and that publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: the which I held needlesse to prooue, because before it was prooued, that they had the charge of the whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocese, and were Pastors thereof: And secondly, because if I prooue they gouerned the Presbyters, who were the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the seuerall flockes, then much more their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction did extend to the flockes themselues.
Where he saith, J must <q>

                  </q>; I answer, it is sufficient to prooue their superioritie in iurisdiction, which I intended, and that none in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocese doth exercise externall iurisdiction, but from the B. and vnder him.
A notable euidence whereof wee haue in <hi>Siluanus</hi>

                  </q>, he seemeth to harpe vpon something, which hee doth not well vnderstand.
For although the Schoolemen and Papists <note n="h" place="margin">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10663:254"/>
censures ouer the people and clergy, before there were any lawes of Christian Magistrates to authorise or assist them thereunto.</p>
               <p>But he is pleased to see how I proue the BB. to haue been superior to the Presbyters in iurisdiction;<note place="margin">§ 6. Their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer the clergy.</note> though not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that I speake <hi>in generall of BB.</hi> for here his Coccysme againe hath place, that <q>
                     <hi>I should haue proued the Angels of the seauen Churches to haue had iurisdiction ouer ministers vnder them.</hi>
                  </q>
Which is a miserable poore shift indeed. Was not this the thing propounded to be proued, that the BB. of the primitiue Church were superior in iurisdiction? doth not himselfe confesse, that the ancient Churches were all of one Constitution? And is not the proofe of the generall, a proofe of the particular also? If I should say, these seauen Angels had this iurisdiction; some such exception of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity in them, would with as great reason be taken, as against <hi>Timothy and Titus.</hi> But when I proue, that BB. in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall had this superiority, I doe more then proue, that these seauen Bishops had it.</p>
               <p>The reason which I vse is an induction. The Bishop had superiority in iurisdiction both to the Presbyters, that were parts of the Presbytery assisting him, and to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors assigned to seuerall cures. Therefore he had superior iurisdiction to all the Presbyters in the diocesse. But the Refuter maketh me reason thus:
<q>
                     <p>If the Bishoppes had maiority of rule both ouer the Presbyters that assisted them, and also ouer the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors allotted to their seuerall charges, then had they power of iurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>But they had maiority of rule ouer the Presbyters, assisting them and the Pastors, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Therefore they had power of iurisdiction.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Why? Needes this to be proued, that Bishops had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of iurisdiction, which euery parish Minister hath? Or doth the Refuter deny, that Bishops had power of iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or if he cannot but grant the conclusion, what a folly is it to wrangle with the premises?
And yet for feare of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10663:255"/>
granting the conclusion, first hee pickes a quarrell with the proposition. <q>
                     <hi>For though they had maiority of rule, &amp;c. yet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll it not follow they had sole power of iurisdiction.</hi>
                  </q>
Whence commeth this <hi>sole</hi> I pray you, that hath so oft been foisted in? I feare greatly from an euill conscience, resolued to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne and deface the truth. Cannot the B. be superior to Presbyters in the power of iurisdiction, vnlesse they haue (as none haue) the sole power of iurisdiction?</p>

                  <note place="margin">§ 7. 1.

will these odious slanders wilfully deuised to disgrace the truth, which I taught, neuer bee left? and yet that is vntrue which he saith of the Duke of Venice, and that is more then we desire, that the B. in his diocese, should be like the King of Polonia in his kingdome.

Howbeit, both this and the former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere here are meere euasions. For suppose that (which I haue proued to be most false) that there were onely-gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning elders in Antioch, and that the Church had been but one parish, can he be so absurde asto say, that none of the Presbyters in Antioch were ministers? If any were (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were all as I haue abundantly proued before) is not the B. here plainely noted to be their gouernour? and if he were their gouernour, was he not aboue them in the power of iurisdiction or gouernment? Or what is this to the present question, whether the Church of Antioch contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one congregation or more, if it cannot be denied that the B. was superiour in the power of iurisdiction to the Presbyters of that Church, how great or how little soeuer it was?</p>
               <p>His third reason of all others is most impertinent.
For
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10663:256"/>
what is this to the purpose, if it were true, that <q>
                     <hi>the duty which Ignatius inioineth them of feeding,</hi> that is, of instructing and guiding the people, <hi>was not perpetually belonging to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but onely in the time of the vacancie, till they had another gouernour</hi>
                  </q>, seeing he noteth that himselfe had been, and his successour should bee their gouernour?
But it is vntrue which he saith, concerning the perpetuity of the duty. For <hi>Ignatius</hi> his meaning was, that as they were at all times to feed the people, so especially in the absence or want of the Bishop, the care and attendance of the flocke in the defect of a B. being deuolued to them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">§ 9.</note>

                     <hi>If M. D. doe vrge,</hi> saith he, <hi>that Ignatius was, and so also his successor their gouernour,</hi> (which was indeed the onely thing for which the place was alleaged, and to which point alone hee ought to haue directed his speech) <hi>the answere is easie, that he might be so, and yet the Church but a parish, and those Presbyters gouerning Elders.</hi> 
                  </q>An easie answere indeed: as who should say, though the allegation doe proue that for which you bring it, yet it doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue some other of our absurdities, for the disproofe whereof you do not bring it: as that the Church was a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and the Presbyters onely gouerning elders.
Was the disproofe of those points to be expected from this place, and at this time? do you not say, it is one of the places which is ordinarily brought out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> for proofe of onely-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning Elders? And must this be your shift to auoid my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, proouing out of this place the superiority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in the power of iurisdiction, that for any thing can hence be alleaged, the Presbyters might be onely gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Elders? Js not the Refuter neere driuen, thinke you, when he would beare his Reader in hand, that his lay Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters be sufficiently proued, if the place which themselues bring for them, doth not disproue them; but especially, when he is driuen to alleage this as a poore shift to auoid another thing in question?
Yea but if the Church were a parish, and they onely gouerning Elders, then was <hi>Ignatius</hi> but as a Parson of a parish: and <q>

But how I beseech you is it proued, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was but a parish Bishop? Because, forsooth, the Church of Antioch might be a parish, and the Presbyters thereof onely-gouerning Elders, for any thing that I haue here said to the contrary, which indeed I intended not in this place. But now I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne a worthy stratageme of this Refuter, in chusing rather to answere the places out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> being brought for superiority of Bishops, then himselfe to vrge them for the lay-elders: hoping to perswade some kind of Readers, both that their Elders are sufficiently proued, if they be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued out of the places which themselues doe bring to proue them: and also, that by such an answere, the superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Bishops is sufficiently auoided.

               <p>Hauing in generall shewed the Bishops superiority in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction ouer the Presbyters, euen those of the Citie; in this section J proue it more particularly by the parts of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are, both to rule and direct; as also to censure and correct. I shew therefore, that the Presbyters of the Citie were subiect to the Bishoppe, both as their ruler, to be guided and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rected by him, and also as their Iudge, to be censured and corrected of him. Where the Refuter, if he would needs be analysing and syllogising, should haue fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this argument:
<q>
                     <p>To whom the Presbyters were subiect, both as to their ruler, to be guided and directed by him; and as to their Iudge, to be censured and corrected of him, he was superior to them in the power of iurisdiction, and maiority of rule.</p>
                     <p>To the B. the Presbyters were subiect, both as to their ruler, to be guided and directed by him; and as to their Iudge to be censured and corrected of him.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the B. was superiour to the Presbyters in power of iurisdiction and maiority of rule.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition of this syllogisme is of euident &amp; vndeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth. The assumption consisteth of two parts: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer concerning the rule of direction, the latter concerning the power of correction: which I doe in order proue by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent testimonies, whereunto he opposeth nothing but ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling shifts and euasions.
By way of analysis he saith thus:<q>The former proofe of the assumption touching the Bishops maiority of rule, was generall, concerning diocesan and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishionall Presbyters. Now follow the reasons for each of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:10663:258"/>
them in particular: and first, for the Bishoppes iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer the diocesan, in regard of direction. Where I desire him to tell vs, what he meaneth by diocesan Presbyters, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such as assisted the Bishop in the diocesan gouernment?</q> If yea, hee dreameth of that hee cannot proue.
To omit the commendation of his skill in analysing, which is not great, his resutation heere is, as you plainely see, not onely a dreame, but the dreame of a dreame.
He saith,<q> 
                     <hi>I dreame of diocesan Presbyters</hi>
                  </q>, when himselfe (belike) did dreame so. Where speake I one word of diocesan Presbyters? where doe I once name them?
Is the Refuters conscience no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then still to father vpon mee vntruths for his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage? doth he not thereby bewray what a cause he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, which cannot be vpheld but by forgeries? Neither if J had spoken of diocesan Presbyters, would I haue vsed the word in that sense.

                     </note>But let vs see his reason, <hi>saith the Refuter.</hi> If the <hi>40.</hi> Canon of the Apostles saith he <hi>(I said, the ancient Canon,)</hi> if the Councels of Arles and Ancyra, Tertullian, Cyprian, and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius affirme, that BB. had maiority of rule for direction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Diocesan Presbyters, then they had such maiority. But all these affirme so: therefore they had so.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The former part of my <note n="e" place="margin">§ 10.</note> aforesaid Assumption, that the Presbyters of the City were subiect to the B. as their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to be directed by him, I proue, first in generall, because
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:10663:258"/>
they might doe nothing of importance without his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or consent, then particularly, in respect of those things which did belong to the power of their order. For as touching the former; if the Presbyters might doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the B. nothing without his appointment, or consent; then were they subiect to him, as their ruler, to be guided and directed by him. But the former I proue by these testimonies, whereto more may be added; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter cannot be denied.</p>
               <p>Of the Syllogisme which he framed, hee denieth first the Consequence of the proposition; not shaming to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that although the ancient Canon called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, though the auncient Councels of Ancyra and Arles, though <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> doe all testifie the maiority of rule in BB: yet it <q>
                     <hi>would not follow</hi>
                  </q> that they had it. It will follow then, that the ancientest Councels, and Fathers deserue no credit: which whosoeuer shall affirme, doth much more without comparison, deserue not onely no credit, but no audience, nay no sufferance, he is not to bee endured.
But what pretence hath hee, to discredite their authorities? forsooth <hi>none of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Tertullian and Ignatius liued in the first</hi> 200. <hi>yeares.</hi> 
                  <q>As if all truth were confined within that periode: or as if some of the Fathers which succeeded (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> by name) deserued not as much credite as they.</q>
As for <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> hee came 40. or 50. yeares after: and the Councell of Ancyry some 50. or 60. yeares after him. No doubt, but great alteration in discipline, and Church-gouernement, was or could be pretended to haue been in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Constatines</hi> time whiles it was vnder the Crosse. But let the Refuter esteeme of these authorities as hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth; there is no modest or moderate Christian, but will preferre the affirmation of any of these, especially, in a matter of fact, before the negation of a thousand such as the libelling refuter.</p>
               <p>After he hath thus eleuated their authority,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> hee cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with their testimonies, denying also the assumption.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10663:259"/>
And first to the ancient Canon,<note place="margin">Presbyters might doe nothing with out the leaue or consent of the Bishop.</note> forbidding Presbyters &amp; Deacons to doe anything <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Can. Apost.</hi> 39. <hi>al</hi> 40.</note>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and consent of the Bishoppe, hee frameth such an answere, as euery word whereof almost doth argue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame either vnconscionablenesse, or ignorance.
<q>
                     <hi>Hee saith,</hi> It doth not proue they had maiority of rule, or sole soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty ouer them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </q>
Sole soueraignity? O defiled consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which ceasest not to ascribe such odious and absurd assertions to me!
But why is not the maiority of rule in the Bishoppe hence proued, and the subiection of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to him as to their ruler, to bee guided and directed by him, seeing they are charged to doe nothing without his direction and warrant? what can bee more plaine? forsooth, <q>the like Phrase is vsed Can. <hi>35.</hi> and Conc. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och. c. <hi>9.</hi> where BB. are enioyned to doe nothing without the sentence of the Archbishoppe, nor he in their Parishes without the sentence or appointment of them all. If therefore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iority of rule in BB. may be proued from this Canon, then in like manner from the other two Canons, the maiority of rule not onely in Archbishops in those dayes ouer BB. but also of Bishops in their Parishes, ouer the Archbishop. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is false in both the parts of it: the former, for there were no Archbishops in those dayes; the latter, because BB. had not authority ouer Archbishoppes: therefore the Antecedent also is vntrue.</q>
Here the refuter vnder some shew of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath bewraied much ignorance. For first, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proposition: his reason is vnlike, and his allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the <note n="g" place="margin">

               <p>The Assumption likewise in the former part of it is false, and the reason of it also. For there were Metropolitanes in the first two hundred yeares, and they were superiour in the power of iurisdiction to their Bishops.

That the Presbyters were Ministers, I haue manifestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before, and I haue noted already, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the ordinary right of baptizing to be in the Bishop, Presbyters &amp; Deacons, that yet extraordinarily and in the case of necessity, lay men might baptize. And so <hi>Ierome</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </note> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to exhound <hi>Tertullians</hi> meaning. <hi>Hence it is that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chrisme</hi> (which <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Carth.</hi> 4. <hi>c</hi> 36.</note> the Presbyters of the seuerall parishes were to fetch from their B.) <hi>and without the commandement of the Bishop neither Presbyter nor Deacon haue right to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize. Which notwithstanding wee know to be oft times lawfull for lay men to doe, si tamen necessitas cogit, but yet so, if necessity doe compell.</hi> But nothing is more euident then that the Presbyters were Ministers, by that which hath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10663:262"/>
heretofore been deliuered. Whereunto this helpeth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> opposeth Presbyters and Deacons to laymen.
This obiection the Refuter thought to preuent, by saying, that <q>
                     <hi>the gouerning Elders and Deacons were accounted among the Clergy.</hi>
                  </q>
Which also is an vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned assertion. For to omit the arguments which before were brought to prooue, that the Presbyters and Deacons were degrees of the sacred Ministery; it is plaine, that the clergy of each diocesse was a company of such as were trained vp in learning, it being the seminary of the whole diocesse. And as they profited in yeeres, learning, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so they were preferred to bee Readers, then Exorcists, then Acolythi, then Sub-deacons, after that Deacons, then Presbyters, out of whom ordinarily was chosen the Bishoppe. And moreouer, the Presbyters and Deacons, with the rest of the Clergy, had all their maintenance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their place and degree in the Church. And therefore our disciplinarians, if they will haue such Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons as were in the primitiue Church, they must fetch them from the Vniuersitie, and schooles of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as we doe, and maintaine them by the charges of the Church, as well, though not with so large allowance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Bishop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His last euasion (for none of his answers is better) is,</hi> 
                  <q>that the lower Tertullian speaketh of, might well be, and was on a parish Bishop, the Presbyters being subiect to him, as his assistants for that one Church.</q>
But parish Bishoppes, such as they speake of, and lay elders be of one edition, neuer heard of before our age. For the more manifest proofe whereof, I referre you to that which before hath been by mee alleaged. Jt is euident therefore by the testimonies of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi> that such was the superioritie of Bishoppes, in respect of iurisdiction, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons, though the right to baptize belonged to their power of order, yet they might not exercise that power, without iurisdiction and authority granted them from the Bishop.</p>

                     <hi>who speake but of the practise of their owne times</hi>
                  </q>; as who should say, it had beene otherwise before their times. But it is plaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most by innumerable testimonies, some whereof I will cite <note n="r" place="margin">§ 20.</note> anon, that the ancientest Canons, Councels, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers acknowledge and allow this correctiue power in the Bishops ouer the Presbyters and Deacons in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church. As for the Apostles times, I prooue the same out of the Apocalypse, but more plainely out of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former reason, if the Refuter will giue me leaue to frame it, is this:
<q>
                     <p>Those who either are commended for examining, and not suffering such in their Church, as called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Apostles, and were not, or were reprooued for suffering false Teachers, had a correctiue power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer other Ministers.</p>
                     <p>The Angell of the Church of Ephesus <note n="s" place="margin">Apoc. 2.2.</note> is commended for the former: the Angell of the Church of Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira <note n="t" place="margin">Apoc. 2.20.</note> is reproued for the latter.</p>
                     <p>Therefore these Angels, which before I haue proued to be BB. had a correctiue power ouer other Ministers.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>His answer is friuolous,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad. past.</hi> 102.</note> that <q>
                     <hi>neither these Angels were diocesan Bishops,</hi> which before hath been prooued, <hi>nor these false Teachers diocesan Presbyters,</hi> which word him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10663:264"/>
deuised for a shift. <hi>Is it not against sense</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that the Presbyters which were subiect to the B. should call themselues Apostles?</hi>
                  </q>
If they were not subiect to him, why is hee either commended for exercising authoritie ouer them, or reprooued for suffering them? And if they were not Presbyters, because they called themselues Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, be like they were better men. Js it not then against sense, to deny that Presbyters were subiect to the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sure of the Bishop, because he imagineth these, who were subiect to their censure, were better men? Whatsoeuer they were, whether Presbyters, or in a higher degree; whether of the Bishops presbytery, or not; whether of his diocese ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, or come from other places, it is plaine, that they were Teachers, and that being in their diocese, the Bishops had authoritie either to suffer them to preach, or to inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit them; to retaine them in the Communion of their Church, or to expell them.</p>
               <p>My other reason, that BB. had correctiue power ouer the Presbyters, is, because <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer the Presbyters of Ephesus and Creet: as I proue by most euident testimonies out of <hi>Pauls</hi> epistles <note place="margin">Tit. 1.5.</note> written to them,<note n="u" place="margin">1. Tim. 1.3.5.19.20.21.22.6.14.</note> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Haeres.</hi> 75.</note> his inference on these words to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe: Against a Presbyter receiue not thou an accusation, but vnder two or three witnesses, &amp;c. Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Par in parem non habet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>subiect to the B. as to their Iudge.</hi>
                  <hi>To my inference out of</hi> S. Paul <hi>he answereth,</hi> 
                  <q>that Timothe and Titus were not BB. and that I shall neuer prooue they were.</q>
I desire therefore the Reader to suspend his iudgement vntill hee come to the proofes on both sides; and if he shall not find my proofes for their being BB. to be better then his to the contrarie, let him beleeue me in nothing. In the meane time let him know, that if the generall consent of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers deserue any credit for a matter of fact, then must it be granted that <hi>Timothe</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Bishops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Against</hi> Epiphanius <hi>hee obiecteth, that</hi>
                  <q> hee tooke for granted that which Aerius constantly denied.</q>
But this is one of his presumptuous and malapeit conceits; for when <hi>Epiphanius</hi> prooueth against <hi>Aerius,</hi> that Bishops were
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10663:264"/>
superiour to other Presbyters, because <hi>Timothe</hi> was, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for granted that <hi>Timothe</hi> was a Bishoppe: what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate or reasonable man would think otherwise, but that this assertion, that <hi>Timothe</hi> was a Bishoppe, was such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued truth, as hee knew <hi>Aërius</hi> himselfe would not deny it?</p>
               <q>(<hi>Serm. sect.</hi> 12. <hi>pag.</hi> 50. But consider also the Presbyters as seuered in place from the Bishop,<note place="margin">The Bishops authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hauing cures.</note> and affixed to their seuerall Cures, &amp;c. <hi>to offenders, pag.</hi> 52.</q>
               <p>My first Argument to proue the iurisdiction of Bishops ouer Presbyters assigned to their seuerall cures, is, that when any place in the country was voide, the Bishoppe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed a Presbyter to them out of his Presbytery, which as hath beene said before, <hi>Caluin</hi> confesseth; and is an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument, as to proue the iurisdiction of the Bishop ouer the country parishes, and Presbyters thereof, so to demonstrate that the Bishops were Diocesan. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son because hee could not answere, he would as his maner is, perswade the Reader that it is <q>
                     <hi>needlesse</hi>
                  </q>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I alledge that these Presbyters might doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by authority from the Bishoppe, from whome they had their iurisdiction, and therefore were subiect to him as their ruler.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Pag.</hi> 103.</note> that they were subiect to his iudgement and censures. These two points with their proofes, hee passeth ouer, as if hee made hast to the reason following, which he supposeth to be the weakest. For this is his maner, to passe by in breuity, or in silence the best proofes, and if he meet with any thing which seemeth to him weaker then the rest, there he resteth like a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus haue I proued by euident testimonies, that al sorts
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10663:266"/>
of Presbyters, and other clergy men in euery diocesse were subiect to the Bishop. Whereunto this I adde, that since the first institution of Bishops, which was in the Apostles times vntill our age, it was neuer otherwise: but all clergy men, if either they withdrew themselues from their subiection to their orthodoxall B. they were counted schismatickes; or if they liued vnder no Bishop, they were wont to be called <hi>headlesse</hi> Clerks. <hi>By no meanes,</hi> saith the councill of <note n="l" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>To these testimonies in the end I added a reason,<note place="margin">§. 21. The superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of BB. in iurisdiction prooued by reason.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the refuter, because he hoped to finde some aduantage, is pleased to insist. The reason standeth thus:
<q>
                     <p>The pastors of seueral parishes in the primitiue church were either subiect to the authority and iurisdiction of the Bishop; or they had associates in the parishes ioyned with them in the gouernment thereof, or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alone without controle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>t, beeing neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by associates, nor subiect to BB.</p>
                     <p>But neither had they associates in the parishes ioined with them, neither did they rule alone without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolement, beeing neither restrained by associates, nor subiect to the Bishop.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the pastors of seuerall parishes in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church were subiect to the authority and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the bishop.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>First he taketh exception against the conclusion, saying <hi>that I doe not conclude that which he looked for.</hi> What he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, I know not, nor care not; the thing which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to proue, was, that the Bishops in the primitiue Church were superior to the Presbyters in the power of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction or gouernment. Which is most euidently proued by this argument <hi>a relatis</hi>: If the Presbyters were inferiour and subiect to the iurisdiction and gouernement of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, then were the Bishops superiour to them in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of iurisdiction and gouernement.
<q>
                     <hi>What can bee more
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10663:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>
plaine? or how could they bee, as he absurdly imagineth</hi> subiect to the iurisdiction and gouernement of the B. if he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had power to rule and direct them, nor authority and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction to censure and correct them?</q>
His exception there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore against the conclusion is a very friuolous cauill, like all the rest of his answers.</p>
               <p>To the proposition hee answereth, by denying<q> the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction as insufficient, because a fourth thing might bee added, and that is the authority of the congregation.</q>
But though this might be added according to the phantasticall conceit of some fanaticall spirits in our time, who make the gouernement of the Church to be neither monarchiall, nor aristocraticall, but democraticall, or rather ochlocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; yet was it not to be added, because there could bee no question thereof according to the iudgement and practise of the primitiue Church, whereof I spake. But let him adde it if the please; for it may as easily be denied in the assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as added in the proposition. The proposition will perhaps seeme somwhat the better, and the assumption wilbe neuer the worse. Therfore, this also was a meere cauill.</p>
               <p>As touching the assumption: that part which denieth them to haue ruled alone,<note place="margin">§. 22</note> as being neither restrained by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates, nor subiect to Bishops, he saith <q>
                     <hi>hee would haue granted, but that I proued it.</hi>
                  </q>
See the spirit of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What then? will he deny it? No, but heereby he wil take aduantage to inferre his triumphing conclusion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 104.</note> that <q>
                     <hi>our Bishops</hi>forsooth <hi>he Popes, &amp; then say it is my conclusion.</hi> 
                  </q> But to this their conclusion, which they haue published in print in most glorious and vaunting manner fiue times that I know of, arguing nothing but their gerat malice &amp; small iudgement, I haue answered before to their shame. How oft must they bee told, that wee neither make our Bishops supreme gouernours, as they doe their parish Bishop: nor sole, as theirs would bee, if they had not the assistance of their Presbyters? And who knoweth not, that it is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy that maketh a Pope: and supremacy they giue to their parish Bishop.</p>
               <p>The other part of the assumption, which saith they had
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10663:267"/>
not assistants in the parish to restraine them, he denieth.
<hi>But before he wil examine my reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which I broght to proue it, his grauity thoght good to cauil with the phrase,</hi> which (<hi>saith he</hi>)<q> soundeth very strangely in our eares. Assistants are for his helpe whom they assist, not to hinder in the execution of his office; so doe the Iustices of peace assist the Iudges at the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sises. Therefore he should either, not haue called them assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, or forborne the terme of restraining.</q>
Where were so many eares, as he speaketh of, there were more heads then one that ioined in this work, as I vnderstand there did. But where so many heads were, it is strange there was no more iudgement. Are your Presbyteries assisting your parish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, to be compared to the Iustices of peace at the assises, who haue no right of suffrage or giuing sentence? or not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Iudges assisting the chiefe Iudge in euery Court? haue not all in your Presbyteries or consistories equal right of suffrage, and are not all things carried by plurality of voice? Is it not plaine, that the Iudges in the Kings bench, or common plees, who are assistants to the L. chiefe iustices, are ioyned to either of them, as to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lpe him in giuing right iudgment, so to restraine him, that he iudge not alone, according to his own pleasure? Is it not euident when more are ioyned in one commission, that they are ioyned as well to restraine him that is the cheefe, that he shall doe nothing alone, as to helpe him in the execution thereof? What a shallow conceit then was this, that assitants might not be said to restraine; seeing their office is, as to helpe him whom they assist to doe right, so to restraine him that hee doe no wrong.</p>
               <p>Let vs now heare what hee can say to the reason; which is this:
<q>If the pastors of euery parish had assistants, then Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, either of lay-presbyters or of Ministers But they had not presbyteries to assist them, neither of lay-presbyters, nor of ministers. Therefore they had none assistants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Proposition is grounded vpon this hypothesis, which I tooke for granted, that all assistants or coassessours
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10663:268"/>
ioined with the Bishop or pastor in the gouernment of the Church, that are any wheres noted to haue been in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, were Presbyters. For that which againe he addeth concerning the whole congregation, is a very fond conceit.Whoeuer heard that the whole congregation as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the pastor in the gouernement of it selfe? assuredlie they which attribute authority to the whole congregation ascribe vnto it the chiefe authority, as in popular states: which the refuter hath before acknowledged, saying, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 6.</note> that
<q>
                     <hi>they subiect both the pastors &amp; elders to the whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 
                  </q>turning the world vpside down, and making the flock to rule their pastor.
And yet how this standeth with their other position, that the pastor is the supreme ecclesiasticall officer in euery Church. J cannot sell, vnlesse they meane the highest vnder the Church it selfe. Which if it be so, then is not the Church according to their conceit assistant to the Pastor, but the Pastor is the Churches deputy and lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant for the gouernement of it selfe, in which gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church the Presbyters bee his assistants. But whatsoeuer might be added to the proposition, according to the vnstayed fancies of certaine innouators, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected not, the proposition is necessary according to the practise of the primitiue Church wherof only J sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad. pag.</hi> 105.</note>But he denyeth the assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, saying, <q>
                     <hi>that they had other Presbyters which were not ministers.</hi>
                  </q>
But I hope he wil vnsay that saying, when he shall haue read what before hath beene deliuered concerning their onely-gouerning Elders. Besides, against their parish-presbyters I alledged the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Churches in <hi>Scotland and Geneua.</hi> For in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> they had not a Presbytery or consistory in euery parish, but in such circuits as are answerable to our deanries.
And whereas he saith, that <q>
                     <hi>neither I nor hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                  </q>; hee should haue spoken for himselfe.
For what I report con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Geneua,</hi> I haue read, as in other Authors, so in <hi>Beza</hi> himselfe, shewing that they haue but one Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call presbyterie, or consistorie, for all the parishes both in the city and territory thereto belonging, consisting of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10663:268"/>
seniors, whereof 6. are Ministers constant, and 12. cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen euery yeare out of their 3. councils of state, viz. 6. out of the councill of 200 4 out of that of 60, and 2. out of the 25. as I haue noted before.
But where he saith that <q>
                     <hi>Geneua may well be taken for one parish, seeing it hath no diocesan Bishop</hi>

Belike there is but one parish church, and all the rest, beeing aboue 20. be chapels of ease; and who then is the pastor of the whole Church of <hi>Geneua</hi>? and what be they that are set ouer the Churches, if they bee not the pastors of them? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is not long since <hi>Geneua</hi> was vnder a Bishop, and then was it a Diocese, and is it now come to bee but a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish? or shall we not rather say, that as the Bishop in his time was Diocesan; so the presbyterie now, is not a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shionall, but a Diocesan presbyterie, and that the whole Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> consisting of many parishes, is as well a Diocese now, as it was before?</p>
               <p>It remaineth therefore as I said in the sermon, that the ministers of seuerall parishes were subiect to the Bishop, whose pastoral care extended it selfe to al, euen theremotest parishes in his Diocese &amp;c.</p>

To his other cauill of not direct concluding, I haue answered already 4. or 5. times.</p>

                     <hi>Ad page.</hi> 106.</note>But before I ended this 4. point, I thought it needfull to preuent an obiection which is vsually made; that whatsoeuer the office of the ancient Bishops was, yet they were not called Lords, as ours bee. Whereunto I answered, that men were not to be offended at that title, for these two causes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it is a title in the holy scriptures giuen, both to naturall and spirituall Fathers, as I proued out of <hi>Genesis</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Because the title of <hi>Angels,</hi> which the Holy Ghost in this place giueth to them, is a title of greater honour, then the other, by how much the heauenly gouernours of men vnder God, are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then the earthly.
To the former, besides some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting speeches,<note place="margin">Psal. 91.11. Dan. 10.11.</note> which hee will bee ashamed of, when hee shall finde himselfe put to silence: hee answereth, that<q> 
                     <hi>the word Lord was a terme common too all superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours as <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10663:269"/>
I confesse to be true in the vocatiue case, the words being vsed as our English, Sir.
But otherwise, where the word is to be translated <hi>Lord,</hi> it is both in Hebrew and Greeke a word of like honour with our English, Lord. And therefore it was a great ouersight in those, which translating 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. where <hi>Peter</hi> saith that <hi>Sara</hi> called <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Lord, read, that <hi>she called him Sir.</hi> For her words, whereunto <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had relation, were these, <hi>Vadoni zaken, and my Lord is olde.</hi> It were something foolish to say, <hi>and my Sir.</hi>
                  <hi>Yea but saith he,</hi> 
                  <q>the word Lord with vs is appropriated to men of Nobility and speciall place in ciuill gouernment.</q>
To omitte that it is not so appropriated to them, but that euen meane gentlemen are so called in respect of the manours which they hold, it appeareth by that which hath bene said, that Bishops not onely now haue, but in the Primitiue Church had, as speciall and as honourable a place in the gouernment of the Church, as the ciuill magistrates he speaketh of, haue in the common wealth. Their calling also beeing more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, I see no reason, why they should be enuyed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall title of honour.</p>
               <p>To the latter reason he answereth 2. things.<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> First, that <hi>the titles of honour now giuen to Bishops were also inferiour to the title of Angels, which the holy Ghost giueth them; and yet then they had them not, nor till Poperie</hi> (he meaneth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie) <hi>was grown to his full height.</hi> His simple Reader would thinke that hee speaketh vpon certaine knowledge, and cannot but beleeue him, and so be deceiued by his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent speeches; but he speaketh at all aduentures, as his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, not as his knowledge lead him. The Papacie came not to the ful height vntil the time of <hi>Hildebra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> which was aboue a thousand yeares after Christ: when the Pope had gotten the temporall supremacie, and so both the swords. The beginning of that, which our writers call the Papacie, was when the Pope first obtained the spirituall supremacie, which was about the yeare sixe hundred and seauen. If therefore I shall prooue, that Bishops had as honourable ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the first sixe hundred yeares, as they haue now with vs; I shall euince, that not onely before the height, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10663:270"/>
the arising of the Papacie, they were called Lords, and by other titles no lesse honourable then <hi>Lord.</hi> But I will not desire so large a scope; the most of my proofes shall be contained within three or foure hundred yeares after the death of Christ.</p>

                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:10663:271"/>His second answer containeth two things: the former, that
<q>
                     <hi>the title of Angels which the holy Ghost giueth to BB.</hi> (for that onely J mentioned) <hi>is quite besides the purpose</hi>
                  </q>, my argument being this:
<q>
                     <p>The holy Ghost giueth BB. a more honourable title, in calling them the Angels of the Churches, then if he had called them Lords.</p>
                     <p>Therefore wee should not thinke much that they are called Lords.</p>
                  </q>
He answereth: <hi>The Angels are glorious creatures of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and haue some fit resemblance of the Ministers office: Lord, Lordship, and grace, are tearmes of ciuill honour, not so well befitting the Ministers of Christ Iesus.</hi>
I confesse they doe not so well befit them, because they come short of that honour and excellencie, which in the name of <hi>Angels</hi> the holy Ghost ascribeth to them. For they are called not only Angels, that is, messengers and ambassadours of God, as all ministers are, in respect of their ministerie; but also each of them is called the Angell of the Church, whereof he is B. in respect of his gouernment, and gardianship of the Church: as the holy Angels of God are said to be their Angels, ouer whom they are appointed Gouernours, and gardians. Therefore the name <hi>Lord</hi> giuen to them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their gouernment and authoritie, is a title of lesse honour, then that which in the same respect is giuen them by our Sauiour Christ. Neither are they therefore ciuill Lords, because they haue that title of Lords common to them with the Lords temporall. For who knoweth not the distinction betweene the Lords spirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, so often mentioned in the Acts of Parliament? And whereas in the second place hee would insinuate, that our Sauiour Christ expresly forbiddeth these titles of Lordship and grace, <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. where though hee readeth thus, <note n="t" place="margin">Luc. 22.26.</note>
                  <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles reigne ouer them, and they that beare rule ouer them, are called gracious Lords; but you shall not bee so:</hi> yet he is not so ignorant of the Greeke tongue, as not to know, that neither <hi>gratious</hi> nor <hi>Lords</hi> are there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the originall text.

of those, who were too partiall in this cause.

It is also plaine, that the disciples imagining that Christ should be a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Monarch, expected, that themselues should be earthly Princes, in great authoritie about him, euery one affecting a neerer place about him then his fellowes, as appeareth by the two sonnes of <hi>Zebede,</hi> whose ambitious suite to Christ, that they might sit one on his right hand, and the other on his left in his kingdome, gaue occasion of this speech, as <hi>Matthew</hi>

                  <note place="margin">§ 27.</note>Hauing thus answered the first obiection, I did easily foresee, that three other things would bee obiected: the first, if Bishops may be called Lords, then they may behaue themselues as Lords of the Churches:
I answered, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may not behaue themselues as Lords of the Churches, yet being the Angels of the Churches, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Fathers, to whom a paternall and pastorall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is committed, may worthily be honoured with the title of Lords. To this he replieth, that <q>
                     <hi>we call not Shepheards nor Fathers Lords, and therefore the paternall or pastorall authoritie of Bishops doth not make them capable of such Lordly titles.</hi>
                  </q>
J answer, that Magistrates, yea Princes, both in Scriptures and prophane Writers, are called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, as well as Bishops, and for the same cause are Lords. Neither doe I doubt, but that the title of Father, being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by way of honour to him that is not a naturall Father, is a word of as great honour at the least, as Lord: and that is the signification of the name <hi>Papa,</hi> which hauing beene giuen in the Primitiue Church to all Bishops, as a title of eminent honour, is for that cause by the Pope of Rome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to himselfe.</p>
               <p>The second, there is too great oddes betweene the titles of Bishops and other Ministers, the one being called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> the other <hi>Lords.</hi> I answered, there is no such great difference betweene Master and Lord, that inferiour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, which assume to themselues the title of <hi>Master,</hi> should denie the title of <hi>Lord</hi> to Bishops.
Hee replieth, as conceiuing my speech simply, that there was <q>
                     <hi>no great difference</hi>
                  </q> betweene Master and Lord.
If you respect
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10663:272"/>
their vse in relation, as they are referred to their correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, there is no difference; if the vse, without relation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, there is great difference; but yet not <hi>so great,</hi> as that Ministers which assume the one to themselues, should denie the other to Bishops, there being as great difference betwixt their degrees, as their titles. Where he saith, <q>
                     <hi>it is not assumed, but giuen by custome to them, as Masters of Arts</hi>
                  </q>; both parts are false: for both it is giuen to all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, as they are Ministers, though not Masters of Arts, though not graduates; and also I especially meant certaine Ministers, who not enduring the title of Lord to be giuen to Bishops, will neither tell you their name by speech, nor set it downe in writing, without the preface of Mastership.</p>
               <p>The third, if Bishops bee called Lords, then are they Lords of the Church.
I answered, it followeth no more that they are therefore Lords of the Church, because they are called Lords, then the Ministers are Masters of the Church, because they are called Masters: for neither of these titles is giuen to them with relation, but as simple ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of honour and reuerence. <q>No? saith he, <hi>let their stiles speake, Lord of Hath and Welles, Lord of Rochester, &amp;c. What? Lord of the Cities? nothing lesse, but Lords of the Diocese.</hi>
                  </q>
They are Lords of neither, but Lord BB. both of the City and Diocese. And the relation is not in the word Lord, but in the word Bishop, though it bee not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed alwaies, but many times is vnderstood.</p>
               <p>The Refuter hauing thus weakly,<note place="margin">§ 28. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 107.</note> friuolously, and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie shifted off my arguments and testimonies, rather then lie shifted off my arguments and testimonies, rather then answered them, there being not one line in my Sermon hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, which I haue not defended with euidence of truth against his cauillations; notwithstanding, concludeth with a most insolent bragge, as if he had (as his fauourites giue out) laid me on my backe.
And therefore as some wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, after they haue giuen one the foile, will iet with their hands vnder their side, challenging all others; euen so he, hauing in his weake conceit giuen me a strong ouerthrow, because he findeth me too weake to stand in his armes, hee challengeth all commers, saying, <q>
                     <hi>Let him that thinketh
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10663:273"/>
he can say more, supplie his default.</hi>
                  </q>
I do vnfainedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, there be a great number in this Land (blessed be God) who are able to say much more in this cause then I am: notwithstanding, a stronger propugner thereof shall not neede against this oppugner. And because I am assured in my conscience of the truth and goodnesse of the cause, I promise the Refuter, if this which now I haue written, will not conuince him, as I hope it will; whiles he will deale as a Disputer, and not as a Libeller, I will neuer giue him ouer (God giuing me life and health) vntill I haue vtterly put him to silence. In the meane time, let the Reader looke backe to that which hath beene said on both sides: let him call to minde, if he can, what one proofe this Refuter hath brought for the paritie of Ministers; what one sound answer he hath giuen to any one argument, or testimonie to my one proposition or assumption which I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and then let him consider whether this glorious insultation proceeded not from an euill consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to a worse purpose, which is, to retaine the simple seduced people in their former tearmes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiousnes.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10663:274"/>
needlesse? but indeed his analysis was forced; as he could not but discerne, both by the distribution of the Sermon page 2. and also by the transition here vsed, neither was this point handled before, but the former assertion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the text was explicated; that the Angels or Bishops of the primitiue Church were diocesan Bishops, and such for the substance of their calling, as ours be, superiour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ministers in degree, &amp;c. This which now wee are to handle, is the second assertion, being a doctrine gathered out of the text, so explicated. I confesse the former doth proue the latter; and that doth commend the methode of my Sermon, and both being disposed together may make this Enthymeme.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Pastors or gouernours of the primitiue Church, here meant by the Angels, were diocesan Bishops, and such for the substance of their calling, as ours be.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the calling of such diocesan Bishops as ours be, is lawfull.</p>
               </q>
               <p>But I contented not my selfe with collecting the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine out of the text, but as the manner of all preachers is, when they haue collected a doctrine, which is controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall; I thought it needfull to proue, and to confirme the same with other arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>But other arguments,</hi> saith he, <hi>needed not, if the three mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle points were sufficiently cleared:</hi>
                  </q> what will he assume? but the three former points were sufficiently cleared? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the first point was bootlesse, so this last is needlesse.
If he like not of this assumption, he cannot make this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, which notwithstanding he maketh: if he will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, that they were not sufficientlie cleared, as he hath borne the reader in hand all this while, then he must needs conclude against himselfe, that therefore these other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were needfull.</p>
               <p>The truth is, though the former points were so suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie cleared, as that the refuter had nothing, whereby to auoid the euident truth thereof conuicting his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but beggerly shifts and sophisticall euasions; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10663:274"/>
for so much as some of them, with whom I had to deale, are so lead with a spirit of contradiction, as if they were in the contradiction of <hi>Chore,</hi> (the Lord open their eyes and turne their hearts) I therefore thought it needfull, for the more full conuiction of the gainesayers, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by other arguments the doctrine which I collected out of the text. But where I had beene to blame for not setting downe this collection plainely (were it not a point of Art sometimes to conceale Art) the reader is to coy the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters head, for making so plaine a collection for his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction, &amp; as they say, for gathering a rod for his own taile. The collection being reduced into a sillogism standeth thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The calling of such as are here meant by the Angels is lawfull and good;</p>
                  <p>Diocesan BB. such as our be, are here meant by the Angels.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Therefore the calling of Diocesan BB. such as ours are, is lawfull and good.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The proposition is such as no man of vnderstanding or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will make question of,<note place="margin">Ad pag. <hi>108.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>saith the refuter,</hi> we aske no more, but to haue this assumption confirmed, that the Angels were such, and then you shall not need other arguments to proue this conclusion.</q>
But the assumption say I, is that which in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and in this defence thereof hitherto hath beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: how sufficiently I referre to the reader, and I appeale to the refuter.</p>
               <p>This therefore may stand for the first argument.</p>
               <p>I proceed to that which was expressed in the Sermon, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting what else he hath in this section as being either refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, or vnworthy to be mentioned now.</p>

                  </q> But say I the Angels of the Churches were the BB. of the primitiue Church, who in the former
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10663:275"/>
part of the Sermon were proued to be such, and those proofes in this defence haue hitherto beene confirmed in such sort as I hope the refuter will acknowledge himselfe to be satisfied:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 109.</note> if not, yet it is but folly to multiply words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the proofes of the former assertion: for they must stand, vntill the refuter or some other of more strength shall take vpon him to assaile them:
And I doubt not, but they will stand after they haue beene assailed.</p>
               <p>My argument therefore standeth thus:
<q>
                     <p>What function hath diuine institution and approbation is lawfull and good.</p>
                     <p>The function of BB. such as were described in the former part of the Sermon, hath diuine institution, as being Angels sent of God, and approbation, as being Starres which Christ holdeth in his right hand.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the function of such BB. is lawfull and good.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To the assumption he hath nothing to answere, besides the bare deny all thereof, but that which already he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated three or foure times since he entred into this fift point: <q>
                     <hi>that diocesan</hi> BB. <hi>are not meant by the Angels and Starres, and chargeth me, as though I thought it enough to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, &amp; would haue my readers to take it vpon my bare word</hi>
                  </q>: when the thing which I haue proued hitherto hath beene only this, <hi>that the Angels or</hi> BB. <hi>of the primitiue Church were such as in the former assertion wer described.</hi>

               <p>The assumption I proued by three arguments: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I proceeded as it were by degrees: two whereof, saith the refuter, <hi>are needlesse</hi>; as if still he held it superfluous to bring more arguments then one.

               <p>The first of the three I thus propounded:<note place="margin">The 1. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because it was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed in the primitiue Church.</note>
                  <q>That gouernment which was generally and perpetually vsed in all Christian Churches in the first three hundred yeares after Christ, and his Apostles, and was not orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by generall Councils, was vndoubtedly of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall institution.</q>
               </p>

for which grant, (though he could doe no other) I thinke my selfe as much beholding to him, as if he had granted the cause. <hi>But thereupon</hi> (saith he) <hi>we may boldly inferre, that if in the Apostles times the gouernment was in the hands of the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitery, it continued in the Church along time after their decease:</hi>
                  </q> from which proposition I may boldly and truely assume &amp; conclude; that after the Apostles times the gouernment was not in the hands of such presbiteries, as the disciplinarians speake of; therefore neither in the Apostles times.</p>
               <p>The assumption consisteth of two parts, the former that the gouernment of the Churches by such BB. was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perpetually vsed in all Christian Churches in the first three hundred yeeres after Christ and his Apostles; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and was not ordained by generall Councils.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§ 4.</note>The former part I proue by foure arguments. The first whereof is this:
<q>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">4. Arguments prouing the assumption: 1. Because all the Angels or gouernours of the primitiue Church in the first three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan BB.</note>If the Angels or gouernors of the primitiue Church in the first 300. yeeres after Christ and his Apostles were dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan BB. then the gouernment of the Church by such BB. was generally and perpetually vsed in that time.</p>
                     <p>But the antecedent is true, Therefore the consequent.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He maketh a doubt of the proposition: because he hath not learned, that speeches in disputation indefinitly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded are generally to be vnderstood for auoiding of clenches: and therefore when I say the Angels or gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, I meane all the Angels or gouernours; when I say in the three hundred yeers, I meane throughout that terme: euen from the death of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> to the end of the foure hundred yeere after the incarnation of Christ.</p>
               <p>The assumption hath beene proued at large in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the Sermon and in this defence thereof: first by this disiunction, either the Churches after the Apostles time were gouerned by diocesan BB. as we say, or by pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteries, consisting for the most part of Lay-elders, as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinarians hold.</p>
               <p>But neuer by such presbiteries. Therefore euer by BB.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I haue proued that euer since the Apostles
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10663:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>
times, the Churches haue been dioceses and the BB. dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans, superiour to other ministers in degree, hauing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of preeminence during life, and majoritie of power in respect both of ordination and iurisdiction: his answere is, that <q>
                     <hi>he hath answered those points of my Sermon, where he hath shewed that I proued no such matter:</hi>
                  </q> whereunto I reply,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 112.</note> that all his answeres were but shifts and euasions, and stand fully confuted.
But perhaps the refuter will say; if I had vnderstood your proposition as vttered in generall termes, as now it is expounded by you; then I would haue taken the same exception against the proofe of the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I did against your proposition: for although in some part of that time some BB. were perhaps, such as you described; yet it followeth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that generally and perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the first three hundred yeeres after Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles they were such. That they were generally such in the last of the three hundred yeeres, which is the fourth century after Christ, it thing most fully testified, and most manifestly proued in the proofe of the former points, and hath been confessed by the refuter: neither can be denyed of any man, who hath any sound learning, ioyned with a good conscience. Let vs then consider, when such BB. had their beginning. Perhaps some will say, they began with <hi>Constantine,</hi> for then was the greatest alteration in the state of the Church. I answere, the alteration was in respect of outward peace and prosperitie, wherewith God blessed his Church, not in the discipline or doctrin of the Church: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the wealth, and better maintenance of the BB. not in the substance of their calling. It is euident that BB. were diocesan before they were actually Metropolitanes; and Metropolitanes, before they were Patriarches: for of the combination of dioceses, did follow Metropolitanes; and vpon the consociation of prouinces, were Patriarches or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned, and yet long before the Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Con. Nic. c.</hi> 6.</note> the Patriarches were in vse, and the customes of subiecting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse prouinces to them, are called <gap reason="foreign">

or prerogatiues of Churches, meaning especially the priuiledges of being mother Churches, should be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to them: which priuiledge, as I haue shewed before, belonged to them euer since the Apostles times. When the B. of <hi>Antioch</hi> attempted to ordaine the Metropolitane of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the BB. of <hi>Cyprus</hi> complaine to the Councill of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> alledging that euer since the Apostles, the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane B. of <hi>Constantia</hi> was ordained by the Synode of the prouinciall BB. whereupon the Councill <note n="g" place="margin">

                  </gap>, <hi>euer from the beginning according to the custome receiued of old.</hi> If therefore Metropolitanes and Patriarches were in vse long before <hi>Constantines</hi> time, who can doubt but dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan BB. were much more? <hi>Long since</hi> saith <hi>Cyprian,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">§ 5. That diocesan BB. had not their first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning after the Apostles times.</note>Without doubt, if diocesan BB. had their beginning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apostles times, then was it shortly after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease. But that cannot be, first because, as I shall proue in the next reason, they were in the Apostles times: secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as I said in the Sermon, it is incredible that all the Churches would, and impossible that they could agree in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing a gouernment receiued from the Apostles, and setting vp at once in all places of the world, one other vniforme gouernment by BB. without the gaine saying of any one of the godly Fathers, or worthy Martyrs of Christ. Besides, the succession of BB. from the Apostles times, as I shall shew, doth plainely proue their originall to haue beene in the Apostles times.

                     </note> but when euery one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted those for his whom he had baptised, it was decreed in the whole world, that one being chosen from the presbiters, should be set ouer the rest in euery Church, vnto whom the care of that whole Church or diocese should appertaine, and that the seeds of schismes might be taken away. <hi>For</hi> full answer to this testimony, he referreth vs to another place; <hi>and when he commeth thither, I doubt he will not say much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <hi>In the meanetime, he answereth first, to the testimony itselfe, and then to my inference out of it: to the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he answereth, that</hi> Ierome maketh the beginning of this constitution of BB. not in the Apostles times, nor in the times immediatly succeeding the Apostles. Not the former because otherwhere he saith that BB. were superiour to presbiters ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the custome of the Church, then any ordinance of God.</q>
Whereto I answer, that custome himselfe calleth <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad. Euagr.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall tradition</hi>: and else where most plainely and fully te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth in many places (some whereof are noted in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) both that BB. were in the Apostles times, and also were ordayned by the Apostles themselues.
<q>
                     <hi>Not the latter,</hi> because it is, as I had told him, against the modest charitie of a Christian to imagine, that all the Church would conspire at once to thrust out the gouernment established by the Apostles, and insteed thereof to bring in another of their owne.</q>
But say I, it is most manifest, that BB. were placed in all Churches in the next age to the Apostles: and therefore he must either grant, that the Apostolicall Churches receiued this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment from the Apostles, or else confesse (according to his vsuall modesty in setting light by the testimony of all antiquitie,) that all Churches conspired to alter the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment which the Apostles had established. But of his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10663:278"/>
modestie I would know, when he thinketh this gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by BB. began; and whether he must not be forced of necessity, either to lay that foule imputation vpon all the ancient Churches, on all the godly Fathers and blessed Martyrs; or to yeeld that they had receiued this forme of gouernment from the Apostles.</p>
               <p>My inference also he denyeth. When as not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the allegation giueth full testimonie to the generality, saying, it was decreed <hi>in the whole world:</hi> and of the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity there can be no question, if the beginning were not latter then I intended. But it is plaine, that by <hi>Ieroms</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it began in the Apostles times: at the first indeed he saith, before BB. were ordained, the same men were called <hi>Presbiteri &amp; Episcopi</hi>: and vntill factions beganne, the Churches were gouerned (<hi>viz.</hi> in the absence of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles) by the common counsell of the Presbiters: which may be true of the most Churches, excepting that of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, by <hi>Ieromes</hi> owne confession. But when factions began, as those did in the Apostles <note n="r" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> times, whereof he speaketh; the Apostles ordayned, and in the whole Christian world it was obserued, that for auoiding of schisme one should be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from among the presbiters, who should be set ouer the rest, and to whom the whole care of the Church, that is, the diocese should appertaine.</p>
               <p>As for the reasons whereby he proueth the consequence feeble, they are exceeding weake.
<q>First, <hi>because</hi> Ierom <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of the times immediately succeeding the Apostles.</hi> It is very true: for he speaketh of that which was done in the Apostles times, as hath bene said: secondly, saith he, <hi>because he saith it was decreed in the whole world, which could not well be without a generall Councill, vnlesse it soaked in by little and little, till at the last it ouer-flowed all places.</hi>
                  </q>
The decree which he speaketh of, could be no other but of the Apostles: for as hath been said, what was generally obserued in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the first three hundred yeares, before there was a generall Councill to decree it, proceeded vndoubtedly from the Apostles. Now it is more then euident, that long
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10663:279"/>
before the first generall councill, there were not onely Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan BB. but Metropolitanes also, yea Patriarches: that which he talketh of soking in by little and little, agreeth not with the generall decree, whereof <hi>Ierome</hi> speaketh, whereby what is instituted is ordayned at once. Neither can hee assigne any time after the Apostles, when BB. had either lesse charges, or lesse authority, then in the end of the first three or foure hundred yeares. Their Diocesses oft times as hath beene shewed, were lessened in processe of time, but seldome or neuer enlarged. Neither is it to be doubted, but that their authority among Christians was greater before there were Christian Magistrates, then afterwards. For before, they called and held their Councels by their owne authority, they heard and iudged all causes among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they punished all kindes of faults <note n="s" place="margin">

               <p>The other testimony of <hi>Ierome,</hi> is out of his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie on <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. which I haue mentioned before.<note place="margin">§ 7.

                  <q>
                     <hi>He saith first,</hi> this testimonie is an allegorie vpon the <hi>45.</hi> Psalme, and not a historie of the times.</q>
Which is a friuolous euasion. For it is an exposition of the Prophecie by the historie or euent, and so not onely he, but <hi>Augustine</hi> also expoundeth the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly, he alledgeth, that</hi> Ierome doth not say, that the Church had BB. as soone as the Apostles were gone: <hi>which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is friuolous.</hi>
                  </q>
For he signifieth that the BB. did succeede the Apostles in the gouernment of the Church, which else where he plainly professeth, saying, that <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad. Euagr.</hi>
                  </note>

Besides, others of the Fathers in plaine termes testifie, that the Apostles committed the Church euery where to the BB. and left them their successors: which in the successions also
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10663:279"/>
of BB. in the Apostolicall Churches is plainely declared. <hi>Simeon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cleophas</hi> succeeding <hi>Iames, Evodius, Linus, Timothie, Tittu,</hi> &amp;c. substituted by the Apostles, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and succeeding them in the gouernment of those Churches wherein they were placed.</p>

               <p>My third argument consisteth of two branches; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, affirmatiue, that the Councels, Histories, and Fathers with one consent giue testimony to the gouernment by BB: the other, negatiue, that not any one pregnant testimony of any sound writer, or example of any one orthodoxal or apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke Church (<hi>viz.</hi> in the first three hundred yeares after Christ and his Apostles) can be produced to the contrarie.
<q>
                     <hi>To the former he answereth,</hi> that the Councels, Histories and Fathers, either beare witnesse of their owne times, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, seeing the ancientest <note n="u" place="margin">
                        <hi>Note his reason: the testimonies of the Fathers to no purpose, because the antientest Councils were in the fourth age.</hi>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10663:280"/>
times, by that which they saw then in practise, taking all that had the same name of BB. to haue beene pertakers of the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If the Fathers did beare witnesse onely of their owne times, it were sufficient for the proofe of my assertion, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there were diuers in all the terme specified of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after the Apostles, which giue testimonie vnto it: as in the first age after the Apostles (to omit them of the two latter) <hi>Ignatius, Hegesippus, Irenaeus, Clemens, Tertullian,</hi> doe giue plaine testimonie vnto it; and two of them, as hath beene shewed, to wit, <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> were not onely Diocesan, but also Metropolitane BB. But the Fathers, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories and councils, doe not onely speake of their owne times; but also relate what was done in the Apostles times, and immediatly vpon their decease. Doe they not testifie with one consent, as I partly shew in the two arguments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that there were BB. in the Apostles times, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ordayned by the Apostles themselues? doe they not say, that the Apostles committed the Churches to them, and left them to be their successors in the gouernment of the Church? is not this one of the chiefe things which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> propoundeth to himselfe in his history, <note n="vv" place="margin">They be the first words of <hi>Eusebius. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> to set down the succession of BB? chiefely, of those who next succeeded the Apostles in the Apostolicall Churches? But let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der iudge of the Refuter, and his cause, by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>The Fathers discerned not, or knew no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the calling or authority of the BB. which were in their owne time, and those which had beene before them, but thought and wrote of them as being alike, the chiefest of them in euery age from the Apostles, being BB. them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The refuter and his fellowes comming thirteene or foureteene, yea almost fiueteene hundred yeares after some of them, will needes haue a difference; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then it shall not stand, all the Fathers must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Idiots, for not seeing that which these learned men doe see. I greatly meruaile with what face, or rather
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10663:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with what conscience the refuter could auouch these things.</p>
               <p>The Nagatiue part of my reason,<note place="margin">§ 9. The second part of the third argument negatiue, that no instance can be giuen to the contrary.</note> he saith, <q>
                     <hi>is directly false in both the parts of it, as well for testimonies as examples</hi>
                  </q>. But I desire the reader to haue an eye to the refuters dealing, so shall he easily discerne to what poore shifts he is driuen: first consider, what was the assumption of my first Syllogisme, which by these foure arguments I doe proue; to wit, <hi>that in the first three hundred yeeres after Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles the gouernment by BB. was generally and perpetually vsed.</hi> This I proue in this third reason, by the testimonies of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, both affirmatiuely, that all antiquity, <hi>viz.</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Fathers, Histories, with one consent giue testimony to it: and also negatiuely, that no testimony or example of antiquity, no ancient Councill, Father or History, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of any antient orthodoxall or Apostolicall Church, can be produced to the contrary.<note place="margin">All the refuters instances either false or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</note> This any reasonable man would take to be my meaning.</p>
               <p>Now consider his instances, wherein he spendeth aboue sixe leaues; and if any one of them be both true and direct to the purpose, then say that I haue no iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>First for testimonyes:</hi> We haue pregnant testimonies, <hi>saith he,</hi> of the ancients, and of many sound writers in these latter ages, who affirme, that BB. and ministers were all one in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, and that one minister exercised not authority ouer his fellow ministers, as BB. since haue done and still doe.</q>
First, consider the persons of the witnesses, which he is about to produce, and then the things which they are to depose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for whereas I neuer meant to extend the negatiue part of my reason, further then the affirmatiue: and therefore as I said that the Councils, Histories, and Fathers, doe all giue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie to the Episcopall gouernment, so I meant that no pregnant testimonie either of Councils, Histories or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (which I comprised vnder the generall name of sound writer) could be produced to the contrary: he, for instance alledgeth a company of new writers in this present age, as if they were competent witnesses to depose in a matter of fact, or to testifie what was done or not done in the Church
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10663:281"/>
foureteene or fifteene hundred yeeres agoe: or as if when I chalenge them to shew any one testimony of antiquity to the contrary, it were a sufficient instance, to oppose against me a sort of new writers, who for the most part also are parties in the cause. But yet what shall these witnesses te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie? forsooth two things: First, <hi>that in the Apostles times BB. and ministers were all one:</hi> whereunto in the first place I answere, that this deposition is not to the purpose. In this argument I speake of what was in the first three hundred yeeres after Christ and his Apostles; but he will make his witnesses to depose what was in the Apostles times: perhaps he will say, the conscience must build it selfe vpon the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Apostles times: (but say I) in this reason I proue, that the Episcopall gouernment was in vse in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, because it was generally and perpetually vsed in the next three hundred yeeres after the Apostles times; which consequence himselfe hath granted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gainst the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption therefore he should bring his witnesses, if they had any thing to say; and not to be so absurd, as by them to deny my conclusion againe, the Ancients that say BB. and Presbiters were all one in the Apostles times, speake of that part of their time, when as in the most places there were no BB. or at least not chosen from among the Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: for before there were such BB. the same persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were called <hi>Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri</hi>: but when BB. were chosen out of the Presbiters, which they also confesse was done in the Apostles time (as namely at <hi>Alexandria</hi>) they professe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hier. ad Euagr.</hi>
                  </note> that then those which were so chosen and placed in a higher degree aboue the Presbiters, began to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led BB.</p>
               <p>The other thing, which he will haue his witnesses testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie is, that <q>
                     <hi>in the Apostles times one Minister did not exercise authority aboue another as BB. since haue done</hi>
                  </q>: to which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, I am sure no sound writer will depose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for I pray you, were not the Apostles ministers? were not <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> ministers? were they not also superiour to other ministers? did they not exercise authoritie ouer them? If
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10663:281"/>
                  <hi>Timothie</hi> therefore and <hi>Titus</hi> were superiour to other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and exercised authoritie ouer them; why may not BB. who succeed not onely them (whether they were BB. or not) but also the Apostles in the gouernment of the Church, be superiour also to other ministers, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise authoritie ouer them?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But come we to his witnesses,<note place="margin">§ 10. The refuters instances out of the old wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Ignatius, Iustin Martyr, Tertullian.</hi>
                     </note> whereof he would seeme to haue great store: howbeit, he will content himselfe with a few, and he <hi>will passe by</hi> Ignatius, Iustin Martyr, <hi>and</hi> Tertullian, as hauing done their seruice already:</q>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et the reader vnderstand, that this is a most vaine flourish: for he is not able to produce any one testimonie out of any one of the Councils, Histories or Fathers, that speaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the gouernment of the BB. in the first three hundred yeeres, in respect either <hi>facti</hi> or <hi>iuris,</hi> that is, as either deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Church was so gouerned then, or that it ought to haue beene so gouerned.
And as for <hi>Ignatius, Iustin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the greatest advantage he could haue by them, was to vse their names: for there is not a word in them sounding against the gouernment of BB. but preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant testimonies for them: especially in <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> whom I haue often quoted in this cause.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the refuter did alledge these Authors as witnesses to proue that fond and vnlearned conceipt, that the ancient Churches were no other but Parishes, to proue that which is more fond, that there is and ought to be no other visible Churches indued with power of Ecclesiasticall gouernment, but Parishes. But the vanitie of his conceipt, and the weakenesse of his allegations, haue I hope beene sufficiently layd open before in the defence of the second point.
<hi>Passing therefore by them, the refuter will</hi> begin with <hi>Cyprian,</hi>

It was debated indeed, but nothing to this present purpose. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, that the B. was wont to vse the aduise of his Presbiters; though in his time it was growne out of vse: and the matter debated betweene vs, was, whether those Seniors, were Ministers, as I proued, or Lay-elders as the refuter pretended; but whether they were the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the authoritie and gouernment of the B. was no more impayred by vsing their counsell, then the authority of a Prince by vsing the aduise of his Counsellours: vntill such time and in such cases as by the Canons and Canonicall law their consent was required as necessarie.</p>

Of the testimonies which the refuter citeth, <q>three <note n="u" place="margin">

To these allegations I haue already made answere, which I doe breifely repeate; that in the Apostles times before BB. were ordayned, the Churches were gouerned by the common counsell of the Presbiters, as vnder the Apostles: and vntill the BB. were elected from among the Presbiters in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral Churches, the names of <hi>Presbiters &amp; Episcopus,</hi> were confounded, but when BB. were chosen out of the Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

               <q>Therefore in the three hundred yeeres after the Apostles the Churches were not gouerned by Diocesan BB.</q>

                     <hi>The Bishops preferment, saith</hi> Ierome according to the refuters allegation, <hi>was not by necessitie of law, but gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him to honour him withall.</hi> 
                  </q>In that Dialogue, there is a controuersie betweene the true Christian, and the Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian: the true Christian would haue those which were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by <hi>Arians,</hi> to be baptised againe, before they should be receiued againe vnto the communion: because by their baptisme, who belieued the Father alone to be God, the Sonne a creature, and the holy Ghost the seruant of both, the holy Ghost was not communicated: the Luciferian held, they might be receiued without baptisme, by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands, whereby the holy Ghost should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, which before they had not receiued: and to that purpose alledgeth the practise of the Apostles, who by imposition of hands gaue the holy Ghost to those whom <hi>Philippe</hi> the Deacon had baptised; and the custome generally receiued of the Church, that BB. by imposition of hands doe communicate the holy Ghost to them that are baptised.
The true Christian replyeth, that BB. vse to impose hands onely on those who were baptised in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true faith, and that by the baptisme giuen by a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of Deacon, the holy Ghost also is conferred. But,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10663:285"/>
saith he, <hi>if here you demaund why hee that is baptized in the Church receiueth not the holy Ghost but by the hands of the B. whom we hold to be giuen in true baptisme; vnderstand, that this obseruation is deriued from that authority that the holy Ghost after the ascension of the Lord descended vpon the Apostles: and the same thing we finde done in many places, ad honorem po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Sacerdotij, quàm ad legis necessitatem; more for the honour of the Episcopall function, then for the necessitie of a law. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, if onely at the prayer of the B. the holy Ghost doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, then lamentable is their case, who in Villages and Townes, and in other remote places, being baptized of Presbiters and Deacons, doe depart out of this life, before the B. visite them: the safety of the Church dependeth on the dignitie of the B. &amp;c.</hi> as hath beene oft alledged.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Ierome</hi> speaketh of this one prerogatiue of BB. the refuter extendeth to his whole preferment, or prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence; and saith, <q>
                     <hi>he hath it not by any necessitie of law, but is granted to him to honour him.</hi>
                  </q>
The preheminence of the B. in generall, <hi>Ierome</hi> supposed to be of such necessity as that the safety of the Church dependeth vpon it; but for this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of giuing the holy Ghost, he saith, there was no such necessitie: because in the Baptisme by a Presbiter, or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con before the B. imposeth his hands, the holy Ghost is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed.</p>
               <p>But as I said, this testimonie is also impertinent, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that for which it is brought. For it is a strange infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: their preheminence was giuen not of necessitie, but to honor them; therfore the Church was not gouerned by them in the three hundred years after Christ, &amp; his Apostles. Neither is it impertinent only to his purpose, but also it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth for me: for if BB. had their preheminence in the primitiue Church, as here it is presupposed: then their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is proued to haue beene in vse: but whether it were by an honour voluntarily giuen them, or by necessitie of law, that in this present point is not materiall.</p>

                  </q> is added by the Refuter: and the <hi>gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> he talketh of, was not a yeelding vpon necessitie, but a modest cession from his right. <hi>Augustine</hi> towards the end of the Epistle earnestly desireth <hi>Ierome,</hi> that hee would boldly correct him, wherein hee should thinke it needfull: <hi>Quanquam enim secundum honorum vocabula, quae iam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae vsus obtinuit, Episcopatus Presbyterio maior sit, tamen in multis rebus Augustinus Hieronymo minor est; licèt etiam â minore quolibet non sit fugienda vel dedignanda correctio.

               </p>
               <p>In that <hi>Episcopatus</hi> is a name of greater honour then Priesthood, it is to be ascribed to the vse and custome of the Church; for at the first they were confounded.

               <p>These are all his witnesses,<note place="margin">§ 16. His allegations out of new Writers answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> besides some, with whose names onely, without their testimonies, he thought best to make a simple flourish. Now if any one of these allegations were reduced into the forme of a Syllogisme, concluding the contradictorie to my assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that some auncient Councils, Histories, or Fathers doe testifie that in the three hundred yeares after Christ and his Apostles, the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by BB. was not generally and perpetually vsed, it would appeare to euery one how ridiculously our refuter argueth. As for example:
<q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Danaeus, Musculus, Iunius, &amp;c.</hi> doe testifie, that in the three hundred yeares after Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles the gouernment by BB. was not generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
                     <p>Therefore some ancient Councils, Histories, or Fathers, doe testifie so much.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, but you speake of sound Writers in generall, will he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10663:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
say, and so I conclude: Therefore some sound Writers doe testifie so much. But it is plaine say I, that I meane the ancient.</p>
               <p>But to his argument such as it is, I answere: first, that if these Writers had testified that which is contayned in the antecedent, yet had not they beene competent witnesses in a matter of fact fourteene or fifteene hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time, the greatest part of them being also parties in the cause. But indeede not all, no nor any one of his witnesses doth testifie that in the three hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apostles the gouernment of Bishops was not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receiued; but all his allegations accommodated to that conclusion, are most ridiculous. As for example: in in the Apostles times Bishops and Presbyters were the same. Therefore in the three hundred yeares after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, the gouernment by Bishops was not receiued. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were ordayned not by Gods law, &amp;c. Therefore they were not in the first three hundred yeares: and so of the rest.</p>
               <p>But some body will say, though these testimonies be impertinent to the present purpose, and I must needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that your Refuter did grossely abuse his vnlearned Readers in making such a flourish with them: notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, some of the allegations contayne assertions contrarie to some points in your Sermon. Of whom, in steed of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, if I should aske this question, whom hee conceiueth to be aduersaries to vs in this cause? he would answere, those that stand for the pretended discipline. And who be those? <hi>Caluin, Beza, Danaeus, lunius, Sadeel,</hi> and the most of those whom the Refuter hath alledged. If they be aduersaries in this cause, is it to be wondred that they haue deliuered contrary assertions? and if they be parties in the cause, are their testimonies to be admitted? Verily, he might better haue alledged M. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and M. <hi>Trauers,</hi> then some of those whom hee did cite, being more parties in the cause then they, as not onely hauing written in defence of their discipline, but liuing where it is practised; but that hee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10663:288"/>
knew the simple Reader, vvho cannot be ignorant that <hi>T. C.</hi> and <hi>W.

               <p>And thus hauing turned ouer,<note place="margin">§ 17. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 125.

But marke I pray you, vvhat vvas my assertion, vvhich hee vvould seeme to contradict. Was it not this, that no example of any Orthodoxall or Apostolicall Church can be produced, to proue that in the three hundred yeares after Christ and his Apostles the gouernment by Bishops vvas not generally receiued? No: saith hee, vvhat say you then, to the <hi>Churches of Heluetia, France, lowe Countries, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">I omit here how shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he belyeth the Doctrine of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, and Sweueland, as opposite to the gouernment of BB. quoting <hi>Harmon.

And thus the former part of my assumption is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.

               <p>Wherefore seeing the proposition of my syllogisme was so euidently true,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> as that the refuter could not deny it, <hi>viz.</hi> that gouernment which was generally and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally receiued in all Christian Churches in the first three hundred yeeres after Christ and his Apostles, and not orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by generall Councils, was vndoubtedly of Apostolicall institution: and seeing the assumption was proued by foure or fiue vnanswerable arguments, that the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by such Bishops as were described in the former part of the Sermon, was generally and perpetually vsed in all Christian Churches in the first three hundred yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ and his Apostles, and not ordayned by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councils; therefore the conclusion is of necessarie and vndenyable truth, that the gouernment of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by such Bishops was vndoubtedly of Apostolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>

The syllogisme was this:
<q>
                     <p>That gouernment which no where was in vse in the first three hundred yeares, is not of Apostolicall institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>Therefore it is not of Apostolicall institution.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition is as certaine as the former; the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I haue already proued in the former syllogisme. For if the gouernment by Diocesan BB. was generally and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually receiued in those three hundred yeares after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: then is it manifest, that this gouernment, which they speake of, was no wherein vse. But because it is infinite to proue such a negatiue by induction of particulars, which might be disproued by any one instance by them which hold the affirmatiue; therefore I left the proofe of the affirmatiue to the refuter. Let vs see then how he answeareth; forsooth by opposing the like syllogisme, saying:
<q>
                     <p>That gouernment which was generally in vse in the first three hundred yeeres, is of Apostolicall insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                     <p>The gouernment of the Churches by a parity of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and assistance of onely-gouerning Elders in euery parish, was generally in vse in the first three hundred yeeres.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is of Apostolicall institution.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And then braggeth that <q>
                     <hi>his proofe for their discipline is as good as mine against it.</hi>
                  </q> Wher the refuter doth not so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray his ignorance in the lawes of disputation, as the badnes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10663:291"/>
of his cause; choosing rather to boast, that their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was generally and perpetually vsed, then to giue any one instance to proue it.
what needed this generall asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vnlesse it were to beguile the simple who are lead with shewes, when one perticular instance would haue serued? But that the reader may vnderstand, that this my assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was vndoubtedly true, I will make the refuter this faire offer; that if he can bring any one pregnant and approued example of a Christian Church gouerned by a parity of ministers, and assistance of onely-gouerning Elders, I will promise to suscribe to their discipline. wherefore let not the reader be carried away with vaine shewes, neither let him belieue, that their pretended discipline was instituted by the Apostles, vntill they be able to shew (as they neuer will be) that it was sometime and some where practised within three hundred yeeres say a thousand foure hundred if you will after the Apostles.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>I reckon without mine host</hi>: &amp; yet confesseth it to <hi>be true according to their opinion who hold there may be but one gouernment in the Church, and that instituted by the Apostles</hi>; </q>which is the generall opinion of the Disciplinarians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in effect by himselfe, <hi>Pag.</hi> 130.
Yea but I say after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in fauour of the Disciplinarians (therein clawing a Churle, according to the homely prouerbe, as appeareth by this refuter) that though the gouernment by BB. is the best; yet we doubt not but where this may not be had, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be admitted, neither doe we deny but that siluer is good, though gold be better.
<q>
                     <hi>If therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>there be diuers kindes of gouernment which may be admitted, then might there be a gouernment in the Churches in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times not contradicted by them, which yet was not of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall institution.</hi> 
                  </q>whereto I answere: first, that I did not say
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10663:292"/>
simply, that other gouernments may be admitted besides that which was ordained by the Apostles, but where that cannot be had.
But whiles the Apostles liued, that which they ordayned might be had. Againe, if any in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times should of their owne heads haue altered the forme of gouernment established by them, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently haue set vp a worse, it cannot be thought, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apostles would haue allowed it, or that all Churches would haue retayned that gouernment, vvhich they had not receiued from the Apostles. Besides, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that in the Apostles times any forme of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was vsed in the Apostolicall Churches, but that which was ordayned by the Apostles: and therefore the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more then manifest.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the assumption: vvhereof are two parts, the one, that the gouernment by BB. was vsed euen in the Apostles times, the other that it was not contradicted by them.</p>
               <p>The former I proue by two arguments: the one because the seauen Angels were in the Apostles times, and they were BB. for the substance of their calling such as ours be: and therefore such BB. were in the Apostles time.</p>

                  <note place="margin">§ 2. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 128. His answer to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</note>
Ere the refuter will answere to the matter of the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he propoundeth two things <q>
                     <hi>worthy his obseruation: the one, that I confine the number of the Angels to seauen, which neither the text doth</hi> (saith he) <hi>nor himselfe euer did till now:</hi>
                  </q>
Did not I before obserue in the Sermon, that there was but one Angell in each of the seauen Churches; and doth not the text say, that the seauen Starres are the Angels of the seauen Churches? I haue spoken of this point before, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let the refuter call to mind this argument among the rest.</p>
               <p>The text saith the Starres were seauen.</p>
               <p>The text saith that the Angels be the Starres.</p>
               <p>Therefore the text saith the Angels be seauen.</p>
               <p>The other is, that I <q>
                     <hi>shunne the terme Diocesan, in which notwithstanding the whole question consisteth: for no man doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10663:292"/>
that the gouernment was by BB. in the Apostles times, seeing that both ministers and ruling Elders were called BB.</hi> 
                  </q>doth he not speak against the light of his owne conscience, when he saith I auoid the name <hi>Diocesan,</hi> seeing in expresse termes I said, they were for the substance of their calling such as ours be?
If I had onely said Diocesan, he might haue excepted in behalfe of the learneder sort of Disciplinarians; that they doubted not but that the Angels were superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the City and countrey adioyning; but all the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion (would they say) is, of the superiority, whether they had a singular preheminence for terme of life, a superiority in degree, a maiority of power in respect of ordination and iurisdiction: when as therefore I say, that for the substance of their calling they were such BB. as ours are, I doe say, not onely that they were Diocesan, but also that they were superiour to other ministers in degree, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But whence I pray you, hath the refuter this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence so boldly to affirme, that their ruling Elders were called BB.? <hi>Caluin</hi> and M. <hi>Trauers,</hi> &amp;c. confesse that BB. signifie onely preaching Elders, and are your Lay-elders now become BB? the people may haue ioy of such guides that cease not to broach such fansies.</p>
               <p>After he hath played a little vvith the assumption,<note place="margin">§ 3. His answere to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the proofes therof.</note> hee<q> 
                     <hi>plainely denieth it: what thinke you,</hi> saith he, <hi>M. D. bringeth to proue it? Nothing</hi> saith the refuter, <hi>but that which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beene answeared:</hi>
                  </q> if that were true, yet that nothing is more then the refuter will euer be able to disproue: and that is this, that the seauen Angels were BB. all doe confesse:
that they were such BB. as ours be for the substance of their calling, I proued in the first foure points of the Sermon: yea but saith he,
<q>
                     <hi>I haue proued that for the substance of their calling they were but ordinarie ministers:</hi> let the reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Gods name iudge <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the euidence which hath beene brought on both sides and where he saith, I <hi>quickely haue done with the scriptures, because they indeed afford but slender shew, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
I answere first, that I had no reason to insist longer in this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10663:293"/>
proofe, vnlesse I would haue repeated the former part of the Sermon againe: was it not sufficient to referre them to the former part where this point was professedly handled? neither is he ignorant, but that in demonstration of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the assumption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I bring other proofes out of the scripture. But faine he would disgrace our cause with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as though we had no proofes in scripture: which ill becommeth him, that hath not one sillable in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or other monuments of antiquity to proue their Presbiterian discipline.</p>
               <p>But it is vntrue, that I bring nothing to proue the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, but what was before answered. For I bring two other arguments, to proue that these seauen Angels were such BB. The former, though this great analyser either did not, or would not see it: that two of these Angels were <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus</hi> and <hi>Onesimus, Polycarpus</hi> the B. of Smyrna, and <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus</hi> the B. of Ephesus, and what is said of two, is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the rest. That <hi>Polycarpe</hi> was in these times the B. of Smyrna, I proued by the testimonie of the Church of Smyrna <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eus. l.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 15.</note>, testifying that he had beene the B. of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church in Smyrna. And of <hi>Bullinger</hi>

Whereunto may be added those authenticall testimonies which after are alledged, that he was made B. of Smyrna by S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> That <hi>Onesimus</hi> was B. of Ephesus at this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I proue by the testimonie of <hi>Ignatius</hi> who liued at the same time, who in his Epistle to the Ephesians mentioneth their B. <hi>Onesimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The latter argument prouing that these seauen Angels were BB. is, because from them all a succession of BB. was continued in those seauen Churches to the Councill of Nice, and afterwards: for to omit, that the auncient BB. of these Churches are sometimes occasionally mentioned <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eus. l.</hi> 5. <hi>ca.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. <hi>Sozo. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note>, as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycrates</hi> of Ephesus, <hi>Thraseas</hi> of Smyrna, <hi>Melito</hi> of Sardes, &amp;c. it is euident, that the Bishops of these Churches sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to diuerse of the ancient Councils, as to the councill
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10663:293"/>
of Nice, <hi>Menophantes</hi> B. of Ephesus, <hi>Eutychius</hi> of Smyrna, <hi>Artemidorus</hi> of Sardes, <hi>Thomasion</hi> of Philadelphia, <hi>Serras</hi> of Thyatira, <hi>Nunechius</hi> of Laodicea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Council of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon, <hi>Stephanus</hi> of Ephesus, <hi>Aethericus</hi> of Smyrna, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius</hi> of Pergamus, <hi>Helladius</hi> of Thyatira, <hi>Florentius</hi> of Sardes, <hi>Megalus</hi> of Philadelphia, <hi>Nunechius</hi> of Laodicea. To this argument the Refuter answereth nothing in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>With these two arguments the refuter ioyneth that which I propounded <hi>Pag.</hi> 63. concerning the succession of Bishops in some Churches within the Apostles times, being indcede the second argument, whereby I proued the assumption, that in the Apostles times were BB.</p>
               <p>To all these he answereth,<note place="margin">§ 4. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 129.</note> first ioyntly, and then cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with some of them seuerally. His ioynt answere to them all, I reserue vntill I come to that second argument. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of Smyrna, which himselfe heretofore alledged as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, being now alledged by me, so hard is my hap, is growne suspitious: and why I pray you? for the Refuter trauailed of a point of learning, which he desired to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered of.
<q>Forsooth because <hi>it vseth the word Catholicke, which is not to be found in any of the Epistles of</hi> Polycarpus, <hi>or</hi> Ignatius, <hi>nor seemeth to haue beene in vse vntill the end of the second age.</hi> Clemens Alexandrinus <hi>I thinke is the ancientest in whom it can be found.</hi>
                  </q> How many Epistles of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> this Refuter hath read I know not; for my part I haue seene no more but his Epistle to the Philippians <note n="d" place="margin">

But to the point, was not the Creed of the Apostles as ancient as this Epistle, which writeth of the martyrdome of <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> who was put to death in the seauenth of <hi>Aurelius Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> about the yeare one hundred sixtie and nine? and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10663:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet that mentioneth the Catholicke Church.

               <p>Where I proued, that Epistle of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or at least that testimonie which I cited concerning <hi>Onesimus</hi> their Bishop, not to be counterfait, because <hi>Eus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The second argument, whereby I proue the former as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption is this,<note place="margin">§ 5.

                     <hi>Iranaeus. Eusebius. Epiphanius. Augustine. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>, of best credit in the Church of God, that in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, reckoning vntill the death of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that is, to the yeere of our Lord one hundred and one, there were not onely BB. but also a succession of BB. in diuerse Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: as at Rome, <hi>Linus, Anacletus, Clemens, Euaristus:</hi> at Ierusalem, <hi>Iames</hi> the iust, and <hi>Simeon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cleophas:</hi> at Antioch, <hi>Evodius</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi>: at Alexandria, S. <hi>Marke, Anianus, Abilius, Cerdo</hi>: hereto he saith, that<q> 
                     <hi>he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly shewen, that if not all, yet the most of these witnesses doe affirme that those BB. were ordinary ministers, without any such supreame power</hi> (he ought to say if he would leaue his calumniating superiority in the power) <hi>of ordination and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</hi>
                  </q>
But this is one of his vsuall bragges, vttered with what conscience I know not: for what one of these hath he or what one among all the ancient Writers can he bring to make good his assertion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:10663:294"/>Now the answere, which he maketh to these arguments ioyntly,<note place="margin">His ioynt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> is,
<q>
                     <hi>that the seauen Angels, and these Bishops whereof there were,</hi> as I said, <hi>successions in the Apostles times were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops indeed</hi> (no meruaile for so were the lay Elders) <hi>but not Diocesan: for what though long after the Apostles times they were so, doth it follow thereupon, that therefore they were so in their times?</hi>
                  </q> If euer there had beene within the compasse of a Diocesse more Bishops then one at once since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times, or if it could be truly alledged, that the circuit of the Bishops charge was enlarged from a Parish to a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse; then were there some colour for this exception, but these conceipts I haue disproued heretofore, and therefore doubt not most confidently to conclude, that if the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of these seauen Bishops, or of the others whom I named, as hauing beene Bishops in the Apostles times, were in the end of three hundred yeares Diocesan Bishops; then were their first antecessors such.
Neither is his example of the Duke of Venice to the purpose; vnlesse hee could proue, that the latter Bishops within the first three hundred yeares had vsurped or vsed, as they were Diocesans, a greater and larger authoritie then had belonged to their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
               <p>The latter part of the assumption remaineth to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,<note place="margin">§ 6. The latter part of the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Episcopall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was not disallowed by the Apostles.</note> where I said that the Bishops were not contradicted by the Apostles, but approued by them. Hee obiecteth, that <q>
                     <hi>this proofe is needlesse</hi>
                  </q>, seeing the Bishops were such as he fansieth: but till he can disproue the former part of my Sermon, and of this Treatise; hee must giue the Reader leaue to thinke they were such, as they haue beene mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly proued to be: but this <hi>needlesse</hi> accusation, being commonly vsed by the Refuter against such passages of my Sermon as are most materiall; maketh me conceiue there is somewhat in this point, that hee could wish had beene spared, or at least whereabout he meaneth to spare his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. That this passage was not needlesse, but very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, appeareth hereby. For if I had onely said, that BB. had beene in the Apostles times, and therefore were of their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10663:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
institution, it might haue beene obiected, that there were abuses crept into the Churches in the Apostles time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of notwithstanding the Apostles were not Authors: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this place I shew that Bishops not onely were in the Apostles times, but also were approued by them. That they were in respect of their function approued, I proue, by the examples of the 7.

Though that word doth not proue it, neither was it alledged to that end, but as one of the titles of commendation giuen to <hi>Epaphroditus</hi>; yet the word <hi>Apostle,</hi> which I alledged, doth proue it; neither should the Refuter haue balked that, to lay hold vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vnlesse it were to deceiue the simple. It is therefore to be noted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as the twelue Patriarches of Christs Church, which were sent into the whole world, some going one way, some another, were called the Apostles of Christ, and not the Apostles of any Church in particular (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iames,</hi> who was the Apostle of the Iewes) so those Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall men, who were set ouer particular Churches as the Bishops thereof, were for a time called the <hi>Apostles</hi> of those Churches.

briefly, that the Bishops <hi>Ierome</hi> speaketh of, were not Diocesan Lords; but such as himselfe describeth, where hee sheweth the custome of the Church of Alexandria, &amp;c.</q>
Whether they were called Lords, or not, it is not greatly materiall; seeing they were called <hi>the Angels,</hi> and <hi>the Apostles</hi> of the Churches, which are titles of greater honour; neither doth it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the substance of their calling; in regard whereof I defend the ancient Bishops to haue beene such as ours are.

If by <hi>Elders,</hi> he meaneth the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gouerning Elders, as well as Ministers (as hee doth, or else he saith little for the pretended discipline) I answere, that the Church was neuer gouerned by the common Counsell of such Aldermen: neither did <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> testifie it, nor D. <hi>Bilson,</hi> D. <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> or D. <hi>Downame</hi> confesse it.</p>
               <p>If by <hi>Elders,</hi> he meane onely Ministers, as <hi>Ierome</hi> did, when he said, <hi>at the first the Churches before factions did arise, were gouerned by the common counsell of Elders,</hi> two things may be questioned: first, whether this gouernment of theirs were vnsubordinate, according to the new discipline; and secondly, whether the Apostles did intend, that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches should be so gouerned still. Whereunto I answere, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the euident light of truth, that the Presbyters gouerned the Churches, as vnder the Apostles, and that but for a time, vntill the Apostles substituted BB. or left them as their successors, committing the gouernment of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Churches vnto them.</p>
               <p>To the second part of his assumption I answere, that the Apostles contradicted that gouernment (which hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, by common counsell of Elders ruling without a B.) not so much by words as by deeds: when ordayning BB. in seuerall Churches, they committed the whole care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as <hi>Ierome</hi>

For he might haue said, though they ordayned the persons, yet Christ instituted the function, and that is the iudgement of many of the Fathers, who holde that our Sauiour Christ in ordayning his twelue Apostles, and his seauentie two Disciples, both which sorts he sent to preach the Gospell; he instituted the two degrees of the ministerie BB. answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the high Priest, and Presbyters answerable to the Priests.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10663:297"/>
ordayned Apostles, that is to say, Bishops.</hi> For the Popish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, that the Apostles were not made Priests till Christs last supper; nor BB. till after his resurrection, as it is sutable with other their opinions deuised to aduance the Popes suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; so it is repugnant to the iudgement of the ancients, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth. Seeing the very Disciples, who were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Apostles, were authorized before Christs last supper, to preach &amp; to baptise. Neither had they, or needed they, any new ordination, whereby they might be qualified to administer the Sacrament. But of this matter I will not contend: for whether the function were first ordayned by Christ or instituted by the Apostles; Christ is the authour thereof, either immediatly, according to the former opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or mediatly, according to the latter. And those things are said to be of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apostolicall institution, which Christ orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apostles.</p>
               <p>The antecedent of my argument,<note place="margin">§ 2. That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles ordayned Bishops.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apostles ordayned BB. and committed the Churches to them: was in the Sermon explaned, and proued, by shewing the time when, the places where, the persons whom, the Apostles ordayned BB. As concerning the time;<note place="margin">The time when in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Church at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</note> I said there was some difference betweene the Church of Ierusalem, and the rest in respect of their first Bishop. For there, because shortly after Christs passion a great number were conuerted to the faith (for we read of three thousand conuerted in one day) and because that was the mother Church, vnto which the Christians from all parts were afterwards to haue recourse; the Apostles before their dispersion, <hi>statim post passionem Domini, straight wayes after the passion of our Lord,</hi> orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Iames</hi> the iust Bishop of Ierusalem, as <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Catal. scrip.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ierome</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</p>
               <p>Here my refuter maketh me to argue thus; culling out one part of my argumentation from the rest;
<q>Iames was ordayned Bishop by the Apostles, therefore the Apostles orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bishops. <hi>And then</hi> denieth the consequence, because though <hi>Iames</hi> being an Apostle had Episcopall power in respect of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and iurisdiction, yet it would not follow that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10663:298"/>
ordayned Diocesan Bishops in other Churches.</q>
But my argument is an induction, standing thus. The Apostles ordayned BB. at Ierusalem, and in other Churches, (which afterwards particularly I doe enumerate) therefore they ordayned BB. That they ordayned BB. at Ierusalem, I proue, because they ordayned <hi>Iames</hi> the Iust, and <hi>Simon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> BB. of Ierusalem. That they ordayned <hi>Iames</hi> B. of Ierusalem, I proue in this section. That they ordained <hi>Simon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cleophas</hi> B. of Ierusalem, and Bishops in other Churches, I proue afterwards, according to the order of time: Beginning here with Ierusalem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Church had first a Bishop.</p>

                  <hi>&amp; that is, that</hi>
                  <q> if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles ordayned <hi>Iames</hi> B. of Ierusalem, then they gaue him the Episcopal power; but they gaue him no power which the Lord had not before inuested in his person, as an Apostle; therefore they did not ordayne him B.</q>
I answere by distinction; the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (if I may so terme it) <hi>Iames</hi> had before, as those who are Bishops, <hi>sine titulo</hi>; but the power of iurisdiction was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him when he was designed Bishop of Ierusalem, and had the Church of Iewry in particular assigned to him. For though our Sauiour Christ bad the Apostles to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the world; yet his meaning was not, that euery one should trauerse the whole world: For if euery one had been
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10663:299"/>
to trauell ouer all the world, great inconuenience, disorder, and confusion would haue followed thereof. Therefore the Apostles, who by our Sauiour were indefinitely appointed to goe into all the world, by the direction of the holy Ghost, before their dispersion from Ierusalem, deuided the world among themselues; in such sort, that one being assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one part, &amp; another to another, euery man walked vvithin his owne compasse, and according to his owne Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non <note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.13.15.16. <hi>vide Chryso. in</hi> 2 Cor. 10. <hi>&amp; gloss. ordin.</hi>
                  </note> or rule, and did not vsually build vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another, nor enter one into anothers labours. Now, as they were carefull to prouide for other parts of the world; so vvould they not all forsake Iewry and Ierusalem, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe one of their company to take charge thereof. Who, though he wer an Apostle, yet being assigned to the peculiar Church of one nation, might not vnfitly be called, as he was indeed, the B. thereof. And hence it is, that although the Apostles vvere commanded to goe into all the world, yet <hi>Iames</hi> stayed at Ierusalem vntill his death.
Secondly he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth exception against the euidence which I brought; first, because <q>

But suppose, that none of the disciples of the Apostles in those few writings of theirs which be extant, had giuen testimony to this matter: were not the testimony of <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> who both liued in the very next age to the Apostles, sufficient? It is not to be doubted, but that <hi>Iames</hi> his being B. of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem was a thing as notorious, and as certainely knowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians in those times; as there is no doubt made among vs now, that D. <hi>Cranmer</hi> was Archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time.</p>
               <p>In the third place he would seeke to descredit all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes in generall; because the most learned B. of Ely, in a Sermon preached when he was of Chichester, truely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, what might be obiected against historians of latter times. But <hi>Eusebius</hi> is free, as I suppose, from that imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and much more <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> in whom also that cauill of his hath no place, that they spake of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops which had beene before, according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in their times. For such was the estate of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and of the Iewes in their times; as that the condition of the Bishops there was rather impayred, then increased. Neither were they, nor any other, whom I cited, so simple, but that they knew as well as the refuter, that <hi>Iames</hi> was an Apostle; neither did they know any reason, which the refuter would seeme to know, why his being an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle should hinder his being the Apostle, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of that Church. For so were the Bishops at the first called.</p>

But how is this proued? forsooth because two or three late writers (worthy men
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10663:300"/>
I confesse, D. <hi>Whitakers,</hi> Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> D. <hi>Raynolds</hi>) doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that he was Bishop there. If they all had denyed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t, as they did not; yet without any disparagement to them, the affirmation of so many ancient writers in a matter of fact, agreeable also with the scriptures, proued by the succession of the Bishops of Ierusalem, remayning yet in diuers good authors vpon record, besides other euidence, may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh their denyall.
But what if they all did not deny it? to D. <hi>Raynolds</hi> I know not what to say, the refuter onely maketh a shew with his name, neither alledging his words, nor quoting the place. <q>He citeth Bishop <hi>Iewels defence of the Apology, pag</hi> 300. <hi>telling</hi> Harding <hi>out of</hi> Clemens <hi>Epist.</hi> 1. <hi>that</hi> Iames <hi>was no otherwise B. of Ierusalem, then ouer all the other Churches</hi>; where is no such matter.</q>
Indeed in the 300. page. of his reply vnto <hi>Harding,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">B. <hi>Iewel</hi> doth not deny <hi>Iames</hi> to haue been B. of Ierusalem.</note> in the fourth article; I find the first Epistle of <hi>Clement</hi> alledged, but Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> misalledged and falsified.

The Pope himselfe, though he claime to be vniuersall Bishop, yet is he specially Bishop of Rome; and his cathedrall Church is the Church of Laterane, of which he is Bishop.

                     <hi>that he neither was, nor might be B. of Ierusalem.</hi> I promise you, this maketh a faire shew, if it be true. But this also is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest vntruth. For the arguments that he vseth, are to proue, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not Bishop of Rome. Yea but <hi>the same are as effectuall to proue that</hi> Iames <hi>might not be Bishop of Ierusalem</hi>: and therefore to these eight arguments he doth referre <note n="e" place="margin">

                     </note> me.</q>
But this also is vntrue. For six of these eight, are such, as the refuter with all his sophistry cannot with any shew of truth applie to St. <hi>Iames.</hi> For his third argument, taken from <hi>Peters</hi> long absence from Rome, after he was according to their opinion B. there cannot be, applyed to <hi>Iames,</hi> who was resident at Ierusalem; as the Actes, besides other witnesses, testifie. Nor the fourth, that if <hi>Peter</hi> were B. then had he two Bishopricks. For he had beene by their owne doctrine as well B. of Antioch, as of Rome. But no such thing can be obiected against <hi>Iames.</hi> Nor the fift that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10663:301"/>
whiles <hi>Peter</hi> liued <hi>Linus</hi> was B. of Rome: so he was indeed by the appointment of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. But whiles <hi>Iames</hi> liued none was B. of Ierusalem, but he. But after he was dead, <hi>Simon</hi> was chosen to be his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor. Nor the sixt, that the authors which mention <hi>Peters</hi> going to Rome, note this to haue beene the end, not to be B. there, but to oppose <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> But the cause of <hi>Iames</hi> his staying and continuing at Ierusalem was to take charge of that Church, which, during his life, had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther B. Nor the seauenth, that if <hi>Peter</hi> were B. of Rome then would he haue professed himselfe the Apostle of the Gentiles, neither would he haue conuenanted with <hi>Paul,</hi> that he and <hi>Barnabas</hi> should take care of the Gentiles, but himselfe, and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> of the Circumcision. For <hi>Iames</hi> as he is said to haue beene B. of Ierusalem; so hee professeth himselfe to haue beene the Apostle of the Iewes. For besides, that he writeth his Epistle <note n="f" place="margin">

Neither is it for nothing that both in the 15. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he is noted as President, or chiefe in that Councill, and in the 2. <hi>Chapter</hi> to the Galathians. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of such Apostles, as were at Ierusalem, he giueth the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to <hi>Iames</hi> before <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> Nor the eight, for they that say <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of Rome, say <hi>Paul</hi> was also, meaning that they were both founders of the Church, but <hi>Linus</hi> was the B. to whom they both committed the Church as <note n="g" place="margin">

                     <p>Bishops haue certaine Churches assigned to them.</p>
                     <p>The Apostles had not certain churches assigned to them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Apostles were not Bishops.</p>
                  </q>
The assumption is to be distinguished according to the times. For when Christ gaue them their indefinite commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note n="h" place="margin">Mar. 16.15.</note>, <hi>goe into all the world,</hi> hee assigned no Prouinces, nor parts of the world to any. Notwithstanding, before they were to goe abroad, he willeth them to stay at Ierusalem, till they had receiued the holy Ghost, who should direct them what to doe; and we may be assured, that he did not direct them to goe confusedly, but distinctly, some to one part of the world, some to another. Howbeit, when they ceased to trauaile in their olde dayes, and rested in some chiefe Citie where they had laboured; they were reputed Bishops of that place, where they rested: though some of them perhaps were not properly Bishops. And this is true of <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the most of the Apostles. But herein <hi>Iames</hi> differeth from the rest: for to him at the first, before their dispersion, the Church of Ierusalem was assigned. Neither did he trauaile, as the rest, from one Country to another, being not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to any one Prouince; though in the end of their trauels some of them made choise of some speciall place, where they rested, exercising (no doubt) a patriarchall authority, as it were, in that circuit, where they had trauailed, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches. Thus <hi>Iohn</hi> rested at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and others in other places. That assumption therefore, which is true of the rest of the Apostles, is not true of <hi>Iames:</hi> and were to be denied if the Syllogisme were thus framed.
<q>
                     <p>BB. had certaine Churches assigned to them:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iames</hi> had not a certaine Church assigned to him:</p>
                     <p>Therefore he was not B.</p>
                  </q>
This assumption I haue disproued. And therefore though that argument may seeme to conclude sufficiently against <hi>Peters</hi> being B. of Rome; it concludeth not against <hi>Iames</hi> his being B. of Ierusalem. And besides, betweene <hi>Iames</hi> and the rest this difference may be noted; that whereas they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing planted Churches, when they saw their time, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10663:302"/>
the same to certaine BB. (so <hi>Peter</hi> and others of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles committed <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Evodius; Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> committed Rome to <hi>Linus; Paul</hi> committed Ephesus to <hi>Timothie</hi>; Creet to <hi>Titus; Iohn</hi> committed Smyrna to <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus,</hi> and diuers other Churches in Asia to other Bishops, as <hi>Eusebius</hi>

                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 23.</note> reporteth; yet <hi>Iames</hi> abiding all his time at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, committed that Church to no other; though when he was dead, the Apostles committed it to <hi>Simon,</hi> whom they ordayned his successour.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The second reason applied to <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Iames</hi> were B. then by the same reason other of the Apostles were BB.</p>
                  <p>But the other Apostles were not Bishops properly; Therefore not <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Why I should not grant this consequence, I haue shewed sufficient reason in setting downe the difference betweene <hi>Iames</hi> and the rest of the Apostles. Therefore that reason also, howsoeuer it may take place as touching <hi>Peter,</hi> in whom no such difference from the rest of the Apostles can be truly noted: yet it holdeth not against <hi>Iames</hi> his being B. of Ierusalem.</p>

Hereunto the Refuter replyeth,<note place="margin">

                  <q>
                     <hi>But yet, that he might let his Reader see, that he is able to defend any thing against me; he saith,</hi> if a man would speake so vntruly and vnreuerently, he might easily maintayne it against the answere that M. <hi>D.</hi> bringeth. They must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>saith he,</hi> that he was an Apostle, and his honour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree by his Bishopricke not impaired. As if the question were not of him, as a B. not as an Apostle. His superiority in degree proceeded from his Apostleship, and yet as a B. he might be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour in order onely. This tricke of fast and loose was not worth the shewing, vnlesse it could haue beene done more cleanely.</q>
To returne these trickes of fast and loose to such a shifting Sophister, as I haue proued the Refuter to be; it is plaine, that <hi>Beza</hi> speaketh simply of <hi>Iames,</hi> as the chiefe in the Church of Ierusalem, as wel in respect of the Apostles, as the Presbyters there. And therefore considereth him as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, as well as a B. And if he had intended any such distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Refuter imagineth, hee should haue conceiued, that <hi>Iames</hi> his honour and degree by his Bishopricke was impaired, and that the Apostles in choosing him to be B. of Ierusalem, should rather haue depressed him, then done him honour. But they thought it a singular honour to be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10663:303"/>
the Apostle or Bishop of that Church which Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had founded. And therefore as <hi>Clement</hi> noteth, the chiefe of the Apostles, <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> though Christ had vouchsafed to them greater honour then the rest, yet would not arrogate <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Euseb. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> to themselues that honour, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Iames</hi> the iust the brother of our Lord thereunto; and when it was void againe by his death, they made choise of <hi>Simon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cleophas</hi> for the same cause <note n="o" place="margin">

The graue censure of the Refuter is, <q>
                     <hi>that</hi> Clements <hi>speech is vnsauourie, and the respect carnall which</hi> Hegesippus <hi>and</hi> Eusebius <hi>alledge.</hi>

Thus is hee able, as it were with a breath, to blowe away these worthy Authors, <hi>Hegesippus, Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi>; they are not able to stand before him. But why <q>

                  </q> when the Apostles were to be dispersed into diuers parts of the world, was it not a speciall honour for one amongst them, without that trauaile &amp; wandring, wherto the rest were subiect, to be set ouer the mother Church of Christendome, which Christ himselfe had founded, to be the Apostle of that people which had sundry prerogatiues aboue all other Nations, and in respect of that place to haue a precedence before the other Apostles,<note place="margin">

<q>
                     <hi>if it were so great a priuiledge, why might it not haue aduanced him to a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree aboue the rest of the Apostles?</hi>
                  </q> because the Apostleship
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10663:303"/>
being the highest degree of the Ministerie, this was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test honour to haue a priority and precedence in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
<q>
                     <hi>Yea, but</hi> I denie him to haue beene B. when I say, that whereas before the Apostles had ioyntly gouerned the Church of Ierusalem, that charge which before they had in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now to depart co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him in particular; but their charge was of Apostles, not of Bishops.</q>
As though the charge of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles is not by the holy Ghost called <note n="r" place="margin">Act. 1.20.</note>

                  </gap>, that is Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke; and as though <hi>Iames,</hi> who before was an Apostle absolutely, did not by this designement become the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the Iewes. Neither was this <q>
                     <hi>a clipping of his wings</hi>
                  </q>, as it pleaseth the Refuter to speake, more then of the rest of the Apostles, when by mutual consent euery mans Prouince as it were, circuit and charge was assigned to him. But I spake not without booke, deliuering mine owne conceipts as the Refuter euery where doth: but what I said, I receiued from their owne, and almost onely Author <hi>Ierome,</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued also from <note n="s" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>As touching the other point,<note place="margin">§ 9. By this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Iames</hi> BB. proued to haue had their singular prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence for terme of life.</note> though the Refuter would scarsely vouchsafe to touch it as being impertinent; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, it not onely confuteth the conceipt of those who hold Bishops were but for a short time, and not for terme of life; but also proueth plainly that <hi>Iames</hi> was B. of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. I therefore shewed that he continued at Ierusalem, <note n="t" place="margin">Act. 15. &amp; 21. Gal. 1. &amp; 2. <hi>Hieron, Catal. Euseb. hist. &amp; Chron.</hi>
                  </note> as the superintendent of that Church vntil his death, ruling the same by the space of thirtie yeares, after that manner as his successor after him ruled it eight and thirty yeares. Yea, but <q>
                     <hi>this doth not proue that he was B.</hi>
                  </q> Neither was it so much alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to that end, as to shew the preheminence which he had was not (as <hi>Beza</hi> saith of all the ancient Bishops, which hee acknowledgeth to be diuine) for a short time, or by course; but for terme of life. And yet it proueth the maine point also, that he was B. and as the <hi>Geneua</hi> translators confesse <note n="u" place="margin">In Act. 21.18.</note>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:10663:304"/>
superintendent of that Church.
For if he were not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of that Church, that is to say the B. why did not he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of other Apostles trauaile into other parts, but continued there ruling that Church by the space of thirty yeares, vntill his death? Forsooth <q>
                     <hi>hee did not stay so much to rule that Church, for that might haue beene otherwise performed, as to conuert the multitudes of Iewes which should resort thither.</hi>
                  </q>
Where, hee saith, the Church might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise haue beene gouerned, it is nothing to the purpose, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he can shew, that it was otherwise gouerned. There is no doubt, but that Church had a Pastor assigned to them by the Apostles, who would not leaue that mother Church as a flocke without a shepheard. But what Pastor had it, if <hi>Iames</hi> who continued there, and ruled it for thirtie yeares were not the Pastor thereof? There is no doubt to be made, but the cause and end of his staying there thirtie yeares, was the same of his successour <hi>Simons</hi> staying there thirtie eight yeares, and of his successours euery one vntill their death.
Wherefore was it not great pitie that the Refuter did<q> forget himselfe to spend so much time in things that were so impertinent?</q>

               <p>The difference in respect of the time, which before I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwixt Ierusalem and other Churches, I doe in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction explane; shewing, that the Apostles did not at the first planting of them appoint Bishops to them, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the ascension of Christ, they appointed a Bishop ouer the Church of Ierusalem: yeelding these reasons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as yet there was neither that choise, nor yet that vse of them among a people which was to be conuerted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10663:304"/>
it needed to be gouerned; and shewing what course they did take, before they appointed Bishops, namely, that first they ordayned Presbyters <note n="vv" place="margin">Act. 14.23. &amp;c.</note> to labour the conuersion of the people, to feed them being conuerted, and to attend them in common, gouerning them after a priuate manner, and as it were in <hi>foro conscientiae.</hi> And this is that, which <hi>Ierome</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">In Tit. 1.</note> saith, that the Churches at the first before Bishops were appointed ouer them, were gouerned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon counsell of the Presbyters. But the Episcopall power which consisteth specially in the right of ordination, and in the sway of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction committed to one; I said the Apostles each of them retayned in their owne hands, as was manifest <note n="y" place="margin">2 Thess. 3.14. 1 Cor. 5.</note>, whiles eyther they continued neare them, or meant not to be long from them. All which while, Bishops were not so needfull, the Apostles prouiding for the necessitie of those Churches, either by their presence, or by their letters and messengers. And this I noted to be the cause, why in the writings of the Apostles, Bishops are so seldome (though not so seldome as some imagine) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and the name with Presbyter confounded. But when as they were to leaue the Churches altogether, either by departure from them or by death (that the Churches should not be left fatherlesse, they fulfilled that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. according to <hi>Augustines</hi> and <hi>Ieromes</hi> exposition, <hi>in steed of Fathers,</hi> that is, the Apostles, <hi>there shall be children borne vnto thee, whom thou shall make Princes ouer all the earth,</hi> that is, Bishops succeeding the Apostles in the regiment of the Church) At their departure they left substitutes, and at their death appointed successours, to whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the gouernment of the Churches, furnishing them by a singularitie of preheminence, both with the right of Ordination and with the power of Iurisdiction, as vvell ouer the Presbyters, as the people of each Citie with the Countrey adioyning.

                     <hi>which is most manifest.</hi> Belike, <hi>saith he,</hi> they were needfull before, but the Apostles would put off the matter till there was no remedie, and I cannot much blame them if it be true which D. <hi>Bilson</hi>

It is more meruaile therefore that they would ordaine any Bishops at all, as long as they liued, then that they would deferre the doing of it so long as they could.</q>
Which words, as they contayne a meere cauill at my words, not worth the answering; so a meere belying of that reuerend B. who saith, that the Apostles could not loose that (<hi>viz.</hi> the power of imposing hands and deliuering vnto Sathan, which the Fathers call Episcopall power) vnlesse they lost the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleship withall.</p>

Here, in complayning of the want of proofes, he giueth sufficient proofe of a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. In this section I did but in generall (hauing noted the difference of the time) declare, what course the Apostles tooke, first in deferring the choise of Bishops; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in appointing them. The proofes doe follow in the sections following, shewing the places where, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom the Apostles ordayned Bishops. That imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of speaking <hi>Pythagoras</hi> like, hee hath often layd vpon

me, and yet not so oft as vniustly, who haue in this Sermon and in this Treatise deliuered nothing almost without plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull proofe or sufficient authority.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee carpeth at the names, wherewith I said the first Bishoppes were called, asking <q>
                     <hi>what is all this to the matter. Would he prooue they were Diocesan Bishops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were called by these names?</hi>
                  </q> what a notorious cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is this? may nothing be spoken but by way of proofe? may nothing be said by declaration, or explanation, or preuention?
I knew it was obiected, that Bishops are not mentioned in the scriptures, the name <hi>Episcopus</hi> Bishop, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giuen to Prebyters: and therefore that is not like, they were ordayned by the Apostles, of vvhom no mention is in the Scriptures. For preuention of this obiection, or assoyling this doubt, I declared first, that the Bishops in the writings of the Apostles are called, sometimes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Churches, sometimes their rulers, sometimes their Apostles.
<q>Yea, but <hi>in my former Sermon I gaue all these names saue onely the name of Apostles to all ministers.</hi>
                  </q> The former Sermon is of ministers in generall, including the Bishops, and diuers things there spoken of ministers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, doe principally belong to Bishops.

                  <q>But <hi>by what authority</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">§ 12. Whether Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of the Churches.</note> 
                     <hi>is the title of Apostle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to BB?</hi> he would haue said, communicated to them with the twelue.</q>
For I know no man so foolish, as to appropriate it to the Bishops. This reason I rendred, why they be called the Apostles of the Churches; because they succeeded the Apostles in the gouernment of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches: whereof I gaue instance <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25. where <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> who was the B. or Pastor of Philippi, is therefore called their Apostle. <hi>Therefore?</hi> saith he.

<q>
                     <hi>Yea but he hath two reasons to proue his to be the more likely sence. First,</hi> as the words following in the same <hi>Verse</hi> and <hi>Chapt. 4.18.</hi> doe shew, how he ministred to him; so the same phrase is vsed to the like purpose, <hi>2 Cor. 8.23.</hi> where the brethren sent with <hi>Titus</hi> to receiue the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans beneuolence, are called Apostles, that is, messengers of the Churches.</q>
I acknowledge, that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> brought a gratuity from the Philippians to <hi>Paul</hi> to supply his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, being a prisoner in Rome. And the brethren likewise who accompanyed <hi>Titus,</hi> were to receiue the beneuolence of the Corinthians; but it is vnlikely; that either he, or they, were called the Apostles of the Churches in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. It appeareth by diuers of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles, that when the churches did send one vpon a Christian Embassage, the B. commonly was entreated to take that Embassage vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. In like manner the Philippians, being to send as it were vpon Embassage to <hi>Paul, Epaphroditus</hi> their B. vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke that voyage He being therfore both their B. and their Embassadour, it is more likely, that he was called their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle because he was their Bishop; then for that hee was their Embassadour. For it is vnlikely, that the name of that sacred function of the Apostles of Christ, who also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is the Apostle of our profession, should be vsed in the Scriptures to signifie the messengers of men. Besides, in both places, the Apostle intendeth by this title highly to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10663:307" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commend <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and the others; but this had beene but a small commendation, that they were messengers of the Churches. Againe, if they in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. were called <hi>the Apostles of the Churches,</hi> because they were their messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; then those Churches should haue sent them: but it is euident, that <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe sent them, for as it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: so had hee vndertaken, to procure a supply for the reliefe of the brethren in Iudaea, who were oppressed vvith famine.

               </p>
               <p>Here the Refuter whiles he goeth about to discouer my ignorance (as though I knew not the signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as well as he) bewrayeth his owne. For it is euident, that in the Scriptures the vvord is vsed with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as vvell to the parties to vvhom, as to the party from vvhom, the Apostle is sent. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> calleth himselfe the Apostle of the Gentiles <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 11.13.</note>

And euen as <hi>Angels</hi> absolutely spoken, is a title of all ministers who are sent of God, but vsed with reference to the Churches whereto they are sent (as <hi>the Angels of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Churches</hi>) doe signifie the Bishops or Pastors of the same churches; so <hi>Apostoli,</hi> absolutely vsed is a title of all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours <note n="(vv)" place="margin">Ro. 16.7.</note> sent from God with authority Apostolicall, though <gap reason="foreign">

This is written, as the most of the booke, to bleare the eyes of the simple. For I cannot thinke he which would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this cause, was so void of iudgement, as the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here would shew himselfe to be, if he wrote sincerely. For I pray you, what was the point which here I had in hand? was it not to shew, that the Bishops at the first in the Apostles times were called Apostles? and doe I not proue it by this instance, that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> being the Bishop of the Philippians, is therefore called their Apostle?
<q>Admit it be so, <hi>saith the refuter,</hi> yet how shall it be proued, that Philippi was a Diocesan Church, and how weakely with that, doth M. D. inferre, that he was a Diocesan Bishop, like to ours for the substance of his office. All men see he deceiueth his reader with the like equiuocation in the word Bishop, which in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times by his owne confession was common to all Pastors, though afterwards appropriated to some speciall persons: <hi>as if
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10663:308"/>
he should haue said, I grant that which here you doe proue, but yet that followeth not hereon, which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not.</hi>
                  </q>
That the Churches were Diocesses, and the Bishops Diocesan, like to ours for the substance of their office, I proued before in the former part: here, I am so farre from inferring or prouing it, that I presuppose it, as sufficiently proued before. But this is the poore shift, which the refuter vsually flyeth vnto, when he hath nothing to answere.
He perswaded himselfe (such was his iudgement) that in the question of parishes and Diocesses he had the vpper hand: and therefore, when he is foiled in any of the points following, he flyeth to that as his refuge; <q>
                     <hi>yea but though this be so as you say, yet the Church was not a Diocese, nor the Bishop a Diocesan.</hi> But how little reason he hath to imagine Philippi one of the <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 16.12. <hi>Sedul. in Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>Philippi Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis Macedoniae.</hi>
                     </note> cheife Cities of Macedonia, to haue beene a parish Church; may be gathered by that, which before hath beene said of the like Cities. Where he saith, I <hi>goe about to deceiue the reader with the like equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word Bishop</hi> he doth me wrong.</q> But he and his consorts deceiue the readers, when they would perswade them, that because in the Apostles writings and for some part of the Apostles time, the names <hi>Episcopus &amp; Presbyter</hi> were confounded, namely vntill Bishops began to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from among the Presbyters; that therefore the offices were confounded.
For here I shew, that when Presbyters were called <hi>Episcopi,</hi> those who euer since the Apostles times haue beene called Bishops, were then called the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the Apostles of the Churches, to whom, as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before out of <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Theodoret,</hi> those who were then called <hi>Episcopi,</hi> that is Presbyters, were subiect.</p>
               <p>For as I said in the Sermon,<note place="margin">§ 16. When &amp; how long BB. were called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of the Churches.</note> whiles the Episcopall power was in the Apostles and Apostolicke men, those who had that power were called Apostles; and therefore <hi>Ambrose</hi> by <hi>Apostles</hi> in some places <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 4.11. 1 Cor. 12.28.</note> of Scripture, vnderstandeth Bishops: and to the like purpose <hi>Cyprian:</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">l. 3. Epist. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostolos, id est, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopos &amp; praepositos dominus elegit, the Lord chose Apostles, that is Bishops and Gouernours.</hi> For as <hi>Theodoret</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Theodor. in</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> hath well
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10663:309"/>
obserued on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>In times past,</hi> saith he, <hi>they called the same men Presbyters and Bishops, and those who now are called Bishops they named Apostles. But in processe of time, they left the name Apostle to those who are properly called Apostles, and the name of Bishop they gaue to them who had beene called Apostles. Thus</hi> Epaphroditus <hi>was the Apostle of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> Titus <hi>of the Cretians, and</hi> Timothie <hi>of the Asians.</hi> Which testimony, if it be conferred with some before cited out of <hi>Ierome,</hi> the truth concerning this matter will appeare to be this. Whiles the Bishops were Apostles and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke men (for such were the first Bishops) the Angels of the Churches were also called the Apostles of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, other Ministers being then called <hi>Presbyteri &amp; Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi</hi> indifferently; but when the first Bishops being dead, their successours were to be chosen out of the Presbyters, (which <hi>Ierome</hi> noteth to haue been done at Alexandria euer since the death of S. <hi>Marke,</hi> and was done in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where were no Euangelists, or Apostolicall men remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) then they left the name Apostle, and for difference sake called him the Bishop. Wherefore as I said in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, it was not long, that the name <hi>Episcopus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with Presbyter. For <hi>Ignatius,</hi> (who was a B. aboue thirtie yeares in the Apostles time, after that <hi>Evodius</hi> had beene B. of Antioch aboue twenty yeares before him) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriateth the name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to a Bishop; and vsually distinguisheth the three degrees of the Clergie, as the Church euer since the Apostles hath distinguished them, by these three names, Bishop, Presbyter, and Deacon.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Yea, but</hi> we may gather out of <hi>Theodorets</hi> testimonie, <hi>saith the Refuter,</hi> that the report which M. D. maketh of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his appropriating the name of Episcopus to a Diocesan Bishop, is without any sufficient warrant. For seeing <hi>Ignatius</hi> liued in the Apostles times, and died within sixe yeares after S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, that in processe of time the name of B. was imposed; it is not likely <hi>Ignatius</hi> should be the imposer of it. No man includeth the processe of time within the compasse of sixe yeares any man will thinke.</q>
The processe of time, wherof <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:10663:309"/>
speaketh, was as appeareth by conference of him with <hi>Ierome</hi> in the Apostles time. At the first, towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apostles time, the Gouernours of the Churches were called Apostles; but in processe of time, when the first Bishops who had beene Apostles or Apostolicall men were dead, and now were to be chosen out of the Presbyters, which was towards the latter end of the Apostles times; then they began to be called <hi>Episcopi,</hi> Bishops. And that this was so, appeareth not onely by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vseth the word as the first and highest degree of the Clergie, Presbyters as the second, and Deacons as the third: but also by other monuments of antiquity which I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Sermon.</p>
               <p>I haue the longer insisted on this point, because it is of great consequence. For hereby it appeareth first that when the name Presbyter and <hi>Episcopus</hi> were confounded, yet the offices of Bishops and Presbyters were not confounded. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that Bishops being then called <hi>Apostoli,</hi> were supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to other Ministers who were called <hi>Presbyteri &amp; Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi.</hi> And lastly, that such Bishops as were superiour to other Ministers, were in the Apostles times, and mentioned in the Apostles writings.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this section and the two next following, I proue that <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were by S. <hi>Paul</hi> ordayned Bishops: the one of Ephesus, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Creet, and maintaine the same assertion against their obiections. Afterwards, I shew out of other the auncientest monuments of antiquitie, that other BB. of other places, were ordayned by the Apostles.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This, <hi>saith the Refuter,</hi> is the last supply to maintaine the former antecedent, by shewing the places where, and the persons whom the Apostles ordayned Bishops.</q>
                  <hi>If this faile he is vndone.</hi> As who should say, that all which hitherto hath beene said, hath by him beene very learnedly and sufficiently refuted. When as in truth hee hath not beene able to confute any one sentence or line of the Sermon hitherto, with sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of reason, or euidence of truth. And the like assurance I haue of that which followeth.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were by the Apostle ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bishops: I proue by a two-fold reason, which I ioyned together, &amp; is thus to be dissolued: the former standing thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If in the Epistles to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> it be presupposed that <hi>Paul</hi> had ordayned <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Bishops of Ephesus and Creet, then is it true, that they vvere by him ordayned BB. of those Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:10663:310"/>But the antecedent is true: Therefore the consequent.</p>
               </q>
               <p>That the antecedent is true I proue by this reason; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is presupposed in the Epistles, that the Apostle had committed to them Episcopall authority, both in respect of Ordination, and Iurisdiction, to be exercised in those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Against which consequence this onely thing can be obiected, that the Episcopall authority might be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them not as ordinarie Bishops or Pastors of those Churches, but as extraordinarie gouernours or Euangelists, which afterwards is answered.</p>
               <p>To this argument the Refuter answereth not.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 137.</note> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he frameth thus:
<q>
                     <p>If the Epistles written to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> be the very patternes and precedents of the Episcopall function, whereby the Apostle enformeth them, and in them all Bishops how to exercise their function, then <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Bishops.</p>
                     <p>But the antecedent is true: Therefore the consequent.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>First, he taketh exception against the proposition, saying, <q>
                     <hi>though it make a goodly shew yet was it confuted long agoe by M. Cartwright.</hi>
                  </q> Whose confutation either he thinketh to be insufficient, or else he doth but kill a dead man in seeking with a new on-set to disproue the consequence.
First, for the consequence it selfe, I auouch thus much; that from that antecedent, I might not onely haue inferred that particular, that therefore these two to whom the Epistles were written were Bishops: but in generall, that the function of Bishops; whose authority and office is described, and the manner of the execution thereof prescribed in the directions giuen to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in these Epistles, hath warrant in the word of God: and when they can make as good an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their lay-elders, out of the Scriptures, I will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to their Presbyterian discipline.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>T. C.</hi> answere to that consequence,<note place="margin">§ 2. <hi>T. C.</hi> answere refuted.</note> I haue taken spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall notice heretofore; and did greatly wonder, that hee could satisfie himselfe with such a friuolous answer. And I do no lesse wonder at the Refuters either lacke of iudgement,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10663:311"/>
who tooke that answere for good payment, or want of consideration and care of <hi>T. C.</hi> credit in referring vs to so sleight and friuolous an euasion.
<q>
                     <hi>For whereas D.</hi> Whitgift <note n="h" place="margin">Pag. <hi>404.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>argueth thus,</hi> That <hi>Timothie</hi> was Bishop, the whole course of the Epistles written vnto him declareth, wherein is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the office and dutie of a Bishop, and diuers precepts peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly pertayning to that function; T. C. <note n="i" place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> part. <hi>1.</hi> pag. <hi>312.</hi>
                     </note> answereth, <hi>that</hi> by this reason he might as well proue that <hi>Timothie</hi> was a deacon, or a widdowe, an olde man or an olde woman, seeing in those Epistles the Apostle wrote of their duties. Yea, rather that hee was a Deacon, considering that there is nothing in the description of a Deacon which agreeth not to him, but in the description of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop that which he requireth of not being giuen to wine, and not being a young Christian, could haue no place in <hi>Timothies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</q>
Not to argue with <hi>T. C.</hi> but to let him rest in peace; can the Refuter be so ignorant, or without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to thinke, that D. <hi>Whitgift</hi> when hee spoke of the whole course and tenure of the Epistles, did meane onely the description of a B. or Minister set downe in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third chapter of the former Epistle? if that had beene his argument, hee had argued thus: <hi>Paul</hi> directeth <hi>Timothie</hi> what manner of men to ordayne Bishops or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and likewise Deacons. Therefore <hi>Timothie</hi> himselfe was a B. or Minister, or likewise a Deacon. Is it not plaine, that by the whole course hee vnderstandeth all those dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which are giuen to <hi>Timothie</hi> throughout the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles for the discharge of his office, either in respect of the Ministerie common to all Ministers, or of his Episcopall function, chiefly in regard either of Ordination or Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, vnto which heads the precepts &amp; directions in those Epistles are to be referred? for when he speaketh of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men and women, olde and young, hee directeth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie,</hi> and in like manner <hi>Titus</hi> 
                  <note n="k." place="margin">Tit. 2.1.15.</note> what to preach. When hee describeth the qualities of Ministers, and Deacons, and Widowes; he directeth him what manner of Ministers and Deacons to ordayne, and Widowes to admit. And whereas D. <hi>Whitgift</hi> hauing said, that in those Epistles diuers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10663:311"/>
pertaine peculiarly to the Episcopall function: <hi>T.C.</hi> chalengeth him to shew him any one precept in those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles which is proper to a B: It is not hard to shew him more then one, as, <hi>lay thy hands hastily on no man. Against a Presbyter</hi> or Minister <hi>receiue not an accusation but vnder two or three witnesses, &amp;c.</hi> These are perpetuall directions, which were not common, eyther to other Christians, or other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: therefore peculiar to BB. And this was <hi>T. C.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the Proposition: Now let vs heare what the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer can say.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Proposition <hi>saith hee,</hi>

                     </note> is grounded vpon a false supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>and what is that?</hi> that the Apostle by describing in these Epistles the rules to be obserued in ordination and iurisdiction, intended to informe <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> as BB. and in them all other BB. how to carry themselues in those matters. <hi>Is this the Supposition, whereon the Proposition is grounded?</hi>
                  </q>
Alas good man, you know not <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide supr. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> what the Hypothesis or Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of an Hipotheticall Proposition is: this which you suppose to be the Supposition of the Proposition, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Assumption of the Syllogisme, which your selfe fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>But because the Refuter hath confounded himselfe with his owne hypotheticall or connexiue Proposition, I will propound my Argument in another forme.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Whosoeuer describing vnto <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> their office and authoritie, as they were Gouernours of the Churches of Ephesus and Creet, and prescribing their dutie in the execution thereof, and that as afterwards I shew to be performed by them and their Successours till the comming of Christ, doth plainely describe the office and authoritie, and prescribe the dutie of BB: hee doth presuppose them to be BB; the one of Ephesus, the other of Creet.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistles to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing vnto them their office and authoritie as they were Gouernours of the Churches of Ephesus and Creet, and prescribing their dutie in the execution thereof to be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10663:312"/>
performed by them and their successours vntill the comming of Christ, doth plainly describe the office and authority, and prescribe the duty of BB.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistles to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> presupposeth them to be Bishops, the one of Ephesus, the other of Creet.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This Proposition, because I know not what can be obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted against it. <hi>T. C.</hi> and the Refuter hauing assailed it in vaine, I will once againe take for granted.</p>
               <p>The assumption I proue by those particulars, wherein the Episcopall authoritie doth chiefly consist, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Ordination, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. and also of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, they being the censurers of other Ministers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.10.11. and 3.9. and iudges of their persons and conuersation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19.20.21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. to which proofes he answereth nothing.

                  <q>
                     <hi>The summe of that which he obiecteth against the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, is this, that</hi> though <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were by <hi>Paules</hi> direction to doe those things, which Bishops arrogate to themselues; yet they were to doe them by an higher power, and therefore not as Bishops.</q>
Whereto I answere, that they were to be done by a power vvhich vvas to continue in the Church vntill the end; and therefore not by a higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer then Episcopal. And secondly, that the power Episcopal, whereby Bishops doe these things which <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had in commission, is so much of the Apostolicall power as was to continue in the Church vnto the end.</p>

                     <hi>The assumption it selfe hee denyeth, saying,</hi> these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10663:312"/>
are not precedents of the Episcopall function, &amp;c. <hi>The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his deniall is this.</hi> What though Bishops haue now got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that power into their hands, yet were not those instructions giuen to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> as Bishops, (the Apostles drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of no such soueraigntie) but particularly to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> as Euangelists, and in generall to the Presbyters, to whom the charge of those affaires belongeth. To the Euangelists, to administer in all the Churches of those Regions, whither the Apostles sent, or where they left them: to the Presbyters, to administer in their seuerall congregations or Churches. </q>
                  <hi>Hee said euen now that</hi> Timothie <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>did those things which BB. doe by a higher power, &amp; now he saith he Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle dreamed not of any such soueraignty, as the BB. haue.</hi>
Where he saith these instructions were not giuen to BB. but particularly to these Euangelists to performe them in all Churches and Regions where he should place them, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to Presbyters, &amp;c. both parts are false. For these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections <hi>Paul</hi> gaue to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to be obserued of them as they were particularly assigned gouernours of the Churches of Ephesus and Creet, and are such as are to be obserued to the end. Neither are these instructions giuen in generall to Presbyters, neither doth the charge of these affaires belong to them. And that these things belong to the BB. I haue sufficiently proued before<note n="r" place="margin">

               <p>To make the matter plaine, he bringeth in an example, which is worth the hearing.
<q>Suppose, <hi>saith he,</hi> a Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where the common-wealth is gouerned by the people; it must needs be that in such a place there are lawes for the choosing and ordering of Officers. What if this gouernment fall into the hands of the Nobilitie, which continue the same lawes, still in the same cases? What if some mightier then the rest, at the last make himselfe sole Gouernour, still obseruing those funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall lawes, which were at the first established: is it to be saide, that those lawes are the verie patternes and precedents of the Aristocraticall, or Monarchicall gouernement, whereby the first maker of those lawes would enforme, in the one, the Nobilitie, in the other, the Monarchie,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10663:313"/>
and in them, all other, how to exercise that function? The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Church matters touching ordination and iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, was first in the seuerall Churches, or congregations; which by their Presbyteries had the menaging of all Church businesse: in processe of time, it came to be restrayned to the Clergie onely, the B. and his Presbyterie of Ministers onely; at last, as things grew worse and worse, the B. like a Monarch got the reynes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne hands. Now though the lawes of Ordination and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction remaine the same, and the practise also in some sort; yet are they not patternes and presidents either of the second or third kinde of gouernment; neither were they giuen to instruct the Bishop alone, or the Bishop and his Clergie together.</q>

                  <note place="margin">§ 5. Schismaticall nouelties broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer.</note>Which comparison I desire may be well considered, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially by the vnlearneder sort; for hereby they shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, what manner of guides they haue desired to follow. For, not to contend with him about his politicke proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not well agreeing with the rules of policy, wherein we are taught, that the appointment of chiefe Officers being reckoned <hi>inter iura maiestatis,</hi> doth alwayes belong to them who haue the soueraigntie; in the whole comparison, but especially, in the reddition, we may behold the trim <hi>Idea</hi> of discipline, which the fancie of our Refuter and his fellow-challengers hath forged. For he conceiueth, as if he were a Brownist, or an Anabaptist, that the ancient state of the Church was Democraticall; that the right of Ordination and Iurisdiction, was in the whole congregation of euery Parish, which by their Presbyteries (consisting for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the laity) had the menaging of all Church-busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; that the lawes and Canons for Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment set downe in the Epistles to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were first prouided for this popular state of the Church. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, by the vsurpation of the B. and his Clergie, the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar state was turned into an Aristocraty, the B. and his Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie of Ministers onely menaging the Church affaires. Lastly, in processe of time, this Aristocraty was turned into a Monarchie, the B. like a Monarch hauing got the reynes into his owne hands. Now the lawes concerning Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10663:313"/>
and iurisdiction are still in force; yet were they not pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes neither for the Monarchicall gouernment of the B. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, nor for the Aristocraticall gouernment of the Bishop and his Presbytery of ministers, but for the popular and golden state of euery Parish which within it selfe had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie immediately deriued from Christ sufficient for the gouernment of it selfe in all causes Ecclesiasticall. This forme is propounded also in the modest and Christian of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of disputation. Haue not our forwarder sort of people bin well aduised thinke you, to doate vpon such leaders as these, who broach such a sort of dreames and dotages, for which they haue not so much as the shew of any sound proofe? Our refuter hath often times obiected against me, though most vniustly, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi>-like, I looke to be creditted vpon my bare word; but what proofes I pray you doth hee bring for these schismaticall nouelties?</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">§ 6. His nouelties breifly refuted.</note> it is here presupposed, that euery Church indued with power of Ecclesiasticall gouernment, was a Parish, &amp; all Church officers Parishionall. Which dotage I haue before refuted. Secondly, that the forme of Church-gouernment was Democraticall, or popular, the cheife authority being in the people. Which hath authority (to be exercised partly by themselues, &amp; partly by their Presbytery) to elect, ordayne, depriue &amp; depose their Pastor or B. for the proofe whereof the cheife burden must lye vpon <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>dic Ecclesiae,</hi> which hath bin before examined. <hi>Beza,</hi> making mention of one <hi>Morellius,</hi> who pleaded in like manner for the popular gouernment, giueth him this stile <note n="t" place="margin">

Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>str. c.</hi> 23. <hi>pag.</hi> 155</note>, <hi>Democraticus quidam fanaticus,</hi> shewing that these who plead that cause, are lead with a phantasticall &amp; fanaticall spirit. For is it not a phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy to vrge the peoples supremacy in Church-gouernment? is there any shew in scripture, or in reason, that the sheepe should rule their Shepheard, or the flocke their Pastor?</p>
               <p>But for the confutation of them, I referre them to other Disciplinarians, from whom they had their first grounds; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this fancy they seeke to ouerturne, as well those Churches where the Geneua discipline is established as ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:10663:314"/>The third dreame is, that the lawes of Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prescribed in the Epistles to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were prouided for the democraticall state of the Church. So that when <hi>Paul</hi> saith lay not thou hands on no man hastily, you must vnderstand the speech directed not to <hi>Timothie,</hi> to vvhom the Epistle was written, but to the people, that they should not suffer their Lay-elders when their minister is dead, to be hasty in laying hands on a new. And vvhen hee saith doe not thou receiue an accusation, &amp;c. it must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the people and Presbyterie. After two or three admonitions doe thou auoid an hereticke or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, that is, thou people. What of Creet? belike the whole Iland of Creet was a Parish too.</p>
               <p>The next fancy is, that the popular state of the seuerall Churches did first degenerate into an Aristocraty, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Monarchie. But it is as cleare as the light, that the seuerall Churches were at the first gouerned by the Apostles or Apostolicall men seuerally, and that either perpetually, as by <hi>Iames, Marke,</hi> &amp;c. or but for a time, as by <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. and that when the Apostles left the Churches, they committed them to other Apostolicall men, such as <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, Titus, Evodius, Simon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cleophas, Linus, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> &amp;c. communicating vnto them the same authority both for the worke of the ministery, and for the power of ordination and iurisdiction which themselues had in those seuerall Churches: and what authoritie each of them had, their successors in the seuerall Churches had the same. Neither haue our BB. at this day, greater authority in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging Church causes, then <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> and other the first Bishops had. Who was to ordaine ministers in Creet and to gouerne that Church? did not <hi>Paul</hi> commit these things to <hi>Titus,</hi> without mentioning, either of Presbytery, or people? are not all his precepts for ordination and Church-gouernment directed onely to <hi>Titus</hi> for Creet, &amp; to <hi>Timothie</hi> for Ephesus? and doth not this euidently shew, that howsoeuer they might vse either the presence, and consent of the people, or the Counsell and aduise of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10663:314"/>
Presbyters in causes of greatest moment, as Princes also doe in common-wealthes: yet the sway of the Ecclesiasticall gouernment was in them?</p>
               <p>It is therefore most plaine, that in the Epistles to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> it is presupposed, that they had Episcopall authority: and that the rules and directions giuen to them are precedents for Bishops and patternes vnto them for the exercise of their Episcopall function.</p>
               <p>And this I proue againe in my Sermon by another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">§ 7. Another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prouing that these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles are pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</note> which the refuter hath framed thus:
<q>
                     <p>Those things which were written to informe not <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> alone, as extraordinarie persons, but them and their successors, to the end of the world, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to informe Diocesan Bishops:</p>
                     <p>But those Epistles were written to informe not <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> alone as extraordinarie persons but them and their successors to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>Therefore they were written to informe Diocesan BB.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The assumption (for with that the refuter beginneth) I proued by testimony,<note place="margin">His answere to the assumption</note> and by reason. And first, by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.13.14.</note>, straightly charging <hi>Timothie,</hi> that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and directions, which he gaue him, should be kept inuiolable vntill the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ; &amp; therfore by such, as should haue the like authority to the end.<note n="b" place="margin">in 1 Tim. 6.14.</note> Hereof <hi>Caluin,</hi> saith thus, <hi>nomine mandati signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat quae hactenus de officio Timothie disseruit.

For <hi>Paul</hi> wrot to this end, to giue direction to <hi>Timothie,</hi> how he should behaue <note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15.</note> himselfe in the Church, which is the house of the liuing God.

               <p>The second testimonie was of <hi>Ambrose</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ambr. in</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.14.</note>, writing on those vvords of <hi>Paul,</hi> saying, that <hi>Paul is so circumspect; not because he doubted of</hi> Timothie <hi>his care, but in regard of his successors, that they after the example of</hi> Timothie, <hi>might continue the well ordering of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The proofe of the assumption.</note>The reason whereby I proued, that <hi>Paul</hi> giueth direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> onely as to extraordinary persons, but to them and their successors vntill the end of the world, was, because the authority which was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, for the execution whereof the Apostle giueth his directions, is perpetually necessary; without the which the Church neither can be gouerned (as without iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) neither yet continued (as without ordination) &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not peculiar to extraordinary persons; but by an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary deriuation to be continued in those, who are the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                     <hi>His answere to the proofe of the assumption.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>The effect of the refuters answere is, that he could be content to graunt this assumption, were it not that he is resolued to deny the conclusion, which followeth thereupon. For first, hee granteth</hi> 
                  <q>Pauls purpose to instruct those that should succeed <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> in the authoritie which they had, but not in their office. And that this authoritie was not, nor was to be, in the hands of any one particular man, but the right of it was in the whole congregation, the execution in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. So that the power of ordination and iurisdiction might be continued without Bishops, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:10663:315"/>It is sufficient for the truth of the assumption, which the refuter granteth; that what <hi>Paul</hi> did write to <hi>Timothie</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus,</hi> he wrote not to them alone as extraordinarie persons, vvhose authoritie should dye with them, but to those also which should succeed them in the like authoritie vntill the end.</p>
               <p>But whether the Bishops were to be their successours, or the whole congregation, or the Presbyterie, belongeth not to the assumption: but rather to the proposition. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, that which he saith, either in denying the Bishops to be the successours of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> or affirming the congregation and Presbyterie to haue succeeded them in the power of ordination and iurisdiction, is spoken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, as against the truth, so without proofe.</p>
               <p>I will therefore returne to the proposition,<note place="margin">§ 8. The proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion defended. And that the successors of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were BB.</note> which is grounded on this Hypothesis; that Diocesan Bishops were the successours of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> For if that be true, then is the proposition necessary, though the refuter <q>
                     <hi>flatly denyeth it</hi>
                  </q>. Thus therefore I reason:
<q>
                     <p>If the successours of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Diocesan Bishops, then those things which were written to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their successours were vvritten to informe Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Bishops:</p>
                     <p>But the successors of <hi>Timothie</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus</hi> were Diocesan BB.</p>
                     <p>Therefore those things which were vvritten to informe the successours of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> vvere vvritten to informe Diocesan Bishops.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the refuter, thinking he had as good reason to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the one part of this syllogisme, as the other, denyeth both. <hi>The consequence of the proposition is feeble</hi> saith he, <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it were certaine, that the Bishops both de facto were, &amp; de iure ought to haue beene their successors.</hi> That the Bishops were <hi>de facto</hi> their successors, &amp; of all other Apostolical men in the gouernment of the Churches, I haue already proued, and there vpon haue inferred, that <hi>de iure</hi> also they were. Because what gouernment was not onely generally receiued in the 300. yeeres after the Apostles, but also was in vse
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10663:316"/>
in the Apostles times, in the Apostolicall Churches, that without doubt was of Apostolicall institution.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The assumption I proue by two arguments: first, by this disiunction.</p>
                  <p>Either the Bishops were their successours, or the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, or (which the refuter would adde) the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
                  <p>But neither the Presbyteries, nor the whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had no greater, nor other authority and power vnder Bishops, then they had before, vnder <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Therefore the Bishops were their successors.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Againe, those who succeeded <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in the gouernment of the Churches of Ephesus and Creet, were their successors.</p>
                  <p>But the Bishops of Ephesus and Creet did succeed <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in the gouernment of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they were their successors.</p>
               </q>
               <p>These reasons the refuter saw not: onely he taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to answere the proofes of this last assumption.<note place="margin">BB. of Ephesus the successors of <hi>Timothie.</hi>
                  </note> And first, for <hi>Timothie</hi> his successors in Ephesus, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that not onely the Angell of the Church of Ephesus. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.1. whether it were <hi>Onesimus,</hi> or any other, was one of his successors, and <hi>Policrates</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">

For whereas in the Councill of Chalcedon, <hi>Stephanus</hi> the Bishop of Ephesus being deposed, some question did arise, whether the new Bishop who was to succeed were to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and ordained by the Councill, or by the Prouinciall Synode of Aisa; <hi>Leontius</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Chalc. Act.</hi> 11.</note> the Bishop of Magnesia in the Prouince of Asia, alledged that from St. <hi>Timothie</hi> to that time there had beene twenty seauen Bishops of Ephesus, all ordained there.</p>
               <p>To this he answereth nothing, but that which before hath been refuted; that <q>
                     <hi>howsoeuer the latter Bishops of those twenty
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10663:316"/>
seauen might be Diocesan, the former were not</hi>
                  </q>. For it is certaine, that both the latter and the former were not onely Diocesan, but also Metropolitan Bishops. And where I number the Angell of Ephesus in this rancke, he saith, that <hi>I tediously begge the question.</hi> But I appeale to the refuter himselfe, first, whether this Angell was not the B. and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the Church of Ephesus, secondly whether he did not succeed <hi>Timothie</hi> in the gouernment of that Church, thirdly, whether he was not one of those twenty seauen Bishops mentioned by <hi>Leontius</hi> in the Councill of Chalcedon. And the like may be said of <hi>Polycrates,</hi> who had beene the eight Bishop of his owne kindred, sauing that concerning him there is more euidence, that he being Bishop of Ephesus was the Metropolitane or primate of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia. For <hi>Eusebius</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 24.</note> saith, that he <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>he was the ruler or chiefe of the Bishops of Asia</hi>; who <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note> by his authoritie did assemble a Prouinciall Synode to discusse the question concerning Easter.</p>
               <p>As touching Creet,<note place="margin">The BB. of Gortyna the successours of <hi>Titus.</hi>
                  </note> because there is not the like eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the refuter taketh vpon him to deliuer diuers things without booke; as <q>
                     <hi>if Titus had successours in the gouernment of Creet, it would be auailable for Arch-bishops which were not bred a great while after, but it maketh nothing for Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san Bishops.</hi>
                  </q>
Whereto I answere, first, though such Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, as were also called Patriarches, were not from the Apostles times: yet such as are Metropolitanes, were. And againe, if Prouinciall Bishops may be proued to haue been from the Apostles times, much more may Diocesan. For euery Metropolitane is a Diocesan, but not contrariwise. And although I doe not remember, that I haue any where read of the next successour to <hi>Titus,</hi> yet I read of <hi>Gortyna</hi> the mother City of Creet, and the Metropolitane Bishops thereof, who were Arch-bishops of Creet, and successors of <hi>Titus</hi>; though not his immediate successours.

                     </gap>, their Bishop,</hi> for his renowned vertue. And although he called him the Bishop of the Churches in Creet: yet the Diocesan Churches had their Bishops too, as the Church of Gnossus a City of Creet, had <hi>Pinytus</hi> at the same time her Bishop, which proueth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue beene an Arch-bishop. <hi>Theodorus Balsamo</hi> saith <hi rend="sup">f</hi>, <hi>antiquius Nomocanonum versaui, &amp;c.</hi>
I haue perused the ancient Code of Councils, and by the subscriptions I finde, that in this Councill held in Trullo, <hi>Basil</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Gortyna (which is the Metropolis of Creet) was present. And where he saith, that <q>
                     <hi>Creet hauing many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had no one Bishop to gouerne them, after Titus the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, till Diocesan Bishops had got the sway of Ecclesiasticall matters</hi>:</q> I confesse it is true, but he must remember, that euen in the Apostles times there were Diocesan Bishops.
And in the very next age after them, <hi>Philippe</hi> was Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Creet. But though there were no direct proofe, that Diocesan or Prouinciall Bishops were the successours of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>; yet it might easily be gathered by other Churches, from whose forme of gouernment E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus and Creet did not vary. It cannot be denyed, but what authoritie <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had, the one in Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the other in Creet, the same had <hi>Marke</hi> at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, <hi>Evodius</hi> at Antioch, <hi>Linus</hi> at Rome, &amp;c. Neither may it be doubted, but that each of these had Bishops to their successours, euen in the Apostles times, as before hath beene shewed: and therefore the refuter should not make it so strange, that Bishops were the successours of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>

That <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> liued and died the one at Ephesus, the other in Creet.</note> I added the credible testimony of diuers Authors, <hi>viz.

<q>The Refuter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, he <hi>may well credit the report of these Authors, and yet not grant that therefore they were Diocesan Bishops of those places.</hi>
                  </q> Indeed, if I had argued thus, as the Refuter would haue the Reader thinke, <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> dyed, the one at Ephesus, the other in Creet: Therefore they were BB. there; it had beene a loose consequence.
But he wrangleth besides the pupose. It was obiected, that <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> were not Bishops of those places, because they did not continue there. I proue, that they held their ordinary resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there, not onely because S. <hi>Paul</hi> required them both, to continue there; but other Authors also testified, that they both liued and died there. The Refuter answereth, and would haue the Reader content himselfe with this answere, that howsoeuer indeed it is true that they continued there, yet hereof it followeth not that they were Diocesan Bishops of those places.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Yea, but saith he,</hi> it would be obserued, that M. D. gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the consequence to be good, namely that they were not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Ephesus and Creet, if they did not continue there but were remoued to other places. Now that they were remoued himselfe confesseth, &amp;c. <hi>If I had confessed, that they were remoued, and also that if they were remoued, they were not Bishops.</hi>
                  </q>
Then I should haue granted both the antecedent of the Enthymeme, (which hee said before that I denyed) and also the consequence. But indeed I denyed the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in that sence which the Refuter conceiueth, and yet granted, that though they were sometimes remoued; yet
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10663:319"/>
they kept ordinary residence, the one at Ephesus, the other in Creet. And therefore their trauelling, or remouing vpon extraordinary occasions, doth not hinder their being BB.
<q>Doe you indeed grant, that sometimes they were remoued? marry that will I proue, saith the Refuter, <hi>out of</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.9. 11.12.21. <hi>&amp;c. and therevpon inferre, they were not Bishops.</hi>
                  </q>But neither are all his proofes good, neither is his inference sound. He would proue that
<q>
                     <hi>Timothy was not at Ephesus, when the second Epistle was written to him. For first, thither the Apostle sent Tychicus.</hi>
                  </q>As if he had said, whether <hi>Paul</hi> sent <hi>Tychicus,</hi> there <hi>Timothie</hi> was not. Belike there was some such Antipathy betweene them, that one place could-not hold them both. Secondly,
<q> 
                     <hi>because from the place where he was,</hi> Paul <hi>requireth him to come to him to Rome, &amp; with him to bring the cloake, the books &amp; parchments which he left at Troas.</hi>
                  </q>
As though <hi>Timothie</hi> might not as well come from Ephesus to Rome as from some other place, and as though his bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to bring the things left at Troas, did not argue, that he was at Ephesus, which is in the same peninsula, rather then else where. But that he was at Ephesus, may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereby: because the Apostle willeth him, to salute <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> (whom he left at Ephesus, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.19.) &amp; the houshold of <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> which also was there. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.19. with 1.16. <hi>Sedulius</hi> vnderstandeth <hi>Paul,</hi>

                     <hi>Now heare his inferences,</hi> Titus was sent from Candy to Rome, and from thence he was dispatched into Dalmatia, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not B. of Candy. Timothie was not at Ephesus when the second Epistle was written to him, therefore hee was not B. there, &amp;c. He stayed with <hi>Paul</hi> some time in Rome, therefore he was not B. of Ephesus.</q>These are goodly inferences to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to the euidence gathered out of the Epistles, and to the generall consent of antiquity, which testifieth that they were Bishops.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 143.</note> Whereas therefore he asketh,
<q>
                     <hi>who dare be so bold or vnreasonable as to imagine that</hi> Paul <hi>had made them Bishops?</hi>
                  </q>
I say, it is intollerable boldnesse, and arrogancie,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10663:319"/>
to auouch the contrarie.And such is that presumptuous speech,
<q>that <hi>if</hi> Timothie <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>had beene Bishops, it had beene a matter neither of good report for them, nor of good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for the ages following that they should be called to other places.</hi>
                  </q> For, so long as ordinarily they were resident, their absence at some times vpon vrgent and weighty occasions, was neither of ill report, nor bad example.
Besides, when the Apostle sent <hi>Tychicus</hi> to Ephesus, and sent for <hi>Timothie</hi> from Ephesus, he sent the one to supply the absence of the other, as <hi>Caluin</hi> also hath obserued.</p>

               <p>The second obiection <hi>saith the Refuter,</hi> lyeth thus,<q> 
                     <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Euangelists. Therfore they were not Diocesan BB. of Ephesus and Creet.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This consequence I denied, because their being Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists did not hinder, but that when they were assigned to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Churches, and furnished with Episcopall power, they became Bishops. Against which answere the Refuter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth two things.
<q>First, <hi>that their being Euangelists did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their assigning to certaine Churches, without which they could not be Bishops.</hi> And this hee proueth by two reasons. For first, <hi>if the Apostle had assigned them to certaine Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, then should he haue confounded the offices which (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe saith,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.) <hi>God had distinguished.</hi> Secondly, <hi>hee should haue depriued</hi> Timothie <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>of a higher calling, and thrust them as it were out of the Hall into the Kitchin.</hi> 
                  </q>These are nice points, which none of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did euer vnderstand: neither did they conceiue, but that Euangelists might, without any disparagement to them, be assigned to seuerall Churches, and so become Bishops.
For if they held, that the Apostles themselues being assigned
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10663:320"/>
to certaine Churches, as <hi>Iames</hi> was to Ierusalem, were BB. much more Euangelists.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelisticall function was.</note>But for as much as the whole force of this argument de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon the Euangelisticall function which <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are supposed to haue had, we will briefly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what that Euangelisticall function was, and whether it could hinder them from being Bishops. An Euangelist therefore was he, which taught the Euangell or Gospell of Christ, whether by preaching, or also by writing. In the latter sence, there are foure onely called Euangelists, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Marke, Luke</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> who though they all prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, yet for the penning of the Gospell are peculiarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Euangelists. In the former sence the word is taken, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generally,<note place="margin">Wee may not think that the 70. after the death of Christ vanished away, but that they were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans next to the Apostles. And therfore as they were Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, so some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are called Apostles.</note> to signifie any one that doth euangelize or preach the Gospell, or specially, signifying the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie function of those in the primitiue Church, who went vp and downe preaching the Gospell, being not affixed to any certaine place. And these seeme to haue beene of two sorts: For either they were immediatly called of Christ, and by him sent to preach the Gospell, as the 72. Disciples; or they were assumed by the Apostles, to be their companions in their iourneyes, and assistants in the Ministery. Of the former sort was <hi>Philippe,</hi> who after he had performed that temporarie office at Ierusalem, whereunto he and the other sixe were chosen <hi>Act.</hi> 6. he returned to his Euangelisticall function,<note place="margin">

                  </note> Neither did they differ from other Presbyters but in this, that they accompanied the Apostles as their helpers, being not tyed to any one place. For neither had they the power of ordination, neither as <hi>Zanchy</hi> saith did

For though the Apostle di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> were called Euangelists as the foure Euangelists, and perhaps also the 72; whose functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons notwithstanding were not so disioyned, but that as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles might be also Euangelists, as we see in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>; so Euangelists might be Bishops, as we see in <hi>Marke.</hi> But as for <hi>Timothie</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus,</hi> the Greeke <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>Neither was it a debasing of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> when they were made Bishops, but an aduancement. Forwhereas

                  <hi>the Euangelist, who had beene one of the Deacons, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Bishop of Caesarea,</hi> Iames <hi>the Apostle was Bishop of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and diuers of the Apostles</hi> (which may much more be verified of the Euangelists) <hi>when they ceased from their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinations, became Bishops of certaine Churches, as by the ancient histories is manifest.</hi>
Whereto the refuter answereth two things, first, that <q>
                     <hi>Zuinglius speaketh according to the phrase of the histories and writers before him</hi>; </q>therefore say I, according to the truth.
Or else we must thinke that none of the Fathers, or ancient historiographers knew whom to call Bishops and whom not. But the refuter, and his fellows onely, haue this knowledge.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 144.</note>Yea but a certaine learned man saith, that
<q>
                     <hi>when the Fathers call</hi> Peter <hi>or</hi> Iames <hi>or any of the Apostles Bishops, they doe not take the name Bishop properly.</hi>
                  </q>
For <hi>Peter</hi> I graunt, but of <hi>Iames</hi> there is another reason, as I haue shewed before. And although it were true, that Apostles could not properly be called Bishops: yet what is that to <hi>Timothie,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> whom I haue proued not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their supposed Euangelisticall function, to haue beene particularly assigned by <hi>Paul</hi> to the Churches of Ephesus and Creet; where also they liued and dyed?</p>
               <p>His other answere is, that howsoeuer <hi>Zuinglius</hi> speake of their being Bishops, it is manifest by his writings, he neither thought they were (and so belike spake otherwise then he thought) nor any other might be a Diocesan B. as by a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony hereafter alledged, appeareth, where he saith no such thing. I will therefore adde another testimony of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> in the same booke:<note place="margin">Ecclesiaste.</note> when <hi>Paul</hi> said to <hi>Timothie</hi> doe the vvorke of an Euangelist, <hi>Timothie</hi> was a Bishop, vvherefore it is certaine according to <hi>Pauls</hi> opinion, the office of an Euangelist and of a Bishop is all one.</p>
               <p>After I had thus answered these two obiections,<note place="margin">§ 13. Other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to proue that <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Bishops.</note> I brought a new supply of arguments, to proue <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to haue beene Bishops of Ephesus and Creet. And first, by occasion of his second obiection I argue thus:
<q>
                     <p>The function and authoritie which <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did exercise in Ephesus and Creet, was either extraordinarie,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10663:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Euangelisticall, as the Disciplinarians teach; or else ordinarie, and Episcopall, as we hold.</p>
                     <p>But it was not extraordinary and Euangelisticall; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordinary and Episcopall.</p>
                     <p>The assumption I proued thus;</p>
                     <p>The supposed Euangelisticall function of <hi>Timothie,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> was to end with their persons, and admitted no succession, being as themselues teach, both extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and temporary;</p>
                     <p>But the function and authority, which they had, as being assigned to certaine Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> of Ephesus and Creet, (consisting especially in the power of ordination, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction) was not to end with their persons, but to be continued in their successors.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the function and authority which <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had, as being assigned to Ephesus and Creet, was not extraordinary and Euangelisticall.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the refuter would make his reder belieue, that<q> I hauing before denyed the consequence of the second obiection, doe also deny the antecedent, and in this place reason against it.</q>
But I doe not deny they were Euangelists, howsoeuer I doe not conceiue their Euangelisticall function to haue beene such, and so great, as the refuter and other Disciplinarians suppose, and therefore I call it <hi>their supposed Euangelicall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Now, that I did not intend to deny, or disproue that antecedent, but to bring a new supply of arguments, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occasion by the last obiection; appeareth by those words, which I premised, as it were an introduction to this argument, <hi>hereof we may conclude thus.</hi>
But let vs heare what he answereth.<q> Forsooth he <hi>flatly denyeth the assumption, wherein</hi> though he vntruely say, that <hi>I begge the question, that</hi> Timothie <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>were assigned to Ephesus and Creet, as ordinarie Bishop or Pastors of those Churches</hi>;</q>
for that I doe assume but conclude;
yet hath he nothing to disproue it, but a meere begging of the question, and denyall of the conclusion, rather then the assumption; <q>
                     <hi>viz. that they had no assignment to those Churches, but onely as euangelists</hi>
                  </q>,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10663:322"/>
which doth not touch the assumption: no more then that which followeth.
<q>Neither by that <hi>(Euangelisticall)</hi> office <hi>(saith he)</hi> did they take the power of ordination and iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Churches, in which by right it is seated; but with the Churches ordayned ministers, and redressed such things, as were amisse, though perhaps that right of laying on hands might sometimes be performed by them alone, <hi>&amp;c. What is all this to the assumption?</hi>
                  </q>
which if he would deny, and make this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall good, he should haue said, and proued it, that the function and authoritie which they exercised in Ephesus and Creet, was to end with their persons, and admitted no succession, or was not to be continued in their successors. But he roues, and raues, as men vse to doe, which being at a non-plus, would faine seeme to answere somewhat. And that which he answereth, besides that it is impertinent, is partly also vntrue.
<q>
                     <hi>For when he saith, that</hi> Timotie and <hi>Titus</hi> did not take the power of ordination and iurisdiction from the Churches, &amp;c.</q>
First, he would insinuate, that Bishops doe; as though herein there were some difference betweene Bishops and them; vvhen as indeed, neither Bishops, nor they, doe take that authority from the Church; but they, and all other first BB. receiued their authority from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and deriued the same to their lawfull successors.
Secondly, he saith, that the <q>
                     <hi>power of ordination and iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by right is seated in the whole Church or congregation</hi>:</q> which is not true of any particular congregation, but in case of necessity; wherein both the succession of their owne clergy failing, and the help of others vvanting, the right is deuolued to the whole body of the Church.
But let this goe among other his Brownisticall, or rather Anabaptisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all nouelties.</p>
               <p>I proceed to the proofe of my assumption,<note place="margin">§ 14. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 145. That their function was ordinary, and their authority perpetually necessary.</note> which hee hath layd forth thus:
<q>
                     <p>That function and authority which is ordinarie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually necessary, not onely for the well being, but also for the very being of the visible Churches, was not to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10663:323"/>
end with the persons of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> but to be continued in their successors.</p>
                     <p>But the function and authority that they had, as being assigned to certaine Churches, is ordinary and perpetually necessary, not onely for the well being, but also for the very being of the visible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</p>
                     <p>Therefore the function and authority which they had, as being assigned to certaine Churches, was not to end with the persons of <hi>Timothie,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their successors.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The assumption is thus to be explaned; the function which <hi>Timothie,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had, as being assigned to certaine Churches, was ordinary; and the authority, which they did exercise, consisting chiefly in the power of ordination and iurisdiction, was perpetually necessary.
<hi>This assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the refuter would seeme to deny, and yet granteth,</hi> 
                  <q>that the power of ordination and iurisdiction is perpetually ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; onely he denieth it to be necessary, that there should be in euery Church an Euangelist to exercise that authority.</q>
So that of the two points in the assumption, the latter hee granteth, <hi>that the authority which they exercised was perpetually necessary</hi>; the other, <hi>that the function which they had being assigned to those Churches was ordinary,</hi> hee toucheth not: but denieth that, which I did not affirme, to wit, that it was necessary there should be an Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list alwayes in euery Church to exercise the power of ordination, and iurisdiction: Did I affirme this? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I not teach the contrary, when I said that the function whereby they did exercise that power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and iurisdiction, was not an extraordinary function, as the Euangelisticall; but ordinary, as the Episcopall? Now that the function which <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had, being assigned to Ephesus and Creet, was an ordinary function, &amp; the very same which the Bishops that succeeded them, and all other BB. both in, and since the Apostles times haue
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10663:323"/>
exercised; it is most certaine, for though in them, who cheifly are called Euangelists, there were diuers things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, besides their limitation to no certaine place, as their immediate calling from Christ, their extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, as of reuelation, and of working miracles, as appeareth by <hi>Steuen</hi> and <hi>Philippe:</hi> yet in <hi>Timothie,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and others who were called Euangelists, because they were the companions of the Apostles in their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, and assistants in their worke of the ministery, there was nothing extraordinarie, but their not limitation to any certaine Churches. For their calling to the ministery was ordinary, and their gifts, though great, yet attayned and increased by ordinary meanes. When as therefore they were assigned to certaine Churches, as the Pastors and gouernours thereof, whereunto they were orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by imposition of hands, and by that ordination were furnished with power of ordination and Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall iurisdiction; their function was the same ordinary function, which their successors, and all other Bishops did exercise.</p>
               <p>But as the refuter said,<note place="margin">§ 15. Whether it be perpetually ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the Ecclesiasticall authority shold be in one.</note> it was not necessary, that there should alwayes be an Euangelist in euery Church to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the power of ordination, and iurisdiction; so perhaps, some more iudicious will alledge, that though the power of ordination and iurisdiction be perpetually necessary: yet it is not necessary, that this power should alwayes be wholy in some one in euery Church, as it was in <hi>Timothie,</hi> or <hi>Titus.</hi> Neither did I say it was, but that the power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which they exercised, was perpetually necessary; and the function, whereby they did exercise it, was ordinary, being the very same function, which other Bishops, both then, and euer since, haue administred.
<hi>And therefore the refuter doth greatly wrong me, when hee saith,</hi>
                  <q> that I make this Episcopall power, perpetually necessary, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me with contradicting my selfe in another place, where I acknowledge, that where the Episcopall gouernment may not be had, there others may be admitted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:10663:324"/>For the clearing therefore of the whole controuersie, and plaine manifestation of that which I hold therein; we will make vse of a distinction, which the learned vse concerning matters of gouernment. In all gouernments therefore there are these things to be considered: <hi>pot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>stas, ordo, formae vel mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, titulus, siue applicatio potestatis ad personam, &amp; vsus.</hi> First the power to be exercised in gouernment; then the order, whereby the inferiours both to be gouerned &amp; gouerning are subordinate to the superiours: after, the forme and the manner of gouernment, as, whether it be a Monarchy, where the power is in one, or an Aristocraty, wher it is in few, or a Democraty, where it is in the multitude: and how each gouernment is ordered: the title, as whether the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are put in and intituled to their power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by succession, or by election or institution; and after, how they vse and exercise their authority, &amp;c. Of these, the two first, that there should be power of gouernment, and order therein, &amp; in the people gouerned are essentiall &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, as the immutable ordinances of God. The other, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes are accidentall &amp; variable. But yet, if question be made, what forme of gouernment in the commonwealth is the best, &amp; hath the best vvarrant; I vvould say the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, as hauing diuine, both institution, and approbation. But yet so, as vvhere this cannot so vvell be had, the other formes of gouernment be lawfull. Euen so in the Church of euery country, that there should be a power of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gouernment to be exercised, &amp; an order or eutaxy, it is the perpetual &amp; immutable ordinance of God, the Church being by his appointment a well ordered society, &amp; as the wise man saith,<note place="margin">Cant. 6.3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>tanquam acies ordinata.</hi> But whether the sway of spiritual authority shold be in one alone of euery Church, or in more, it seemeth not to be so essentiall; though I must confesse, that both in the Church of the Iewes by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God it vvas in one, namely the high Priest, and likewise in the primitiue Churches, as hath beene shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as touching the title, that seemeth also to be varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For the gouernours in the Church of the Iewes came
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10663:324"/>
to their places by succession and lineall descent; but in the Churches of Christ, by free election, after Gods first imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate calling.</p>
               <p>Now if we shall enquire,<note place="margin">§ 16. What forme of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenrment to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others.</note> what forme of Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath the best warrant; hereby we may be resolued. For it is manifest, that our Sauiour Christ committed the power of Ecclesiasticall gouernment cheifly to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and that they being seuered into diuers parts of the world did gouerne the particular Churches, which they had collected, seuerally. And howsoeuer there were diuers things extraordinary in the Apostles, and peculiar to their persons; as their immediat calling from Christ; their vnlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted function, hauing authority to exercise their Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power wheresoeuer they came; their admirable, &amp; extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts, of wisedome, of languages, of miracles; their infallible inspiration, &amp; direction of the holy Ghost preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them from errour: notwithstanding, there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in them, which being perpetually necessary for the being, and well being of the Church, were from them to be communicated, or deriued to others; as the power to preach the Gospell, and to administer the Sacraments; and publicke prayer or liturgy: the power to ordayne mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Pastors; the power of the keyes for gouernment, and exercise of Ecclesiasticall censures. Now the power of preaching the word, and administring the Sacraments, was not from the Apostles communicated to euery Christian, but to such as they ordayned ministers, and by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of their hands communicated that power to them. The power of ordination, and publicke iurisdiction, was not committed by the Apostles, neither to other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor yet to all ministers whom they ordayned; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ordination of Presbyters in each Church, they reserued the power of ordination, and publicke iurisdiction in their owne hands; which after a time they communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to those whom they set ouer the seuerall Churches to that very purpose: <hi>viz.</hi> to ordayne Presbyters, and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise publicke iurisdiction; which manifestly appeareth by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10663:325"/>
the Epistles to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> Thus was <hi>Timothie</hi> set ouer the Church of Ephesus, <hi>Titus</hi> of Creet, <hi>Linus</hi> of Rome, <hi>Evodius</hi> of Antioch, <hi>Simon</hi> of Ierusalem, <hi>Marke</hi> of Alexandria, &amp;c. and what authority was from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles communicated to them, was from them deriued to their successors, not onely since, but euen in the Apostles times. For what authority <hi>Evodius</hi> had at Antioch, the same after him had <hi>Ignatius</hi>; and what <hi>Linus</hi> had at Rome, the same had <hi>Anacletus, Clemens, Euaristus</hi>; what <hi>Marke</hi> had at Alexandria, the same after him had <hi>Anianus, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and <hi>Cerdo,</hi> and all these in the Apostles times: and what <hi>Timothie</hi> had at Ephesus, the same had <hi>Gaius,</hi> who (if <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotheus</hi> is to be creditted) was his next successor,<note place="margin">

These, to my vnderstanding, are plaine euidences to warrant the Episcopall function, and to shew the deriuation of their authority from the Apostles; and to perswade Christians to preferre that forme of gouernment before others. For as I added, and will now repeate a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, vvhich the refuter might more easily elude vvith a male pert speech, calling it <hi>wauing and crauing,</hi> then to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vvith soundnesse of reason, and euidence of truth.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If the Apostles, vvhiles themselues liued, thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary (that is, needfull and behoofefull for the well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Churches already planted) to substitute therein such as <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> furnished with Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall power, then much more after their decease haue the Churches need of such gouernours:</p>
                  <p>But the former is euident by the Apostles practise in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus and Creet, and all other Apostolicall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the latter may not be denyed.</p>
               </q>
               <p>All which notwithstanding, I doe not deny, but that where the gouernment by Bishops cannot be had, another forme may be vsed; because the modus, or forme of being
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10663:325"/>
in the B. alone, doth not seeme so to be of diuine ordinance, but that it may vpon necessity be altered. But if any shall reply, that howsoeuer in ciuill gouernment the forme is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, yet for Church gouernment we are to keepe vs close to the word of God, and what hath warrant there we are to hold perpetuall and vnchangeable by men, as some of our Disciplinarians vse to argue: I wish them to looke to this inference. For if they doe not leaue that hold, they must needes grant, that the Episcopall function hauing that vvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Scriptures which I haue shewed, is to be holden <hi>iure diuine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas to confute me, or rather to fight with his owne shadow, hee saith, <q>
                     <hi>that other reformed Churches haue continued many yeares, and may doe more, without Bishops:</hi>
                  </q> I confesse they haue, and I wish they may continue to the end in the sincere profession of the truth.
But where hee saith, that <q>
                     <hi>they haue continued in more quietnesse, then ours hath done, or is like to doe</hi>: </q>for that wee may thanke him, and other vnquiet spirits, who haue troubled the peace of Israell, with vrging and obtruding their owne fancies for the ordinances of God.</p>
               <p>To these reasons I added the testimonies of antiquity,<note place="margin">§ 17. Testimonies of antiquity that <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were BB. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 146.</note> which with a generall consent beareth witnesse to this truth, that <hi>Timothie</hi> was B. of Ephesus, and <hi>Titus</hi> of Creet.
<q>
                     <hi>Of all which the Refuter maketh very light.</hi> All that remaineth to proue, that <hi>Timothie</hi> was B. of Ephesus, and <hi>Titus</hi> of Creet, is no more but this; the subscriptions to the Epistles to <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>2</hi> to <hi>Timothie,</hi> call them Bishops, as also the generall consent of the ancient Fathers, and histories of the Church, doe. <hi>No more (quoth he) but the generall consent of antiquity in a matter of fact, agreeable with the Scriptures?</hi>
                  </q>
Why, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of some one of the Fathers affirming it, ought to be of more weight with vs, then the deniall of the same by all the Disciplinarians in the world. But let vs come to the particulars. First,<note place="margin">First, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription to 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> &amp; to <hi>Tit.</hi>
                  </note> I alledged the subscriptions annexed to the end of the Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> and second to <hi>Timothie</hi>: wherein the one is said to haue beene ordayned the first B.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10663:326"/>
of the Church of the Ephesians, and the other the first B. of the Church of the Cretians.
<hi>This is something plaine. But he asketh me,</hi> 
                  <q>why I seuered them from the consent of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers? was it because I thought them to be of the Canon?</q>
I answere, that I did not seuer them, but ioyne them in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulatiue speech; and if I had beene of opinion, that they were of the Canon, I would not haue said as I did, <hi>it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not onely by the subscriptions, but also by the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Fathers</hi>: but contrariwise, not onely by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall consent of the Fathers, but also by the subscriptions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed by the Apostle himselfe. But though it were not likely (as he hath alledged out of <hi>T. C.</hi>) that they were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Apostle himselfe; yet is it certaine, that they are of great antiquity, and of better credit, then the Refuter and some other Disciplinarians would make them. Indeed, if any other learned man, that were not a party in this cause, had censured these subscriptions; I would haue respected their censures; but the cauillations of Disciplinarians against them (who being parties in this cause, are so plainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by them) are to be reiected.

                  <q> How little credit those subscriptions deserue, it may appeare by that vnder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> which is quite contrary to the Epistle it selfe. <hi>And why so, I pray you?</hi> the subscription saith, the Epistle was written from Nicopolis, and <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe willeth <hi>Titus</hi> to come vnto him to Nicopolis, for I haue determined to winter there. But if <hi>Paul</hi> had beene now at Nicopolis, when he wrote, he would haue said, not there, but here. Therefore hee was but a simple fellow, that was the Author of that subscription.</q>
So saith this great Criticke. But if you will consider with me, that <hi>Paul</hi> being, as vsually he was, in peregrination; <hi>Titus</hi> could not well tell where he was, neither had <hi>Paul</hi> signified in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle where he then was, therefore wrote being at Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, as any discreet man would in the like case, <hi>come to mee to Nicopolis, for I meane to winter there:</hi> whereas if hee had written, as the Refuter would haue had him, if hee were at Nicopolis; <hi>come hither, for I meane to winter here, or come to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10663:326"/>
Nicopolis, for I meane to winter here</hi>: might not <hi>Titus</hi> haue said, where <hi>Paul</hi>; as being vncertaine where <hi>Paul</hi> was, and whether himselfe was to goe. This therefore is too seely a censure, though receiued from <hi>T.

For hereby it is manifest, that the Bishops haue receiued and deriued their authority from the Apostles, whose successors they are, not onely in respect of doctrine (as all other true ministers) but also in the gouernment of the seuerall Churches. And when the Disciplinarians can shew the like warrant for their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteryes, especially of Lay-elders; or our refuter, and his good friends the Brownists, for the cheife authority of the people, we will harken to them. Once, it is euident, that Christ committed the authority and gouernment of his Church to his Apostles, who were to deriue the same to others. Wherefore who haue any ordinary right, they haue receiued the same from the Apostles. So <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> receiued their authority from <hi>Paul, Linus</hi> from <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, Policarpus</hi> from <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10663:330"/>
succession it hath beene deriued to the Bishops which are at this day. But where is any euidence of the like deriuation from the Apostles of authority to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Lay-elders, I know not.</p>

For the confutation of whom, he seeketh to aduance the Presbyters aboue the Deacons as much as he can; and may seeme to match them, more then truth would permit, with the Bishops. For which, the onely ground which he hath is this, because the name Bishop and Presbyter were for a while in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times confounded.

                     <hi>The refuter replieth, that my</hi> consequence is naught, for euen whiles the Church was gouerned in common by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, it was not gouerned without the counsell of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the same Church, much lesse did <hi>Iames</hi> afterwards take the whole authority into his owne hands, from them.</q>
Which exception of his is of no force, because there were no Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters ordayned in that Church, when it was gouerned by the common counsell of the Apostles; and I added, which he should haue disproued, if he would haue said any thing to the purpos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>Iames</hi> was assigned Bishop to that Church, before we read of any Presbyters ordayned in, or to that Church. For if <hi>Iames</hi> were Bishop of that Church before it had Presbyters, then was not that Church ruled by the common counsell of Presbyters, before they had a Bishop. <hi>Iames</hi> indeed after he was Bishop, ordayned Presbyters, whose counsell and assistance he did vse in the gouernment and instruction of that Church (as other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops vsed to doe in the like case) as wee read <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and 21.</p>
               <p>Yea but <hi>the whole multitude</hi> saith he, <hi>as appeareth by</hi> Act. 6.2.5. <hi>had the choise of Church-officers.</hi> What then? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church was not gouerned by the common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the Apostles, or was gouerned by the common
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10663:331" rendition="simple:additions"/>
counsell of Presbyters? Because the Greekish Iewes (which had their Liturgy and scriptures in the Greeke tongue) were discontented with the Apostles distribution of the Churches stocke, the Apostles therefore to auoid contention and scandall, and to giue euery one content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, departed from their right, and willed the whole multitude to choose seauen, whom wee (say the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles) may appoint to this busines. Surely, if where the Presbyters are erected, the people, who doe contribute to the releife of the poore, are permitted to make choise of ouerseers &amp; collectors for the poore; it wer but a simple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to inferre hereupon, that therefore the Churches are not gouerned by the common counsell of Presbyters.</p>
               <p>And to as little purpose, or rather lesse, is that which followeth.
<q>If the Apostles altogether, or <hi>Iames</hi> alone after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, had by vertue of their extraordinarie calling the power of ordination and iurisdiction in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heir hands, in that, as in all other Churches; yet the Pastors of the Churches after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being no Apostles, had no such vnlimited power; and so <hi>Ierome</hi> still speaketh truely of the ordinary gouernment of the Church.</q>
And so <hi>Ierome</hi> still spake vntruely, in respect of the Church of Ierusalem. I doe confesse, this was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Church of Ierusalem, and differing from the order of other Churches: that the Church of Ierusalem had a Bishop before it had Presbyters of her owne. And therefore though I did not deny his speech to be vntrue in respect of other Churches; yet I proued it to be vntrue, in respect of Ierusalem, by his owne testimony. But before I come to the sifting thereof, there are two other things to be noted in this speech of the refuter.
For that which he pratleth of <hi>Iames</hi> his sole power exercised in the Church of Ierusalem, <q>
                     <hi>by vertue of his extraordinarie calling</hi>
                  </q>, is altogether impertinent: seeing <hi>Ierome,</hi> of whom the question is,<note place="margin">

                  </note> confesseth, that hee was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and ruled that Church as the Bishop thereof thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres.
Neither is it true, that the ordinarie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of that Church had not the like power therein,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10663:332"/>
which <hi>Iames</hi> had. For there is no question, but what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>Iames</hi> had in the gouernment of that particular Church of Ierusalem, <hi>Simon</hi> his successor had the same, and all the Bishops of Ierusalem after him.</p>

                  </note>Now, that <hi>Ieromes</hi> speech was vntrue in respect of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, I proued by <hi>Ieromes</hi> owne testimony; affirming, that <hi>Iames straight wayes after the passion of our Lord was by the Apostles ordayned Bishop of Ierusalem.</hi>
                  <hi>Here the refuter hath found out a quirke, which if it were true, would not yet serue his turne. The quirke is, that</hi>
                  <q> Ierome is mistaken by false pointing and reading, for that straight way belongeth not to <hi>Iames</hi> his being made Bishop: but is brought to shew, that <hi>Iohn</hi> maketh mention of him, immediately after he hath spoken of our Lords passion. So that <hi>Ierome</hi> doth not say, that <hi>Iames</hi> straight wayes after the passion of our Lord was ordayned Bishop of Ierusalem, but that <hi>Iohn</hi> mentioned him presently after hee had spoken of the passion of our Lord. Let me lay downe the whole sentence, that it may appeare more plainely. <hi>Iames</hi> saith <hi>Ierome,</hi> who is called the brother of our Lord, surnamed <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus:</hi> the sonne as many thinke of <hi>Ioseph</hi> by another wife: as it seemeth to me of <hi>Mary</hi> the sister of our Lords mother; of whom <hi>Iohn</hi> in his booke maketh mention, after the passion of our Lord straight wayes, (<hi>statim,</hi> id est, <hi>continenter &amp; immediate vt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur,</hi> Iohn <hi>19.25.</hi> saith <hi>Iunius</hi>) who was ordayned Bishop of Ierusalem by the Apostles. And this manner of reading is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched by <hi>Sophronius,</hi> that translated that booke of <hi>Ierome</hi> into Greeke, who maketh the distinction presently after straight wayes, seuering that word from his ordination by the Apostles.</q>
Among many other proofes of his learning &amp; iudgement, the refuter giueth this for one. For first, this subtility hee receiued from <hi>Iunius</hi> as he doth professe, but exceedingly dulled by comming through his fingers.

To iustifie his correction of this place of <hi>Ierom,</hi> he saith this manner of reading is auowed by <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> &amp;c. which is neither so, nor so. For between the Greeke and the Latine there is onely this difference (in that edition which I haue, being as I suppose the best) that whereas in the Latine, there is a Colon at the word <hi>filius,</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <hi>meminit</hi>; in the Greeke, there is but a Comma; but at the word <hi>statim</hi> in Latin, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For the correction it self, I would be loth to contest with <hi>Iunius,</hi> neither is that subtilty which he hath found out preiudiciall to my assertion, as you shall heare; notwithstanding I must needs say, he was greatly transported with preiudice, when he would referre the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe <hi>statim</hi> to the verbe <hi>meminit,</hi> rather then to the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>ordinatus.</hi> For though both the Comma and Colon that come betweene them were taken away, yet the word <hi>filius</hi> comming also betweene, cleane spoileth his conceipt. For can any man of indifferency thinke, that <hi>Ierome</hi> being an elegant writer, if he had meant that the aduerbe <hi>statim</hi> should haue waited on the verbe <hi>meminit,</hi> would haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it thus, <hi>cuius</hi> Ioannes <hi>meminit filius post passionem Domini statim ab Apostolis Hierosolymorum Episcopus ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus?</hi> But now weigh the refuters iudgement. Suppose, that this place were read as <hi>Iunius</hi> would haue it, and that <hi>Iames</hi> were not so presently made Bishop of Ierusalem after Christs passion, as <hi>Ieromes</hi> words seeme to import, but that after the Apostles he tooke the gouernment of the Church of Ierusalem, as <hi>Ierome</hi> citeth out of <hi>Hegesippus</hi>; what is all this, but the same that my selfe set downe in the Sermon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10663:333"/>
both in this place also <hi>pag.</hi> 68. in these words, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles first ioyntly ruled the Church at Ierusalem, but being to goe into all the world, and no longer to be accounted members of that particular Church, ordained <hi>Iames</hi> to be Bishop. And that charge which before they had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, they now comitted to him in particular. And this is that, which <hi>Ierome</hi> citeth out of <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> who saith, <hi>Iames the brother of our Lord surnamed</hi> Iustus <hi>receiued or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke the Church of Ierusalem after the Apostles.</hi> And if the refuter will needs expound after the Apostles, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie after their departing from Ierusalem, I must intreat him to take with him the words both of <hi>Eusebius,</hi>

               <p>§ 4.

Both the parts of this answere I explaned and confirmed. The former thus: it is true, that for a time the Presbyters by common counsell gouerned the Churches, but as vnder the Apostles, who kept in their own hands the Episcopall authority; they, I meane the Presbyters, hauing neither the right of ordination, nor the power of outward or publike iurisdiction. This therefore doth not proue, that the offices of BB. &amp; Presbyters wer confounded. The name of B. was confounded with Presbyter, but the office and authority of the B. was as yet in the Apostles; the Presbyters being such then vnder the Apostles, as they were afterwards vnder the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10663:333"/>
Bishops. The latter thus: but when the Apostles were to discontinue, from those Churches which they had planted, then were BB. substituted. Whereunto the factious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the Presbyters (whereof <hi>Ierome</hi> speaketh) might be some inducement.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> For parity indeed breedeth faction and confusion; for the auoyding whereof when the Apostles should be absent, BB. were instituted: but when, and where, and by whom, and to what end, let <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe testifie. The summe is, that although for a time the Churches were gouerned by the common counsell of Presbyters; yet this doth not hinder, but that the Episcopall function is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine institution. For after a while the Apostles ordayned BB. as <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe doth most plainely and fully testifie, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the places where, and the persons whom, and the time when, and the end wherefore, they ordaynd them.</p>
               <p>Now let vs see,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 149.</note> what the Refuter can reply against this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Forsooth as if he knew, or regarded no lawes of dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he thrusts himselfe into the answerers place, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me the opponent, casting my answer into a Syllogisme, and bids me proue euery part and parcell of it, or else all that I say is to little purpose; himselfe in the meane while, who should follow the argument which I answered, and take away my answer, goeth about to proue nothing, but himselfe to be a shifting Sophister. I thinke it was neuer heard in dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that the opponent hauing receiued the answere, and reciting the summe thereof, saying, <hi>sic respondes,</hi> would cast it into a Syllogisme and then bid the answerer proue the parts thereof. But such a disputer am I matched with. And how I pray you doth he reduce my answere into a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme? that vvhich I brought to cleare the former part of my answer, is made the argument to proue both the parts in a filthy long Syllogisme; and that vvhich I added to proue the latter part, he mentioneth as straggling speches brought in to no purpose. This is his analysing, which whether it be done of vnskilfulnes, or wilfulnes, I refer it to his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science I cannot iudge therof, because I know not the man.</p>
               <p>But if my answere must needes be reduced into Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes,<note place="margin">§ 5.</note>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:10663:334"/>
I would intreat,<note place="margin">The Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters gouerning the Church by common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, doth not proue that the office of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and BB. is confounded.</note> that the parts thereof may seuerally be concluded, as they were by me seuerally explicated; and then, that the first Syllogisme may be this;
<q>If whiles the Churches were gouerned by the common counsell of Presbyters, the Presbyters did gouerne the same as vnder the Apostles, the Episcopall office and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority being not in them but in the Apostles, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters being such then vnder the Apostles as they were afterwards vnder the Bishops: then their gouerning of the Church by common counsell doth not proue, that the office of a B. and a Presbyter was confounded. But the antecedent is true in all the parts thereof: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the consequent.</q>
The consequence I did illustrate by this distinction, the name of Bishop was confounded with Presbyter, but the office was not, for that was not in the Presbyters, but in the Apostles.
<hi>The consequence when it was worse for the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the second part, the Refuter granted; yet he thought good to gather out of it this worthy obseruation, that</hi>
                  <q> if there was a time before there were Bishops. When the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters gouerned the Churches as vnder the Apostles; then all that while there were no Diocesan Bishops <hi>(the Refuter spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth sentences)</hi> and so no distinction betweene a Bishop and a Presbyter in office.</q>
This, <hi>and so,</hi> could not well be gathered out of the proposition, being repugnant vnto it; for if there were no distinction betweene the office of a Bishop and a Presbyter, then were the offices confounded. Suppose the common-wealth of Iewry, being a Prouince vnder the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Rome, had beene gouerned by the Synedrion or common counsell of the Seniors for a time, vntill the Emperour had placed a soueraigne King ouer them, as hee did <hi>Herod</hi>; it might be said, that for a time that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was gouerned by the common counsell of their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but as vnder the Emperour, who kept the regall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his owne hands. Hereof it might not be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the office of the Senatours and of a King were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. For the soueraignty was in the Emperour, and the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:10663:334"/>
Senatours might haue beene the same vnder their King, which they had beene vnder the Emperour, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As touching the assumption, he saith, <q>
                     <hi>it should haue beene proued</hi>;</q> and I say, if he were able, he should haue disproued it.
For my part, I was in this place the answerer; and the parts of the assumption be such, as either had beene before cleared, or seemed to neede no proofe. For first, that the Presbyters ruled the Churches as vnder the Apostles, it is manifest. That the Episcopall authority consisting specially in the power of Ordination, and publicke Iurisdiction, was not in them but in the Apostles; partly was proued before, to wit, that Presbyters neuer had it; and partly needed no proofe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apostles had it. And surely little need had <hi>Paul</hi> to haue sent <hi>Timothie</hi> to Ephesus, and <hi>Titus</hi> to Creet, to exercise the power of Ordination and publicke Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction in those Churches; if the Presbyters had the same before they came. But still I desire some euidence, whereby the deriuation of this power of Ordination and Iurisdiction, from the Apostles to the Presbyters, or people, may be warranted. Thirdly, that the Presbyters were the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apostles then, which they were afterwards vnder the Bishops, I take for a certaine truth. For if they were the same vnder <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> that they were vnder the Apostles; then questionlesse they were the same vnder the Bishops, who haue no other function, nor exercise any other authority, then that which <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in Ephesus and Creet. And these I hope are reasons sufficient to approue the former part of my answere, vntill the refuter who is the opponent, be able to disproue it. The second part of my answere may be concluded thus.<note place="margin">§ 6. The Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ruling the Church by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon counsell for a time, doth not hinder, but that the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall function is of Apostolicall institution.</note>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>If after a while, namely when the Apostles were to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue from the Churches which they had planted, the Apostles themselues ordayned BB. then the Presbyters ruling of the Churches by common counsell for a time, doth not hinder, but that the Episcopall function is of Apostolicall institution:</p>
                  <p>But the former is true: Therefore the latter.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:10663:335"/>The consequence needeth no proofe: the assumption I proue by <hi>Ieromes</hi> owne testimony. For if <hi>Ierome</hi> doe testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that the Apostles ordayned BB. and withall doe note the time when, the place where, and the end wherefore, then doth he giue plentifull testimony to this truth: But <hi>Ierome</hi> doth testifie, that the Apostles ordayned BB. and withall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the time when, the place where, and the end wherfore. The time and place he noteth:<note place="margin">The time in generall when BB. were first ordayned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.</hi>
                  </note> first generally, the time when Bishops were ordayned was in the Apostles time: the place where, in all the world: Which two if you ioyne together, it will appeare that by <hi>Ieromes</hi> testimony the function of BB. is of Apostolicall institution. For it is vtterly incredible, that BB. should be ordayned in all parts of the Christian world in the Apostles times, and yet not be of the Apostles orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Ierome</hi> helde BB. to be ordayned in the Apostles time, I proue out of the place alledged; <hi>when factions began to spring in the Church,</hi> saith Ierome, <hi>some saying I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>I am of</hi> Cephas; which was in the Apostles times, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. and it were fond to imagine, that factions did not begin till after their time.</p>

Which answere might haue some shew of probability, if <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe did not both in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, which I cite, most plainely testifie, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were ordayned in the Apostles times; and also in the place alledged expressely speake of those factions which did arise in Corinth, and other places in the Apostles times.

Yea but <hi>Ierome</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> sheweth that in the Apostles times Bishop and Presbyter was all one; and that afterwards Bishops were first ordayned as a remedy against schisme. To this I haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered before, shewing that <hi>Ierome</hi> there proueth that the names at the first were confounded, and the same men were called Presbyters and Bishops vntill one out of the Presbyters in euery Church was chosen, and set aboue the rest, and called a Bishop. Which <hi>Ierome</hi> there confesseth to haue bin done euer since St. <hi>Markes</hi> time, and therefore in the time of the Apostles. For the first Bishops were not chosen out of the Presbytery of the Churches, whereof they were made BB. but were Apostolicall men, I meane either Apostles, or some of their companions and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants: all which while, the Bishops were called Apostles, as I shewed out of <hi>Theodoret</hi>: the names <hi>Presbyter &amp; Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus</hi> being as yet confounded. And whereas he saith, that I <hi>answered euen now, the course of gouernment was not changed at the first when facti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

kindnesse on mee: for I said no such thing. If therefore <hi>Ierome</hi> teacheth that Bishops were ordayned when factions began: and also that in the Apostles time factions did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; then in <hi>Ieromes</hi> iudgement Bishops were ordayned in the Apostles times; but <hi>Ierome</hi> teacheth both the one and the other, as is manifest by that which hath beene said.</p>

<q>
                     <p>A generall decree in the whole Christian world could not be made in the Apostles times without the authority and consent of the Apostles:</p>
                     <p>This generall decree was made in the Apostles times:</p>
                     <p>Therefore not without their authority and consent.</p>
                  </q>
The assumption I proue thus: This generall decree in the whole world was made either in the Apostles times, or neare their times. But not neare their times, for there could no such generall decree be made without a generall Councill. And there was no generall councill before the councill of Nice, before which councill there were not onely Diocesan and Metropolitane Bishops but also Patriarches.</p>

But first, what is this to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? that the Refuter had rather there should be a Schisme in euery Parish, then a Bishop of the Diocese? it was <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> iudgement, that I opposed to their allegation out of <hi>Ierome.</hi> And if <hi>Ierome</hi> testifie, that in the Apostles times Bishops vvere ordayned to auoyd Schisme, and that this was a necessarie remedie, insomuch that he doubteth not to say that the safety of the Church dependeth vpon it; it was as much as in this place either I intended, or could by the aduersarie be required. Secondly, where <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, that Bishops were ordayned for auoyding of Schisme, hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth such Schisme as the Presbyters (vvhom hee calleth <hi>Sacerdotes,</hi> Priests) would make, if there were not one in euery Church set ouer them, to vvhom the care of that vvhole Church should belong.

                     <hi>the remedie was almost worse then the disease, because this superioritie of BB. did breed the Papacy</hi>:</q> this sheweth, that great and sound D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that the superioritie of Bishops did breed the supremacie of the Pope.
<q>
                     <hi>Because</hi> as at the first one Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter was before the rest, and made a Bishop, so afterwards one B. was preferred aboue the rest, so this custome bred the Pope and his Monarchy. <hi>By which reason, all superioritie should be condemned as the originall of the Popes supremacie.</hi>
                  </q>
For might not a man as well say, that as one Presbyter in euery parish is superiour to the rest according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt; so one Pastor which is the Bishop in euerie diocese is superiour to the other Pastors, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But indeed the superioritie of Bishops is so far from bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Papacy as the cause or originall,<note place="margin">§ 10. That the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie of BB. did not breed the Papacy.</note> that it was not so much as any direct occasion thereof. Yea so farre vvas it from breeding the oecumenicall B. of the whole world, that it did not breed the Patriarckeship in the maine parts of the world, nor yet the superioritie of the Metropolitanes in the seuerall prouinces. For the superioritie of Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10663:338"/>
did arise as <hi>Beza</hi> supposeth from the very light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture directing, and force of necessitie vrging men to that course: but as I rather thinke from the institution of the Apostles, after whose times the first originall of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be shewen. For although actually they were not Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, till in the seuerall dioceses of the prouince Bishops were ordained; yet the euent plainely sheweth it was from the beginning intended that the Bishop of the mother ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie should be the chiefe in the prouince. And you haue heard before how in the Apostles times <hi>Ignatius</hi> the B. of Antioch was the Metropolitane B. of Syria, and in the age following <hi>Philippe</hi> the Metropolitane B of Creet, and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> the B. of Lyons was the Metropolitane of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in France. And although not long after the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches were acknowledged and in the councill of Nice esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in a godly policie, as <hi>Caluin,</hi>

                  <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Zanchius</hi> confesse, yet neither did the superioritie of Bishops breede them; nor they, the Papacy. The true originall of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie of Bishops Metropolitanes, and Patriarches in their circuites was the patterne of ciuill gouernment in the Romane Empire, diuided into certaine precin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts, which the Church did follow. Whereas therefore to each citie the countrey adioyning was subiect, the Apostles first pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Bishops in the cities, committing to their charge not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the citie but countrey subiect to it, which wee call a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese, wherein from the beginning, there was neuer more lawfully then one B. and whereas in euery prouince, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were many Cities, there was one Metropolis or mother citie, where the ruler of that prouince was seated; in like manner, so soone as Bishops were placed in the seuerall ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they acknowledged the B. of their mother citie their primate, and chiefe B. of the Prouince. And as the whole Empire was diuided among certaine gouernours, who were called <hi>praefecti praetorio,</hi> whereof one was placed in Rome hauing the gouernment of Italy, Affricke and part of Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum.

other countreyes of the East. A fourth in France gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning France, Germanie, Spaine and Britaine; so the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers prouinces subiect to the <hi>praefecti praetorio,</hi> at least the three former, were subiected to the Bishops of the same sees, who afterwards were called Patriarches; whose Patriarchal authoritie was ratified in the Councill of Nice;<note place="margin">

After Constantinople, was built, and made the seat of the Empire, diuers countreyes were subiect to the prefecture, and consequently to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke thereof.</p>
               <p>Neither as I said did the superioritie of Patriarches (though perhaps larger, then was absolutely needfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Ecclesiasticall causes of euery prouince might be sufficiently determined in the prouincial Synodes) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I say, it did not breede the Popes supremacie. Which did arise from another occasion: which was this. The Bishop of Constantinople, considering that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Alexandria and Antioch had that prerogatiue which they had, because they were seates of <hi>praefecti praetorio</hi>; and Rome, because it had beene the seate not onely of the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus,</hi> but of the Emperour himselfe, (though at that time in respect of ciuill gouernment it were subiect to the Exarch of Rauenna, for which cause the Archbishop of Rauenna contended with the B. of Rome for the superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie) and with all remembring, that Constantinople vvas the seate of the Empire; contended therefore, that as the Emperour, who had his seate at Constantinople, was the Monarch of the world, so himselfe might be acknowledged the vniuersall B. or oecumenicall Patriarch. The which am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, though it were condemned by <hi>Gregorie</hi> the B. of Rome as Antichristian (for there is no vniuersall B. or head

At length with much a doe, and contention, obtained of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Phocas,</hi> not only that he should be called an Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Patriarch, (for that title the B. of Constantinople ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once vsurped, enioyed it, as well as hee, and doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne it to this day) but that his See should be head of all Churches. And this was the true originall of the Popes supremacie.</p>

                     <hi>The refuter</hi> denyeth this inference to be <hi>Ieromes,</hi> or that any hath vrged such an inference from him.</q>
When indeed the inference plainely is <hi>Ieromes,</hi> and is that which among all their obiections, is to best purpose obiected by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinarians. <hi>Ierome</hi> had said before, that in the writings of the Apostles <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> is all one; and that before factions did arise by the instinct of the Diuell, some saying I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. the Churches were gouerned by the common counsell of Presbyters, &amp;c. Of those spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches when hee had made a briefe recitall, <hi>haecpropterea,</hi> &amp;c. he maketh an inference to this effect, that for as much as <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were all one at the first, therefore both Presbyters should know themselues to be subiect to the B. and BB superiour to the Presbyters by the custome of the Church, &amp;c. And for as much as at the first the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:10663:339" rendition="simple:additions"/>
churches were gouerned by the common councell of the Presbyters, as vnder the Apostles, that therefore the B. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set ouer the Presbyters should not altogether exclude them, but should in <hi>communi Ecclesia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regere</hi> rule the church in common; imitating <hi>Moses,</hi> who, when hee had in his power to rule the people of Israel alone, chose seauenty, with whom he might iudge the people.</p>
               <p>Which obiection, being better then any the refuter hath made in this booke, I will not let it passe without some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. For it appeareth that neither the Apostles or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall men being Bishops, were simply bound to vse the councell of the Presbyters, but that the vse of them was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie, after the example of <hi>Moses,</hi> as <hi>Ierome</hi> saith; and the auncient Bishops of the Primitiue Church who vvere of the best disposition, (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> by name) did follow their example, resoluing to doe nothing of moment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their counsell and aduise: seeking therein the good and peace of the Church. And this custome was vsed by all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bishops, vntill as I said, the Presbyters aduise and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to themselues seeming troublesome, and to the B. by reason of the frequent Synodes and Synodall constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons needlesse, grew out of vse; whereupon Canons vvere made that their counsell and assistance should be required an had in greater matters, which is not misliked but wished to be more vsed. And so much may suffice to haue answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an obiection; which the refuter doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>I proceede therefore to the third,<note place="margin">§ 12. <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 152. The chiefe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection that BB. are greater then Presbyters by the custome of the church not by Diuine ordinance.</note> which is as it vvere the shoote-anchor of the Disciplinarians; which fayling their Discipline vvill suffer shipwracke. Presbyters and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were all one; therefore Bishops are to know that they be greater then the Presbyters, rather by the custome of the Church, then by the truth of Diuine disposition.</p>
               <p>To this obiection I returned two answeres: the first, that where <hi>Ierome</hi> saith <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> is all one, it may be vndertooke of the names, vvhich hee proueth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note n="n" place="margin">Phil. 1.1. Acts 20.17.28. Tit. 1.5.7. 1 Pet. 5.</note> testimonies to be confounded in the vvritings of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:10663:340"/>
Apostles. And in this sense it is true, that whereas now <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus</hi> is more then <hi>Presbyter,</hi> it is to be ascribed to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Church, as before I haue noted out of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret.</hi> And in the same sense <hi>Augustine</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 19. <hi>ad Hier.</hi>
                  </note> is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, vvhen hee saith, <hi>according to the names of honour in which the vse of the Church hath preuailed</hi> Episcopatus, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopship is a name of greater honour then</hi> Presbyterium.</p>
               <p>The refuter comming to examine this answere, saith, I <q>
                     <hi>denyed the Antecedent</hi>
                  </q>, vvhen as indeed I granting the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, in that sense vvhich I giue in the answere, denyed the consequence. That although the distinction of the names vvas not by diuine disposition, but by the custome of the Church: yet that hindreth not, but the function may be of Apostolicall institution. Seeing they vvhich at the first vvere ordayned by the Apostles to the Episcopal fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though they vvere not called Bishops till they were chosen out of the Presbyters, yet vvere called sometimes <hi>the Apostles,</hi> sometimes <hi>the Angels</hi> of the churches. So that when the names were confounded, the offices were not.
But the refuter censureth this distinction<q> as an idle conceipt and shift hauing no colour of excuse for it.</q>
As though it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded excuse, vvhen I brought iust defence of it, vvhich hee is not able to answere. For how shall <hi>Ieromes</hi> minde be knowne in that assertion, that <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> was all one, but by the proofes vvhich he bringeth for it? but all his proofes are that the names vvere confounded in the vvritings of the Apostles; and that the same men were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Presbiteri &amp; Episcopi,</hi> and that was all that <hi>Ierome</hi> could truely inferre out of those places. For if hee would haue concluded out of them that the offices vvere confounded, his consequences would be very weake.</p>
               <p>The second defence of my answere vvas this, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> is to be vnderstood eyther of the names or of the offices: But not of the offices, therefore of the names. If you shall vnderstand <hi>Ierome,</hi> as affirming that the offices were confounded, and denying that the office and superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie of Bishops was of Diuine disposition, in that sense
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10663:340"/>
that Apostolicall ordinances may be said to be of Diuine Institution, you shall make <hi>Ierome,</hi> not onely to striue against the streame of all Antiquitie; but also to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to himselfe; but this latter is absurd; so is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>To the former reason the refuter answereth not,<note place="margin">§ 13. The refuters reply, that <hi>Ierome</hi> is not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the names.</note> but bringeth a reason or two, such as they be to ouerthrow my distinctions, seeking as we say <hi>clauum clauo pellere.</hi>
                  <q>Can any man be so sotttish, <hi>saith he,</hi> as to imagine that the question betwixt <hi>Ierome</hi> and those Deacons was about names, not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices? or would <hi>Ierome</hi> reason so simply as to proue the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Presbyters aboue Deacons, because the name of Presbyter and Episcopus was all one? it were absurd to spend more time in answering so vnreasonable a distinction. </q>
                  <hi>You see how bragge our refuter is, when hee seemeth to haue gotten neuer so little aduantage.</hi>
To his former question I answere, that although the question vvas concerning the office of Presbyters and Deacons vvhether were supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; yet <hi>Ierome</hi> might, and indeede did proue the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to be superiour, because as the Apostles did call themselues Presbyters, so Presbyters vvere called Bishops. Yea but saith he in the second question, Ierome <hi>would not reason so simply.</hi> Whereto I answere, that not onely learned men, but the holy Ghost also in the Scriptures<note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> doth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to that purpose, prouing their dignitie to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vvho haue obtained a greater name. For as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers <note n="r" place="margin">

                  </note> say, names are the resemblances and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the things.</p>
               <p>Secondly hee obiecteth the authoritie of diuerse new, and I confesse, worthy Diuines,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> who thinke that <hi>Ierome</hi> maketh a Bishop and a Presbyter all one, not in name one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in office also. Which is a kinde of arguing frequent with this refuter, but seldome or neuer vsed by any writer of worth. Against his authorities therefore that <hi>Ierome</hi> was of that iudgement, I feare not to oppose the reasons which I produced, and namely the second.
<hi>But saith hee</hi>
                  <q> we neede not stand in feare of that glittering flourish, whereby wee are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10663:341"/>
charged to make <hi>Ierome</hi> striue against the streame of all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, and to be contrarie to himselfe, if eyther hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the functions or deny it to be an Apostolicall ordinance, that Bishops should be set ouer the Presbyters. What one te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of Antiquitie within the first two hundred yeares, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath beene, or can be alledged to that purpose? of as little force are the allegations which M. D. saith, hee hath cited out of <hi>Ieromes</hi> writings.</q>
In both which answeres the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer sheweth himselfe to be very impudent. For first, that the office or degree of Bishop and Presbyter are distinct; haue I not brought forth most plaine and plentiful proofes, out of <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian,</hi> and other auncient writers? that Bishops were ordayned by the Apostles, haue I not alledged most pregnant testimonies out of <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hegesippus</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> cited by <hi>Eusebius?</hi> and can it seeme doubtfull to any, that shall reade vvhat is alledged by mee and the refuter in this controuersie which way the streame of Antiquitie runneth? And as for <hi>Ierome,</hi> vvhat more plaine testimonies can be desired, then those vvhich I brought to proue, that in his iudgement Bishops vvere ordayned by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. And that <hi>Ierome</hi> neuer thought, that the office of Bishop and Presbyter was confounded, it may further appeare by these reasons. For vvhere <hi>Paul</hi> vvriteth to the Bishops and Deacons at <hi>Philippi, here,</hi> saith <hi>Ierome</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hier. in Phil.</hi> 1.</note>, <hi>by Bishops wee vnderstand Presbyters. For in one Citie there could not be more Bishops then one.</hi> Which plainely sheweth, hee thought that although Presbyters had the name, yet they had not the office of Bishops, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there might be many in one Citie which had the name, yet there could be but one, that had the office of a Bishop. Againe on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. he <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hier. in</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3</note> saith, it is deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, vvhy the Apostle made no mention there of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, but comprehended them in the name of Bishops? <hi>because,</hi> saith he, <hi>the degree of Presbyters is the second, and almost the same with that of Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The second answere.</note>My second answere vvas, if <hi>Ierome</hi> must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10663:341"/>
as speaking of the office, that then wee are to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of those words, <hi>Diuine disposition,</hi> as including onely those things which be eyther directly and immediately of Diuine institution, or are <hi>Diuini iuris, of Diuine right,</hi> as being perpetuall and immutable; but not as excluding Apostolicall ordinances. For <hi>Ierome,</hi> besides that he hath plentifully testified, that Bishops were ordayned by the Apostles, hee doth also expressely call this function E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall an <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Euagr. Ad pag</hi> 153.</note> Apostolicall tradition.
But this testimonie the refuter thinketh to elude, because<q> 
                     <hi>in the writings of the Fathers, the precepts and obseruations of their forefathers though indeede not ordayned by the Apostles are called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall traditions.</hi>
                  </q> Which answere may haue place in such traditions, as haue no testimonie or proofe, that the Apostles ordayned them; but for this matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, vve haue had plentifull and pregnant proofes, and euident testimonies, not onely of other authors, but of <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe, plainely auouching, that Bishops were ordayned by the Apostles, and particularly relating the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vvhom, the places where, the time vvhen, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles ordayned them.</p>
               <p>If neither of these answeres, will satisfie the refuter, then must he be forced to confesse, that <hi>Ierome</hi> was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in this question, holding one while that Bishops were of Apostolicall Institution, and another vvhile that they were not. And if <hi>Ierome</hi> vvere vnconstant vvhich is the worst that can be obiected against this cause, and vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I would be loath to charge him, then let it be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether those testimonies which he hath in more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deliuered dogmatically and historically, for the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie of Bishops, himselfe being a Presbyter; are not to ouerweigh those fewer, which hee vttered <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10663:342"/>
I hold, shewing plainely in what sense I maintaine the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Diocesan Bishops to be of diuine institution. All which though the refuter passed ouer in silence, yet I thinke it needfull to repeate, that both my sinceritie, and his fraudulent dealing may appeare.</p>
               <p>My words in the Sermon were these: If his (that is <hi>Ieromes</hi>) meaning should be, that the superioritie of Bishops ouer Presbyters, though it be an Apostolicall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (as himselfe calleth it) yet notwithstanding is not directly of Diuine institution: although there be small difference betwixt these two (as I vnderstand Diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution) because what the Apostles did in the execution of their Apostolicall function they did by direction of the holy Ghost:<note place="margin">Acts 15. Acts 20.28.</note> so that they might truely say both of their ordinances, it seemed good to the holy Ghost and vs, and of the partyes by them ordayned, attend the flocke ouer which the holy Ghost hath made you ouerseers; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, for more euidence I will in the last place directly, yet briefely proue, that the Episcopall functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of Diuine institution, or that Bishops were ordained of God.</p>
               <p>In the margent also (fearing least my meaning would not plainely enough appeare) to preuent the cauils of those which be aduersaries to the cause vvhich I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, I noted these words. Though in respect of the first institution, there is small difference betweene an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall and Diuine ordinance, because what was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apostles proceeded from GOD (in vvhich sense and no other, I doe hold the Episcopall function to be a Diuine ordinance, I meane in respect of the first institution) yet in respect of perpetuitie, difference by some is made betweene those things which be <hi>Diuini,</hi> and those which be <hi>Apostolici iuris</hi>: the former, in their vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being generally, perpetually and immutably necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; the latter, not so. So that the meaning of my defence plainely is, that the Episcopall gouernment hath this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation aboue other formes of Ecclesiasticall regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10663:343" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that in respect of the first institution, it is a Diuine ordinance; but that it should be such a Diuine ordinance, as should be generally, perpetually, immutably, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily obserued, so as no other forme of gouernment, may in no case be admitted, I did not take vpon mee to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
With what conscience therefore the refuter hath laid the maintenance of that assertion to my charge, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the explanation of my defence in this place, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may easily iudge; especially if hee remember that where hee thought any aduantage could be taken out of this explanation of my defence, there hee taketh notice of it, as namely <hi>page</hi> 90. of his booke; where hee suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that I auouch a necessitie of retayning the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diocesan Bishops, hee vseth these words. <q>

               </p>
               <p>To this argument the refuter answereth nothing, but that, which I haue plainely and fully confuted before; that Timothie <hi>was not a Bishop,</hi> though <hi>Caluin</hi> as you see, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that <hi>Timothie</hi> by the oracle of the holy Ghost was chosen into the order of Pastors. For if hee were a Pastor, it is not to be doubted, but he was a Bishop.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Archippus</hi> was ordayned Bishop of God, I proue thus. Because <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Paul</hi> vsing the same exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him vvhich hee gaue to <hi>Timothie</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.5.</note> the Bishop of Ephesus, namely, that hee should fulfill his ministerie, hee addeth, <hi>which thou hast receiued in the Lord</hi>; and therefore by Gods ordinance, and as it vvere at his hands.</p>
               <p>The refuter hauing framed the argument thus,
<q>
                     <p>Hee that receiued his Episcopall ministerie in the Lord, was ordained a B. by the Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Archippus</hi> receiued his Episcopall ministerie in the Lord:</p>
                     <p>Therefore hee was ordained Bishop by the Lord:</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He denyeth the proposition; <hi>because neither is all Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall ministerie proper to a Diocesan Bishop, else the Apostle would not haue made a</hi> B <hi>and Presbyter all one; neither is that office onely in the Lord.</hi> Of which reasons, the latter is meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent, and friuolous. For who euer said, or thought, that the office of a Bishop onely is in the Lord?
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10663:344" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neither is the former to any purpose, seeing he knoweth, that by Episcopall ministerie I vnderstand the function of a Diocesan Bishop, and therefore should not haue denyed the proposition, but haue distinguished of the assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, saying, that hee did not receiue the Episcopall ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, meaning the function of a Diocesan Bishop.

<q>
                     <p>Those who are called by the holy Ghost the Angels of the Church; and were signified by the seauen starres which were in Christs right hand, had Diuine both insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and approbation:</p>

                     <p>Therefore the Diocesan Bishops of the seauen Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had diuine both institution and approbation.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition I proued, because they who are called Angels are authorized and sent of God, and starres vvhose both preheminence of dignitie is noted in this life (for the starres <note n="i" place="margin">Apoc. 12.1.</note> are the crowne of the Church) and also prerogatiue of glorie which they shall haue in the world to come. And finally, they who are signified by the seauen starres in the right hand of Christ, are such as Christ doth both approue and protect.</p>
               <p>The assumption I went not about to proue now, because it was proued at large in the former part of the Sermon.
And yet all that the refuter answereth to the purpose, is, <q>
                     <hi>that they were not Diocesan Bishops.</hi>
                  </q>
For that which he addeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, is but the vttering of his spleene, and emptying his gall against Bishops, to whom he cannot abide (such is his malice) that the titles of Angels and starres, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the holy Ghost giueth to the Bishops of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10663:344" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Churches, and which himselfe acknowledgeth to be titles common to all ministers, should be applyed to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. It is true, that these titles of Angels and stars are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all ministers, yet <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (to signifie their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence) they be attributed to Bishops. For as I haue said before; when in a Church, where are many Ministers, who are all tearmed Angels, the Bishop onely is called the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Church, this title doth note his singular prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. And the same is signified when as there being a great number of ministers in <hi>Asia</hi> who all were starres, the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Bishops onely of those Churches are signified by the seauen starres vvhich Christ held in his right hand. Now if these seauen Bishops were Diocesan Bishops as I haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly proued them, and all the Bishops of the auncient Churches to haue beene; then must the refuter be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to endure, both that Diocesan Bishops were called the Angels of the Churches, and the starres which Christ held in his right hand; and consequently also, that the function of Diocesan Bishops is of Diuine institution. And thus passing by his rayling, as not worth the mentioning, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to the conclusion of my Sermon.</p>

               <p>My resolution of this doubt I signified before <hi>Serm. pag.</hi> 92. that I did not hold it so to be <hi>diuini iuris,</hi> as that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily it were to be obserued alwayes and in all places, and so himselfe confesseth <hi>pag.</hi> 90. of his booke.
And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he said<q> 
                     <hi>my resolution was obscure and doubtfull</hi>
                  </q> (<hi>for doubling</hi> I leaue to him) he was disposed to cauill.

Which conceipt of theirs hath perhaps beene the cause, vvhy they haue giuen out to make my Sermon odious among their followers, that I maintaine the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall function to be <hi>diuini iuris,</hi> as being commanded of God, and perpetually imposed vpon all Churches. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, I plainely declared my resolution to be this, that although we be well assured, that the forme of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Bishops is the best, as hauing not onely the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of scripture for the first institution, but also the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall practise of the Church from the Apostles times to our age, for the continuance of it; notwithstanding vve doubt not, vvhere this may not be had, others may be admitted; neither doe we deny, but that siluer is good, though gold be better, vvhich obiection and answere, I inserted of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose into the Sermon, to preserue the credit of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, vvhere the Presbyterian discipline is

But as alwayes hitherto, so now also, he hath shewed his malice to be greater then his strength. For though hee chargeth me, as hauing often and peremptorily auouched the perpetuall necessitie of the gouernment of the Church by Diocesan Bishops: yet neither often, nor once, neither peremptorily, nor at all, neither the perpetuall necessitie, nor any absolute necessitie at all, is vrged in any one of the allegations, which hee so hotly, as it were with fire and towe, obiecteth. The first which is obiected out of <hi>pag.</hi> 33. hath beene explained before. For when I said, that as <hi>the gouernment by Bishops was first ordayned for the preseruation of the Church in vnity, and for the auoiding of schisme; so it is for the same cause to be retained</hi>: I did not meane any absolute necessitie of retaining it, but that as at the first it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as being thought fit, expedient and needfull to auoid schisme; so it is fit, expedient and needfull for the same cause to be retained. Neither doe I see how hee can inferre this perpetuall necessitie which he talketh of out of <hi>pag.</hi> 72. where I said, <hi>the Epistles to</hi> Timothie <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>are the very patternes and Presidents of the Episcopall function, whereby the Apostle informeth them, and in them all Bishops how to exercise their function touching ordination and iurisdiction.</hi> For although <hi>Paul</hi> giueth his directions primarily to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and to all such as should haue the like fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that is to say, Bishops: yet if this forme of gouernment be changed, those which shall exercise the like authority, must follow those directions, as being giuen, though pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and directly to Bishops, yet secondarily, and by consequence, to those who though they were not Bishops,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10663:346"/>
should haue the like authority And to the like purpose is that alleadged out of <hi>pag.</hi> 74. <hi>and that we should not thinke as some doe that these things were spoken to them as to extraordinarie persons (whose authoritie should dye with them) but to them and their successors to the end of the world, he straitly chargeth</hi> Timothie, <hi>that the commandements and directions which hee gaue him, should be kept inuiolable vnto the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ; and therefore by such, as should haue the like authority vnto the end.</hi> And presently after, <hi>for the authority which was committed to them is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually necessary, without which the Church neither can be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned (as without iurisdiction) neither yet continued (as without ordination) and therefore not peculiar to extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry persons, but by an ordinary deriuation to be continued in those, who are the successors of</hi> Timothie <hi>and</hi> Titus. Here I appeale to the refuters conscience whether he be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the truth of both these sentences. Can he deny, the authority which was committed to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> to be perpetually necessary, which is the summe of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sentence? or if it be perpetually necessary, that some were to haue it to the end of the world, which was affirmed in the former sentence? If he had learned the distinction betwixt <hi>potestas, &amp; modus potestatis,</hi> whereof I spake before; the power or authority it selfe being the perpetuall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, the manner or forme of gouernment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that power is exercised being mutable; hee would not so hotly haue vrged these allegations.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Yea but</hi> that pag. <hi>79.</hi> is aboue all shew of exception <hi>saith hee</hi> where hee saith, the function and authority which <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had was not to end with their persons but to be continued in their successors as being ordinary and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually necessary not onely for the well being, but also for the very being of the visible Churches.</q>

                  </gap>ch is to be vnderstood, I distinctly shewed before, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (I protest) of this obiection made by the Refuter. For when I said, <hi>their function and authority was ordinarie and perpetually necessary,</hi> I meant, that their function was
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10663:347"/>
ordinary as being Pastorall and Episcopall, and that the authority which they had was perpetually necessary, as was said in the former allegations.</p>
               <p>If he shall perhaps vrge those words which mention the successors of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to the end of the world: I answere, it is more then likely, that they shall haue successors in the same function in some Churches to the end, that is to say, Bishops; though in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that forme of gouernment being altered, the authority may be in those who doe not succeed them in the said function at least in the same forme and manner of gouerning.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§ 3.</note>This being all which he hath gained by these allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he might haue forborne his triumphing insultations, which bewray his want of iudgement.
For where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth against me this contradiction, as though I held, both <q>
                     <hi>that the gouernment by Bishops is necessary for the very being of visible Churches, and also that there may be visible Churches without it</hi>;</q> either he doth ignorantly mistake, or wilfully depraue my sayings.
For though I said, the authority which <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> exercised, was perpetually neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, both to the being of Churches as the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and to the well being as the authority of iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet I neuer said, that this forme of gouernment was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the being of visible Churches.
And where hee goeth about to proue, that <q>
                     <hi>the Episcopall gouernment is not perpetually necessary, because there be many visible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at this day without it</hi>;</q> what doth hee else, but fight with his owne shadow, seeing that in fauour onely of those Churches this passage was by me inserted?<note place="margin">Whether more refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall or by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terian disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, hee impudently ouer-reacheth, when he saith<q>

                  </q>
For not to mention all other Churches which be in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world, which haue alwayes had, and still haue Bishops: and to speake onely of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Europe: is it not euident, that the farre greater part of them is gouerned by Bishops, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10663:347"/>
which is all one with Bishops; by Superintendents? The refuter, when hee desired to the vttermost <hi>pag.</hi> 52. to enlarge the number of those Churches which haue the Presbyterian Discipline, he reckoned the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Fraunce, the Low-countreyes, Saxony, Heluetia, Bohemia, Zuricke, Berne, Geneua, Sauoy, Palatine, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Hungary, Gernsey, Iersey, Scotland: from which number notwithstanding some Churches are to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, as all in Scotland, and some if not all, in Saxony, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I suppose that their Presbyterian discipline is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in Zuricke, and all the Churches of Heluetia, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any one whole kingdome ruled by that discipline. So that I am perswaded there are scarse so many particular Churches or congregations, gouerned by the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian discipline in all the world, as are gouerned by Bishops in the Kings dominions, in great Britaine and in Ireland.

Whereunto I answered, that those godly and learned men allowed the Episcopall function, and simply desired the continuance thereof, if with it they might haue enioyed the Gospell. For proofe whereof I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the reader to the Suruey of the pretended discipline <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 110.111. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In refuting of which answere, the refuter dealeth very absurdly with me, and the reuerend author of the Suruey. For when I referred the reader to a Chapter of that booke, contayning many notable testimonies, to proue that which I said: the refuter dealeth as a man resolued to deny my conclusion, what proofes so euer I should bring against him.
And though I referre him to testimonies for number and weight sufficient, either to satisfie, or to conuince him, if he would but haue turned to the place; yet he saith, <q>hee cannot possibly see, how I should haue any such opinion of those godly and learned men, whose writings (<hi>as he saith</hi>) doe so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and so vehemently professe the contrary. And that he may not seeme to speake without ground, he desireth me to leaue the Surueyour, and heare what he can say.</q>
As if the Surueyour were not worthie to be heard when the learned refuter is to speake. When as indeed our Refuter, for ought I see by him, is not for wisedome, learning and iudgement worthie to be named with that reuerend Author on the same day. But though he would seeme not to vouchsafe an answere to the Suruey, yet the truth is, he durst not acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with those testimonies: which howsoeuer before I did mention for breuity sake, I may not now wholy conceale from the Reader.</p>

And first, though he saith <q>
                     <hi>hee will passe by an Epistle of one</hi> Oram <hi>written vnder the name of</hi> Lucifer <hi>to the Pope and his Prelates,</hi> yet because he entreateth the Reader <hi>to turne to it in the booke of Martyrs,</hi> as fitting belike our

Bishops, hee is worthy not to passe vnpunished, when hee comes to light</q>
For that letter being a meere inuectiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the horrible enormities of the Popish Prelates, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nothing at all of their office, but that <hi>they were the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours of the Apostles,</hi> in referring the Reader vnto it, what was his intent, but that he should apply the things spoken of their greiuous enormities to our Bishops? then which, hee could not offer a greater villany to them. I desire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that hath any moderation in him to read that Epistle, and by his intended application thereof to our Bishops, to iudge of our refuters spirit, though he professeth in the last page, how greatly he reuerenceth the Bishops persons.</p>
               <p>In the next place, to let you thinke hee hath great store (euen whiles hee quoteth either not Protestants or such as were not of our age, of whom alone the question is) hee saith, <q>
                     <hi>he will passe by also that which is written by defensor pacis part.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</q> and well might hee passe by him; for though he hold, that the Priestly Character is the same in Priests and Bishops, yea in the Pope himselfe, and that they haue the same essentiall authority which is the power of order, and likewise in imitation of <hi>Ierome</hi> holdeth, that <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> at the first were one, &amp;c.
Notwithstanding, he no more disalloweth the superiority of Bishops; then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some other Papists, who haue contended, that for as much as order, in that it is a Sacrament, hath reference to the Sacrament of the Altar which the Priest doth offer, and make his maker, as well as the Pope himselfe, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Bishops and Presbyters be of one order; or then <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> who though he saith <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were at the first all one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet professeth, that the safety of the Church dependeth vpon the dignity of the Bishop, &amp;c.</p>

Indeed in the booke of Martyrs, where be eighteene articles obiected against <hi>Wickliffe</hi> (though neither the twelfth article which the Refuter mentioneth, nor that which <hi>Pighius</hi> obiecteth against him is contayned in that number) the which articles he explaneth. Among which the fifteenth is this, <hi>that euery Priest rightly and duely ordered according to the law of grace, hath power according to his vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby he may minister the Sacraments, and consequently absolue any man confessing his fault, being contrite and penitent for the same.</hi> Which article, when he came to expound, hee gaue this reason; <hi>because that the order of Priesthood in his owne nature and substance receiueth no such degrees either of more or lesse.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus haue I recited word for word what is set downe in the booke of Martyrs; the words whereof the Refuter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praueth, making <hi>Wickliffe</hi> to say,<note place="margin">

                  </q> Whereby he would make the Reader beleeue, that he differed from those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, with whom he doth agree: affirming (as many others

To the same purpose is alledged his assertion of two orders Priests and Deacons, which the Papists themselues holde, diuiding Priests <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But I had almost forgotten his first allegation, which the Refuter pretending such plenty, might well haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as impertinent.

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:10663:351"/>Whereto I answere, first, that these articles were indeed exhibited against him to the Pope by <hi>Michael de Causis,</hi> but I doe not read, that either he acknowledged them to be true, or that he was condemned for them. Secondly, in the book of Martyrs, and also in his Story prefixed before his works, it is said, that of the articles which were obiected against him, there were but a few which he acknowledged to be true. This therefore is the refuters argument, <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> was accused by his malicious aduersaries, who made no conscience of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him falsly, that hee held all these articles; therefore all these were his opinions. But if it be sufficient to accuse, as the Emperour said, who can be innocent? the godlyest Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs neuer wanted accusers; whom if the refuter should ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pronounce guilty of those matters whereof they were accused, he should shew himselfe a wise man. But so he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with <hi>Iohn Hus</hi>: he was accused of these opinions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he held them. Wherfore he must either proue, that <hi>Hus</hi> did acknowledge them to be true, or else what doth hee but subscribe to the accusations of his malicious accusers against him. But suppose the first of these three were his, what will the refuter inferre thereof? he did not hold nor allowe that by the Church was meant the Pope, Cardinalls, Archbishops and Clergie vnderneath them; therefore hee did not allowe the calling of Orthodoxall Bishops. <hi>Michael de Causis</hi> his accuser, for this article quoteth his booke <hi>de Ecclesia,</hi> where I finde this assertion (by the allegation whereof, you may guesse how he was vsed in the rest) that the Pope of Rome <note n="x" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This allegation the refuter hath notably wrenched.

               <p>In the next place he citeth <hi>Viret,</hi> as pleading for a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar state in euery church; wherein, if the allegation be true, he is singular, hauing neither the iudgement of any other sound Diuine, nor practise of any reformed Church that I know of, No not of <hi>Geneua</hi> it selfe, to second him. For though the common wealth of <hi>Geneua</hi> be reduced to a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular state, yet the gouernment of the church by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorie, is Aristocraticall.</p>
               <p>And though he passeth by (as well he might) <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Bullinger, Brentius, Musculus,</hi> whom he thought good to mention onely as fauourers of the pretended discipline; yet neither any of these, nor any other moderate and iudicious Diuine doth condemne (as our Presbyterians doe) eyther the ancient gouernment by Bishops in the primitiue Church, or the retayning thereof in reformed churches now, as hath been shewed before.</p>
               <p>But he is pleased to <hi>conclude with some of our own writers and Martyrs.</hi>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10663:354"/>
eyther now, or in the Primitiue church, which was the point to be proued. And the like is to be said of <hi>Iohn Lambart, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Bradford</hi> whom hee citeth as holding that the Scripture knoweth no difference betwixt a B. and a minister, meaning that the names were confounded and that nothing is to be gotten by the succession of Popish BB. as minister not, but Lord it: yet nothing can be alleadged out of him to proue that he disalloweth the gouernment of orthodoxal Bishops.</p>
               <p>But it is strange, that he should alleadge B. <hi>Hooper,</hi> and B. <hi>Bale,</hi> as disallowing in their iudgement, the superioritie of BB. which they allowed in their practise. But all that is said out of B. <hi>Hooper,</hi> is eyther that BB. were not till <hi>Siluesters</hi> or <hi>Constantines</hi> time,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad pag.</hi> 164.</note>B. <hi>Bale</hi> vnderstandeth by the names of blasphemie writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the heads of the beast. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. the titles of Popish offices, which he saith are vsurped, and not appointed by the holy Ghost; among which when he reckoneth Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, Diocesans, Parsons, Vicars, and Doctors, he cannot be vnderstood as speaking of these offices in the true church, but as they are members of Antichrist. For what is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Parson, but of a Pastour, &amp;c. And that this vvas his meaning, appeareth by the other allegation <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>In Apoc.</hi> 17.3.</note>, wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the titles and offices of the Popish hierarchy (among whom he reckoneth BB.

               <p>After these, for want of better proofes, hee alleadgeth the testimonie of the English men which were at <hi>Geneua</hi> in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10663:354"/>
Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, and were the first authors of this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the pretended discipline among vs; to whose testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in their owne cause, that <hi>they present to vs the forme of a Church limited within the compasse of Gods word,</hi> what should I answere, but that they haue often said, but neuer will be able to proue, that their discipline is prescribed in Gods word?</p>
               <p>Lastly, he alleadgeth M. <hi>Foxe,</hi> whose testimonie though in vaine I sought in three seuerall editions; yet his iudgement is apparant, by that which may easily be found. Hee therefore saith, according to the refuters allegation, that <hi>in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church there was not then any one mother Church</hi> (such as the church of Rome now pretendeth her selfe to be) <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue other Churches, but the whole vniuersall Church was the mother Church, vnder which vniuersall Church in generall were comprehended all other particular Churches in speciall</hi> (hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Churches of seuerall countreyes, and Prouinces) <hi>as sister Churches together, not one greater then another but all in like aequalitie.</hi> What will hee hence conclude, that therefore there were no BB. nor Archbishops? Not so. But that therefore as the Diocesan churches were equall, so were the BB. and as the Metropolitane churches were equal, so the Archbb. Heare M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foxe</hi>

               <p>If they say there must needs be distinction of degrees in the church, and in this distinction of degrees superioritie must necessarily be granted for the outward discipline of the church for directing matters, for quieting of schismes, for setting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mencing of Conuocations &amp; Councils as need shal require, &amp;c. Against this superioritie we stand not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we yeeld to our superiour powers, Kings and Princes our due obedience, and to our lawfull gouernours vnder God of both regiments, Ecclesiasticall and Temporall. <hi>Also in the Ecclesiasticall state we take not away the distinction of ordinarie degrees, such as by the scripture be appointed, or by the Primitiue Church allowed. As Patriarkes or Archbb. BB. Ministers and Deacons,</hi> for of these foure we especially reade, as chiefe. In which foure degrees, as we grant diuersitie of office, so we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the same also diuersitie of dignitie: neither denying that which is due to each degree, neither yet maintaining the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10663:355"/>
ambition of any singular person. For as we giue to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster place aboue the Deacon, to the B aboue the Minister, to the Archbishop aboue the B. so wee see no cause of inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, why one Minister, should be aboue another minister: one Bishop in his degree aboue another B. to deale in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese, or one Archbb. aboue another Archbishop. And this is to keepe an order duely and truely in the church, &amp;c. Here then is the question betweene vs and the Papists, whether the Metropolitane church of Rome with the Archbb. of the same ought to be preferred before other Metropolitane churches and Archbb through vniuersall Christendome or not?</p>

It being <hi>an easier matter</hi> as the Fathers of the Affricane council professed, <hi>to find many fit men to be Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> (especially if the laitie also afford fit men for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) <hi>then to finde one fit to be a B.</hi> But the refuter doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, first who should haue ordained them, secondly, how they should haue been maintained, thirdly, and chiefely, whether the assistance of the ciuil Magistrates could haue been had for deposing the BB. vnles they had yeelded both to the dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bishoprickes, and to the alteration of the forme of gouernment, &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But why in other churches the learned men haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored BB. I gaue this reason: for that they could not, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because the Popish BB. were still countenanced by the ciuill Magistrate, as in France: or because the forme of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill gouernment being after the expulsion of the B. changed into a popular state, could no more endure the gouernment of a B. then Rome after the expulsion of <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of a King. The refuter saith <q>
                     <hi>they could</hi>
                  </q>, thereby insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating that they would not. But doth he thinke that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish BB. in France countenanced by the state, would endure Antibishops to be set vp against them in their Diocese? And for <hi>Geneua,</hi> is it not a plaine case, that, that state was so farre from admitting againe the gouernment of BB. that <hi>Caluin</hi> being out of hope to get a Presbytery established of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters alone, was faine to accept of a Presbyterie wherin twelue Citizens are ioyned to sixe Ministers? neither is that to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted which <hi>Zanchius</hi> in the place before cited, doth adde in the next words. <hi>But euen in those Churches also where neither the good Greeke names, nor the bad Latine names are vsed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there vse to be some chiefe men, in whose hands all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie almost is. Where therefore these be vpheld and Bishops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled it may seeme to be but a controuersie concerning the names, but when wee agree of the things, why should we striue about the names?</hi> At <hi>Geneua,</hi> while <hi>Caluin</hi> liued, he was the perpetuall president of their Ecclesiasticall Senate, differing rather in name, then authoritie from a B. And <hi>Beza</hi> likewise for the space of ten yeares had the like authoritie, till <hi>Danaeus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither that course was altered. Since which time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Beza</hi> finding some inconueniences, which he knew not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, hath sometimes signified his desire to some (whom I know) wishing with all his heart, that with the reformation of religion the Episcopall gouerment in that church had beene retayned. And I haue beene very credibly informed, that the most learned and iudicious Diuines both in France, and <hi>Geneua,</hi> could well be contented, that the ancient go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment by BB. were renewed among them. which neede
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10663:356"/>
not seeme strange to vs, seeing in the Church of Scotland, where the <hi>Geneua</hi> Discipline had for a long time beene pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, notwithstanding, when the matter was referred to voices, of that great number which were assembled to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, there were not aboue fiue which stood for the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian discipline, as I haue beene informed by some that were there.</p>
               <p>But there are two things more in the refuters answere to be touched; the one that against sense he chargeth me twice in this place <q>
                     <hi>as holding the gouernment by</hi> BB. <hi>to be so necessary as that there cannot be a visible Church without it.</hi> I say, <hi>against sense,</hi> 
                  </q>because in the former part of this section I acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that where this gouernment could not be had, others might be admitted: and in this place, I doe not onely excuse those Diuines which wanting the Episcopall gouernment brought in the Presbyteries, but also commend their fact as wisely performed.</p>
               <p>The other is, that out of a desire of contradicting me, hee <q>
                     <hi>denyeth the state of</hi> Geneua <hi>to be popular.</hi> But let <hi>Bodin</hi> vvho could discerne betweene the diuers formes of policie, be iudge betweene vs.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The selfe same yeare</hi> saith he, <hi>that</hi> Andreas Doria <hi>did establish the Aristocracie at</hi> Geneua, <hi>did they of</hi> Geneua <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing expelled their</hi> B. <hi>change the Monarchy into a popular state. And after libertie was restored to the commonweale, although they ordayned a Senate or Councill of two hundred men, yet the people reserued to themselues the right &amp; authoritie of making lawes, of creating the chiefe Magistrates, of making warre and concluding peace,</hi> which are the principall prerogatiues of Soueraigntie, called <hi>iura Maiestatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the latter part of this Section I did accuse the innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours among vs, affirming that as in those places where or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall Bishops could not be had, Presbyteries were wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought in: so are they very inconsiderately obtruded on those churches, where Bishops most soundly professing the Gospell of Christ are established; especially, considering that the gouernment by Bishops is not onely simply good, and lawfull, but also in comparison to be preferred before the Presbyterian Discipline, as hauing better warrant. Here the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10663:357"/>
refuter, who was so ready to take away the excuses vvhich I brought for other churches, hath nothing to pretend as an excuse for himselfe and his consorts.</p>
