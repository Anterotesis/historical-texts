            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The firſt publique Lecture read at Sir. <hi>Balthazar Gerbier</hi> his Accademie, concerning Military Architecture or Fortification.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall by way of Preface, ſay ſomewhat in generall concerning this Art of Military Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, properly termed Architecture, by reaſon that it ſerves for a rule to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Forts, Caſtles, and Towns; though their beſiegers batter, and ruine them, faſter then they were firſt erected by the ſame Art. Its true, warre is to have ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for it in divers places, wherewith they maintain their proceedings, againſt the opinion of ſome ſcrupulous men, who will rather be taken (and even looſe all) then learn how beſt to defend themſelves; when they cannot deny, but that even the Apoſtles were commanded by the Prince of Peace to provide Armes for defence.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures doe in effect in ſundry places warrant ſo much the proceedings of warriours; that therefore this art of Military Architecture is the more laudable, and to be made uſe of as well in the defence, as for the beſieging of places; ſo the preſcriptions be duely obſerved, and that the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Towns and People have thoſe grounds preſcribed by holy writ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:117549:3"/>Deutronomie 20. cap. 11. and 12. verſ. <hi>When thou commeſt nigh a Citty to fight againſt it, then proclaim a Peace unto it; and it ſhall be, if it make thee anſwer of Peace and open unto thee; then it ſhall be that all the People that is found therein ſhall be tributary unto thee, and they ſhall ſerve thee; but if they will make warre againſt thee, then thou ſhalt beſiege it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other Texts preſcribe the beſiegers to make havock of all; yet in ſome things with a certain reſtriction, of ſparing even the Trees of the field; as we read in the 19. v. of the ſaid Chapter of <hi>Deutron.</hi> viz. <hi>When thou ſhalt beſiege a Citty a long time in making warr againſt it, to take it; thou ſhalt not deſtroy the Trees thereof, by forcing an Ax, againſt them; for thou mayeſt eate of them, and thou ſhalt not cut them down (for the Tree of the field is mans Life) to imploy them in the ſiege; Onely the Trees which thou knoweſt that they be no Trees for meat, thou ſhalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and cut them down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This holy writ ſayth, but few men obſerve it in any age, nor among the moſt regular, for that thoſe of <hi>Machl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It hath beene therefore noted at all times, that the <hi>Switzers</hi> in the times of the <hi>Romans,</hi> made their wars deteſtable for laying the land waſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by firing it; and ſo the proceedings of the <hi>Campaniens</hi> were abhorred, when <hi>Agathocles</hi> (fighting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117549:3"/>
in <hi>Sicily</hi> being entred into <hi>Meſsina</hi> under colour of freindſhip) put to death the greateſt number of the Citizens, to get their meanes: And</p>
            <p>And it was no leſſe odious in <hi>Haniball,</hi> when after he had given his Parole to <hi>Gerion</hi> a Town neer <hi>Nicerie,</hi> to put all the Inhabitants to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that this Preface may not weary you, I ſhall proceed to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WEE ſhall beginne by the diviſions of the places which are ſtrong either by nature, or by art, or both. By nature when their ſeate proves ſo advantageous that it is very hard, nay almoſt impoſſible to force them, ſuch as are the places that are on Hils and inacceſſible Rocks, either in the Seas, on the Land, or in the Marches, or ſuch other like places.</p>
            <p>Thoſe are ſtrong by art, wihch wanting an advantagious ſeate, are fortified by art and labour.</p>
            <p>Such Places are ſtrong by nature and by art, when the one part of them is ſtrong by nature, and the other is fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by art.</p>
            <p>To fortifie is to build, or to incloſe the places in ſuch a manner that all the places of their circumference are ſeene from each other flancke, and that they can reſiſt the armes and engins whereof the Enemy makes uſe:</p>
            <p>And therefore it ſhall bee ſaid a place to bee well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified whenſoever all the parts of its circumference are flanckt.</p>
            <p>A place that hath but a ſingle ſtraight wall about it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be a fortified place, but onely incloſed, and whatſoever doth flanck as what is flancked, ought to be ſtrong enough to reſiſt the Engins of an Enemy.</p>
            <p>Flancking is to ſee by its ſides; To bee flancked, its to be ſeen either by the ſide or flanck.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of Fortifications in generall, one the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117549:4"/>
ancient, and the other moderne:</p>
            <p>The Places that are fortified according unto the ancient manner, are thoſe that have ſingle Wals onely, and with Towers at certaine diſtances, made of Materials that are not capable to reſiſt the Canon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Towers being too ſmall as that they cannot beare any Canon; Thoſe kinde of places deſerve not to be ſaid fortified ones:</p>
            <p>The Modernes are thoſe which are flancked on all ſides, and that the flancking and flancked bodies are ſo ſolid and of ſuch matter as that they may reſiſt the Canon.</p>
            <p>Every Country hath its owne way of Fortification, as the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Italians,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> &amp;c they differ in certain circumſtances, or accidents, but agree in the eſſentiall parts:</p>
            <p>There are two kindes of modern Fortfication, to wit; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and Irregular;</p>
            <p>The Regular places are thoſe, that have the ſides and the angles equall; and ſuch Baſtions as are on them, and its ſtrength every where equall:</p>
            <p>The Irregular places are thoſe that have not the aforeſaid equality, either of the ſides or the Baſtions or of ſtrength,</p>
            <p>Of that kinde are the moſt part of places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It might be ſaid againſt this definition, that a place wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch hath all its faces, and all its Baſtions equall, being commanded from any ſide; its ſtrength could nor be equally ſtrong every where: therefore according to the definition it could not be regular, which is abſurd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I doe anſwer, that a place, though commanded from ſome ſide, would nevertheleſſe be equally ſtrong every where in it ſelf: but from this ſide that ſtrength would bee over-topt by that of the commanding which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would remain the ſame, though the ſaid greater ſtrength ſtood not in opoſition of it, as a man that ſhall reſiſt another ordinary man, and cannot reſiſt a Gyant; he ſhall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
