            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Lords Free Priſoner.</head>
            <p>MUch honoured and beloved in our Lord, having been often put upon it by one friend and another to give an account by word of mouth, of the caſe of my preſent conſinement, in <hi>Newgate-Priſon,</hi> that when you hear a true Narration of the matter of fact, you may be the better able to judge of the matter of right, I therefore give this ſhort Hiſtory, of the Sum and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my former and preſent Croſs for Chriſt, which I, through Grace, and Mercy, obtained from my Lord, do take up, and bear for him, thus following him to fulfil after him.</p>
            <p>This letter is a Word-Apologie under Patient-ſuffering For a faithful Teſtimony, or a neceſſary Vindication, and a juſt Defence of <hi>F. B.</hi> As to his Caſes of ſuffering, Several Impriſonments, the cauſe of thoſe ſufferings, his call to them, his carriage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, to the honour of his Lord, to the furtherance of the Goſpel, and for the wiping off, of ſeveral injurious Aſperſions, and falſe Charges, which have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, and wrongfully caſt upon him. What my Call has been to the Miniſterial Office I have<note n="†" place="margin">in a ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, Intituled them Acher, a name an after one. a name a new on &amp;c.</note> elſewhere publiſhed.</p>
            <p>I am a Miniſter of Chriſt, ſent forth by him, to bring in an open Teſtimony for him, &amp; for the glory of the latter day; I have for theſe laſt twenty years eſpecially, or more been honour'd with ſeveral impriſonments; for the cauſe and ſake of Chriſt, of the Goſpel, and of Righteouſneſs: to paſs by ſome of them, which were but ſhort for ſome few days, <hi>I</hi> was eight years, and three quarters of a ninth year, under confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> Priſon in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> for Preaching, Praying, Reading, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and applying the Scriptures, and of ſinging Hymns, and ſuch like parts of my office, and for not Conforming to the corruption of the times in the matters of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; during which time, <hi>I</hi> had wonderful experiences of the wiſdom, power, loving kindneſs of <hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> and many other Covenant favours in ſpecial unto me, in healing, ſtre ngthning, conforting, teaching, inlightning, in a peculiar manner, and in divers ways of ſpirit,-illuminations, whereof I have elſewhere given an account. Upon my diſcharge from that confinement, without paying one penny of that Fine which was laid upon me, I went on with my Mniniſterial Office and work as before, here and there, as I had opportunity and a call; but <hi>I</hi> was quickly apprehended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and impriſoned at <hi>Salisbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> for about eighteen weeks, which filled up my<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 10.</note> Ten days of Tribulation in the Lètter of it, aday for an year, wherein I greatly rejoyce; it was for the ſame cauſe as is before mentioned, after that Term of weeks I had my diſcharge from that confinement (without paying one farthing of the Fine or Mulct) How much to be admired the appearings of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> my <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> were in a very ſignal way and manner for me and againſt many of my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his juſt judgments, upon and againſt them, were worthy of an Hiſtorical Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but I would keep within the compaſs of one Sheet.</p>
            <p>Upon my releaſe, <hi>I</hi> came to this City, <hi>London,</hi> for the further filling up of my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in and near it. At <hi>Bethenal-Green,</hi> my labours were neither unacceptable, nor unproſitable, where, with ſome who deſired it, I had Providential Communion for ſome time. After a while my Reſidence was more in the City and Subburbs: having gathered a people unto Chriſt, who ſubmitted unto Believers Baptiſm, we paſſed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly into a Goſpel way of Church-ſtate and Relation, and full Communion, founded on theſe two great Principles, owning, profeſſing, of Jeſus Chriſt, to be the one and the only Lord over our Conſciences, and Law-giver to our Souls; and of the holy Scriptures of Truth, being our one; and our only Rule of Faith, Worſhip, and Life. And thus my liberty in preaching of the Goſpel continued, for that very ſelf ſame juſt proportion of time, as my former confinements laſted, that is to ſay, full nine years, and ſome part of a tenth; and this in direct anſwer to,<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 15.</note> 
               <hi>That word ſeaſonably ſuiteably brought in upon the hearts of my ſelf, and of my yoak-fellow ſeveral years ſince, Make us glad according to the days, wherein thou haſt afflicted vs, and the years wherein we have ſeen evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About two years and a half ſince, my ſelf, and the friends in Goſpel-fellowſhip with me, were to ſeek of a convenient Meeting-place, for open worſhip, where all, whoſe hearts were made willing might have liberty to come to joyn with us in the ſpiritual, glorious, heavenly duties of the new Teſtament, Adminiſtration of Grace <hi>(for I was always for Chriſt's open houſe-keeping, ſince I hadinner aequaintance with him)</hi> There were three places, which particularly had in our eye, one at <hi>Great More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,</hi> a ſecond at <hi>Spittle-fields,</hi> a third at <hi>Pinners-hall:</hi> upon debate in Chriſtian friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and love, and not being all of one mind, concerning any one of theſe three

places, at laſt as ſoon as propoſed, we laid aſide all our own prudential determinings of<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40.</note> this matter † (Natural decencie and Goſpel-order, reſolving, and determining all our Caſes, and the prudence of believers, conſiſting in this to find out, know, chooſe and acquieſce, in the determination of the Alwiſe, Sovereign, Supreme will of our Lord according to his word, in the way of his providence;) and we, after we had ſought the Facès of <hi>Aelohim</hi> to chooſe for us, did refer and deliver the determining of it wholy unto him, accordingly the<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33.</note> lots were given forth, a ſeveral one for each of the three forementioned places, one for <hi>Great More-fields,</hi> where <hi>I</hi> then lived, a ſecond for <hi>Spittle-fields,</hi> whither a little after I removed; a third for <hi>Pinners-Hall,</hi> and a forth for elſewhere; we not being to limit the All-free Agent, the Faithful Creator, the Gracious Redeemer, the Providential Governour, to ſome one of theſe three, for, we knew not, till he gave forth the expreſs ſignification of his mind and will, whether any one of theſe three muſt be the place, or he would deſign us elſewhere: having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon one to draw the lot, we all looked up to the God of Heaven, expecting his Allotment; the lot opened ſpeak <hi>Pinners-Hall</hi> to be the place of our ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling for inſtituted worſhip. Upon this we rejoyced, and all our Spirits, as one united Spirit ran together with Chriſt's Spirit in our thoughts and meditations into that place, chooſing over Chriſts choice, ſweetly delighting, and contentfully acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcing, in that place, reſolving there to be whilſt we had an<note n="†" place="margin">

            <p>Having agreed with the owner, for the liberty of that place, we forthwith, on the next <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath,</hi> entered that place of Meeting, I was directed unto<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Zechar.</hi> 6. 9.—15.</note> that Scripture, which doth ſpeak of Chriſt's bearing the Glory, and wearing the Crowns, which were to be, for a Memorial, hung up in the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Accordingly we did, in our Spirits, ſet up, as it were, Spiritual Crowns for King Jeſus, with which to honour him, if he would be the Glory in the midſt of us, and Spirit and bleſs his Ordinances in the Miniſtery of them. This he has done, drawing many young men, and maidens, by the cords of his love, more eſpecially this laſt year. All the glory be to him, who has ſo powerfully, and freely, exalted himſelf, and advanced, his rich Mercy, his abounding Grace, &amp; his free Love, which has been gathering in ſome of his Sheep, and Lambs into his Flock, and brought ſo many of them into his Fold, which has ſo inraged the<note n="†" place="margin">

            <p>On the ſeventeenth day of the twelfth Moon, according to vulgar account, in the year 1682. Whilſt I was at our uſual hour of convening, openly at my Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial work in <hi>Pinners-Hall,</hi> Reading and Interpreting of<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 1.—6.</note> the Scripture, a Conſtable, with his Staff of Office, attended with ſeveral other under Officers, with their old ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Halberds, ruſhed in upon our Aſſembly, requiring, in the Kings Name, to give off and to come down, to which <hi>I</hi> anſwered, I was there in the diſcharge of my Office, in the Name of the King of Kings; he mentioned, that he had a Warrant from the Lord Major to diſturb our Meeting; I replyed I had a Warant from Chriſt, who was Lord Maximus to go on; and ſo keept on my work; he commanded one of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Officers to pul me down; I anſwered, out of that Scripture I was upon, that, Chriſt was travelling in the greatneſs of his ſtrength, he ſpeak, in righteouſneſs, who was mighty to ſave, that, the day of vengeance was in his heart; and the year of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones was come; and that he would pull down his Enemies, this was, whilſt the under Officer was pulling me behind, from the place where I was ſpeaking. This is, in ſhort, what paſſed there for the ſum of it, for I write in this and in what follows ſo far as <hi>I</hi> can well remember, though it may not be expreſſed in the very ſame words.</p>
            <p>From thence they guarded me, and about ſix more to the Lord Major's, Hall; who, when we were before him, demanded of the Conſtable, and other Officers for what cauſe, they had brought us before him? the Conſtable anſwered, they took us at a Meeting, and that <hi>I</hi> would not give off, when he commanded me ſo to do. The Lord Major applyed himſelf to me, ſaying that we, and ſuch as we, would bring in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; I replyed, that we, were more Chriſtians, and more againſt Popery, than thoſe whoſo wrongfully accuſed us: for we owned Chriſt for our one, and our only Lord over our Conſciences, and Law-giver to our Souls, and the Scriptures of Truth for our one &amp; our only Rule of Faith, Worſhip, &amp; Life; we declared againſt Popery, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God, againſt Chriſt, againſt Chriſtianity, againſt the Word of Chriſt,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54579:2"/>
againſt the the Laws of Chriſt, againſt Humanity. You ſpeak great words for your ſelves, ſaid the Major; Sir ſaid I, we are ready to proveall this, to any of your Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, or any other whatſoever, if we are called unto it: who ſhall be Judge ſaid the Major? <hi>I</hi> replyed, Sir, we will refer the determination of it to your own Conſcience, if you will give us a fair hearing. What calling or profeſſion are you of ſaid the Major? Sir, I am a Miniſter of Chriſt, and this alſo I am ready to prove, if any queſtion my call. Are you of any other profeſſion or calling? Anſwer, no Sir, nor never was. It's. under a pretence of ſuch private Conventicles, that all the Popiſh-Plots are hatch't and carried on. Anſwer, our Aſſemblings are in one of the moſt open, publick places in all <hi>London</hi> for ſuch Meetings: where both doors ſtand wide open for any to come, who will, and ſo it uſeth to be in my private dwelling. Do you keep <hi>Saturday Sabbath?</hi> Anſwer, I obſerve the ſeventh day as the weekly Sabbath day. Do you keep the <hi>Sunday,</hi> ſaid one who ſtood next to the Major? Anſwer. There is but one day in the week, that is the weekly Sabbath-day. You break the Kings Lavvs, ſaid the Major. Anſwer, we obſerve; keep, and obey the Scripture-Laws of King Jeſus, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: upon this I was bid to ſtand, or ſit by.</p>
            <p>Afterwards they examined four who are in Church-Fellowſhip with me; the Major inquireing what their callings were, and where they lived, which the Clark wrote down: and uſually the burden of the Song was, <hi>Have you been at</hi> St. <hi>Omars,</hi> as if we all had been Jeſuitically educated, and principled, whereby to inſinuate, as if vve vvere bringers in of Popery, the quite contrary, vvhereunto is the Truth: Tvvo others alſo were examined upon the ſame Interrogatorys but well agreeing in the ſame Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the main with us: one whereof affirmed, that he thought, there was ſcarce any one Congregation in all <hi>London,</hi> that brought in a fuller Teſtimony againſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than our Congregation did.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Friends were bid to depart; when ſeveral of them, I think it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported were Fined Ten Pounds a Man: <hi>I</hi> ſtay'd behind, but a little after, I vvas told I might be gone: ſo <hi>I</hi> returned to my dvvelling.</p>
            <p>In the after noon I came to <hi>Pinners Hall</hi> again, at the wonted Seaſon, we having a Key unlocked the door, and ſome few of us went in; The Conſtable and under Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers being very near, quickly haſted, and ſhut the doors upon the reſt, and required us to be gone, as before: we kept our places, and had oppertunity to ſpeak to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the Officers, who all declared their unwillingneſs to meddle in ſuch work: one of our Friends demanded of the Conſtable a warrant; he ſaid he would go or ſend to the Major; we waited, but, no freſh warrant that we ſaw came from the Major, then the Conſtable commanded an under Officer to pull me from the place where I was: who at laſt, trembingly and palefac'dly laid his hand upon me; thus they led us out: when we came out multitudes were in the ſtreets. I returned with the reſt and a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie to my houſe, where <hi>I</hi> read and expounded the word I preached, prayed, hymned &amp; performed my office to the Satiſfaction and profit of many hearers; which laſted untill about that Hour, which they commonly call four of the Clock, and ſo the Companie peaceably withdrew.</p>
            <p>Upon the next <hi>Seventh-day-ſabbath</hi> the Twenty and fourth day of the ſame foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned month, I went at the accuſtomed time unto one of the doors of <hi>Pinners Hall</hi> which being ſhut or locked faſt, I went about to the other door, where, having knocked, the door was opened, &amp; thoſe who were preſent went in; Another Conſtable, with ſome under officers quickly ruſhed in at our aſſembly; whilſt I was in Prayer, the Conftable commanded us to depart; <hi>I</hi> kept on praying as I was ſupplyed &amp; aſſiſted ſuiteably; till an under officer pulled me away, towards the ſhutting up of my requeſts.</p>
            <p>So they carryed me out of that place towards the Lord Majors. As I was guarded along by the Officers, I carried my Bible openly in my Hand through the ſtreets, declaring practically, as well as verbally, that the taking away of my liberty was for the cauſe and ſake of Chriſt, &amp; of the word of Chriſt. Thus I marched a long; the Major, when we came to his Hall, was gone, as we were told, to the Seſſons; The Conſtable paſſed by ſome other Juſtices and Aldermen, but would not carry me before them, but made me go in and out here and there towards the Seſſions; as I paſſed a long I vvas made a <hi>Gazing-ſtock,</hi> variouſly reported, ſome againſt me, others for me, one calling me a Chriſtian Jevv, others ſaying, <hi>I</hi> vvent along vvith my Bible, as one of the old Martyrs: thus through good report, and evil report, I trudged along (as they ſaid of my Lord and Maſter; ſome he is a good man, others, hay, but he decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the people.) great flockings after us there vvere to publiſh the Teſtimony the

more the Lord preaching to the Conſciences of thouſands; the boys in the ſtreet at laſt pointed at one of the under officers and cryed out, an informer, an informer, pelting of him with dirt &amp; ſtones; who had he not ſhelterd himſelf near me he bad been in great danger: at laſt they brought me to the Seſſions houſe where I was led to a private Room. After a while, <hi>I</hi> was called up to an higher Room, where were Three Magiſtrates, the door keeper ſaying, that none elſe ſhould get in but my ſelf. I declared in hearing of the Magiſtrates that Courts of Juſtice ought to be open, that I might have witneſs of what paſſed at examination, for I knew not what ſome might ſwear falſely againſt me, but ſome friends got in; one of the Magiſtrates asked the Conſtable, for what cauſe he had brought me there; while he anſwered, I apprehended him at <hi>Pinners Hall</hi> &amp; he would not come down, till an officer pulled him down. I anſwered I was here for doing work for my Lord Chriſt, for preaching, praying; as I was going on, one of the Magiſtrates cut me off ſhort, your praying is prating: I replyed Sir, take heed how you reporach that great ordinance of Praying; the God I pray unto is a God hearing prayer, he has heard my prayers, &amp; will; &amp; as he has done it ſo he can anſwer it terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a gainſt thoſe who ſpeake ſo reproachfully againſt ſuch prayer: another of the rulers ſpake ſomewhat againſt diſſenters, I anſwered, whilſt there was a Chriſt, in Heaven &amp; a bible on earth, there would be diſſenters from them and from their ways; if ſo, ſaid he, yet I hope, we ſhall not be ſo troubled with diſſenters as we have been; but this being a cauſe depending upon the Law we will confer with the Recorder about it, &amp; ſo they withdrew.</p>
            <p>After a while <hi>I</hi> was brought into the court of open ſeſſions at the old Bailey, where being charged with breaking the Kings Laws, and as if I would introduce poperie &amp; might have been at Saint <hi>Omars;</hi> I held forth my Bible, declaring aloud for my Lord Chriſt, and for his word, and Lawes, and that, it was a maxim in their own Law, that, the Law of God was the Law of the land; and if ſo, I was ready to plead this cauſe; thus, as I could he heard, the Lord ſpirited me to<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 1. &amp;c.</note> be finiſhing my teſtimonie for Chriſt; who as I told them was judge at the ſeſſions; I was more than once told, they would not hear me preach; I declared againſt popery, agen and agen, as I could be ſuffered. Upon this the Recorder called upon me then to take the oathe's: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unknown to me before, Sir ſaid I, I ſuppoſe by your gown, that you profeſs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in your Law; and by that Law you ought not to put me to oaths; for my libertie is taken from me upon another cauſe, and that muſt be firſt iſſued; ſo that, then, when an end is put to that I may be at leaſure to conſider what anſwer to return.  It was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked whether, ever I had been at the Univerſities, and at what Univerſity, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had taken any degree; I anſwered, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where I had taken two degrees; by that the Recorder knew, that ſo many years <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16.</note> An Oath was for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation an end of all ſtrife; which this, neither had not would be: ſtill he required the taking of the Oaths: I anſwered, I had given him a Scripture anſwer, going it over a ſecond time. Read, the Oaths to him ſaid the Recorder or ſome other upon the Bench: as they were reading, one commanded me to pull off my Gloves, another to lay my hand upon their Book; I having no Scripture Warrant and Law for either, kept on my Gloves, and did not put my hand upon their Book. I over-heard one of them ſay; his hand is already upon his own Bible, read on.  Hereupon I laid down my Bible as one was a reading; they intending hereby as I gathered, that ſo holding up my Bible as I did, one or other would have clapped my Bible to my mouth, and ſo have interpreted it, as my taking the Oaths: but the Lord gave me to ſee the ſnare was laid for me: upon this they concluded me reſolute, and ſaid take him Jailor, or away with him, whereupon one of the Keepers of the Jayl led me to <hi>Newgate</hi>-Priſon, where my Lord is with me to the ſweet feeding and full ſatisfaction of my whole man, greatly rejoycing, overcomingly-Triumphing, Abaſing of ſelf, and Advancing of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah Elohim,</hi> in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30.</note> Thoſe who honour me, they are the words of my Lord, I will honour, and thoſe who deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
