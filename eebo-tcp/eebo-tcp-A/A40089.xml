            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE desire of many Worthy Gentlemen, who were pleased to think this Sermon seasonable, could not have prevailed with me to make it thus publick, were it not for the Entertainment it hath met with from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of Auditors, who have represented it as Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and almost all that's naught.</p>
            <p>But, as I have not (I thank God) so little of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in me, as to return Cursing for Cursing, or Reviling for Reviling; but, on the contrary, do most heartily pray for these men, who express the greatest enmity against me: so will I no longer trouble the Reader with complaints of their most injurious and provoking behaviour upon the account of the following Discourse, but only intreat him to be Impartial in the perusal of it; and <hi>then</hi> to judge between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>me,</hi> whether I have given them any other cause to be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, than what the blessed Apostle gave the <hi>Galatians,</hi> viz. <hi>Telling them the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I appeal to the most Censorious and Captious of those that heard me, whether I have been guilty of the <hi>least</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness in this Publication.</p>
            <p>God is my Witness, that I had the <hi>best</hi> of Designs in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Preaching this Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi> A sincere and earnest desire to do some service to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as by Law esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht: Nor am I conscious to my self of any crime in the
<pb facs="tcp:95579:3"/>
pursuing of <hi>this</hi> Design, unless honest impartiality in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Doings, which are apparently most highly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the interest of all <hi>these</hi> (than which nothing in this world should be dearer to us) ought to render me blame-worthy.</p>
            <p>But I am not in the least solicitous about what defects may be found in the Discourse, that are not of a <hi>moral</hi> nature; for, as the ingenuous will easily overlook them (especially in a Discourse not design'd for the Press) so 'twould be a great piece of weakness to be at all concerned at the Censures of those that lye at the catch, and who if they <hi>find</hi> no faults will be sure to <hi>make</hi> them.</p>
            <p>But the main thing I intended this <hi>Preface</hi> for is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, <hi>viz.</hi> A faithful Narrative of a matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> which hath had the ill fortune to be as falsly and injuriously repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as this <hi>Sermon.</hi> It is this, There lately stood in the West-window of the Quire of <hi>Gloucester</hi> Cathedral, a most scandalous Picture, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Blessed <hi>Trinity</hi>: Which, had it been much observed, could never have outstood the first year of the Reformation; and much less continued till about <hi>two</hi> years since. I was first shewed it by one of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prebendaries about <hi>four</hi> years since: After which time, the sight of it, when I read at the Communion Table, did often discompose me. And, thinking my self obliged to do my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to have it taken down, though no great notice, that I knew, was taken of it, I made no <hi>haste</hi> for <hi>that</hi> reason; but some time after my return from my Residence, I advised with one who is a most learned and eminent Prelate of our Church about it; and he, expressing high offence at it, told me we were all bound in Conscience not to suffer such a thing, now we had <hi>observed</hi> it, to stand longer. Hereupon I resolved to complain of it in <hi>Chapter</hi> at my <hi>next</hi> Residence, but there being not above <hi>two,</hi> or at the most <hi>three</hi> of us upon the
<pb facs="tcp:95579:3"/>
place all that time, I put off the doing it till my Residence the <hi>following</hi> year. And <hi>then,</hi> having a good opportunity (there being about the Conclusion of that Residence, our whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber except one, present) at a <hi>Chapter</hi> that was called about <hi>other</hi> business, the very last day of my stay (which was Mid-summer Eve <hi>1679.</hi>) having <hi>all</hi> of us viewed it before, I moved my Brethren in <hi>Chapter</hi> (the officers that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent being first desired to withdraw, because I would have the matter carried as privately as might be) that it might be taken down: Representing the hatefulness of such a Picture, and what scandal it would give, should it happen to become more publick (as it quickly might, it being known to more than <hi>our selves,</hi> and that not by <hi>my</hi> means) and the great <hi>seasonableness</hi> of doing it at <hi>this</hi> nick of time, seeing through oversight it had been omitted <hi>thus</hi> long: it being not long after the discovery of the Plot, and many Factious people <hi>then</hi> at work in vilifying the Church of <hi>England</hi> as advancing apace towards Popery. This motion of mine was readily entertained by the <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the Idol most chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully voted down, and the Act of <hi>Chapter</hi> afterwards Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Register Book by some of the Prebendaries, where it <hi>now</hi> stands. I moved, as I said, that it should be <hi>taken</hi> down, that is, by a <hi>Glasier</hi>; but for a great reason, which I think fit to conceal, till provoked to publish it, it was as readily consented to, that it should be immediately <hi>broken,</hi> as 'twas before, that it should be <hi>taken</hi> down, and new glass set up in the room of it. Whereupon the greater number of the <hi>Chapter</hi> went together to the place to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the action, and it was done by <hi>my</hi> hand. We could not in the least doubt, but that <hi>this</hi> was done very <hi>regularly,</hi> it being a hard case if the Governours of a Cathedral should not be invested with as much Authority as <hi>this</hi> comes to. But when it came to be known abroad, there was a hideous noise and clamour made by some few people; who are, I dare say,
<pb facs="tcp:95579:4"/>
the <hi>first</hi> Protestants that ever so concern'd themselves about such a vile Relique of Popish Superstition. The Clamour continues to this very day; and, after I had Preached <hi>this</hi> Sermon, complaint was made of the high misdemeanor to the <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>some,</hi> further to vent their spleen against me for my Sermon, did what lay in them to have it presented by the Grand Iury of the City, though a thing of above two years standing; Which doughty attempt (as well it might) made sport enough.</p>
            <p>But that which necessitates my publishing this Narrative, is the several shameful Vntruths they have made to pass for current, far and near, among those who have little knowledge of <hi>them</hi> and <hi>me</hi>; for those that know <hi>either</hi> of us cannot easily believe them. Particularly,</p>
            <p>First, they represent this Action, as done by me upon my <hi>own</hi> head. They say not one word of a <hi>Chapters</hi> being concerned in the case, and so expose me for a Rash and furious Zealot.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To lay still greater load upon me, they have given it out by <hi>themselves,</hi> and their Agents (particularly a <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.24, 25, 26. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.18.</note> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Agent they have in <hi>London,</hi> a most disingenuous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of whom I have deserved, as he can't forget, much better things) that it was only the Picture of a <hi>Saint</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> or at <hi>worst</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when the contrary was visible to us <hi>all,</hi> and to <hi>others</hi> also, as I have intimated already. It was the <hi>old</hi> Popish Picture of the <hi>Trinity</hi>; God the <hi>Father</hi> represented by <hi>an Old man with a very long Grey Beard, and a huge beam of Light about his head</hi>: God the <hi>Son,</hi> by <hi>a Crucifix between his knees</hi>: And God the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> by <hi>a Dove with spread wings, under his Beard</hi>: which was patcht with a piece or two (as I remember) of <hi>plain</hi> glass. I have the Copy of the Picture by me as it stood in the Window, drawn by one who lives in that City, that had (as he told me) viewed it at times for <hi>twenty</hi> years together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95579:4"/>Thirdly, They represent it as done in complyance with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Rebels, who, they say, were <hi>then</hi> in Arms. But as this is most <hi>false,</hi> (these wretches being routed before this time, and the news of it come to <hi>Gloucester</hi> in the Publick intelligence) so <hi>every</hi> body must needs see the woful silli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Ridiculousness, as well as Malice of this suggestion.</p>
            <p>There are some I confess, who are of better Tempers than the Furious people who have made such a loud clamour, that express their dislike of Breaking this Picture, which they call a great indecency. But I would fain know of <hi>them,</hi> why must it be done so <hi>decently</hi>? Is it because it was a gross abuse of the Holy Trinity? But if it was not an indecency to break in pieces the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> when it came to be abused, though of God's own institution, much less can it be so, to break <hi>that</hi> the making of which God hath <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.15, &amp;c.</note> forbidden in so strict a manner. But I have said already that it had been done after these mens <hi>decent</hi> fashion, that is, taken down by a <hi>Glasier,</hi> might I have had my will, and had there not been a great probability, if not certainty, of our making our Order to no purpose, if it were not done <hi>this</hi> way; as my Worthy Brethren will bear me witness: who are <hi>all</hi> liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and can testifie the truth of my Narrative of <hi>this</hi> so Scandalous a thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The Destroying of an Idol, that even Moderate <hi>Papists</hi> have condemned, and some of the better sort of <hi>Heathens</hi> also; that is, a Corporeal Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the Great God, and which one would wonder should have any Patrons, besides the monstrous Sect of <hi>Anthropomorphites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I perswaded my self with great difficulty, to publish this Account to the world, and could not resolve upon it till I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, how well it becomes me to disabuse abundance of people, who have been imposed upon by false stories, as well as to
<pb facs="tcp:95579:5"/>
vindicate my own Reputation. And besides, this I have now done, will not make the thing much more publick than it was before: no nor at <hi>all</hi> more publick than the late Doings at the <hi>Gloucester Assizes,</hi> will perhaps make it. I have only taken a course to make the <hi>truth</hi> about this matter as publick, as some men have made gross <hi>falsehoods.</hi> And indeed I am now sensible, I should have done this long ago, and that I have been much too patient.</p>
            <p>I am prepared to say much more of the Vnworthy Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have had from some upon <hi>this</hi> account, and of what Methods were used to raise clamour, but I have done enough at <hi>present</hi>; my Design being only to suppress lying Reports, and to disabuse (as I said) those who have received them, not the exposing of <hi>particular</hi> persons, which I am not like to do, till any of <hi>themselves</hi> shall make it necessary.</p>
            <p>I will Conclude with this Address to my Adversaries (in allusion to our Blessed Saviours reply to the Wretch that smote him) <hi>viz. If I have spoken,</hi> or done, <hi>evil,</hi> and transgrest the Law, <hi>bear witness of the evil,</hi> the Law is open: <hi>But if well why smite you</hi> after so unchristian a manner <hi>him</hi> with your Tongues, for want of sharper wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, who never had any quarrel or controversie with any of you, and who is resolved to requite your malice, with never ceasing to Pray for you?</p>

They made the Holy Jesus, <hi>who was manifested that he might destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> the great Patron of sin, and <hi>turned the grace of God into Lasciviousness</hi>; did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Grace <hi>in vain,</hi> and rendred it, as much as lay in them, ineffectual to the bettering mens lives and natures, but also made it the greatest Promoter and Encourager of <hi>that,</hi> for the utter destruction and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of which it was designed.</p>
            <p>This they did by corrupting the Christian Doctrine, and bringing into it a company of wicked and Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Principles, and by endeavouring to make that pass for the Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> which was no better than the Doctrine of <hi>Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>these</hi> Wretched People S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith that, <hi>They professed that they knew God, but in Works they denyed him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate, Tit.</hi> 1.16. And in diverse other places he discourseth of <hi>these</hi> men, calling them <hi>false Apostles, deceitful workers,</hi> and the like; and warns the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians he wrote to, to beware of them: As do <hi>other</hi> of the Apostles also, particularly S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> and S. <hi>Iude.</hi> Now would we know how it should come to pass, that the Christian Religion should be so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverted, and made use of for the <hi>building</hi> of that which it was designed to <hi>destroy.</hi> We are assured that it proceeds not from the Obscurity of the Writings of the New Testament; for <hi>they</hi> as plainly, as 'tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for words to do it, do every where condemn all Unrighteousness and Sin. But it was caused by <hi>Wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Scriptures and putting them upon the rack to force them to speak quite contrary to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us the Epistles of his Brother <hi>Paul</hi> were abused, that <hi>those that were unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable wrested them to their own destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95579:6"/>But how came it to pass that any should dare to make thus bold with the Scriptures? My Text An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers <hi>this</hi> question: The Apostle in these words tells us that, their <hi>making shipwrack of the Faith</hi> was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by their <hi>having first put away a good Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He here exhorts his Son <hi>Timothy</hi> to take care of holding both <hi>Faith</hi> and a <hi>good Conscience</hi>; and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive he useth to quicken his care is, that those who are not careful to <hi>hold</hi> both, will be in danger of <hi>losing</hi> both. So much is implyed in his saying, that <hi>some having put away a good Conscience have made shipwrack concerning Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holding Faith,</hi> or <hi>the</hi> Faith, <hi>and a good Conscience, which some having put away, concerning Faith,</hi> or <hi>the</hi> Faith, <hi>have made shipwrack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, We will explain the terms, or endeavour to shew what it is <hi>to hold the Faith,</hi> and what to <hi>make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack</hi> of it; as also what it is to <hi>hold a good Conscience,</hi> and what to put it away.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That <hi>holding the Faith</hi> will nothing avail us, except we also <hi>hold a good Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That <hi>mens making shipwrack concerning the Faith</hi> is occasioned by their having first <hi>put away a good Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, For Explication of the terms; we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</p>
            <p>1. What it is <hi>to hold the Faith,</hi> and what <hi>to make shipwrack of it. To hold the Faith</hi> is to adhere to the belief and profession of the Doctrine of the Gospel. <hi>Holding</hi> or <hi>keeping</hi> the Faith sometimes implyeth also a <hi>life</hi> answerable to the Christian doctrine; as where S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I have kept the Faith</hi>: And where the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95579:7"/>
Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> exhorts the Christians, <hi>to hold fast the profession of their Faith without wavering.</hi> But <hi>here</hi> it can signifie no more than the <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>profession</hi> of that Doctrine, because it is <hi>distinguished</hi> from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good <hi>Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, to <hi>make shipwrack</hi> of the Faith is to do either of these two things. Either, <hi>First,</hi> expresly to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Articles of the Christian Belief, the main fundamental Articles; all or <hi>any</hi> of those on which the whole Frame of Christianity is erected, and which are the Essential materials of it. As that <hi>Iesus is the Son of God</hi>: that <hi>he dyed for our sins, and rose again for our justification</hi>: that <hi>he ascended into Heaven, and will come again at the end of the world to judge the quick and the dead</hi>: that <hi>men shall be rewarded</hi> or punished accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their works: that <hi>Faith, Repentance and New Obedience are of absolute necessity to our obtaining the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Favour, and everlasting life.</hi> These and the like Articles which either are <hi>declared</hi> necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by our Saviour or his Apostles, or which from their own <hi>nature</hi> appear so to be, as containing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary motives, encouragements or helps to a holy life, these are such as the renouncing any of which is <hi>making shipwrack concerning the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the misunderstanding such Doctrines as have no such weight and stress laid upon them, or which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered <hi>in themselves</hi> appear to be of such a nature, as that the misunderstanding of them is consistent with true Goodness, cannot be called a making Shipwrack of the Faith: For if so, it will be impossible to know who <hi>holds</hi> the Faith, and who <hi>makes shipwrack</hi> of it: There being many points so disputably expressed in the Scriptures, and which there is such a diversity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about, even among Good as well as Learned
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95579:7"/>
men, that it may be an argument of too great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and presumption in any, to conclude perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that <hi>theirs</hi> is the true notion of them. Or, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The introducing such Principles and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the Christian Religion as do manifestly strike at any of its Fundamentals; and particularly such as directly, or in their evident consequences, enervate the Promises, Threatnings, or Precepts of the Gospel, and contradict the great design of Christianity, <hi>viz.</hi> that of making men Sober, Righteous and Godly, <hi>this</hi> may also very properly be called <hi>making shipwrack of the Faith.</hi> It is truly so notwithstanding it may be joyned with a profession of <hi>all</hi> the Articles of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: For who seeth not that those who corrupt it with such Doctrines or Practices, are as injurious to the Faith, as the down-right opposers of its main Principles; or rather the more injurious of the two, there being much more danger of a false Friend, than of a professed and open enemy.</p>
            <p>2. Would we know what it is to <hi>hold a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; this</hi> is, in short, sincerely to endeavour <hi>to walk in all the Commandments of the Lord blameless</hi>: To endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour impartially to acquaint our selves with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, and when we understand it, to comply therewith, although it be never so cross to <hi>our own</hi> wills and natural inclinations. And therefore, on the contrary, to <hi>put away</hi> a good Conscience is to be bent upon the pleasing our own wills, and gratifying our sensual Appetites: to give up our selves to be acted and governed by fleshly and impure Lusts: To be devoted to the Service of corrupt, carnal and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections and interests. Where the <hi>lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye,</hi> or <hi>the pride of life,</hi> the love of Pleasures, Riches or Honours, are predominant in the Soul, there a <hi>good Conscience is put away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95579:8"/>Secondly, We next come to shew that <hi>holding the Faith</hi> will nothing avail us, if withal it be not our care to hold a <hi>good Conscience.</hi> This is apparent in that the Renewing of mens natures, and Bettering their Lives is the only end both of Natural and Revealed Religion; and were not this the end thereof, Religion would be the vainest and most insignificant thing in the world. The Heathens themselves were well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of <hi>this,</hi> and therefore the professed intendment of <hi>their</hi> Philosophy was, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>The purgation and perfection of the humane life.</hi> They well knew that no body is the better for the <hi>best</hi> Principles, where they are only <hi>believed</hi> and not <hi>lived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the Principles of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, which the Ancients used to call the Christian <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> I shall not need to prove that our belief of <hi>these</hi> is required wholly upon the account of the great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy they have for the transforming of us into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine likeness, the subjecting our Wills to the Will of God, and the making us holy in all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. And therefore we find our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his Apostles making the whole of a Christian to consist in <hi>keeping his sayings,</hi> in <hi>doing the things he commands them,</hi> in <hi>Faith that worketh by love,</hi> and in <hi>the new Creature.</hi> And therefore we see the greatest contempt cast upon Knowledge and Profession and Faith, unaccompanied with an answerable life and practice. Therefore we read, that <hi>Faith without works is dead,</hi> that <hi>Faith is dead being alone,</hi> as being utterly unable to stand us in the least stead, and as being so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to save us, as greatly to aggravate our Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95579:8"/>The Papists lay mighty weight upon their Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, their believing as the Church believes, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselves with a fond conceit, that the <hi>goodness of their Faith</hi> will make great amends for the <hi>badness of their lives.</hi> But suppose it true, that <hi>they</hi> are <hi>the</hi> Orthodox believers, and all the Christian World He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks besides themselves, as <hi>they</hi> would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, yet the <hi>Devils</hi> are as Orthodox as <hi>they</hi> can be for their hearts, but their Orthodoxy makes them but the more miserable; if they did not believe so truly, they would not tremble as they do. <hi>The Devils also believe and tremble, Iames</hi> 2.19. In short, we are not more assured from the Holy Scriptures that <hi>God made the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> than we are of the truth of <hi>this</hi> Proposition, that the most sound belief will not do us the least service while it is accompanied with a naughty life: That the most Orthodox Sentiments will nothing avail us while joyned with an Heretical Conversation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We proceed to shew, that mens <hi>making shipwrack concerning the Faith,</hi> is occasioned by their having first <hi>put away a good Conscience. Which</hi> (good Conscience) <hi>some having put away, concerning Faith have made shipwrack.</hi> The Apostle, speaking of some that <hi>resisted the truth,</hi> calls them <hi>men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the Faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. Thereby intimating, that their being <hi>reprobate concerning the Faith,</hi> proceeded from the <hi>corruption of their minds,</hi> or naughtiness of their hearts, and the prevalence of evil and corrupt Affections. And the same Apostle, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain Hereticks, attributes their <hi>erring from the Faith</hi> to their gratifying particularly that last of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.10. <hi>The love of money is the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95579:9"/>
root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the Faith.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter,</hi> speaking of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Seducers, saith, that <hi>they had eyes full of Adultery, and hearts exercised with covetous practices</hi>: And inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth that <hi>this</hi> is the cause of their <hi>forsaking the right way,</hi> and <hi>their beguiling unstable Souls,</hi> 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
            <p>Now would we be satisfied <hi>how</hi> this <hi>putting away a good Conscience</hi> occasioneth mens <hi>making shipwrack of the Faith</hi>: It is evident that it doth thus these <hi>three</hi> ways.</p>
            <p>First, As mens addicting themselves to the satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some lust or other, puts them upon devising shifts and tricks to still the disquieting clamours of their Consciences. <hi>The wrath of God being revealed from Heaven against all unrighteousness and ungodliness of men,</hi> 'tis no easie thing for any one willingly to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress the Rules of Righteousness, without being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently tormented with fearful expectations, and the Horrors of an Accusing and condemning Conscience. Now the most effectual way to be rid of these (next to sincere Repentance and Reformation) is either for a wicked man to perswade himself, if he be able, that there is no God, or nothing after this Life; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that the Bible is a cheat, and all its threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings mere scare-crows. Or if <hi>this</hi> he cannot do, in regard of the abundant evidence of the Being of a God, and the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, the course must be so to wrest and pervert the Scriptures, as to make them give liberty to certain evil practices, or to promise forgiveness of sin to certain performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are short of forsaking it.</p>
            <p>Thus those Hereticks in the Primitive times wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d the places wherein the Gospel is called <hi>the Law of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95579:9"/>
Liberty,</hi> and wherein we are said to be delivered from the Law, so as to take off the Obligation of the Moral as well as the Ceremonial Law; and to give liberty to sin, and to oppose Faith to Obedience in the business of Justification and acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>Many other instances may be given both of Ancient and Modern Hereticks perverting of passages of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, so as to make them great encouragements to sin, and discouragements to a Holy life; perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole strain and tenor of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But I must not enlarge farther upon this Argument, because the main thing I intended in the choice of this Subject is yet behind.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>putting away of a good Conscience</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions <hi>making shipwrack of the Faith,</hi> through the <hi>just judgment of God.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> particular gave us an account of wicked mens being strongly <hi>enclined</hi> to make shiwrack of the Faith, and of their <hi>endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it, <hi>this</hi> of their putting their inclinations into <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> and <hi>succeeding</hi> in their endeavours.</p>
            <p>Men that are wedded to any lust are very forward, for their own ease, to endeavour either the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Atheistical Principles, or so to abuse the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures as to take encouragement from them to live in sin; but they could hardly so extinguish the light of their own minds, as to succeed in their endeavours, were it not for the judgment of God upon them, in giving them up into the Deceivers hands. To this purpose observe what the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved</hi> (or they did not so receive it as to suffer it to have any good effect upon their hearts and lives) <hi>for this cause God shall send them strong delusions</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95579:10"/>
(or give them up to be deluded by the tricks of the Devil, the signs and lying wonders before mentioned) <hi>that they should believe a lye,</hi> that <hi>they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>putting away of a good Conscience</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions <hi>making shipwrack of the Faith,</hi> as wicked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christianity do find it a most successful course to promote their corrupt and naughty designs, by <hi>foist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> into the Christian Religion such Doctrines and Practices, as favour and encourage such designs. I have shewed that those who corrupt the Christian Religion with such Doctrines or Practices as contradict the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it, do truly make shipwrack of the Faith; and whereas there may be given too many instances of such Hypocrites as have so done, I shall make it the whole business of what remains of the Doctrinal part of this Discourse, to shew that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as she is now Constituted, is most shamefully guilty in this particular.</p>
            <p>It is to be acknowledged, that she retains the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all the Fundamental and Essential Articles of the Christian Faith; a summary of which is that Creed which we call the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and she professeth a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the whole New Testament. If she in <hi>express</hi> terms rejected any Doctrine that is of the <hi>Essence,</hi> and a <hi>vital</hi> part of Christianity, her members may not be called <hi>Christians</hi> in any sense, and we <hi>then</hi> do very ill to say the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do not stick at calling them a <hi>Church,</hi> though a most corrupt and degenerate Church; as (to use the similitude of Bishop <hi>Hall</hi>) a <hi>thief</hi> is <hi>truly</hi> a man, though not a <hi>true</hi> man. A woman may retain the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95579:10"/>
name of a wife till she's formally divorced, though she be an adulteress.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may as truly be called a <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation the <hi>People of God,</hi> after their foul Revolt from him, and Lapse into Idolatry and other wicked and impious practices.</p>
            <p>But <hi>this</hi> hath been abundantly made good against this Church, that, though she holds the Foundation yet, she builds Wood, Hay and Stubble upon the Foundation: that is, she mixeth many impure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of her <hi>own,</hi> with the most holy and undefiled Doctrines of the Gospel. Of which I will present you with some instances, but must be very brief upon most of them.</p>
            <p>What say you, in the first place, to her Doctrine of <hi>Infallibility</hi>? Which speaks her uncapable of erring in any of her Decrees and Determinations: Which Infallibility the <hi>Iesuits</hi> will have seated in the <hi>Popes</hi> Chair; <hi>others</hi> in the Pope in conjunction with a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council; that is, a Number of Bishops and Priests packt together of his own Faction: For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>he</hi> hates more than a Council truly General.</p>
            <p>I call <hi>this</hi> not only a <hi>false</hi> but a <hi>wicked</hi> Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the infinite mischief that it doth in the world: For the <hi>Romish</hi> Church's pretence to Infallibility, is that which enables her to Lord it at that intolerable rate, over the minds and Consciences of her Subjects, and to make them the greatest of Slaves and Vassals. And 'tis <hi>this</hi> also that makes her utterly incurable of her gross corruptions, her other notorious Heresies, and the ungodly and horrid practices founded upon them. So that, so long as she continues to assume to herself the Title of <hi>Infallible,</hi> there is no hope to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of her being <hi>ever</hi> in the least Reformed, either in her Principles or Practices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95579:11"/>But never was a Doctrine more shamefully baffled than <hi>this</hi> hath been; as easily it may, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Interest to uphold it, nor one syllable in all the Bible to befriend it. As for <hi>that</hi> promise of our Saviour, that <hi>the gates of hell shall never prevail against his Church,</hi> the <hi>most</hi> that can be concluded from thence is, that he will ever have a Church upon earth in spight of all the endeavours of Hell to destroy it. But thanks be to God, this Promise would be no whit the further from being performed, although the Devil should be permitted totally to extinguish the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; though to be sure he understands his <hi>own</hi> interest bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than once to attempt it.</p>
            <p>But if the meaning of this Promise be (as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists would have it) that <hi>the gates of Hell shall never so prevail against the Church</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to occasion her falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to errors of <hi>Iudgment,</hi> why may we not as well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it so far as to secure her also from errors of <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice? these</hi> being no less dangerous or destructive than those of <hi>Iudgment.</hi> But I retain so much Charity for the <hi>Romish</hi> Church still, as not to think her so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of all Modesty, as to deny that in <hi>this</hi> sense, the Gates of Hell have prevailed against her with a vengeance.</p>
            <p>And as for the other Promises which they lay any stress on, they are either such as 'tis manifest the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles only, and first planters of the Gospel were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in, or else such as belong to all Christians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception <hi>thus</hi> far, as that while it is their sincere endeavour to know the truth, and to live up to their knowledge, they shall be secured from pernicious and damnable errors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95579:11"/>Again, What say you to the Doctrine of the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> over all other Churches and Kingdoms too, and his having a Grant of as vast Dominions upon Earth, next and immediately under Christ, as Christ himself hath under God the Father, his being King of all Kings, and Lord of all Lords, and that both in Spirituals and Temporals? I might easily tire you upon <hi>this</hi> head of Discourse, but all I will say to it shall be <hi>this,</hi> that the Charter pretended for so mighty an Empire is much too obscurely exprest to be ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, by any other people than the Pope and his Vassals. There is not a tittle in the Holy Scriptures for it, though we know what a noise and fluster they make with <hi>two</hi> Texts, <hi>Pasce Oves meas,</hi> and <hi>Dabo tibi Claves, &amp;c.</hi> as if this Supremacy were as plainly legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in each of them, as the Doctrine of the Creation in the first verse of <hi>Genesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, which is worst of all, how many thousands of honest people have been barbarously butcher'd, merely because their eyes would not serve them to read this Doctrine of theirs in those two Texts!</p>
            <p>And this is that Doctrine which gives them a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for their restless and unwearied endeavours to get these Kingdoms again within their Clutches, and for all their desperate and hellish designs against us.</p>
            <p>What say you to their Doctrine of <hi>Image-Worship</hi>? with which I will joyn that other of <hi>Praying to Saints and Angels.</hi> In their Adored Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it is decreed, that <hi>The Images of Christ, the Virgin mother of God, and other Saints, be especially kept in Churches; and that due Honor and Veneration be given unto them.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward this Council expresseth its allowance of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95579:12"/>
Picturing the Divinity it self; and accordingly Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the Blessed Trinity, (Oh hateful sight!) are ordinarily to be beheld in the Popish Churches.</p>
            <p>Now would we know what the Council means by <hi>Debitus honor &amp; veneratio, the due honour and veneration that is to be given to Images</hi>; this appears by these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>We decree doing honour to them, because the honour which is done to them, is referred to the Prototypes which they represent. So that in the Images which we kiss, and before which we uncover our heads, and fall down, we adore Christ, and Worship the Saints which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, &amp;c.</hi> So that the Honour and Veneration which they determine should be given to Images, do imply all <hi>external</hi> Acts of Adoration; and that the Image of our Saviour is to have the self same Adoration paid to it, that would be due unto himself were he perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally present.</p>
            <p>And the Universal <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church (wholly to pass over the Vile stuff of their <hi>Doctors, Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Casuists</hi>) will tell you the meaning of their <hi>debitus honor &amp; veneratio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The consent of Nations</hi> (saith the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi>) <hi>have made Sacrifices, Oblations and Incense, proper signs of Divine Worship</hi>; but, though I had time, I need not stand to shew, that the Images of Christ, Angels and Saints, especially that of the Blessed Virgin, are every where Worshipped with these signs, and with all the Rites of the most solemn Invocation in Sacred Offices, and in places set apart for Divine Worship. And they do all the external honour to the Saints and Angels in the Addresses they make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, whether immediately or as represented by Images, that 'tis imaginable they should do to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himself, or the Blessed Trinity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:95579:12"/>Nay, They pray unto them, not only for Temporal or Ordinary Blessings, but for Spiritual and Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: such as the Pardon of their sins, and the Holy Spirit, and eternal life, as might be shewn at large.</p>
            <p>Now what is Idolatry, if such doings are not? why, they tell us, and we cannot blame them, that the true Notion of Idolatry is only the Worshipping some Creature for the most High God, supposing it <hi>to be the</hi> most High God. But if so, the Worshippers of the Golden Calf, to be sure, were no Idolaters; for <hi>they</hi> can be little better than mad themselves, who are able to imagine that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were so mad, as to believe that the Calf which they saw made, and that of their own <hi>Ear-rings</hi> too, was that very God which brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But the Gentlemen of <hi>Rome</hi> would have us think that they were so forsaken of their Intellectuals, as <hi>so</hi> to believe; and we cannot blame them for <hi>that</hi> neither. For if they did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently bear us down, that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that this Moulten Calf was that God that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Sea, wrought so many Miracles for them, and the maker of Heaven and Earth, they would, they are sensible, be necessitated to excuse them from Idolatry, expresly contrary to the words of Scripture. And if this their Notion of Idolatry be the only true one, we are certain that it will be extremely difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, to find out Idolaters among the very <hi>Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What think you of their Doctrine of <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> of which take this account from the Council of <hi>Trent. By the Consecration the whole substance of the Bread is changed into the substance of the Body of Christ our Lord, and the whole substance of the Wine, into the substance of the bloud of Christ.</hi> So that as <hi>like</hi> as it still
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95579:13"/>
looks to Bread and Wine: Though it hath the perfect Tast, the perfect Feeling and Smell of Bread and Wine, yet it is nothing less; 'tis that very Body that hung upon the Cross at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that very bloud that was there shed.</p>
            <p>This is the most prodigiously contradictious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that I will not say the <hi>Wit</hi> but the <hi>Madness</hi> of men can possibly invent: 'tis a most wonderful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of most horrid contradictions, and absolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities. But this is not the <hi>worst</hi> of it, it is also the foundation of so gross and foul Idolatry as is scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be named among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or to be found paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd in <hi>Peruvia</hi> it self, or the most barbarous parts of <hi>India.</hi> The forementioned Holy Council declares, <hi>nullus itaque dubitandi locus relinquitur, &amp;c. There is therefore no place left for doubt, but that all good Christians do give the Worship of Latria,</hi> quae Vero Deo debetur, <hi>which is due to the true God, to this most Holy Sacrament; according to the always received custom of the Catholick Church.</hi> They should have said, according to the <hi>late</hi> and <hi>upstart</hi> custom of the <hi>Romish</hi> Faction. Here you see that the Bread and Wine are Worshipped by them, not as Representations of God, but as God himself.</p>
            <p>But what if those words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> should prove to be a Figure? like those other of his, <hi>I am a Vine, I am a Door, &amp;c.</hi> or what if <hi>This is my body</hi> should be as much a Figure, as they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the words presently following are, <hi>viz. This Cup is the New Testament in my Bloud</hi>? Where we have a <hi>double</hi> Figure, both the <hi>Cup</hi> put for the <hi>Wine</hi> in it, and the <hi>Wine</hi> said to be the <hi>New Testament</hi> or Covenant, when, supposing it were the <hi>very</hi> Bloud of Christ, it could not be the New Covenant it self, but the <hi>Seal</hi> of that Covenant; I say, what if these words be to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95579:13"/>
understood <hi>figuratively</hi>? (as why they should not the Papists can shew nothing like a reason, but <hi>we</hi> have shewn <hi>them</hi> the greatest absurdities imaginable in other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise understanding them) why <hi>then</hi> they themselves <hi>will</hi> and <hi>do</hi> acknowledge that they should be guilty of the most gross Idolatry in their Worship of the Host.</p>
            <p>What say you to the Popish Doctrine of the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Mass,</hi> which is of near kin to the foregoing? The Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is, as you shall find it in the Council of <hi>Trent, That in this Sacrifice which is performed in the Mass, that very Christ is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in a bloudless manner offered, which, upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of the Cross, did once offer up himself in a bloudy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> So that, according to <hi>this</hi> Doctrine, our Blessed Saviour must still to the end of the world be laid hold of by Sinners, be ground with their teeth, and sent down into their impure paunches, as often as the Priest shall pronounce the charm, <hi>hoc est enim corpus meum.</hi> And it seems that he was a false Prophet, when he said upon the Cross <hi>it is finished,</hi> seeing there was such an infinite deal of loathsome Drudgery still to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Dr.</hi> More'<hi>s Mystery of iniquity, Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</note> And it seems the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> is found to be a false Apostle, in asserting so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, as more than once he doth, that such is the Dignity of Christ's Priesthood, and its excellency above the <hi>Levitical,</hi> that by <hi>one</hi> offering he hath made perfect satisfaction, and expiation for sin.</p>
            <p>So that this <hi>their</hi> Doctrine of the <hi>Sacrifice of the Mass,</hi> is not only False, but very Corrupt and impious Doctrine.</p>
            <p>What say you to their Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi>? which, in short, is <hi>this</hi>: That <hi>no souls, except such as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95579:14"/>
purified in this life</hi> (which they'l surely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are extremely few) <hi>shall go at their departure hence into a place of happiness or ease, but all, the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned excepted, into a place of torment; where they may abide for an exceeding long time, even many hundreds of years, except some effectual care be taken for their deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>this</hi> Doctrine the poor people are brought into a most slavish state; by the means hereof their merciless Tyrants the Priests hale them into worse than <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Bondage: who, instead of enjoyning them the most reasonable duties to which the Precepts of their Saviour oblige them, and which are most admirably adapted to the cleansing of their natures, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their corrupt affections, impose upon them a great number of ridiculous Services of their <hi>own</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
            <p>But though they cannot pretend the least warrant from Scripture for <hi>such</hi> doings as <hi>those,</hi> yet they have a most <hi>express</hi> Text, they tell you, for their Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory, viz.</hi> those words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.15. <hi>But he shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</hi> But he who considers these <hi>two</hi> things will see nothing like <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Text, namely, First, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not he shall be saved <hi>by fire,</hi> but <hi>as it were</hi> by fire, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>through</hi> fire. Secondly, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to be saved as through fire,</hi> is a Proverbial Speech (as those great Criticks, <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> with others, have shewed) signifying <hi>to be saved from most eminent danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this Doctrine of theirs is <hi>groundless,</hi> so is it as <hi>wicked,</hi> it being a most vile affront to the Merits and and Satisfaction of our Blessed Saviour: For in order to the establishing of this Doctrine they teach, that, <hi>The Passion of Christ takes away only the guilt of Mortal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95579:14"/>
sins, not their eternal Punishment,</hi> which is as <hi>non-sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> as false and impious.</p>
            <p>'Tis an impious Doctrine also, both as it is devised to inslave the Consciences of the Poor People, and to bring them into absolute subjection to their Priests; and likewise to gratifie their greedy Appetites, and to bring their <hi>Purses</hi> no less under their power than their <hi>Consciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What say you to their Doctrine of the <hi>Non-necessity of the Laity's partaking of the Cup in the Lords Supper, and their being Rob'd accordingly of their share therein</hi>? expresly contrary to our Saviours institution, and the Practice of the first Ages of the Church, and of all other Churches in the world.</p>
            <p>What say you to their well known Doctrine, <hi>Of the Non-necessity of Repentance before the imminent point of death</hi>? And to this <hi>other</hi> that goes beyond <hi>that, viz.</hi> that <hi>meer Attrition</hi> (or sorrow for sin for fear of hell) <hi>if accompanied with the Sacrament of Penance is sufficient to a sinners justification and acceptance with God</hi>? This the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth plainly take for granted, in the <hi>fourth</hi> Chapter of their <hi>fourteenth</hi> Session.</p>
            <p>What say you to the Doctrine of <hi>Opus operatum</hi>? which makes the meer work <hi>done</hi> in all acts of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sufficient to the Divine Acceptance: particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the bare <hi>saying</hi> of Prayers, without either <hi>mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> what they say, or <hi>understanding</hi> it. And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hereunto the <hi>Romish</hi> Church enjoyns the saying of them in a Language unknown to the generality of her children; notwithstanding the perfectly contrary Doctrine delivered by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 14<hi>th</hi> Chap. of the <hi>first</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:95579:15"/>What say you to the Doctrine of <hi>the Insufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for mens Salvation,</hi> and her denying them to be a complete Rule of Faith, and Practice in things necessary, without her Traditions? Wherein she gives the Lye to the same great Apostle, who tells his son <hi>Timothy</hi> that, <hi>the Scriptures are able to make wise to Salvation:</hi> and that by <hi>them</hi> the man of God may be <hi>perfected, and throughly furnished to every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What say you to her Doctrine of the <hi>Gospels obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty even in things of absolute necessity to be believed and practised</hi>? devised on purpose to perswade the people to an implicit belief in <hi>her self,</hi> and to receive without examining whatsoever doctrines she shall please to call Articles of Faith.</p>
            <p>This is a wicked Doctrine in <hi>it self</hi> also, as well as upon the account of the <hi>Design</hi> of it: It being most unworthy of God to require all under pain of damnation, rightly to understand those Points which are obscurely revealed.</p>
            <p>What say you to her Doctrine of the <hi>dangerousness of the vulgars reading the Holy Scriptures</hi>; and her Practice answerable thereunto, of denying them the Bible in their own language?</p>

            <p>To mind you of a few famous instances: in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> and <hi>Waldenses,</hi>

                  <hi>The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Mr.</hi> Joseph Mede <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it as his Opinion, that the Papal Persecution doth equalize, if not exceed, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of men made upon the Church by the Ten famous Persecutions under the Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.

            <p>So that we need no further proof that the Woman hath <hi>Rome Christian</hi> for her principal Seat, upon whose head S. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, was a name written, <hi>Mystery Babylon the great, the mother of Harlots and Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth</hi>: and whom he saw <hi>drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Iesus.</hi> But we have <hi>farther</hi> proof that the now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned wicked doctrine, may truly be charged upon the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: For her abominable <hi>Practices</hi> do not only justifie this charge, but several of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of her darling sons, those pretious youths the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and which (as <hi>they</hi> tell you) are much elder than <hi>their</hi> order, <hi>viz.

               <hi>That</hi> of the Popes power of Dispensing with the most Solemn Oaths, and of Absolving Subjects from their Allegiance to Heretical Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> of the Lawfulness, nay Meritoriousness of taking Arms against them, of Stabbing and Poisoning them. And we of this Kingdom too well know that the <hi>Romish</hi> Church make no bones of practising upon these Principles.</p>
            <p>I might still farther proceed in instancing in her most corrupt and wicked Principles, but you have had enough in all Conscience: And but that, <hi>now</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, we are obliged to take all opportunities for the exposing of the vileness of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, I would e'en be as soon engag'd in stirring Jakes's, and raking dunghills, as in such work as <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:95579:16"/>God be thanked for that mighty Spirit that hath been stirred up throughout the Nation against <hi>Popery</hi>: Oh that it more generally proceeded from our sense of the hatefulness thereof, and the extreme dishonour it brings to Christianity, and its infinite injuriousness to the Souls of men, as well as from the concern we have for our <hi>Temporal</hi> interest; which is but a mean and pitiful consideration in comparison of <hi>those</hi> other. And the better the Principles of <hi>Popery</hi> and the Practices of the <hi>Papists</hi> are understood, the greater and more last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must <hi>their</hi> zeal against them needs be, who have any hearty kindness either for Christianity or for Natural Religion; either for Christianity or for good Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and common honesty, or even mere good nature.</p>
            <p>I will not so far imitate the horrible uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, as to say that 'tis impossible to find any sincere Christians in her Communion; and much less, that no honest or good natur'd people are among them: But <hi>this</hi> we are very certain may safely be said that, whosoever is throughly instructed in the Popish Principles and acts accordingly, is so much a stranger to <hi>Christianity,</hi> that he hath totally cast off all <hi>Humanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whosoever is a <hi>thorough</hi> Papist hath no Conscience in his own keeping; his Conscience is perfectly at the dispose of his Holy Father and his Confessor: Nor is there any villany, be it never so great, but he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, whensoever a Priest or Jesuit by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the Pope shall oblige him to it.</p>
            <p>That Protestant doth but slightly understand Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who dares trust his throat with a thorough Papist, although he be seemingly a man of never so good a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95579:17"/>
nature, or of never so good Morals: and the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious he is in his way, by so much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a person is he. That's a rare Religion in the mean time, the more true to which any man is, the greater Villain he must necessarily be. And those are a precious sort of Christians, of which one cannot adventure to give a true and impartial Character, and to paint them in their own colours, but he must be in danger to be Censured as a scurrilous person, as a man of a foul mouth, and a down-right Railer.</p>
            <p>Let us all therefore take up those words of <hi>Iacob,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Generation, which he uttered concerning his two wicked sons, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi, O my soul come not thou into their secret, unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make some Application of what hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed.</p>
            <p>First, Is the <hi>putting away a good Conscience</hi> the true cause to which <hi>making shipwrack of the Faith</hi> is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted? Is <hi>this</hi> the account into which it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved? Then, as we would be out of danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Heresie, and <hi>particularly</hi> of turning <hi>Papists,</hi> and of making shipwrack of the Faith as <hi>they</hi> have done, let us have a great care to hold fast a good Conscience: <hi>To exercise our selves in keeping Consciences void of offence both towards God and towards men:</hi> To lead lives answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the holy Doctrine which we profess to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any man will do the will of God</hi> (or be sincerely <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to do it) <hi>he shall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God,</hi> saith our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.17. He shall be able to discern between truth and falshood, and shall be guided into and kept in the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95579:17"/>The truth hath no fast hold of any, but those who <hi>receive it in the love of it,</hi> and make it the measure and rule of their lives and actions.</p>
            <p>It is not at all strange that Learned and Knowing men should make shipwrack of the Faith, for Learning and Knowledge is no security while separated from Honesty and a Good Conscience. There is no error so absurd or dangerous, but we ought to expect an insincere person will embrace it, when once it becomes service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Interest he is most concerned for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of.</p>
            <p>Even those of us who do now shew the most <hi>forward</hi> zeal against <hi>Popery,</hi> if we be wedded to any corrupt Affection, and have only the <hi>Form,</hi> but are void of the <hi>Power</hi> of Godliness, will be in never the less danger, notwithstanding our present zeal, of Apostatizing, if ever it should become our <hi>temporal</hi> interest (which God forbid) to turn Papists.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is it so apparent that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made so woful a shipwrack of the Faith? Then what an infinite obligation lyeth upon us to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Thankfulness to our good God, for rescuing these Nations from under her yoke; and for those Miracles of mercy which he hath wrought for us, in blasting so many of their deep laid designs, their late great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, and late Sham-plots, for the reducing of us to our old Captivity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may</hi> England <hi>say, if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when</hi> these <hi>men rose up against us; then they had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: then the waters had overwhelmed us, and the streams had gone over our soul.</hi> Let us therefore <hi>Bless the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey unto their teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:95579:18"/>Lastly, As we would still be secured from Popish Conspiracies, from the unwearied attempts of our old Adversaries against us, take we great heed of provoking the Almighty to withdraw at length his Protection, and abandon us to their Malice, by walking unworthy of that glorious Light and Liberty we now enjoy in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>while we have the light let us walk in the light,</hi> lest God, in his just judgment, suffer us to be again involved in <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkness.</p>
            <p>Oh happy Children of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if we could be perswaded to prize our present Vast Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, before our having <hi>lost</hi> them doth force us to set a high value on them.</p>
            <p>And, Oh that we were capable of so much Wisdom, as no longer to strengthen the hands of our common enemy, by our as unreasonable as Unchristian Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities against one another. That we had once as great a zeal against the Anti-christs within our own breasts, Pride, Anger, Malice and Bitterness, as we seem to have against the Anti-Christ in the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair: <hi>Those</hi> Anti-christs being the greatest friends <hi>this</hi> Anti-christ hath, and more our enemies than he is capable of being.</p>
            <p>Oh that at length we could be convinced of <hi>this</hi> great truth, that the Christian Religion consisteth not <hi>in meats or drinks,</hi> mere external things, but in <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> In Humility, Meekness, Self-denial, Obedience to Authority in all lawful things, love to God, and love to men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh that we had a vigorous powerful sense of <hi>this,</hi> that neither the most admired Gifts nor appearances of Grace, which are not joyned with a Benign and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95579:18"/>
temper, can at all recommend us to the Divine favour: That he hath no Participation of the God-like Life and Nature, who is of a Quarrelsome, Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Uncharitable Spirit, be he in a many <hi>other</hi> respects never so Saint-like. And that Christian love is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times better argument of a renewed state, than most of those marks and characters which are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given of a godly man.</p>
            <p>If we were once brought to this happy pass, to have a lively sense of <hi>these</hi> things: to make great Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>of preserving the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</hi>; and to abandon all Separating, Dividing, Sowre and ill-natur'd Principles and Practices, we shall not <hi>then</hi> need to fear the malice of the <hi>Papists,</hi> were their <hi>power</hi> greater than, God be thanked, it is; but <hi>till</hi> then, all our other endeavours to secure our selves may fail of success.</p>
            <p>But alas, I fear, that never had a People sadder <hi>Omens</hi> of miserable days than <hi>we</hi> now have: And nothing bodes worse than <hi>this</hi> that, we are so far from Uniting among our selves, notwithstanding we seem so sensible of extraordinary danger from our common Enemy, that our breaches daily grow wider and wider.</p>
            <p>We seem no less infatuated, no less madly bent upon our own destruction, than were the miserable <hi>Iews</hi> in the Siege of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; among whom there were never such desperate Feuds, as when they were all surrounded with the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies.</p>
            <p>Those who, by their causeless forsaking of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, have greatly strengthned the hands of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are so far from being yet made sensible of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of Separation, and the most pernicious consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95579:19"/>
of Dividing, that many of them are <hi>now</hi> grown fiercer than ever (as appears by their late Books and Pamphlets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) against that Church, which <hi>Rome</hi> hath always found to her cost, the most impregnable Bulwark in all Christendom against Popery.</p>
            <p>And on the <hi>other</hi> hand (for I will not be taxed with Partiality) there are too too many among <hi>our selves,</hi> that do <hi>little</hi> consult our Churches interest, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the interest of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>disserve</hi> both, by their intemperate heats, and branding <hi>all</hi> with the names of Fanaticks and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians who are not come up to <hi>their</hi> pitch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in all things just of their complexion; although they be as obedient to both their Civil and Ecclesiastical Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors as themselves, are no less truly Regular and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable.</p>
            <p>We ought by Love and Sweetness to encourage men all we can, <hi>this</hi> is to act like the Disciples of the mild and most lovely temper'd Jesus; and not by Sowreness and Censoriousness tempt those to depart from us, who would gladly still hold Communion with us <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>We think it high time to shew our dislike of those against whom we have been ever enough offended, though we could not in this manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, who under pretence of Affection to Vs and Our Service, assume to themselves the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Reviling, Threatning and Reproaching others; and as much as in</hi> them <hi>lies, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to stifle and divert their good inclinations to Our Service; and so to prevent that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and Vnion of Hearts and Affections, which can only, with Gods Blessing, make Vs rejoyce in each other, and keep our Enemies from rejoycing.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> II. in His Proclamation against Vicious and Debauched people.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tis evident I meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by this passage but that we ought to imitate the Fathers behaviour in the Parable towards his Prodigal Son.</hi>
               </note>And where we find an inclination towards <hi>returning</hi> in any that have <hi>departed</hi> from us, we should be glad to meet them half-way in order to the bringing them over to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95579:19"/>And it becomes us likewise to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Peaceable and Modest Dissenters from us, and those who are Turbulent, Seditious and Factious, and not wind up all together in the same bottom.</p>
            <p>I may add also, that there are, God knows, too too many <hi>Debauchees</hi> in the Nation, who would be thought great Champions for the King and the Church, but do infinite prejudice to both, by the mad and frantick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of their zeal. Who do mighty honour to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism by charging all with it, that run not with <hi>them</hi> to the same excess of Riot.</p>
            <p>One would suspect that <hi>these,</hi> whatsoever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, do really design nothing more, than to make both the King and the Church as friendless as they are able.</p>
            <p>Heaven help them both, should they ever be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, (which God forbid) as to stand in need of <hi>this</hi> sort of people.</p>
            <p>If indeed Huffing and Healthing, Cursing and Damning, and giving vile names would do the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>then</hi> let <hi>them</hi> alone to protect and defend the King and Church: but former experience hath assured us, that <hi>those</hi> are the best weapons that most of them can boast of their being good at.</p>
            <p>A Neighbouring King, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may wish God's blessing on the hearts of these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: but our own King (whom God preserve) and the Church of <hi>England</hi> have little reason to Con them thanks,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>There are likewise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other sort of men, of whom we have heard much, and are sufficiently ashamed, who spend their time in Taverns, Tipling-houses, and Debauches, giving no other Evidence of their Affection to us, but in Drinking, our Health, and inveiging against all others, who are not of their own dissolute temper; and who in truth, have more discredited our cause, by the licence of their manners and lives, than they could ever advance it by their Affection or Courage, &amp;c.</hi> In the same Proclamation.</note> for any service they are like to do <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:95579:20"/>King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi> of Glorious Memory was very sensible of the Consequence of such mens assistance, which proved fatal to him: <hi>The goodness of whose Cause did sink under the burden of</hi> their <hi>sins,</hi> according to the sad Presage of our excellent <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> in a Sermon Preached to the Court at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if ever his Majesty and the Church should be again set upon by <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pharisees,</hi> God grant us better assistance than that of <hi>Publicans</hi> &amp; <hi>Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I wonder in my heart, what should make any Debauched and Prophane people pretend the least zeal for the Church of <hi>England</hi>; there being no Church in the world that more condemns all unrighteousness and sin; or which would be more severe against wicked livers, were she in circumstances to put in execution her own Discipline. Which she is not like to be, so long as the Civil Magistrate is so remiss in executing, according to their Oaths, those excellent Laws that are Enacted against Drunkenness, Swearing, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Profanation of the Lord's day, and other wicked Practices.</p>
            <p>And I add that <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Fanaticism</hi> will both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly still grow upon us, be we never so zealous against both, whilst that Debauchery and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which have so miserably overspread the Nation, do still escape scot-free and go unpunish'd.</p>
            <p>I cannot but observe one thing more that, 'tis an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth and ridiculous Spectacle, to behold wild Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and prophane <note n="*" place="margin">

               <head>To Conclude.</head>
               <p>'TILL I see on the one hand a far greater sense of the hatefulness of <hi>Schism,</hi> and of breaking the Peace and Unity of the Church: of which all good people did heretofore express the greatest Abhorrence and Detestation.</p>
               <p>And till I see on <hi>all</hi> hands more sincere endeavours to put away Anger, Wrath, Malice and Bitterness.</p>
               <p>Till I see that the several divided Parties among us, are more inclinable to unite heartily with <hi>us</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>We</hi> again with <hi>them,</hi> so far forth as unanimously to oppose <hi>Popery,</hi> that designs the destruction of us <hi>all.</hi> Which all but hot-spurs, that never allow themselves leisure to think a wise, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date thought, must needs know to be absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our mutual preservation at <hi>this</hi> time. And it would be well, would we <hi>herein</hi> learn of the <hi>Papists,</hi> who, notwithstanding the great differences that are among <hi>them</hi> also, can joyn together against Protestants.</p>
               <p>Till I see again that our Zeal against <hi>Popery</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally so well tempered, as not to endanger our running headlong into the other extreme, that of <hi>Confusion</hi>: which will, no question, end in Popery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95579:21"/>Till I see that we hate Popery for its Disloyalty, as well as for its Idolatrous and Cruel Principles and Practices.</p>
               <p>Till I see also that our opposition to Poper y ariseth more generally from a sense of the infinite scandal it brings upon the Holy Religion of our Blessed Saviour, and its wofully depraving the Souls of men, as well as from our concern for our Temporal interest.</p>
               <p>Till I moreover see that Zeal in any sort of people whatsoever, is not accounted sufficient to give them the Reputation of Good Protestants or Good Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, so long as they are bad Christians, and their Conversations declare them no hearty Friends <hi>to any</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>And (in a word) till I see that our Excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, that the pure and undefiled Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath a more powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Lives and Spirits, of those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves Anti-papists and Anti-sectarians: I say, till I see <hi>these</hi> things, I shall, for my part, be far from concluding with <hi>Agag,</hi> that the bitterness of death is past, that the <hi>worst</hi> is not still behind; which God in his infinite mercy, give us wisdom to prevent, by our timely Reformation in the forementioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, for Christ Jesus his sake: To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be rendred by us, and by all the world, all Honour, Glory and Praise. <hi>Amen.</hi>
