            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

here, which thou half not found in any other discourses of

all Vices, and the mother of all mischief,
(<hi>saith the book of Homilies</hi>) was <hi>LUCIFER,</hi> first Gods

who by Rebelling against the Majesty of God, of the brightest and

            <p>2. <hi>Q.</hi> How many sorts of <hi>Rebellion</hi> are there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Three most especially, that is to say, the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of
the <hi>Heart,</hi> the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of
the <hi>Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> What is the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> is a rancorous swelling of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40533:3"/>
the <hi>Heart</hi> against the authority and commands of the supreme
power under which we live: which tho it be so cunningly
suppressed and smothered, that it break not out either into
words or deeds, yet makes a man guilty of <hi>damnation</hi> in the
sight of God. And this is that of which the <hi>Wiseman</hi> tells us
saying, <hi>Curse not the</hi> King, <hi>no not in thy</hi> thought, <hi>for a bird of
the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell
the matter.</hi> Eccles. 10. v. 20.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Quest.</hi> What is the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Tongue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>tongue,</hi> is a malicious defaming of
the person, actions, parts, and government of those Sovereign
Princes to which the Lord hath made us <hi>subject,</hi> of purpose to
disgrace them amongst their people, to render them odious
and contemptible, and consequently to excite their Subjects
to rise up against them. Of this it is whereof the Lord God
commanded saying, <hi>thou shalt not speak evil of the</hi> Ruler <hi>of thy
People; Exod.</hi> 22. 28. acknowledged for a divine precept by
St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 23. 5. See to this purpose also that of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi>
24. v. 21. where it is said, <hi>It is not fit to say unto a</hi> King <hi>thou
art wicked;</hi> And if it be not fit to <hi>speak evil</hi> to him, assuredly
it is as unfit to <hi>speak evil</hi> of him. And finally of this it is that
<note n="b" place="margin">Aristot. in Problem. sect. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Philosopher tells us saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
he that speaks evil of the Magistrate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
against the Common-wealth. But I must let you know
withal, that tho this of the <hi>tongue</hi> be a distinct <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi>
and so judged in <hi>Law:</hi> yet many times this and the
other of the <hi>heart,</hi> are but the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>preparations</hi> to the
<hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>hand,</hi> or <hi>actual Rebellion,</hi> as they call it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly.
And this appears most plainly in the story of <hi>Absalon,</hi>
whose <hi>heart</hi> first swelled against his Father, for being so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
in restoring him to his <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Presence,</hi> upon the murder
which he had committed on his brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> (2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. v.
24, 28.) and his <hi>tongue</hi> found the way to disgrace his <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which he accused of <hi>negligence</hi> and <hi>injustice,</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-people
(2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. v. 2, 3 &amp;c.) before he blew the <hi>trumpet,</hi>
and took Arms against him, and made him <hi>flee</hi> with some <hi>few
servants,</hi> from the Royal City, v. 14. But here we take it not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40533:4"/>
for a <hi>preparation,</hi> but for a <hi>species</hi> distinct, as before was said.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Quest.</hi> Why do you call the <hi>swellings</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> and
the <hi>revilings</hi> of the <hi>tongue</hi> by the name of <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
considering that the Law which punisheth <hi>Rebellion</hi>
with no less than death, doth take no cognizance of
mens <hi>thoughts;</hi> and that when<note n="c" place="margin">Merc. An<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Gervase Shelvey</hi> of
<hi>Sandwich</hi> said lately to a Gentleman of that Town
that <hi>if the King came thither he would shoot the Rogue,</hi>
for which he was imprisoned by the Major now being,
it was resolved by the <hi>High Court of Parliament,</hi> that
these words were but a <hi>misdemeanour;</hi> and so he was
released again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>House of Commons,</hi> which you call the <hi>High Court</hi>
of <hi>Parliament,</hi> did not so much deliver their judgment in the
case aforesaid, as betray their disaffection in it to His Majesty,
whose Person they endeavour to destroy that they may keep
his power still amongst themselves. Or if they did, it was a
very false and erroneous judgment, directly contrary unto the
resolution of my Lords the Judges, and other Sages of the Law
in all former Ages,<note n="d" place="margin">V. Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords Pleas cap. 2. Coke on Littleton I. 2. c. 11. §. 200.</note> by whom it is affirmed expresly, that <hi>if

               <hi>do compass or imagin the death of our Lord the King</hi> (as
all <hi>Rebels</hi> do) and doth declare the same imagination by any
<hi>overt fact,</hi> either deed or word, he shall suffer judgement as a
Traitor, <hi>licet is id quod in voluntate habuit, ad effectum non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxerit,</hi>
as<note n="f" place="margin">Bracton. l. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Bracton</hi> hath it, altho it do not take effect, and go
no farther than the thought or purpose of the first contriver.
Upon which ground it was, no question, that <hi>Shimei</hi> suffered
death by the hands of <hi>Solomon.</hi> For altho <hi>David</hi> spared him
upon submission, because he would not intermix the joy of
his return unto <hi>Hierusalem</hi> with any sad and mournful Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(as that must needs have been unto <hi>Shimei</hi>'s friends)
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 22. yet he gave order to his son <hi>to bring his hoary head
down to the grave with blood, because he had cursed him with a
grievous curse in the day when he went to</hi> Mahanaim, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
2. 8. which was accordingly performed by <hi>Solomon,</hi> v. 46.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Quest.</hi> But <hi>Shimei</hi>'s case can be no <hi>Precedent</hi> to us, who are
not governed by the <hi>Iudicial Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> but by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40533:4"/>

Officers, &amp; Form of Government, of purpose to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The other sort of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>hand,</hi> is that which commonly is called <hi>Actual Rebellion,</hi> and is defined by
the Statute of the 25 of King <hi>Edward</hi> 3.<note n="p" place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> to be <hi>a levying of
War against our Sovereign Lord the King in his Realm, or an
adhering to the Kings Enemies in his Realm, giving to them aid
and comfort in the Realm or elsewhere.</hi> And so it is determined
also in the <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> by which all those,<note n="q" place="margin">Spiegel in Lexico <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to be <hi>Rebels.</hi> Where note, that not the <hi>open Act</hi> only, but
the attempt &amp; machination is brought within the compass of
<hi>Rebellion. Rebellio ipse actus rebellandi est, qui non solùm facto sed
machinatione committitur,</hi> as those <hi>Lawyers</hi> tell us.<note n="r" place="margin">Bartolus in Constitut. Hen. 7.</note> And it is
worth our observation that not only the <hi>bearing Arms</hi> against
the King is declared to be <hi>Rebellion</hi> by the law of <hi>England,</hi> but
that it was declared to be <hi>Rebellion</hi> by the chief Judges of
this Kingdom<note n="s" place="margin">Camden Annal. Eliz. An. 1601.</note> at the arraignment of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> (the
Father of him who now is in the head of this <hi>Rebellion</hi>) for any
man to seek to make himself so strong, that the King should
not be able to resist him, altho he broke not out into open act.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The deposition &amp; destruction of the King in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; an alteration of the present Government. And so it was
determined by the joint consent of all the Judges<note n="t" place="margin">Camden ibid.</note> at the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment
of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> above mentioned, by whom it
was resolved for <hi>Law,</hi> that in every <hi>Rebellion</hi> there was a plot
upon the life and deposition of the Prince; it being not to be

conceived that the <hi>Rebels</hi> would suffer him to <hi>live</hi> or <hi>reign<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
who might have opportunity in the change of things, to punish
them for their Rebellions, and avenge himself upon them for
their Treasons. And this they did confirm by the <hi>Civil Laws,</hi>
and further justifie and confirm by the strength of Reason, with
which it seemed inconsistent, <hi>ut qui semel Regi jus dixerit,</hi> that
he who had once over-ruled his King by <hi>force of Arms,</hi> should
either suffer him to <hi>live,</hi> or recover the possession of his <hi>Realm</hi>
again. All which they made good by the sad examples of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the second, and King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, who did not
long enjoy either <hi>life</hi> or <hi>Crown,</hi> after they came into the hands
of those who <hi>rebelled</hi> against them.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Qu.</hi> But those Examples which you speak of, were in
times of <hi>Popery;</hi> have you the like to shew since the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I would to God we had none such, but we have too
many. For not to look into our neighbouring Realm of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the proceedings of some there (who called themselves
<hi>Protestants)</hi> against their <hi>Queen;</hi> the <hi>Rebellion</hi> plotted by the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, (though there was
nothing less pretended) was to have ended in the death of the
Queen, and the alteration of the Government. For as was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
confessed by some of his <hi>Accomplices,</hi> the secret part of
the design, was to have seized upon the Queen, and secured
his Adversaries in the Court; whom when he had condemned
and executed,<note n="u" place="margin">Id. Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Parliamento indicto reipub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> formam immutare
statuit,</hi> he then resolved to call a Parliament, and settle a new
form of Government. Which how it could be done, and the
Queen alive, I believe you know not. And so much was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the Earl himself, after the sentence of death
was passed upon him, when he affirmed to certain of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Council, <hi>Reginam sospitem esse non posse si ipse supersit,</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Idem. Ibid.</note> that whilst he lived it was not possible for the Queen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in safety. Thus have you seen the main design of that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
(as of all others whatsoever) what his pretences were
which he cast abroad, the better to seduce the people, I shall
not stick to tell you if you put me to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40533:6"/>11. <hi>Quest.</hi> I shall not trouble you with that at this present
time. But being you say, that <hi>levying of War</hi> against the
King is properly and truly to be called <hi>Rebellion,</hi> I would
fain ask, whether you mean it only in such cases where
the Subjects take up Arms out of pride and wantonness;
or in such also when they are necessitated and inforced
unto it in their own defence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I mean it equally in both cases, tho of the two, the
former be more odious in the sight both of God and man. For
even <hi>defensive Arms,</hi> as your Party calls them, are absolutely
unlawful in the Subject against his Sovereign: in regard that
no <hi>defensive War</hi> can be undertaken, but it carrieth a <hi>resistance</hi>
in it<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> to those <hi>higher powers,</hi> to which <hi>every soul</hi> is to be <hi>subject.</hi>
Which <hi>powers</hi> being <hi>obtained</hi> by Almighty God, it followeth by
the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s Logick (who was a very able Disputant) that they
<hi>who do resist the powers, resist the Ordinance of God,</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>shall receive to themselves demnation.</hi> A rule which took
such deep impression in the Primitive Christians, that though
for personal valour, numbers of men, and leaders able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them, they were superiour to the adverse party in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire; yet they chose rather to expose their lives unto
the merciless fury of the <hi>Persecutors,</hi> than take up <hi>Arms</hi> against
their Princes, or disturb the peace of their Dominions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of standing in their own <hi>defence,</hi> being so tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically
and unjustly handled. For proof whereof, we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

            <p>12. <hi>Quest.</hi> You need not put your self to that trouble. For
we deny not that <hi>the Antient Christians did rather choose to
suffer, than to take up Arms;</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Mercur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Britannicus. num. 19.</note> but when we say, that <hi>tho
they were</hi> exceeding <hi>numerous, yet they were not formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
States and Kingdoms,</hi> and that when they were once
<hi>estated in laws and liberties, as in</hi> France, Holland, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Germany, <hi>they made no question then to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
What can you answer unto that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I trow the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was a <hi>setled State,</hi> as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40533:6"/>
strongly cemented with all the ligaments of power and policy,
as any one of these you mention; and that the Subjects of that
Empire had their <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>liberties,</hi> which as their Ancestors
had received from the indulgence of their <hi>Emperors,</hi> and the
<hi>Roman Senate,</hi> so they transmitted them to their posterity. And
yet when all the Empire had received the faith in the time of
<hi>Constantine,</hi> and that no Religion but the <hi>Christian</hi> had publick
countenance from the Laws, during the most part of his reign,
and the whole reign of his three Sons (which was for fifty five
years, no fewer,) the Subjects kept themselves to their former
Principles. Insomuch that when the Emperour <hi>Iulian</hi> began
to intrench upon their <hi>liberties,</hi> and infringe those <hi>laws,</hi> which
had been granted them by the grace and goodness of those
Princes; they knew no other way, nor <hi>weapons,</hi> by which to
make resistance to such lawless violence, but their <hi>prayers</hi> and
<hi>tears.</hi>

the <hi>Medicine</hi> which they had to cure that <hi>Malady,</hi> as we find in
<hi>Nazianzen.</hi> The like I could produce from St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also,
<note n="g" place="margin">Ambros. Orat. 5.</note> were not this sufficient. And for your instances of <hi>France,
Holland, Scotland, Germany,</hi> which you have mustered up to
make good your cause; I am sorry for the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religions
sake, that you have furnished me with so many examples of
Rebellions since the Reformation; some of which ended in the
<hi>death,</hi> and others in the <hi>deposition</hi> of their natural Princes.
Which was a point you seemed to doubt of in your tenth
Question.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>Quest.</hi> But tell me seriously, do you conceive that all
<hi>resistance</hi> of this kind made by <hi>force of Arms,</hi> may be called
<hi>Rebellion;</hi> and that there are no cases which may make
it lawful, and warrantable by the Laws of God or man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Your question hath two several parts, and must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
two several answers. And to the first I answer seriously
(it being now no time to trifle) that all <hi>resistance</hi> of the kind
you speak of, nor only may be called <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but is <hi>Rebellion</hi> in
the true and natural sense of the word. For if (as the <hi>Civilians</hi>
say) <hi>Rebellis dicitur inobediens Principi circa concernentia prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
Imperii,</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Bartolus in repertorio.</note> that every one may be said to be a Rebel,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40533:7"/>
who yieldeth not obedience to his Prince in all such particulars,
as do concern the flourishing estate of his Dominions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> assuredly
he is a <hi>Rebel</hi> in the highest degree, who takes up <hi>Arms</hi> against
his Sovereign (whatever his pretences be) and by so doing
doth embroil his Kingdoms in all these miseries, which most
inseparably are annexed to a <hi>Civil</hi> War. Now frame the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of the present <hi>Quere,</hi> into a distinct question of it self,
and I will give such answer to it, as I hope shall satisfie.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Quest.</hi> My question is, whether the <hi>condition</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which are ingaged in such <hi>resistance,</hi> the <hi>grounds</hi> on
which they go, and the <hi>end</hi> they aim at, make not an
alteration in the case: so that <hi>Resistance</hi> qualified by these
several circumstances, become not warrantable by the
Laws both of God and Man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The answer unto this is already made in the book of
<hi>Homilies;</hi> where it is said,<note place="margin">First part of the Homily against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> that "though not only great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the rude and rascal <hi>Commons,</hi> but sometimes also men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of great <hi>Wit, Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> have moved <hi>Rebellion</hi>
against their lawful Princes; though they should pretend sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
causes, as the <hi>redress</hi> of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> or <hi>Reformation</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> tho they have made a great shew of holy mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by beginning their <hi>Rebellion</hi> with a counterfeit service of
God, and by displaying and bearing about divers <hi>Ensigns</hi> and
<hi>Banners,</hi> which are acceptable unto the rude ignorant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
people, (great multitudes of whom by such false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
and shews they do deceive and draw unto them) yet
were the multitudes of the <hi>Rebels</hi> never so huge and great, the
<hi>Captains</hi> never so noble, politick and witty, the <hi>pretences</hi> feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be never so good and holy, yet the speedly overthrow of
all <hi>Rebels,</hi> of what number, state or condition soever they were,
or what colour or cause soever they pretended, is, and ever
hath been such, that God doth thereby shew that he alloweth
neither the <hi>dignity</hi> of any person, nor the <hi>multitude</hi> of any
people, nor the <hi>weight</hi> of any cause, as sufficient for which the
Subjects may move <hi>Rebellion</hi> against their Princes." So far
the very words of the Book of <hi>Homilies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. <hi>Quest.</hi> Why do you tell us thus of the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40533:7"/>
composed by a company of ignorant <hi>Bookmen,</hi> men utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unskilful in the Laws of the Land. Think you that we
ascribe to them so much authority, as to be over-ruled
by them in this case?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It may be not. But I must tell you that there was a
Statute made in the thirteenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>

<hi>An Act for Reformation of disorders in the Ministers in the

all who were to be admitted unto <hi>holy Orders,</hi> or instituted into
any <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> preferment should first subscribe unto the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles

of which <hi>Articles</hi> recites the names and titles of each several
<hi>Homily,</hi> and approves their doctrine. So that although the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi>
were at first composed by men unskilful in the <hi>Laws,</hi> as
you please to say, yet they received both strength and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the skilfullest <hi>Lawyers</hi> of those times, convened with
the Nobility and Gentry in the Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
have as much authority as the <hi>Parliament</hi> could add
unto them. But since you are not pleased with this general an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
give me your doubts and <hi>Queres</hi> in particular, and see
what I can say unto them.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>Quest.</hi> First then, I ask, whether if the King become a
<hi>Tyrant,</hi> it be not Lawful in that case to <hi>bear Arms</hi> against
him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, if <hi>G. Buchanan</hi> may be judg,<note n="l" place="margin">Buchanan. de jure Regni.</note> who tells us
plainly, that he would have rewards proposed to such as should
kill a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> as formerly there were for those who destroyed
<hi>Wolves.</hi> But if S. <hi>Paul</hi> may rule the case we shall find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
For if we ask to whom it was that the Apostle did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Subjection to be given even by <hi>every soul,</hi> to whom it
was that he forbad <hi>resistance</hi> to be made upon pain of <hi>Damnation;</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 13. v. 1, 2, 3.</note> we shall find it was no other than the Emperour<note n="n" place="margin">Baron. &amp; Chronol. alii.</note> 
               <hi>Nero,</hi> the
greatest <hi>Tyrant,</hi> the bloudiest and most terrible Prince, the
greatest monster of mankind, that ever yet was born of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> over whom he did so
cruelly tyrannize, commanded <hi>every soul</hi> to be <hi>subject</hi> to him, <hi>not
for wrath only but for conscience sake,</hi> and that upon the pain and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40533:8"/>
peril of <hi>damnation,</hi> no man should be so bold as to <hi>resist</hi> his <hi>power,</hi>
or <hi>rebel</hi> against him. And doubtless <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a
mighty <hi>Tyrant,</hi> one who had taken from the <hi>Iews,</hi> their, <hi>Laws,</hi>
their <hi>Liberty,</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">2 Kings 25. &amp; 2 Chron. c. 36.</note> and whatsoever else was most
dear unto them. Yet were the <hi>Iews</hi> commanded to submit
unto him, and patiently to bear the yoak which was laid upon
them; and <hi>not to hearken to their</hi> Prophets, <hi>not to their</hi> Diviners,
<hi>nor unto their</hi> Dreamers (mark it, for this is just your case)

<hi>for they Prophesie a lye unto you that ye should perish,</hi> Jerem. 27.

wicked speech of him who did pretend so much unto <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
we find it thus resolved in <hi>Plutarch,</hi>

the Emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> who did not only labour to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<hi>Religion,</hi> but utterly to root out the <hi>Professours</hi> of it; and
yet the contrary doctrine was then preached and practised, as
before was shewed you. What weapons the poor <hi>Christians</hi>
did make use of in the time of <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate,</hi> in his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to subvert the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and establish <hi>Paganism</hi> again in the
place thereof, we told you lately out of <hi>Nazianzen:</hi> and shall
now add, that the <hi>Christian</hi> party was then so strong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, that when <hi>Iovinian</hi> was elected Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

that it was not <hi>consciousness</hi> of their own weakness, nor the <hi>fear</hi>

which made them patiently submit to the present storm. Thus

when the younger <hi>Valentinian</hi> endeavoured to supplant the true
<hi>Religion,</hi> and to set up <hi>Arianism,</hi> to which he strongly was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Somewhat in answer unto this you received before,
in the command imposed upon the <hi>Iews</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>

you now, it S. <hi>Pauls</hi> case in the 23. of the Acts. Being brought
to plead his own cause, and the Gospels too, before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> in the first entrance of his Plea, <hi>the high

of so great an injury, so plainly contrary unto the

finding that it was the <hi>High-Priest</hi> whom he had reviled (who

               <hi>I

some men who had got the Queen into their hands, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ingrossed unto themselves the principal managery of
the Commonwealth. But he had other aims than that, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was told you; and so had they that went before him in the
self same road. When as <hi>Watt Tiler,</hi> and <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> and the
residue of that <hi>Rascal Rabble</hi> had took up Arms against King
<hi>Richard</hi> the second, they made the <hi>Londoners</hi> believe (who have
been always apt to be deluded by the like pretences) that when
they had seized on the <hi>evil Counsellors,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Hollingsh. in Rich. 2.</note> which abused the King,
and brought them to a legal trial, <hi>then they would be quiet.</hi> But
under this pretence they broke open Prisons, robbed Churches,
murdered the King's good Subjects, and finally arrived to so
high an impudence, that <hi>Watt Tiler</hi> did not stick to say, that
<hi>within four days all the Laws of England should proceed from his
mouth.</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Id. Ibid.</note> And when <hi>Jack Cade</hi> had drawn the <hi>Kentish</hi> to Rebel

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, if<note n="e" place="margin">

               <hi>Paraeus</hi> may be Judg, and some of the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
Doctors who have so determined. But <hi>David</hi>'s case, which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40533:9"/>
commonly is alledged in defence hereof, if looked on with the
eyes of judgment, doth affirm the contrary. For <hi>David,</hi> though
he had a guard of some friends and followers to save him from the
hands of such wicked instruments, as <hi>Saul</hi> in his unjust displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
might have used against him: yet he preserved himself from
<hi>Saul</hi> not by <hi>resistance,</hi> but by <hi>flight,</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 22. v. 5. 23. v. 13. 26, 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> by flitting up and down as
the King removed, and approached near him with his Armies.
For had he had a thought of War, though <hi>Defensive</hi> meerly, 'tis
probable he would have took the opportunities which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to him, either of seizing on <hi>Sauls</hi> person when he had him
all alone in the <hi>Cave</hi> of <hi>Engeddi,</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">1 Sam. 24. v. 3.</note> or suffering <hi>Abishai</hi> to <hi>smite him</hi>
as he lay <hi>asleep</hi> in the <hi>Hill</hi> of <hi>Hachilah,</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">1 Sam. 16. v. 3.</note> or at the least in making
sure of <hi>Abner</hi> and the Host of <hi>Saul,</hi> who lay <hi>sleeping</hi> by him.<note n="i" place="margin">Ibid. v. 12.</note> But
<hi>David</hi> was not so well tutored in the Art of Rebellion, as to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himself this way, and wanted some of our new Masters to
instruct him in it. If from the practice of a pious and religious
<hi>Iew,</hi> we will look down upon the precept of a grave, wise,
and learned <hi>Gentile,</hi> we shall find this rule laid down in <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Aristot. in Polit.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that if the Magistrate
assault the person of a private <hi>Subject,</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi> may not
strike again, nor lift hand against him. Finally, that you may
perceive how much all sorts of men do oppose your Doctrines,
<hi>Calvin</hi> himself, although no friend to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> doth affirm
thus much,<note n="l" place="margin">Calvin Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut. l. 3. c. 10. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>qui privatus manum intulerit, &amp;c.</hi> that any <hi>private</hi>
person of what sort soever, who shall lift up his hand against
his <hi>Sovereign</hi> (though a very <hi>Tyrant</hi>) is for the same condemned
by the voice of God.</p>
            <p>21. <hi>Quest.</hi> Perhaps we may so far agree with you, as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>private</hi> persons from <hi>bearing Arms,</hi> and lifting up
their hands against Kings, and Princes of their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
But think you that <hi>inferiour Magistrates</hi> are not
inabled by their Offices to protect the People, and <hi>arm</hi>
them if occasion be, in their own <hi>defence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true that some <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
who either lived in <hi>popular States,</hi> or had their breeding at
<hi>Geneva,</hi> or thought the <hi>Discipline</hi> by them defended could not
be otherwise obtruded upon <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> than by putting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40533:10"/>
the Sword into the hands of the People, have spared no pains
to spread abroad this dangerous Doctrine; in which they have not
wanted followers in most parts of <hi>Christendom.</hi> But S. <hi>Paul</hi>
knew of no such matter when he commanded <hi>every soul</hi> to
yield obedience and <hi>subjection</hi> to the <hi>higher powers,</hi> and upon no
occasion to <hi>resist</hi> those <hi>powers</hi> to which the Lord had made them
<hi>subject.</hi> So that although <hi>inferiour Magistrates</hi> may expect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the hands of those, over whom and for whose weal and
governance they are advanced and placed by the <hi>Prince</hi> in chief;
yet God expects that they should yield obedience to the <hi>powers</hi>
above them, especially to the highest of all, than which there is
not any <hi>higher.</hi> There is a golden Chain in <hi>Polities,</hi> and every link
thereof hath some relation and dependence upon that before; so
far forth as <hi>inferiour Magistrates</hi> do command the People, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that power and those instruments which is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to them by the <hi>supreme Prince,</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi> is obliged to
submit unto them, without any manner of <hi>Resistance.</hi> Men of
no publick Office must obey the <hi>Constable,</hi> the <hi>Constable</hi> is bound
to speed such Warrants as the next <hi>Iustice of the Peace</hi> shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
unto him; the <hi>Iustices</hi> receive the exposition of the Law
from the mouth of the <hi>Iudges;</hi> the <hi>Iudges</hi> have no more Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
but what is given them by the <hi>King:</hi> And thereupon it needs
must follow, that though the <hi>Iudges</hi> direct the <hi>Iustices,</hi> and the
<hi>Iustices</hi> command the <hi>Constables,</hi> and the <hi>Constables</hi> may call the
<hi>People</hi> to their aid, if occasion be; yet all must yield a free obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
without reluctancy or <hi>resistance</hi> to the King himself.
The reason is, because as Kings or <hi>Supreme Magistrates</hi> are called
<hi>Gods Ministers</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 13. vers. 4.</note> so the <hi>inferiour</hi> or <hi>Subordinate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>

               <hi>Submit your
selves to the</hi> King, <hi>as unto the</hi> Supreme; next to such <hi>Governours
as are sent</hi> (or authorized) <hi>by him for the punishment of evil
doers.</hi> Besides, there is no <hi>Inferior Matistrate</hi> of what sort so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
but as he is a <hi>publick</hi> person, in respect of those that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
him, so is he but a <hi>private</hi> man in reference to the <hi>powers</hi>
above him; and therefore as a <hi>private</hi> person disabled utterly
(by your own rules) from having any more authority to <hi>resist</hi>
his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> or bear <hi>defensive</hi> Arms against him as well as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40533:10"/>
any other of the Common People. The government of <hi>States</hi>
may be compared most properly unto <hi>Porphyries</hi> Tree, in which
there is one <hi>Genus summum,</hi> and many <hi>Genera subalterna.</hi> Now
'tis well known to every young <hi>Logician</hi> who hath learnt his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicabiles,</hi>
that <hi>Genus subalternum</hi> is a <hi>species</hi> only as it looks up to
those above it; a <hi>Genus</hi> in relation unto these below it. If you
have so much <hi>Logick</hi> in you as to make application of this Note
to the present case, you will perceive <hi>inferiour Magistrates</hi> to
be no <hi>Magistrates</hi> at all, as they relate unto the King, the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
summum</hi> in the scale of Govenment, and therefore of no
more authority to <hi>resist</hi> the King, or call the People unto Arms,
than the meanest <hi>Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. <hi>Quest.</hi> If so, then were the <hi>Christian</hi> Subject of all men
most miserable,<note n="o" place="margin">Merc. Brit. numb. 19.</note> in being utterly deprived of all ways

in which you have deprived him of all means to

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That which the Lord himself <hi>prescribed,</hi> and the

to our Lord the King. Kings are <hi>accomptable</hi> to none but God,
if they abuse the power which he gives unto them: Nor can we
sue them for a <hi>Trespass</hi> in any other Court, than the Court of
Heaven. Therefore when <hi>David</hi> had defiled the Wife, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the Husband, he thought himself responsal for it unto
none but God, <hi>against</hi> whom <hi>only he had sinned,</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ps. 51. v. 4.</note> as he saith him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And thereupon S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> gives this gloss on those words
of <hi>David, Homini ergo non peccavit cui non tenebatur obnoxius.</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ambros. in locum.</note> 
               <hi>David,</hi> saith he, confesseth no offence to man, by whom he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40533:11"/>
could not be <hi>impleaded;</hi> but only unto God who had power to
judg him. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> understood this rightly, when
he did thus address himself to a King of <hi>France, Si quis de nobis,
&amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="s" place="margin">S Greg. Tur. Hist. Franc.</note> "If any of us (O King) do transgress the Laws, thou hast
power to punish him; but it thou goest beyond thy limits, who
can punish thee? We tell thee of thy faults as occasion serves,

Which if thou shouldest refuse to do, who shall judg thee
for it, but he that calls himself by the name of Justice." And
that you may be sure, that it is no otherwise in <hi>England</hi> than in
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Iewry, Bracton,</hi> a great and famous Lawyer of this
Kingdom, doth affirm expresly, that if the King proceed not
in his Government according unto Law and Right, there is no

by the injured Subject? <hi>Locus erit supplicationi quod factum suum

them by <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. <hi>Quest.</hi> We grant it to be true which you cite from <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton,</hi>
as it relates to private and particular men; but think
you that it doth concern or oblige the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which
is the representative body of the Kingdom?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Hoc sumus congregati quod &amp; dispersi,</hi>

tells us of the <hi>Christians</hi> in another case. We shewed before
that <hi>Subjects</hi> were in no case to resist their <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> in the
way of <hi>Arms,</hi> either as <hi>private</hi> persons on <hi>inferiour Magistrates.</hi>
And thereupon we may conclude, that the People of this Realm
in the <hi>diffusive</hi> body of it, having no power of <hi>levying War</hi> or
raising Forces to <hi>resist</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> without being punishable for
the same, as in case of <hi>Treason;</hi> cannot enable the two Houses of
<hi>Parliament,</hi> which are the <hi>representative</hi> body of it, to do those
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40533:11"/>
Acts, which they want power to do themselves; for no Man
can confer a power upon any other which is not first vested in
himself, according to that good old rule, <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi>
And therefore if it be <hi>rebellion</hi> in the <hi>English</hi> Subject out of times
of <hi>Parliament, to levy War against the King in his Realm, or to
adhere unto his Enemies, and be aiding to them:</hi> I know not how
it can excuse the <hi>Members</hi> of the two Houses of <hi>Parliament</hi> from
coming within the compass of that <hi>Condemnation,</hi> if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
such Acts in time of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and under the pretence
of the power thereof, which are judged <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi>
by the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>24. <hi>Quest.</hi> But Master <hi>Prynne</hi> hath learnedly removed that
rub,<note n="x" place="margin">In his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> who tells you that the Statute
of 25. <hi>Edward</hi> 3.
runs (only) in the <hi>Singular</hi> number, <hi>If a man shall levy
War against the King,</hi> and therefore cannot be extended
to the <hi>Houses,</hi> who are many and publick persons;
What can you answer unto that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> having so often shewn <hi>malice,</hi> may
have a little leave sometimes to shew his <hi>folly,</hi> and make some
<hi>sport</hi> unto the Kingdom in these useful times: for if his learned
observation will hold good in Law, it is not possible that any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
should be punished in a <hi>legal</hi> way; because so <hi>many</hi> (and
some of them perhaps may be <hi>publick</hi> persons) are commonly
ingaged in actions of that wicked nature. And I suppose that
Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> with all his learning, did never read of a <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
that is to say, of a <hi>War levyed</hi> by the Subject against his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
plotted and executed by one <hi>man</hi> only, in the <hi>Singular
number.</hi> Had Master <hi>Prynne</hi> affirmed on his word and credit,
that the <hi>Members</hi> of the two Houses were not <hi>men</hi> but <hi>gods,</hi> he had
then said somewhat which would have freed them from the guilt
and danger of that dreadful Statute. If he admit them to be
<hi>men,</hi> and grant them to <hi>have levyed War against</hi> his Majesty, or
to <hi>be aiding to the Rebels now</hi> in arms against him; he both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them to be guilty of this great <hi>Rebellion,</hi> with which this
miserable Kingdom in almost laid desolate. His Sophistry and
trim distinctions touching their <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>numbers</hi> will but little
help them.</p>

25. <hi>Qu.</hi> We have another Plaister which will salve that Sore,
<hi>viz.</hi> The difference that is made between the King's <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and his <hi>Power</hi> by which is it made visible to discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eyes, that though the <hi>Parliament</hi> have <hi>levyed</hi> War
against the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> yet they do not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his <hi>Power,</hi> but <hi>defend</hi> it rather. And 'tis not a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi>
of the <hi>Person</hi> but the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> which is
forbidden by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> How do you like of that <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As ill, or worse than of the other, as being of the
two the more serious folly; and coming from an Author no
less factious (but far more learned I confess) than your other
was. For if I do remember right, <hi>Buchanan</hi> was the first that
broached this Doctrine in his Book De <hi>jure regni apud Scotos;</hi>
in which he tells us that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the place aforesaid doth not
speak of <hi>Magistrates, Sed de functione &amp; officio eorum qui aliis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt,</hi>
but of the <hi>Magistracy</hi> it self, the Function or Office of the
<hi>Magistrate,</hi> which must not be <hi>resisted,</hi> though his <hi>Person</hi> may.
Which foolish Fancy serving fitly for a Cloak or Vizard,
wherewith to palliate and disguise <hi>Rebellions,</hi> hath since been
ofen used by those who pursue his Principles, (though never
worn so thred-bare as of late, in your treacherous Pamphlets:)
but draweth after it as many and as gross Absurdities as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did. For by this strange division of the King from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or of his <hi>Person</hi> from his <hi>Power;</hi> a <hi>Traitor</hi> may kill <hi>Charles,</hi>
and not hurt the <hi>King,</hi> destroy the <hi>Man</hi> and save the <hi>Magistrate,</hi>
the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> in one of the Armies may fight against
his <hi>Person</hi> in the other Army, his own <hi>Authority</hi> may be used to
his own <hi>destruction,</hi> and one may lawfully set upon him, beat,
assault, and wound him, in order to his <hi>preservation.</hi> So that you
make the King like <hi>Sosia</hi> in the ancient <hi>Comedy,</hi> who being
well beaten, and demanded who it was that did it, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Egomet, memet, qui nunc sunt domi,</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Plaut. in Amphitr. Act. 2.</note> that <hi>Sosia,</hi> who was
at home in his Masters House, did beat that <hi>Sosia</hi> which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in his Masters business. But questionless Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did
better understand himself than either <hi>Buchanan,</hi> or any of his
followers since his time have done: Who doth interpret the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40533:12"/>
word <hi>power,</hi> which he useth in the first and second Verses, by
that of <hi>Principes &amp; Ministri, Rulers</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> which be
useth in the third and fourth: Which as it plainly shews that he
meaneth the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and not the <hi>Function</hi> or the <hi>Office,</hi> as
your Masters tell you; so doth it leave you liable to the <hi>wrath</hi> of
God, if you endeavour to defend these wicked and <hi>rebellious</hi>
courses by such wretched shifts.</p>
            <p>26. <hi>Quest.</hi> What say you then, if it appear that the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Parliament,</hi> (for I use your terms) are not <hi>subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi>
to the King, but <hi>coordinate</hi> with him:<note n="y" place="margin">Observations on his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Answers, &amp;c.</note> I hope then
you will yield so far that the <hi>two Houses</hi> have a power, if
they cannot otherwise provide for the common safety,
to <hi>arm</hi> the People of the Realm against Him, as against
an <hi>Equal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We grant indeed, that People which have no <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
but stand on equal terms with one another, if injured by
their Neighbours, and not receiving satisfaction when they do
desire it, may remedy themselves by force, and for so doing
by the Law of <hi>Nations,</hi> are esteemed <hi>just Enemies;</hi> but so it is
not in the point which is now in question, <hi>the Realm of England</hi>
(as it is declared by Act of<note n="a" place="margin">Statut. 24. Henr. 8. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

had the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> then assembled, conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>coordinate</hi> with the King in the publick Government, they
would not have so wronged themselves and their Posterity,
as to have made this declaration and acknowledgment so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
thereunto, not only in a <hi>Parliament</hi> time, but by Act
of <hi>Parliament.</hi> Besides, if this <hi>Coordination</hi> which you dream
of could be once admitted, it must needs follow thereupon, that
though the King hath no <hi>Superiour,</hi> he hath many <hi>Equals,</hi> and
where there is <hi>equality</hi> there is no <hi>subjection.</hi> But <hi>Bracton</hi> tells
you in plain terms, not only that the King hath no superiour
in his Realm, except God alone, but that he hath no <hi>Equal,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40533:13"/>
neither, <hi>Parem autem non habet in regno suo,</hi> as his words there
are<note n="b" place="margin">

cum par in parem non habet imperium,</hi> because he could not
have an <hi>Equal</hi> but with the loss of his Authority and Regal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
considering, that an <hi>Equal</hi> hath no power to command an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
Now lest you should object that is spoken of the King out
of times of <hi>Parliament,</hi> but that when once the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
are convened in <hi>Parliament,</hi> the case is otherwise. First, you
must think that had this Doctrine been on foot in the times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding,
it would have been a great impediment unto frequent
<hi>Parliaments;</hi> and that our King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as others) being very <hi>jealous</hi>
even of the smallest points of <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> would not admit of
<hi>Partners</hi> in the <hi>Crown Imperial,</hi> by the assembling of a <hi>Parliament,</hi>
having been used to reign alone without any <hi>Rivals.</hi> And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
you may call to mind, that even <hi>sedente Parliamento,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the sitting of the Court, the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>His Majesties most humble and obedient Subjects,</hi> which is not
only used as a stile of course in such <hi>Petitions</hi> as they use to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto him, (and by the way, 'tis not the use for men of <hi>equal</hi>
power to send <hi>Petitions</hi> unto one another) but it is the very
Phrase in some Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. c. 22, &amp;c.</note> for which I do refer you to
the Book at large. And if they be his <hi>Subjects,</hi> as they say they
be, they cannot be his <hi>Equals,</hi> as you say they are; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not <hi>coordinate</hi> with him, but <hi>subordinate</hi> to him; by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
the <hi>levying War</hi> against the King, no more excusable in
them than the meanest <hi>Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. <hi>Quest.</hi> You take great pains to make the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or
the two Houses, as you call them, to be guilty of <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>
against his Majesty without ground or reason. For
tell me seriously, think you the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath not power
to <hi>arm</hi> the people, and put them into a <hi>posture of defence</hi>
against the <hi>Enemies</hi> of the Kingdom, if they see occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, if the King do give consent, and that there be
such <hi>Enemies</hi> against whom to <hi>arm</hi> them. For properly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ordinary rules of <hi>Polities,</hi> there is no power of
raising Forces, and putting the People into <hi>Arms,</hi> but only in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40533:13"/>
the Prince or <hi>Supreme Magistrate.</hi> The <hi>Civil</hi> Laws have so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
it. <hi>Nulli prorsus, nobis insciis &amp; inconsultis, quorumlibet

               <note n="d" place="margin">Constitut. Valentin. &amp; Valent.</note>; let none presume to
<hi>levy</hi> Forces, whatsoever the pretence or occasion be, without
our privity or consent, saith the <hi>Constitution.</hi> If you consult
with the <hi>Divines,</hi> Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> a most Learned Father, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you thus, that the <hi>natural course and arts of</hi> Government
<hi>accommodated to the peace and welfare of us mortal men do require

               <hi>that all authority of making war and levying forces ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
only to the Prince.</hi> And if you please to look on <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton,</hi>
or any of the <hi>Lawyers</hi> of your Native Country, they will
tell you this, that the <hi>material sword</hi> is put into the hands of the
King by Almighty God,<note n="f" place="margin">Bract. <hi>l.</hi> 1. c. 8. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 4. &amp; l. 2. c. 24.</note> that by the <hi>material sword</hi> is meant a
power and right to look to the <hi>defence</hi> and preservation of the

<hi>association,</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Proclam. Feb. 16. 1642</note> or to raise a war without the Kings consent, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his will. And this the <hi>Houses,</hi> as it seems, understood
full well, when purposing to <hi>levy Forces</hi> to begin the War, they
took the <hi>Kings authority</hi> along for company, and raised them in
the name of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> the better to seduce the
People to a <hi>blinded Rebellion.</hi> As for the <hi>Enemies</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
against whom the Subjects were to <hi>arm</hi> themselves by the
appointment of the <hi>Houses,</hi> I can tell of none; no nor they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as I take it, unless they saw them in their dreams. And
for your <hi>posture of defence,</hi> as you please to phrase it, (besides
that I have proved before, that even <hi>defensive Arms</hi> are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
unlawful on the <hi>Subjects</hi> part) the <hi>war</hi> hath been <hi>offensive</hi>
plainly on the part of the Houses, which as it was contrived and
followed without the least colour of <hi>necessity</hi> to induce them to
it, so did it aim at nothing else than the destruction of the <hi>King,</hi>
and the alteration of the Government, which are the purpose
and design of all <hi>Rebellions,</hi> as before was told you.</p>
            <p>28. <hi>Quest.</hi> How prove you that the <hi>Parliament</hi> did begin the
war, that on their parts it was <hi>offensive,</hi> not <hi>defensive</hi> only,
or that they had a purpose to destroy the King? if you
can make this good you shall gain me to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40533:14"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This point hath been so agitated and discoursed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it were but labour lost to speak further in it. The <hi>Votes</hi> and
<hi>Orders</hi> of the Houses for putting the Kingdom into a <hi>posture of
war,</hi> the taking into their own hands the whole <hi>Militia</hi> of the
Kingdom, raising of Money, Men, and Horses, in all the
quarters of the Land, mustering their new-raised House and
Foot in <hi>Finsbury</hi>-fields, and <hi>Tuttle</hi>-fields, seizing upon the <hi>Arms</hi>
and <hi>Ammunition</hi> which the King had bought with his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and laid up in his own <hi>Magazines,</hi> before the King had
either money enough to pay a Soldier, powder enough to kill a
Bird, or Men enough about him to guard his Person from any
ordinary force and violence; what was all this but a <hi>beginning</hi> of
the <hi>war?</hi> and who did this but some prevailing Men in the two
Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> under the name and stile of the <hi>Lords</hi>
and <hi>Commons?</hi> Then for the <hi>managing</hi> of the war, if it had been
<hi>defensive</hi> only, as you say it was, what needed a Commission to
the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> to <hi>kill and slay</hi> all such as opposed their doings?
What needed they have sent some part of their Forces into
<hi>Hampshire,</hi> to pluck the Town of <hi>Portsmouth</hi> out of the Kings
hands, which by reason of the distance of it could not do them
hurt; another into <hi>Dorsetshire</hi> to beat the Marquess of <hi>Hertford</hi>
out of <hi>Sherborne</hi> Castle; a third, and that the greatest part as
far as <hi>Worcester,</hi> and beyond it, to find the King, and give
him battel before he was within an hundred Miles of them?
What needed they have sent their <hi>Emissaries</hi> into all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Kingdom, to put the People into <hi>Arms,</hi> in which
the King had neither Power nor Party that appeared for him;
or to exhaust the blood and treasure of this Nation, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of settling their own <hi>privileges</hi> and the Subjects <hi>liberties,</hi>
when the King offered more by his frequent Messages than
they had reason to expect? Doubtless they could pretend no
<hi>danger,</hi> as the case then stood, which might <hi>necessitate</hi> them to
take Arms in their own <hi>defence:</hi> and therefore now of late they
have changed their terms, and do not make the war <hi>defensive</hi>
meerly, but in part <hi>preventive.</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Merc. Brit.</hi> numb. 18, 19.</note> It seems their <hi>consciences</hi>
told them what they had deserved, and so for fear the King
might right himself upon them when he was of power, they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40533:14"/>
thought it best to strike the first blow and begin the Quarrel;
in hope to make such sure work of it, that he should never
strike the second. But to say truth, the War was not <hi>preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
neither on the Houses part, but a design that had been plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
long before, and was made ripe for execution, when there
was neither ground nor colour to possess the People with the
fancy, that the King intended force against them. For what
purpose else did Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig</hi> and M. <hi>Pym</hi> sojourn two years
together with Mr. <hi>Knightly,</hi> so near the habitation of the good
Lord <hi>Say?</hi> to what end held they correspondence with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
Party in the Country, and took such pains in can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassing
for <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> (when this present <hi>Parliament</hi>
was called) in most Counties, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Or to what end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
had the zealous Citizens so used themselves unto their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
frequented the <hi>Artillery</hi> Garden, and stored themselves
with Arms in so large a measure, but that they were resolved to
be in readiness when the time should come? This if it were not
a <hi>design,</hi> must be done by <hi>Prophecy,</hi> not in the way of a <hi>preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29. <hi>Quest.</hi> But to the other point you spake off, touching the
purpose which you say they had to <hi>destroy the King;</hi> can
you make any proof of that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I have already told you from the mouths of our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Lawyers, that all <hi>Rebellions</hi> aim at no other end then the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the King,</hi> and the change of Government; and that
this end was aimed at more especially in this particular <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
I shall tell you now, you cannot chuse but call to mind with
what heat and violence, multitudes of the <hi>rascal people,</hi> as they
flocked towards <hi>Westminster,</hi> clamoured against his Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
even at <hi>Whitehall</hi> Gates; and how seditiously they expressed
the secrets of their traitorous hearts: some saying openly as they
passed along, <hi>that the King was the Traitor;</hi> some, <hi>that the young
Prince would govern better;</hi> and others of a more transcendent
wickedness,<note n="l" place="margin">L. <hi>Digbies</hi> Apol. p. 13.</note> 
               <hi>that the King was not fit to live.</hi> Next look upon
these very Men, (for out of them the body of their Army was at
first compounded) trained to the Wars, well armed, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
furiously to find out the King, against whose Sacred Person,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40533:15"/>
and most precious life, they had before expressed such a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
malice. Then add to this, that when they came unto <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi>
they bent their Canon more especially, and spent the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of their shot and fury towards that part of the battel in
which (according unto that advertisement which the villain
<hi>Blague</hi> had given their General, a Man as full of discontent and
malice, as the worst amongst them) the King in Person, and
the two young Princes meant to be. Put this together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it with some subsequent passages which have been despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly
vented in the House of <hi>Commons</hi> (touching the <hi>deposition</hi> of
the <hi>King</hi>) without check or censure; and the inviting of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Nation to Invade this Kingdom, the better to effect their
business, and tell me, if you can, what is aimed at else, then
the <hi>destruction of the King,</hi> and his Royal Issue?</p>
            <p>30. <hi>Quest.</hi> I must confess you put me to it, but I must take some
time to consider of it, before I tell you what I think. In
the mean season I have one more doubt to propose unto
you, which if you can remove, I am wholly yours. The
name of <hi>Parliament</hi> is sacred to me, and I am loth to
scruple any of those actions, which receive countenance
and authority from the awful body. Can you make proof
that the Party which remains at <hi>Westminster</hi> have not the
full authority of the two <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Parliament?</hi> If you could
make that clear, then the work were done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I dare not take that task upon me; it is too invidious:
but I shall offer these few things to your consideration. First, it
would seriously be considered, Whether the <hi>King,</hi> whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
as the head of that awful body, gives life and motion to
the acts and results thereof, do purposely absent himself to make
their consultations <hi>frustrate</hi> and their meeting <hi>fruitless;</hi> or that
he hath been driven from them by force and violence? Secondly,
Whether such considerable numbers of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> as
are now absent from the <hi>Houses,</hi> have left the Houses and the
service, for no other reason than for <hi>compliance</hi> with the King,
and to serve his ends (in hope of getting honours and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by him,) or on the motion made by the <hi>rascal multitude,</hi> to
have the names of these given up, who <hi>Voted</hi> not with <hi>Say,</hi> and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40533:15"/>
               <hi>Pym,</hi> and other the <hi>good Members</hi> of both Houses? Thirdly,
What mischief would ensue both to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> If when the greater and sounder part
of <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>General Councils</hi> shall be driven away, either
by the threats and practices of the lesser, and the worse affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
the less and the worse affected part may have the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the whole body, and their actions countenanced by the
name thereof? Fourthly, Whether it be not one of the greatest
prejudices which the <hi>Protestants</hi> have against the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Histor Con<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Triden. Sleid. &amp; alii.</note> that it was held in an <hi>unsafe place,</hi> which they could not
come to without danger; and that the <hi>Prelates</hi> there assembled,
were so prelimited by the <hi>Popes</hi> instructions, or awed with an
<hi>Italian</hi> Guard which was set upon them, under pretence of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to their Persons, from affronts and injuries, that they had
neither freedom to debate the points which were there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
nor <hi>liberty</hi> of suffrage to <hi>determine</hi> of them? Fifthly,
Whether the <hi>King</hi> calling the <hi>expulsed</hi> Party of the <hi>Lords</hi> and
<hi>Commons</hi> to some other place, and <hi>summoning</hi> all the rest also to
assemble there, may not with greater reason take unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the name, the power, and reputation of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> than
the remaining party now at <hi>Westminster,</hi> consisting seldom of
above an hundred <hi>Commons,</hi> and sometimes not above <hi>three
Lords,</hi> have challenged and usurped the name of the <hi>two Houses?</hi>
Sixthly and lastly,—</p>
            <p>31. <hi>Quest.</hi> Hold, I must interupt you there. The King by
<hi>Writ</hi> appoints his <hi>Parliament</hi> to be held at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and
by a subsequent Act or <hi>Statute</hi> hath so bound himself, that
he can neither <hi>dissolve</hi> nor <hi>adjourn</hi> it without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
How can he then <hi>remove</hi> it to another place, than
that which was at first appointed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No doubt but he may do it with as good authority, as
the <hi>two Houses,</hi> or either of them may adjourn to <hi>London,</hi> which
you cannot choose but know hath been often done, since the
beginning of this Session. For tho they sit not there as <hi>Houses,</hi>
but by turning the either of the Houses into a <hi>Committee of the
whole House:</hi> yet this is but an Artifice to elude the <hi>Writ,</hi> and
act their business in a place of more advantage. The change is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40533:16"/>
only in the name, but the power the same. Witness those <hi>Votes</hi>
and <hi>Declarations</hi> which they have passed and published in the said
<hi>Committees,</hi> as binding and effectual to their ends and purposes, as
any thing transacted in the several <hi>Houses.</hi> Nor is the <hi>place</hi> so
necessary and essential unto the being of <hi>Parliament,</hi> but that the
<hi>major part</hi> with the Kings consent, may change it if they think
it profitable for the <hi>Common wealth.</hi> Otherwise we might say of
<hi>Parliaments,</hi> as once <hi>Victorinus</hi> did of Christians,<note n="l" place="margin">S. <hi>August. Confess.</hi> l. 8. c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ergone pariete;
faciunt Christianum?</hi> Is it the <hi>place</hi> and not the <hi>persons</hi> which
do make a <hi>Parliament?</hi> Or grant we, that of common course the
<hi>Houses</hi> cannot regularly be <hi>adjourned</hi> to another <hi>place,</hi> but the
<hi>adjournment</hi> must be made in the <hi>House</hi> it self; yet this is but a
<hi>circumstance,</hi> or at most a <hi>ceremony,</hi> not of the <hi>substance</hi> of the
work. And if that speech of <hi>Caesar</hi> carrieth any weight, (as all
wise Men conceive it doth) <hi>Legem necessitati cedere oportere,</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <hi>Val. Max.</hi> l. 3. c. 7. n. 3.</note> that
even the <hi>strictest Laws</hi> must yield to the <hi>necessities</hi> and uses of
the <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> no question but so slight a <hi>circumstance,</hi> as
that of <hi>place</hi> must needs be thought in the present business, is to
give way unto the peace and preservation of this wretched
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>32. <hi>Quest.</hi> These points I shall consider of as you have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised;
only at present I shall tell you, that I am very
well resolved of the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of this <hi>War</hi> against His
Majesty, and think them guilty of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> who either
laid the plot thereof, or have since pursued it. Tell me
now for the close of all, what punishment the <hi>Laws</hi> do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
on those who are <hi>convicted</hi> of so capital and abhorred
a crime?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> You cannot be so ignorant of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi>
as not to know, That a <hi>convicted Rebel</hi> is condemned to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
drawn, and quartered, his belly to be ripped up, and his bowels
to be taken out, whilest he is yet living, his head and limbs to be
advanced on some eminent places, for a terrible example unto
others, his blood attainted, his estate confiscate, his possessions
forfeited. The <hi>Civil Laws</hi> go somewhat further, and execute
them after death in their Coats of <hi>Arms,</hi> which are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
and razed, in what place soever they are found. <hi>Rebellium
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40533:16"/>
arma &amp; Insignia delenda sunt, ubicunque inveniuntur,</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Bartochinus in Repertorio aureo.</note> as <hi>Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
hath it. I end as I began with the Book of <hi>Homilies;</hi> "Turn
over and read the Histories of all Nations, look over the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi>
of our own Country, call to mind so many <hi>Rebellions</hi> of
old time, and some yet fresh in memory, ye shall not find that
God ever prospered any <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the natural and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Prince,</hi> but contrariwise, that the <hi>Rebels</hi> were overthrown
and slain, and such as were taken Prisoners dreadfully executed.
Consider the great and noble Houses of <hi>Dukes, Marquesses,
Earls,</hi> and other <hi>Lords,</hi> whose names ye shall read in our <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi>
now clean extinguished and gone, and seek out the
causes of the decay, you shall find that not lack of Issue and
Heirs Male hath so much wrought that decay, and waste of
noble Bloods and Houses, as hath <hi>Rebellion."</hi>
