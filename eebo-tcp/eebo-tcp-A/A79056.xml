            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E do fully agree without heſitation, that theſe Scriptures cited in the margin of your paper, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3. 3 <hi>Iohn</hi> 9 &amp; 10 do prove that the Apoſtles did ordeine Presbyters and Deacons, give rules concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſtian Diſcipline, and had power of exerciſing cenſures over Presbyters, and others. And that theſe places of Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10. do prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine Presbyters and Deacons, and to exerciſe cenſures over Presbyters and others. And that the ſecond, and third Chapters of the <hi>Revelation</hi> do prove; That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Churches had power of governing of the Churches, and exerciſing cenſures.</p>
            <p>But that either the Apoſtles, or <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> or the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches were Biſhops, as Biſhops are diſtinct from Presbyters, exerciſing Epiſcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that ſenſe. Or that the Apoſtles did commit and derive to any particular perſons as their ſubſtitutes, and ſucceſſors, any ſuch Epiſcopall Government: or that this is proved in the leaſt meaſure by the Scriptures alleaged, we do as fully deny. And therefore do humbly deny al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116881:4"/>
That Epiſcopall Government is therefore moſt conſonant to the word of God, and of Apoſtolicall inſtitution, or proved ſo to be by theſe Scriptures. None of theſe were Biſhops, or practiſed Epiſcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Biſhops are diſtinct from Presbyters. Neither is ſuch an Officer of the Church as a Biſhop diſtinct from a Presbyter to be found in the New Teſtament (by which wee humbly conceive, that our Faith, and Conſcience touching this poynt ought to be concluded.) The name Office, and Worke of Biſhop and Presbyter being one and the ſame in all things, and never in the leaſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht, as is clearly evident, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. 7. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in</hi> Creete, <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordaine Presbyters in every City; as I had appointed thee. For a Biſhop muſt be blameleſſe,</hi> In which place the Apoſtle his reaſoning were altogether invalid, and inconſequent; if Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Biſhop were not the ſame Office, as well as they have the ſame Name.</p>
            <p>The ſame is manifeſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 20 17. 28. And from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus</hi> hee ſent to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and called the Presbyters of the Church, to whom hee gave this charge, <hi>verſe</hi> 28. <hi>Take heede therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to feede and governe the Church of God. Where wee obſerve, That the Apoſtle being to leave theſe Presbyters, and never to <hi>ſee their faces more verſe</hi> 28. doth charge them with the feeding and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of the Church; as being Biſhops of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſts making. But that the Holy Ghoſt did make any ſuperiour, or higher kinde of Biſhops, than theſe common Presbyters is not to bee found in that, or any other Text.</p>

And that under the mouth of two or three witneſſes this aſſertion of ours may ſtand; we adde to what we have already ſaid, that in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. 2. <hi>The Presbyters which are among you, I exhort, who am alſo a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               </gap> uſed in this place, is expreſſed whatſoever work the Presbyters are to do. Neither can <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſo called, as above Presbyters, do more for the government and good of the Church otherwiſe, then is there expreſſely injoyned unto Presbyters. By all which that hath been ſaid the point is rendered to be moſt cleare to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt men, both ancient, and of later times. That there is no ſuch Officer to be found in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, as a Biſhop diſtinct from a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: neither doth the Scripture afford us the leaſt notice of any qualification required in a Biſhop, that is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Presbyter, nor any Ordination to the Office of a Biſhop, diſtinct from a Presbyter: nor any work or duty charged upon a Biſhop, which Presbyters are not enjoyned to do: nor any greater honour or dignity put upon them. For that <hi>double honour</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. as due to Presbyters that rule well, is with a note of <hi>(eſpecially)</hi> affixed to that Act or work of labouring in the <hi>word and doctrine,</hi> which is not that Act wherein Biſhops have challenged a ſingularity, or peculiar eminency above the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>To that which Your Majeſty doth conceive, <hi>That Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall government was practiſed by Apoſtles themſelves.</hi> We humbly anſwer, That the Apoſtles as they were the higheſt Officers of the Church of Chriſt: ſo they were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116881:5"/>
extraordinary in reſpect of their commiſſion, gifts, and office, and diſtinguiſht from all other Officers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Prophets, thirdly, Teachers,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11. <hi>Chriſt gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> Where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles are diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> who are the ordinary Officers of the Church for preaching the word, and government. That they had power and authority to ordaine Church Officers, and to exerciſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in all Churches, we affirm, and withall, that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons, or Officers of the Church may challenge or aſſume to themſelves ſuch power in that reſpect alone, <hi>becauſe the Apoſtles practiſed it.</hi> Except ſuch power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them in common, as well as to the Apoſtles, by warrant of the Scripture. For that government which they practiſed was Apoſtolicall, according to the peculiar commiſſion, and authority which they had, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be called Epiſcopal, than as their Office was ſo comprehenſive, as they had power to do the work of any, or all other Church Officers, in which reſpect they call themſelves <hi>Presbyteri, Diaconi,</hi> (but never <hi>Epiſcopi</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſenſe) and therefore we humbly crave leave to ſay, that to argue the Apoſtles to have practiſed Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Government, becauſe they ordeined other Officers, and exerciſed cenſures, is, as if we ſhould argue a Juſtice of Peace to be a Conſtable, becauſe he doth that which a Conſtable doth in ſome particulars. Its manifeſt that the Office of Biſhops and Presbyters were not diſtinct in the Apoſtles. They did not act as Biſhops in ſome Acts, and as Presbyters in other Acts. The diſtinction of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Biſhops being made by men in after times.</p>
            <p>

And whereas your Majeſty doth conceive that the Epiſcopall Government was by the Apoſtles committed and derived to particular perſons, as their Subſtitutes, or Succeſſors therein, <hi>as for ordeining Presbyters and Deacons, giving rules concerning Chriſtian diſcipline, and exerciſing cenſures over Presbyters and others.</hi> Seeming by the alledged places of Scripture, to inſtance in <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the Angels of the Churches. We humbly anſwer, and firſt, to that of <hi>Timothy and Titus.</hi> We grant that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had Authority, and power of ordaining Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons, and of exerciſing cenſures over Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and others: though we cannot ſay they had this power as the Apoſtles Subſtitutes, or Succeſſors in Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government; nor that they exerciſed the power they had, as being Biſhops in the ſenſe of your Majeſty, but as extraordinary Officers, or Evangeliſts, which Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts were an office in the Church diſtinct from Paſtors, and Teachers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. and that they were Evangeliſts, it appears by their being ſent up and downe by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, or taken along with them in company to ſeverall Churches, as the neceſſity, and occaſion of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es did require; The One of them being expreſſely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 5. And neither of them being any where in Scripture called <hi>Biſhop.</hi> Neither were they fixed to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> as Biſhops in the Churches committed to them: but removed from thence to other places, and never, for ought appears in Scripture, returned to them againe. And it ſeems cleare to us, that neither their abode at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> was for any long time, nor ſo intended by the Apoſtle. For he imploys them there upon occaſionall buſineſſe, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116881:6"/>
expreſſes himſelfe in <hi>ſuch manner, (I beſought thee to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſtill at</hi> Epheſus <hi>when I went into</hi> Macedonia, <hi>that thou mightſt charge ſome, that they teach no other doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 3. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Greete,</hi> Tit. 1. 5.) as doth not carry the fixing, or conſtituting of a Biſhop in a place as a perpetuall Governour. And it is as manifeſt, that they were both of them called away from theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Do thy diligence to come to me ſhortly,</hi> Tit. 3. 12. <hi>Be diligent to come to me to</hi> Nicopolis. So that they may as well be called Biſhops of other Cities, or Churches, where they had any conſiderable abode, as they are pretended to have beene of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Greete.</hi> As they are called by the <hi>Poſcripts</hi> of thoſe Epiſtles, the credit of which <hi>Poſtſcripts</hi> we cannot build upon in this point.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To that of the <hi>Angels of the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The miniſters of the Churches are called <hi>Starres, and Angels,</hi> which denominations are metaphoricall, and in <hi>a myſtery,</hi> Rev. 1. 20. <hi>the myſtery of the ſeven Starres, Angels,</hi> in reſpect of their miſſion, or ſending. <hi>Starres</hi> in reſpect of their Station, and ſhining. And it ſeems ſtrange to us, that to ſo many expreſſe Teſtimonyes of Scripture, an Allegoricall denomination, or myſtery ſhould be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Theſe Angels being no where called <hi>Biſhops</hi> in vulgar acceptation, nor the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> uſed in any of <hi>Johns</hi> writings, who cals himſelfe <hi>Presbyter.</hi> Nor any mention of ſuperiority of one Presbyter to another, but in <hi>Diotrephes</hi> affecting it. And as to that which may be ſaid, that the <hi>Epiſtles are directed to one,</hi> we anſwer, that a number of perſons, are in the myſterious, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick writings expreſſed in ſingulars, and we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, that being written in an Apoſtolary Style,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116881:6"/>
(for they are as letters or Epiſtles to the Churches,) theſe writings are directed as letters to collective Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative bodies uſe to be. That is, to one, but intended &amp; meant to that body in meeting aſſembled; which that they were ſo intended is cleare to us, both becauſe there were in <hi>Epheſus</hi> Biſhops and Presbyters, one and the ſame, to whom the Apoſtle at his farewell commendeth the Government of the Church: And by divers expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in theſe Epiſtles, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>To you and to the reſt in</hi> Thyatyra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which diſtinction of <hi>you and the reſt,</hi> we conceive the particular Governours, (which were more then one) and the people to be ſignified. And ſo cannot conſent that any ſingular perſon had majority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the reſt, or ſole power of exerciſing Church Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Government ſpoken of in theſe Chapters.</p>
            <p>Having thus (as we humbly conceive) proved by pregnant places of Scripture compared together, that the Apoſtles themſelves did not inſtitute, or practiſe Epiſcopall Government, nor commit and derive it to particular perſons, as their ſubſtitutes, or ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors therein. Wee ſhall in farther diſcharge of our duty to, and for the more cleare, and full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Majeſty in this point, briefely declare into what Officers hands the ordinary and ſtanding Offices of the Church were tranſmitted, and derived by &amp; from the Apoſtles. The Apoſtles had no ſucceſſors <hi>in eundem gradum:</hi> the Apoſtolicall Office was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by ſucceſſion, being inſtituted by Chriſt by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary &amp; ſpecial Commiſſion. But for the ordinary and ſtanding uſe and ſervice of the Church, there were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained only two Orders of Officers, viz. <hi>Biſhops and Deacons,</hi> which the Apoſtle expreſſeth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. To
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116881:7"/>
               <hi>all the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus which are at Philippi, with the Biſhops and Deacons;</hi> And onely of them doth the Apoſtle give the due Characters of Officers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. 8. From both which places of Scripture we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with ancient Expoſitors both Greek and Latin, that Biſhops are the ſame with Presbyters, and beſides Presbyters, there is no mention of any other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that of Deacons. Of both which Orders in the Apoſtles times, there were in one City more then one, as in <hi>Philippi</hi> and <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And we humbly offer to your Majeſty as obſervable; That though one Order might be ſuperiour to another Order, yet in the ſame Order of Officers, there was not any one ſuperiour to others of the ſame Order: No Apoſtle was above an Apoſtle; No Evangeliſt above an Evangeliſt; No Presbyter above a Presbyter; No Deacon above a Deacon. And ſo we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this part, That ſince Church Officers are inſtituted, and ſet in the Church by God, or Chriſt Jeſus, and that Ordination by, or in which the Office is conveyed, is of no other Officers, but of Presbyters and Deacons. Therefore there are no other Orders of ordinary and ſtanding Officers in the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As for the ages immediatly ſucceeding the Apoſtles, we anſwer. Firſt, Our Faith reaches no farther than the holy Scriptures. No humane teſtimony can beget any more than a humane faith. Secondly, we anſwer, That it is agreed upon by learned men, as well ſuch as contend for Epiſcopacy, as others, that the times immediately ſucceeding the Apoſtles are very dark in reſpect of the Hyſtory of the Church. Thirdly, That the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Record of thoſe times gives cleare teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to our aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Epiſtle of <hi>Clements</hi> to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116881:7"/>
               <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who reciting the Orders of Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, expreſely limits them to two, <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and them, whom in one place he calls Biſhops; he alwayes afterwards nameth Presbyters. The Epiſtles of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> pretend to the next antiquity, but are by ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as wholly ſpurious, and proved by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>edelius</hi> to be ſo mixed, that it is hard, it not impoſſible, to know what part of them are genuine: Beſides, Biſhop <hi>Vſher</hi> in his late obſervations on them Chap. 18. page 138. confeſſes, that of the twelve of his Epiſtles, ſix are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, the other ſixe mixt, and none of them in every reſpect to be accounted ſincere and genuine. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We grant, That not long after the Apoſtles times, Biſhops in ſome ſuperiority to Presbyters are by the writers of thoſe times reported to be in the Church; But they were ſet up not as a Divine Inſtitution, but as an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clefiaſticall, as afterwards both Arch Biſhops, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs were; which is cleare by Doctor <hi>Reinolds</hi> his Epiſtle to Sir <hi>Francis Knowles,</hi> wherein he ſhewes out of Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> That <hi>Ambroſe, Chryſoſtome, Jerome, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and many more holy Fathers, together with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> agree, that by the word of God there is no difference between a Biſhop and a Presbyter. And that <hi>Medina</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> affirmes not onely the ſame Fathers, but alſo another <hi>Jerome, Theodoret, Primaſius, Sedulius,</hi> and <hi>Theophytact,</hi> to be of the ſame judgement. And that with them agree <hi>Oecumenius; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and another <hi>Anſelme, Gregory</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> and after them many others; That it was inrolled in the Canon-Law for ſound and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrine; and publikely taught by learned men. And addes, that all who have laboured in the Reformation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116881:8"/>
of the Church for theſe 500. years have taught that all Paſtors, be they entituled Biſhops, or Prieſts, have equal authority and power by Gods word. The ſame way goes <hi>Lumbard</hi> Maſter of the Sentences, and Father of the Schoolmen, who ſpeaking of Presbyters, and Deacons, ſaith, The Primitive Church had thoſe Orders onely, and that we have the Apoſtles precept for them alone. With him agree many of the moſt eminent in that kind, and generally all the Canoniſts. To theſe we may adde <hi>Sextus Senenſis,</hi> who teſtifies for himſelf, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. And <hi>Caſſander,</hi> who was called by one of the Germame Emperours as one of ſingular ability, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, to inform him, and reſolve his conſcience in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of that nature; who ſaid, It is agreed among all, that in the Apoſtles times, there was no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Biſhop, and a Presbyter. For a concluſion, we adde, that the Doctrine which we have herein propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to your Majeſty concerning the Identity of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Biſhops and Presbyters, is no other then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine publiſhed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. 1543. <hi>for all his ſubjects to receive, ſeen and allowed by the Lords both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and temporal, with the nether Houſe of Parl.</hi> Of theſe two Orders onely (ſo ſaith the Book) That is to ſay, <hi>Preiſts and Deacons,</hi> Scripture maketh expreſſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and how they were conferred of the Apoſtles by Prayer, and Impoſition of hands. By all which it ſeems evident, that the Order of Epiſcopacie, as diſtinct from Presbytery, is but an Eccleſiaſticall Inſtitution, and therefore not unalterable.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; we anſwer. That Epiſcopall Government which at firſt obteined in the Church, did really and ſubſtancially differ from the Epiſcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116881:8"/>
which the Honorable Houſes of Parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the abolition of. The Biſhop of thoſe times was one preſiding, &amp; joyning with the Preſbytery of his Church, ruling with them, and not without them. Either crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made by the Preſbyters chooſing out one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, as in <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or choſen by the Church, and confirmed by three, or more of his neighbours of like dignity within the ſame precinct; leſſer towns, and villages had, and might have Biſhops in them, as well as populous and eminent Cities, untill the Councel of <hi>Sardis</hi> decreed, <hi>that villages, and ſmall Cities ſhould have no Biſhops, leaſt the name, and authority of a Biſhop might thereby come into contempt.</hi> But of one claming as his due, and right to himſelfe alone, as a ſuperior order, or degree, all power about ordination of Presbyters, and Deacons, and all juriſdiction, either to exerciſe himſelfe, or delegate to whom he will of the Laity or Clergy, (as they diſtinguiſh) according to the Judgement and Practice of thoſe in our times, wee read not till in the latter and corrupter ages of the Church.</p>
            <q>By all which it appears, that the preſent Hierarchy, the abolition whereof is deſired by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſes, may accordingly be aboliſhed, and yet poſſibly the Biſhop of thoſe Primitive times be. They are ſo farre differing one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</q>
            <p>In anſwer to that part of your Majeſties Paper, wherein you require whether <hi>our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did ſo leave the Church at liberty, as they might total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:116881:9"/>
               <hi>alter or change the Church Government at their pleaſure.</hi> We humbly conceive that there are ſubſtantials belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to Church Government, ſuch as are appointed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which are not in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es liberty to alter at pleaſure. But as for <hi>Arch-biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> We hope it will appear unto your Majeſties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that they are none of the Church Governours appointed by our Saviour and his Apoſtles. And we beſeech your Majeſty to look rather to the Originall of them, then Succeſſion.</p>
