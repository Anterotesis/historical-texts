            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ioptrical Glasses (which are now wrought up to that height and curiosity we see) are but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Invention: Antiquity gives us not the least hint thereof, neither do their Records furnish us with any thing that does Antedate our late discoveries of the <hi>Telescope,</hi> or <hi>Microscope.</hi> The want of which
<pb facs="tcp:58849:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
incomparable Artifice made them not onely erre in their fond Coelestial Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, and Crystalline wheel-work of the Heavens above us, but also in their nearer Observations of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Bodies and smallest sort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures about us, which have been by them but sleightly and perfunctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly described, as being the disregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pieces and huslement of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; when (alas!) those sons of Sense were not able to see how cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously the minutest things of the world are wrought, and with what eminent signatures of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they were inrich'd and embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
<pb facs="tcp:58849:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without our Dioptrical assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Neither do I think that the Aged world stands now in need of Spectacles, more than it did in its primitive Strength and Lustre: for howsoever though the faculties of the soul of our Primitive father <hi>Adam</hi> might be more quick &amp; perspicacious in Apprehension, than those of our lapsed selves; yet certainly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Adam's</hi> Organs was not divers from ours, nor different from those of his Fallen Self, so that he could never discern those distant, or minute objects by Natural Vision, as we do by the Artificial advantages of
<pb facs="tcp:58849:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Telescope</hi> and <hi>Microscope.</hi> So that certainly the secondary Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> and his Ansulary appearances, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae Solis,</hi> and Lunations of the inferiour Planets, were as obscure to him as unknown to his Posterity; onely what he might ingeniously ghess at by the Analogie of things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and some other advantageous Circumstances.</p>
            <p>And as those remote objects were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of his natural Opticks, so doubtless the Minute Atoms and Particles of matter, were as unknown to him, as they are yet unseen by us: for
<pb facs="tcp:58849:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
certainly both his and our Eyes were framed by providence in Analogie to the rest of our senses, and as might best manage this particular Engine we call the Body, and best agree with the place of our habitation (the earth and elements we were to converse with) and not to be critical specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, surveyors, and adaequate judges of the immense Vniverse: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath often seem'd to me beyond an ordinary probability, and somthing more than fancy (how paradoxical soever the conjecture may seem) to think, that the least Bodies we are able to see with our naked eyes, are
<pb facs="tcp:58849:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but middle proportionals (as it were) 'twixt the greatest and smallest Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in nature, which two Extremes lye equally beyond the reach of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane sensation: For as on the one side they are but narrow souls, and not worthy the name of Philosophers, that think any Body can be too great or too too vast in its dimensions; so likewise, are they as inappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, and of the same litter with the former, that on the other side think the particles of Matter may be too little, and that nature is stinted at an Atom, and must have a <hi>non ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> of her subdivisions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58849:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Such, I am sure, our Modern En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine (the <hi>Microscope</hi>) wil ocular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince and unlearn them their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions again: for herein you may see what a subtil divider of matter Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is; herein we can see what the illustrious wits of the Atomical and Corpuscularian Philosophers durst but imagine, even the very Atoms and their reputed Indivisibles and least realities of Matter, nay the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mechanism and organical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of those Minute Animals, with their distinct parts, colour, figure and motion, whose whole bulk were to them almost invisible: so that
<pb facs="tcp:58849:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were <hi>Aristotle</hi> now alive, he might write a new History of Animals; for the first Tome of <hi>Zoography</hi> is still wanting, the Naturalists hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to having onely described unto us the larger and more voluminous sort of Animals, as Bulls, Bears, Tygers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilst they have regardlesly pass'd by the Insectile <hi>Automata,</hi> (those Living-exiguities) with only a bare mention of their names, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in these prety Engines (by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Stenography</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence) are lodged all the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the largest Animals; they have the same organs of body, multiplicity
<pb facs="tcp:58849:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of parts, variety of motions, diversity of figures, severality of functions with those of the largest size: and that which augments the miracle, is, that all these in so narrow a room neither interfere nor impede one another in their operations. Who therefore with the Learned <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Brown,</hi> Relig. Med.</note> Doctor, admires not <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> his Fly beyond his Eagle, and wonders not more at the operation of two souls in those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute bodies, than but one in the trunk of a Cedar? Ruder heads stand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at those prodigious and Colossean pieces of Nature, as Whales, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and Dromedaries; but in these
<pb facs="tcp:58849:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
narrow Engines there is more curious Mathematicks, and the Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of these little Fabricks more neatly set forth the wisdom of their Maker.</p>
            <p>Now as Matter may be great or little, yet never shrink by subdivision into nothing; so, is it not probable, that Motion also may be indefinitely swift or slow, and yet never come to a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escency? and so consequently there can be no rest in Nature, more than a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity in Matter. The following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations seem to make out, that the Minute particles of most (if not all) Bodies are constantly in some kind
<pb facs="tcp:58849:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of motion, and that motion may be both invisibly and unintelligibly slow, as well as swift, and probably is as unseparable an attribute to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as well as Extension is.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if the very nature of fluidity consist in the Intestine motion of the parts of that Body call'd fluid, as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> happily supposed, and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Boyle</hi> has more happily demonstrated, Why may we not be bold both to think and say, that there is no such thing in the World as an absolute quiescence? for <hi>1.</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the World (<hi>viz.</hi> the aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Medium (wherein all the Stars
<pb facs="tcp:58849:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Planets do swim) is now confess'd by all to be fluid, and so, consequently, in a Perpetual Motion. <hi>2.</hi> All the fixed lights of Heaven are generally concluded to be pure Fire, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently fluid also, and then subcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially in motion also; not to mention the dinetical Rotations of their whole Bodies, which every one is supposed to have, as wel as our Sun: and as for the Opace and Planetary Bodies of the Vniverse, they are all porous, and the aetherial Matter is continually streaming through them, their internal fire and heat constantly subliming Atoms out of them, the
<pb facs="tcp:58849:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Magnetical Atoms continually play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them: Not to mention also their dinetical Motions about their own Axes, and circumrevolutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their central Suns: so that, Is it not, I say, more than probable, that rest and quiescency is a meer Peripateti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notion, and that the supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (who is Activity it self) never made any thing inactive or utterly devoid of Motion?</p>
            <p>Hence wil unavoidable follow some other Principles of the ever-to-be-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired <hi>Des-Cartes:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That as Matter is made greater or less, by addition or subduction of
<pb facs="tcp:58849:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
parts, so is Motion made swifter or slower by addition given to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, by other contiguous Bodies more swiftly moving, or by subduction of it by Bodies slowlier moved.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> As the parts of Matter can be transfer'd from one Body to another, and as long as they remain united, would remain so for ever: so Motion may be translated from one Body to another; but when it is not transfer'd, it would remain in that Body for ever.</p>
            <p>But these sublime Speculations I shall with more confidence treat of in another place; the Speculation of Motion, and its Origin, being, as I
<pb facs="tcp:58849:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conceive, one of the obscurest things in Nature.</p>
            <p>And therfore at present we shal keep within the compass of the <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,</hi> and look at nothing further than what we can discover therein: The knowledge of Man (saith the learn'd <hi>Verulam</hi>) hath hitherto been determin'd by the view or sight, so that whatsoever is invisible, either in respect of the fineness of the Body it self, or the smalness of the parts, or of the subtilty of its motion, is little enquired; and yet these be the things that govern Nature principally: How much therefore are we oblig'd to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

Industry, that of late hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd this advantageous Artifice of Glasses, and furnish'd our necessities with such artificial Eys, that now nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fineness of the Body, nor the smalness of the parts, nor the subtilty of its motion, can secure them from our discovery? And indeed, if the Diop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks further prevail, and that dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Art could but perform what the Theorists in Conical sections demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, we might hope, ere long, to see the Magnetical Effluviums of the Loadstone, the Solary Atoms of light (or <hi>globuli aetherei</hi> of the renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>) the springy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

of Air, the constant and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary motion of the Atoms of all fluid Bodies, and those infinite, insensible Corpuscles (which daily produce those prodigious (though common) effects amongst us:) And though these hopes be vastly hyperbolical, yet who can tel how far Mechanical Industry may prevail; for the process of Art is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and who can set a <hi>non-ultra</hi> to her endevours?

                     <p>How critical is Nature in all her works! that to so small and contemptible an Animal hath given such an

exquisite fabrick of the eye, even to the distinction of parts.</p>
                     <p>Had our famous <hi>Muffet</hi> but seen them, he would not have spoke so doubtfully as he did: <hi>Oculos</hi> (saith he, speaking of Flea's) <hi>habere, verisimile est, tÃ¹m quod suos eligunt recessus, tÃ¹m quod appetente luce so subducunt.</hi> He has also a very long neck, jemmar'd like the tail of a Lobstar, which he could nimbly move any way; his head, body, and limbs also, be all of blackish armour-work, shining and polished with jemmar's, most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently contrived for the nimble motion of all the parts: nature having armed him thus <hi>Cap-a-pe</hi> like a Curiazier in warr, that he might not be hurt by the great leaps he takes; to which purpose also he hath so excellent an eye, the better to look before he leap: to which add this advantageous contrivance of the joynts of his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der legs which bend backwards towards his belly, and the knees or flexure of his fore-legs forwards (as in most quadrupeds) that he might thereby take a better rise when he leaps. His feet are slit into claws or talons, that he might the better stick to what he lights upon: he hath also two pointers before which grow out of the forehead, by which he tryes and feels all objects, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be edible or no. His neck, body, and limbs are also all beset with hairs and bristles, like so many Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes, as if his armour was palysado'd about by them. At his snout is fixed a Proboscis, or hollow trunk or probe, by which he both punches the skin, and sucks the blood through it, leaving that central spot in the middle of the Flea-biting, where the probe entred.</p>
                     <p>One would wonder at the great strength lodged in so small a Receptacle, and that he is not able onely to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his whole armour about him, but will frisk and curvet

so nimbly with it: Stick a large brass pin through his tayl and he will readily drag it away. I have seen a chain of gold (at <hi>Tredescants</hi> famous reconditory of Novelties) of three hundred links, though not above an inch long, both fastned to, and drawn away by a Flea. Such a like one it seems as our <hi>Muffet</hi> tells that one <hi>Marcus</hi> an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-man</hi> made.

                     <p>THe eye of a Bee is of a protuberant oval figure, black and all foraminulous, drill'd full of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble holes like a Grater or Thimble; and, which is more wonderful, we could plainly see, that the holes were all of a square figure like an honey-comb, and stuck full of small hairs (like the pores in our skin) and which (by blowing upon) you might see waft to and fro; all which neat particularities were more palpably discovered in the eye of a great Humble-Bee. Now these holes were not absolute perforations, but onely dimples in their crusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58849:15"/>
                        <hi>Tunica Cornea;</hi> which it seems is full of little pit-holes, like the cap of a thimble: for we cutt out the eye in a large Humble-Bee and Crecket, and bared the shell or horney coat of the eye; and laying either the convex or concave side upwards (upon the object plate) I could easily perceive the little holes or dimples formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. So that, by the favour of our <hi>Microscope,</hi> I have seen more in one hour then that famous Bee-master <hi>Aristomachus</hi> did in his fifty years contemplation of those Laborious Insects.</p>
                     <p>If you divide the Bee (or Humble-Bee especially) near the neck, you shall, without help of the glasse, see the heart beat most lively, which is a white pulsing vesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. The stings in all Bees are hollow and tubulous (like a Shoomaker's-punch) so that when they prick the flesh, they do also, through that channel, transfuse the poyson into it: For if you take a Bee, Wasp, or Humble-Bee especially, and gently squeeze her tayl, so that you may see the sting, you shall perceive a drop of diaphanous liquor at the very end of it, which if you wipe off, you shall distinctly see it renewed again, that humour passing down the Cavity into the end thereof. But if you would see their Common-wealth, Laws, Customs, Military Discipline, and their skill in Tacticks and Architecture, then read our English <hi>Butler,</hi> an experimental and not Theoretical writer on that subject.</p>

                     <p>IT is a very pleasant Insect to behold: her body is as it were from head to tayl studded with silver and black
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58849:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Armour, stuck all over with great black Bristles, like Porcupine quills, set all in parallel order, with their ends pointing all towards the tayl; her wings look like a Sea-fan with black thick ribs or fibers, dispers'd and branch'd through them, which are webb'd between with a thin membrane or film, like a slice of Muscovy-glasse: She hath a small head which she can move or turn any way: She hath six legs, but goes onely but upon four; the two foremost she makes use of instead of hands, with which you may often see her wipe her mouth and nose, and take up any thing to eat. The other four legs are cloven and arm'd with little clea's or tallons (like a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount) by which she layes hold on the rugosities and asperities of all bodies she walks over, even to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of her self, though with her back downwards and perpendicularly invers'd to the Horizon. To which purpose also the wisdom of Nature hath endued her with another singular Artifice, and that is a fuzzy kinde of substance like little sponges, with which she hath lined the soles of her feet, which substance is always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated with a whitish viscous liquor<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> which she can at pleasure squeeze out, and so sodder and be-glew her self to the plain she walks on, which otherways her gravity would hinder (were it not for this contrivance) especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when she walks in those inverted positions.</p>
                     <p>But of all things her eyes are most remarkable, being exceeding large, ovally protuberant and most neatly dimpled with innumerable little cavities like a small gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or thimble, through which seeming perforations you may see a faint reddish colour (which is the blood in the eyes, for if you prick a pin through the eye, you shall finde more blood there, then in all the rest of her body.) The like foraminulous perforations or trelliced eyes are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58849:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in all Flyes, more conspicuously in Carnivorous or Flesh-Flyes, in the Stercorary or Yellow Flyes that feed upon Cow-dung: The like eyes I have also found in divers other Insects, as the Shepherd-flye or Spinster-flye, which <hi>Muffet</hi> calls <hi>Opilionum Muscam;</hi> also in <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> or French-Flyes; also in all sorts of Scarabees, black and spotted; also in all sorts of Moth-flyes, called by <hi>Muffet, Phalaenae-papiliones</hi>; also in the May-Fly, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-flyes, Scorpion-tail'd-fly, Twinges, and Earwigs; most clearly in the sloe-black eye of the Crecket, and in the large eye of the Dragon-fly or Adderbolt. Many more observables there are in Common Flyes, as their Vivacity; for, when they appear desperate and quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of their forms, by virtue of the Sun or warm ashes they will be revoked into life, and perform its functions again.</p>

that it looks like green silk Irish-stitch, drawn upon a black ground, and all latticed or chequered with dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples like Common Flyes, which makes the Indentures look more pleasantly: Her body looks like silver in frost-work, onely fring'd all over with white silk: Her legs all joynted and knotted like the plant call'd <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setum</hi> or Horse-tayl, and all hairy and slit at the ends into two toes, both which are lined with two white sponges or fuzballs as is pre-observ'd in Common Flyes.

For the wings of the Butterfly seem like a great plume of feathers, with a glystering splendour exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to behold, especially if the wings be strip'd with several colours: yea that small meal and dust of their wings (which sticks to your fingers when you catch them) is all small little feathers, which grow out of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58849:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their wings; and you may plainly see the twills by which they stick to the wings, and the holes in the wings, out of which they were pluck'd. Nature having imp'd her wings (for her better flight) with those plumeous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescences; which shews how vastly <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Brown <hi>in his Vulgar Errors.</hi>
                        </note> they were mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that held this mealy dust to be an exudation of atoms out of their wings.</p>
                     <p>Her eye is large and globular (but somewhat flattish) white like Alablaster, diced or bespeck'd here and there with black spots (like checker'd Marble) all foraminous, both the white and black parts of it. I mean in a white Butterfly, for in a red-wing'd Butterfly, her eye is all black and full of perforations as in a Common Fly.</p>
                     <p>The Probe (which you see lyes in her mouth in spiral contorsions, wound up like a spring, or like the twining tendrils of the Vine, and which you may with a pin draw out to its full length) seems to be hollow, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the office both of Mouth and Tongue: for you shall see it (if cutt out and laid on the object-plate) to winde and coyl it self up like a Spring, and then open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a long time together, and to have a transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinde of hollownesse quite throughout. Nature having made it of a considerable length (when extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that she might reach her nourishment, else the length of her legs would hinder the stooping of her head: She hath also fitted it with that spiral or cochleary contrivance, that so being drawn up into an Helix, and retracted into the mouth, it might be no hinderance to her flight.</p>

Her two eyes were like two black beads, gogled and protuberant, standing somewhat backwards on the side of her head behind her horns: She is blackish about the shoulders; if she be laid on her back, you may perceive her body to be of Escallop'd protuberances, diaphanous also, very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to behold. In this supine position of hers, there are two bloody darkish spots discernable, the greater in the midst of her body, and the lesser towards her tayl. In the Centre of the middle spot there is a white Film or Bladder, which continually contracts and dilates its self upwards and downwards from the head towards the tayl; and alwayes after every pulse of this white particle or vesicle, then followes the pulse of the great dark bloody spot, in which, or over which, the vesicle seems to swim. This we observ'd two or three hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as long as the Louse lived; and this motion of <hi>Systole</hi> and <hi>Diastole</hi> is most palpably seen, when the Louse grows feeble and weak.

                     <p>They have a very puffy light body of an Oval figure, covered with a sleek thin skin: which they change once a moneth, sayes <hi>Muffet</hi>; though I hardly believe they cast their spoils so often.</p>
                     <p>Their skin is not pellucid, for I could never discover any pulsing particle within them: She hath eight legs, four on each side, split into small oblong fingers at the ends, by which she makes her curious Web-work Both body and limbs is all stuck over with small silver hairs, which the very ayr will waft to and fro, as you may see in the <hi>Microscope.</hi>

perfectly taper-grown. And (which is most admirable) we could most distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly see six, in some eight eyes, ranged in this order; the innermost least, and the outermost greatest, of a very quick and lively transparency or fulgour, like Eagle's eyes; every Eye hath a pale yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low circle, which encompasseth a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-blew Pupill, most clear and most admirable, but not perforated at all. Letting her lye on the object-plate for half an hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we perceived her Eyes all of them to grow less and less, and a whitish kind of film or socket, by degrees, to cover part of them: I cutt her in the midst at first, and so layd onely her head with the upper part of her body, on the object-plate.</p>

                     <p>She had before, two claws (at a manifest distance from her head) just like a Crab's claws, with two black tips, like the Chely's in Crabs, which I could distinctly see to open and shutt (exactly like those in a Scorpion) which were indented, or made<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Saw-wise on the inside (the better to keep fast what she had once laid hold on.)</p>
                     <p>There is a Field-Spider of a russet colour and long legs, of the same shape and figure.</p>

                     <p>I Took a Field-Spider under a stone, 13. of <hi>June,</hi> with a bag of eggs fastned to her tayl, bigger than all the bulk of her body; I opened it, and saw abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of blewish eggs in it, which in the <hi>Microscope</hi> look'd white and round, like your counterfeit pearl, and I could most clearly see abundance of very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Spiders, newly hatch'd, no bigger, and just like Mites in Meal, with white hairs and bristles, especially in their tail, creeping and crawling amongst the eggs: The Nett-work of the Purse or Bag seem'd all dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous; a very pleasant spectacle, and of curious workmanship.</p>
                     <p>I then made the like Observation of a bag full of House-Spider-eggs, which are round and white, just like white Poppy seed; and all things look'd whitish, and something Transparent therein also: but the youngling Spiders (that were either hatching, or new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hatch'd) were far bigger then the former, and white as Alablaster, but shap'd like the Parent with five legs on each side (without hairs or bristles) and not by far so active as the other.

I could perfectly see the divisions of the head, neck, and body. To the small end of the oval Body was fastned the head, very little in proportion to the body, its mouth like that of a Mole, which it open'd and shutt; when open'd, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd red within: The eyes also, like two little dark spots, are discernable: Near to the head were four legs fastned, two on each side; the legs were just like to those in a Louse, Jemmar'd and Transparent: She has two little pointers at the snout; nay, you may see them sometimes, if you happily take the advantage, like so many <hi>Ginny-Pigs,</hi> munching and chewing the cud: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the head and tail are stuck long hairs or bristles: Some we could see (as little, even in the Glass, as a Mustard-seed) yet perfectly shap'd and organiz'd: We also saw divers Atoms somewhat Transparent like eggs, both in form and figure. Nay, in these moving Atoms, I could not onely see the long bristles formerly specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but also the very hairs which grew out of their leggs, which leggs themselves are smaller than the smallest

Her tayl is all jemmar'd with Annulary divisions, which at last end in a stump, which she often draws up, or thrusts out, at her pleasure.</p>

Cap.</hi> 16. <hi>pag.</hi> 122.</note> That first it creepeth, then leapeth, and at last flyeth. She has two blackish claws, or pounces (at the ends of her feet,) which she can open and shut at her pleasure: We could discover no mouth at all, but a long reddish Probe, between the fore-legs, through which, perchance, she suck'd her froathy nourishment.</p>
                     <p>Now, what this spumeous matter is, and into what A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal this Insect is at last shaped or transpeciated, are Doubts that as yet have found no clear and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Decision.</p>
                     <p>That the Spattle is a froathy kind of dew that falls
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58849:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the Air, I doubt not, whatsoever my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> say to the contrary. For, first; It is found upon most, if not all, Plants whatsoever, but most copiously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our Whinns, or prickly Broom; and generally about the joynts and ramulous divisions, because there it is best secured from the heat of the Sun, which licks it off the open leaves, or else probably it is imbibed by the full grown and porous leaves of Plants, as the Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew, and other honey-Dews are.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it is the sole exudation and secrement of Plants, I cannot believe: First, because it is never found upon their Second growth, nor in Eddish: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, How should an excrement of so many several Plants, still breed one and the same Animal, when as we see that all Vegetables whatsoever produce their several Insects (as <hi>Muffet</hi> in his 19. and 20. Chapters has parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly enumerated.) I shall not deny but the Effluvium's that continually perspire out of all Plants whatsoever, may advantage and promote the nutrition of the little Insect that breeds therein.</p>
                     <p>For that all Vegetables have a constant perspiration, the continual dispersion of their odour makes out; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides an experimental eviction I shall give you by this singular Experiment: 23. of <hi>Feb.</hi> (â61.) we weighed an Onyon exactly to two ounces, two scruples and a half, and hanging it up till the 6. of <hi>May</hi> next following (at which time it had sprouted out a long shoot) we then, upon a re-ponderation of it, had lost near two drams of its former weight, which was exhaled by insensible Transpiration.</p>

                     <head>OBSERVAT. XXX. Of the little white Eels or Snigs, in Vineger or Aleger.</head>
                     <p>THey appear like small Silver-Eels, or little Snigs, and some of them as long as my little finger, constantly wrigling and swimming to and fro with a quick, smart, and restless motion. In which smallest of Animals these things are most remarkable:</p>
                     <p>First, They are not to be found in all sorts of Vineger nor Aleger, but onely in such, probably, as has arrived
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58849:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to some peculiar temper or putrefaction, of which I can give you no Characteristical Signs; for, I have found them in all sorts of Vineger, both in the keenest and smartest, as well as in the weakest and most watrish Vineger; and in all these sorts, you shall sometimes find none at all; and I have both found them, and also vainly sought them, in the former Liquors, at al seasons and times of the year also.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The manner and best way of observing them is, upon a plain piece of white glass, whereon two or three drops of the said Liquors are laid; and so lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that glass on the object-plate, and fitting your <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope</hi> to it, you may distinctly see them to play and swim in those little Ponds of Vineger (for so big every drop almost seems) to the very brink and banks of their fluid element.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Nay you may see them (especially in old Aleger) with the bare eye, if you put a little of it into a clear <hi>Venice</hi>-glass, especially into those pure thin white bubbles, which they call Essence-glasses; you may then see an infinite company of them swimming at the edges of the Liquor, nay and in the body of it too, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shreds of the purest <hi>Dutch</hi> thread, as if the whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor was nothing else but a great shoal or mass of quick Eels or Hair-worms.</p>
                     <p>I have another advantageous way of discoverance of them to the bare eye also, which is by putting a little of those Liquors into a little cylinder of white glass, of a small bore and length, either sealed or closed up with cork and wax at the one end: therein, if you invert this glass cylinder, and often turn it topsy turvy, no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor will fall out, onely a little bubble of aire will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pass and repass through the inverted Liquor, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58849:30"/>
one pretty thing I have herein observed, that when this bubble has stood in the superiour end of the glass (and sometimes it would do so for a pretty while together before it broke) I have seen some of those small Snigs or Animals on the top of it, crawling over the smooth convexity of the bubble (like so many Eels over a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glass) without breaking thorow the tender cuticle and film of so brittle and thin a substance.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That as the Liquor (dropt upon your object-plate) spends and dries up, so you shall see those little Quicks to draw nearer and nearer together, and grow feebler in their motion; and when all the Vineger or Aleger is dried away, then they lie all dead, twisted and complicated all together, like a knot of Eels, and after a little time dry quite away to nothing.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Their heads and tails are smaller then the rest of their bodies; which is best observed by the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope,</hi> when the Liquor wherin they swim is almost spent and dried up, so that their motion thereby is rendred more feeble and weak, or when they lie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely dead.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Another remarkable thing, is, their exceeding exiguity; for certainly of all Animals they are the least that can be seen by the bare eye, which is helped and advantaged also by the refraction of the water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they swim.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, If you take a spoonful of the foresaid Vineger and heat it over a few coals, it presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys all the Quick's in it, so that you may see them all stretched out at their full length, like a pencil chopt small, or little bits of hairs swimming up and down the Liquor, which in a short time will precipitate and all sink down to the bottom of the glass.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:58849:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>Nay these poor Vermin are not onely slain by actual heat, but by a potential one also: for, putting but a few drops of the Oyle of Vitriol into an Essence-glass full of that Vineger, it also shortly destroyed them in the same manner as the fire had done before.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, Now though heat hath that killing proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet it seems that cold hath not: for I have taken a jar-glass full of the said Vineger, and by applying Snow and Salt to it, I have artificially frozen all the said Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor into a mass of Ice, (wherein all these Animals it seemed lay incrystalled) though I could discover none of them in it (though I have taken the Icy-mass out on purpose to look at it) so that now I gave them for gone for ever: yet when I came again (about two or three hours after) to uncongeal the Liquor, by keeping the glass in my warm hand, when the Vineger was again returned to its former liquidity, all my little Animals made their re-appearance, and danced and frisked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as lively as ever. Nay I have exposed a jar-glass full of this Vineger all night to a keen Frost, and in the morning have thaw'd the Ice again, and these little Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min have appeared again and endured again that strong and long Conglaciation without any manifest injury done to them; which is both a pretty and a strange Experiment.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, I have filled an essence-glass half with the said Vineger, and half with Oyle (which floated on the Vineger) in a distinct Region by it self, and I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that in frosty weather when the Vineger has been congealed, that all the little Eels have run up into the super-incumbent oyle to preserve themselves there, and would not return till some warmth was apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Vineger again, and then they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58849:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
presently return down into their native Liquor again.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, Their motion is very remarkable, which is restless and constant, with perpetual undulations and wavings, like Eels or Snakes; so that it seems, that Animals that come nearest the classis of Plants, have the most restless motions.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, the innumerable number and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated motion of these minute Animals in Vineger, may very neatly illustrate the Doctrine of the incomparable <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> touching Fluidity: (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of all fluid bodies are in a continual and restless motion, and therein consists the true nature of fluidity: for by this ocular example, we see there may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine restless motion in a Liquor, notwithstanding that the unassisted eye can discover no such matter, which likewise is evinced by <hi>Observ.</hi> 13. <hi>Of the Mites in Meal.</hi>

                     <p>IN this slimy Animal (the slow-paced Engine of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) are very many rare and excellent Observables. The first is his Eyes, which are four in number, (like black atramentous Spots) fixed to the end of their horns; or rather to the ends of those black filaments or optick nerves, which are sheathed in her horns which she can retract or protrude, through the hollow trunck of her horns, as she pleaseth.</p>
                     <p>If with your finger you take hold of the tip of her
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58849:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
horn when fully extended, and draw out this nervous filament, or then nimbly clip off the extremities of her horns, you shall in the <hi>Microscope</hi> see those 2. black spots to be semi-spherical eyes, like two large blew Beads: and we could afterwards also, when she re-extended the stump, clearly perceive it with the bare eye to be tubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and hollow. And therefore however, though the learned Doctor <hi>Brown</hi> (my ever honoured friend) hath ranked this conceit of the Eyes of a Snail (and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially their quadruplicity) amongst the Vulgar errours of the multitude; yet through a good <hi>Microscope,</hi> he may easily see his own errour, and Nature's most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable variety in the plurality, paucity, and anomalous Situation of eyes, and the various fabrick and motion of that excellent organ; as our Observations will more particularly inform him.</p>
                     <p>If by a dextrous Dissection you would see the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fabrick of this Animal, there are many excellent things that will recompence your curiosity.</p>
                     <p>For first, you may find her Heart just over against that round hole near her neck (which Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously conjectures to be the place of their respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which hole you may observe to open and shut as she moves or stands still, and out of which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served some salivous Matter to be evacuated.</p>
                     <p>We have observ'd her Heart to beat fairly for a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour after her dissection; afterwards we took out her guts which were of a pure green colour, by reason of the thinness of their film, and transparency of the green juice of hearbs with which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
                     <p>They were all diaper'd or branched over with pure white Capillary little veins, which (by help of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope</hi>)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58849:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we could discern to be hollow, with a blackish kind of pith running through the midst of the smallest of them, which doubtless was their nutrimental juice coagulated there, like the bloud starkn'd in the veins of dead Animals.</p>
                     <p>They are mouthed like a Hare or Rabbit, with four or six needle-teeth, like those in Leeches.</p>
                     <p>Nay this poor Animal (how contemptible soever it may seem) hath a whole Sett of the same parts and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans with other Animals, as Heart, Liver, Spleen, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Guts, Mouth and Teeth, Veins and Arteries: Yea and a pair more of the noblest of the Senses (the Eyes.)</p>
                     <p>Nay this Animal doth autoptically evince us, that, as sanguineous and more perfect Animals, have a circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their bloud within them; so this more ignoble creature hath also a circulation of its nutritive humour, which is to it as Bloud is to other Animals.</p>
                     <p>Nay further (which is the best Remarkable of all) this juice hath not onely a circular motion; but also the very Animal Spirits (by which she moves) seem to have the like Circulation. For, if you observe her with the bare eye to creep up the sides of a glass, you shall see a little stream of clouds, channel up her belly from her tail to her head, which never return again the same way, but probably go backwards again from the head down the back to the tail; and thus, so long as she is in local motion they retain their circulation, which is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant spectacle. And more pleasant, if you let her creep upon the lower side of your glass-object-plate, and so view that wavy Current of Spirits through the <hi>Micros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope</hi>; which handsome experiment does not onely prove the Spirit's circular motion, but also ocularly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58849:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the Animal Spirits are the Soul's immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate instrument in all Loco-motion.</p>
                     <p>Now if you reply that it is onely the parts of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that moving by a kind of undulation protrude one another forwards, as Palmer-worms (which we call Wool-boys,) and some sort of Caterpillars do: To this I answer, that do but intensly observe any one of the former spots or clouds, and you shall see it go quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the tail to the head, keeping alwayes an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual distance from the precedent and subsequent spot: so that it is far more ingenious to believe it to be a gale of Animal Spirits, that, moving from her head along her back to her tail, and thence along her belly to her head again, is the cause of her progressive motion.</p>

                     <p>The Heart in this Animal is very strangely secured, &amp; lies immured or capsulated in a Cartilage, or grisly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which includes the Heart and its Auricle, as the Scull or Pericranium does the Brains in other Animals; it is of a horny and transparent substance, of an obtuse conical figure, cemented and glewed as it were on all sides to the Pleura, or innermost skin of the Thorax; the Cone or obtuse Tip of this Capsula, butts or shoots it self into the basis of the Liver, which to give way thereunto has an oval cavity or hollowness exactly fit to receive it.</p>
                     <p>In this Cartilaginous Pericardium, or purse of the heart, is likewise the Auricle co-included, lying not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the basis of the heart as in other Animals, but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally adjacent thereunto, insomuch that it being far more flaggy then the heart, they seem to represent the right and left ventricle of the heart. Yet is the Heart, not onely more solid, but seated in the right side, and the Auricle in the left.</p>
                     <p>If the Lamprey be laid upon her back, and you gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lift up with a probe, the Heart and Auricle; you shall see a fine thin Membrane arise, which separates the Heart from the Auricle, as the <hi>falx cerebri</hi> does sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the left side of the brain from the right.</p>
                     <p>From this Auricle proceeds a little short Channel, which perforates this separating Membrane, and brings the bloud from the auricle into the heart, we thrust a probe just under this Channel betwixt the Heart and the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58849:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Auricle, to see the bloud passe from the Auricle into the Heart; for at every pulse of the Auricle you might see the bloud passe through this Channel into the heart; for alwayes, as the bloud passed through it was blew, and, when empty, pale, and transparent, that I could easily see the Probe thorow it.</p>
                     <p>Whilest I had the Probe in this position, with another Instrument and it together, I quite stopped the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel on purpose to hinder the bloud from coming into the heart, which thereupon grew very pale, and in a short time ceased its motion; the Auricle in the interim swelled and was very red. I no sooner opened the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel to let the bloud have a free passage as formerly, but the heart began afresh to beat again.</p>
                     <p>We pricked the heart while it was in its motion with a large pin into the cavity thereof, and at every systole or contraction, we plainly saw a drop of bloud squeez'd and ejected out of that hole.</p>
                     <p>In this Animal, you may easily distinguish between the motion of the heart and auricle, for there intercedes the time of a pulse twixt the motion of the auricle and the heart; and the heart in every diastole is of a fair pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ruddy colour, and in every systole pale and wan, as is observable in Frogs and other Fishes also; where you may see the heart to shift colours by turns, as it receives or ejects the bloud in the performance of the circulation.</p>
                     <p>Now the reason of this Cartilaginous Capsula of the heart in this Creature, might be its defect of bones and those costal ribs, which serve others to secure the heart from all external violence; for, she wanting these, had not Nature wisely secured and capsulated the heart in this gristle, it had been subject to all external inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58849:34"/>
which might have hindred the motion, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the life of the Animal.</p>
                     <p>This horny Capsula, also served instead of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm to part the lower Venter from the Thorax.</p>
                     <p>The Lamprey likewise hath no bones: for the spine or back-bone, it hath a Cartilaginous flexible Tube or Channel, without any <hi>Vertebrae</hi> or Spondyls in it, hollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed or tubulous from one end to the other; in which lay the Spinal Marrow, which was of a serous, thin, and milky substance.</p>
                     <p>In some Lampreys, I have found the Liver (as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Brown</hi> writes) of a pure grass-green colour, which remain'd and kept that tincture whilst the Animal lived; but when I had cut it out of the Body, and layd it by, it presently turned into a faint Olive-colour. Besides I have in the beginning of <hi>April</hi> cut up many Lampreys, whose Livers were of no such colour at all, but a dull yellow, like that of Eels and other Fishes.</p>
                     <p>So that in this Animal, and Snakes also, you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly see the Bloud's Circulation.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That it was none of the Atoms of the Steel or Stone, grated off by Collision; for those you might easily see were distinguishable from it; now that so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a stroak, and so small a fire can vitrify, will be better understood by him that knows, how small a heat at a Lamp-Furnace will melt Glass: I have small Capillary Glass-Tubes, which will melt immediately like Wax, if you hold them but near the flame of a common Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, without any blast at all; by which Artifice I make small Syphons, for the Tryal of many notable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of which I have treated at large in our <hi>Mercurial</hi> Experiments.</p>
                     <p>This further I shall adde of Flint, that in it you shall

                     <head>OBSERVAT. L. Of Hair.</head>
                     <p>WE slit a black Horse's Hair with a Rasor, and perceived it to be hollow, with a white streak like pith in the middle of it; it seemed as big as a Rush, and like a Rush slit length-wayes into two. They are none of them Cylindrical, but angular and corner'd, which you may even perceive by your fingers, by twir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Horse-hair in them: Now though <hi>Borrelius,</hi> and some of our Anatomists, as <hi>Bartholin, Riolan, &amp;c.</hi> say the like of the Hairs of a mans head, that they also are hollow within, and angular and corner'd without: yet I could never perceive neither the one nor the other in any of the <hi>Microscopes</hi> I have seen, though I have tried it in four excellent ones, the worst whereof I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was better then that of <hi>Borrels</hi>: In all which, I could perceive nothing of an Hair, but that it was like a thin horn something diaphanous (especially in the full Sun) which diaphanity might perchance hinder the appearance both of its cavity and angularity also: for I my self have little glass pipes of so little a Cylinder, and so small a bore, that their hollowness to the bare eye is utterly imperceptible.</p>
                     <p>And since the bristles and quils in other Animals are sensibly hollow, which are analogous to the hairs in a man; I doubt not, but every one of our hairs is hollow also, which though our Glasses (by reason of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58849:41"/>
cannot present, yet it is palpably evinced by an odde Experiment in <hi>Poland,</hi> where there is a disease (they call the <hi>Plica</hi>) which makes the very hairs of their heads drop bloud at the ends, and if cut any where, to drop bloud there also; which infallibly proves the tubulous cavity of them. Besides, we see the hairs do grain and fork themselves, (when grown too long) which is a sign also of their hollowness.</p>
                     <p>What, shall we judge them too small to be perforated by Nature? since we see she has perforated Vessels within the Body, as small as hairs, as the <hi>Venae Lacteae,</hi> and Lymphae-ducts; nay, since we see that Art can blow a glass hollow, and yet as small as hair; and your Wire-drawers know, that if they take a short piece of Wire, as thick as a quill, and drill it through, that then though they draw it out to the smalness of a hair, yet wil it still remain hollow quite through in despite of their Wurdle: which is as great a Miracle in that Engine, as that the like Wire once gilt, shall remain perfectly gilt all over, though it be drawn five hundred yards longer than it was at first; which is an experimental truth, and the dayly practice of our Wire-drawers in <hi>London.</hi> So that the conclusion of this Observation may be this, that every hair of our head is as a little quill or horn, hollow and transparent. Which seems to be further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched also by the burning of hair; for there you may perceive the same odour and smell, as of burnt horn; and the Chymists, as I remember, draw out of hair a volatile Spirit, exactly like that of Harts-horn: both which experiments do prove an homogeneity and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of their substance.</p>

                     <p>SOme with a Magisterial Confidence do rant so high as to tell us, that there are Glasses, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present not onely the Aromatical and Electrical Efflux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of Bodies, but even the subtile effluviums of the Load-stone it self, whose Exspirations (saith Doctor <hi>Highmore</hi>) some by the help of Glasses have seen in the form of a Mist to flow from the Load-stone.

                     <p>But I am sure he had better Eyes, or else better Glasses, or both, then ever I saw, that performed so subtle an Experiment: For the best Glasses that ever I saw, would not represent to me, the evaporations of Camphire (which spends it self by continually effluvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its own Component Particles;) nay, I could never see the grosser steams that continually perspire out of our own Bodies, which you see will foil and besmear a polished Glass at any time; and which are the fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Eructations of that internal fire, that constantly burns within us.</p>

                        <p>FIrst, Therefore, it is Ocularly manifest from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Observations, that, as perfect Animals have an incessant motion of their Heart, and Circulation of their Bloud (first discovered by the illustrious Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi>;) so in these puny <hi>automata,</hi> and exsanguineous pieces of Nature, there is the same pulsing Organ, and Circulation of their Nutritive Humour also: as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58849:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by OBSERV. fourth, sixth, seventeenth, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Nay, by OBSERV. sixth, it is plain that a Louse is a Sanguineous Animal, and hath both an Heart and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles, the one manifestly preceding the pulse of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and hath a purple Liquor or Bloud, which circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in her (as the Noblest sort of Animals have) which though it be onely conspicuous in its greatest bulk, at the heart, yet certainly it is carried up and down in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory Vessels; which Veins and Arteries are so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding little, that both they and their Liquor are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible: For certainly, if we can at a Lamp-Furnace draw out such small Capillary Pipes of Glass that the reddest Liquor in the World shall not be seen in them (which I have often tried and done;) how much more curiously can Nature weave the Vessels of the Body; nay, and bore them too with such a Drill, as the Art of man cannot excogitate: Besides, we see, even in our own Eyes, that the Sanguineous Vessels that run along the white of the eye (nay and probably into the diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous humours also) are not discernable, but when they are preter-naturally distended in an Ophthalmia, and so grow turgent and conspicuous.</p>
                        <p>To which we may adde, that in most quick Fish, though you cut a piece of their flesh off, yet will no bloud be discernable, though they be sanguineous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; but the bloud is so divided by the minuteness of their Capillary Vessels, or percribration through the habit of the Parts, that either it has lost its redness, or our eyes are not able to discover its tincture.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is observable also from the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, that in these minute Animals their nutritive Liquor never arises to the perfection of bloud, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58849:43"/>
as it were remains Chyle within them, for want of a higher heat to dye it into that Spirituous Liquor: Nay, you shall observe in perfect Sanguineous Animals a Circulation of an albugineous chylie-matter (before the bloud have a being) if you take Nature at the rise, and critically observe her in her rudimental and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure beginnings.</p>
                        <p>For view but an Egge, (after the second day's Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and you shall see the cicatricula in the Yolk, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the breadth of a groat or six-pence into trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent concentrical circles; in the Centre whereof is a white Spot, with small white threads, (which in futurity proves the Heart with its Veins and arteries) but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent both its motion and circulation is undiscernable to the bare eye, by reason of the feebleness thereof, and also because both the Liquor and its Vessels were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour to the white of the Eggs they swum in; but the Heart does circulate this serous diaphanous Liquor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (by a higher heat) it be turned into bloud.</p>
                        <p>And one thing here I am tempted to annex, which is a pretty and beneficial Observation of the <hi>Microscope,</hi> and that is, That as soon as ever you can see this red pulsing Particle appear (which Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi> conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to be the Heart, but one of its Auricles) you shall most distinctly see it, to be the whole Heart with both Auricles and both Ventricles, the one manifestly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the pulse of the other (which two motions the bare eye judges to be Synchronical) and without any interloping perisystole at all: So admirable is every Organ of this Machine of ours framed, that every part within us is intirely made, when the whole Organ seems too little to have any parts at all.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It is peculiarly remarkable from <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

xxxi. That not onely the bloud in perfect Animals, and the chyle in imperfect ones; but also the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have a Circulation, which singular observation hath often provoked and entised our endeavours into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry after the Nature of these Spirits, as to their Origin or Generation, their activity and motion, with some other eminent properties belonging to them: we shall draw our thoughts together, and so present them to your View: I will not say, that our discourse hereon, shall pass for an un-controllable authentick Truth; it is all my ambition if it attain but to the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reception of a rational Hypothesis at last.</p>

                        <head>A Digression of the Animal Spirits.</head>
                        <p>FIrst, then, we have not those narrow conceptions of these subtle Spirits to think that they are onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the Bodies of Animals, or generated (much less created) there, but we doe believe that they are universally diffused throughout all Bodies in the World, and that Nature at first created this aetherial substance or subtle particles, and diffused them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Universe, to give fermentation and concretion to Minerals; vegetation and maturation to Plants; life, sense, and motion to Animals; And indeed, to be the main (though invisible) Agent in all Natures three Kingdoms Mineral, Vegetal, and Animal.</p>
                        <p>And lest they should (because of their exceeding volatility and activity) be of little or no use, Nature hath immersed them in grosser matter, and imprisoned them in several Bodies, with which she has intermixed them,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58849:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the better to curb the boundless activity of so thin and spirituous a substance, and therefore the Spirits (of all compound Bodies especially) ought to be considered under a triple notion:</p>

                        <p>First of Fixation, when they are so complicated with the grosser Particles of Matter, and lockt therein so fast, that they can hardly be separated, and dis-impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as in Minerals, but most especially in Gold.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The state of Fusion, I call that, when the Spirits by any kind of help have so wrought themselves towards a Liberty, that they are in the middle way to Volatility, as in half-concocted Minerals, fermenting Vapours or Liquors, and half-ripned Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Spirits are in their third state of Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, when after a colluctancy with the grosser Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they have so subjugated and overcome them, that they are just upon wings, and ready to fly away; as in Wine when it is in the height of its fermentation, and in some part of our arterial bloud alwayes. Now we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that those Bodies that relax and open the grosser composition of other Bodies, do presently create a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; for, being like so many Keys, they set the imprisoned Spirits at Liberty, which presently fall on working, and by attenuating the grosser parts, separating the Heterogeneous, volatilizing some, precipitating of others, digesting of others, expelling of others, do at last mould it and work it to such a Body, as the parts of it are fit to make up: In all which interval of time, there is a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58849:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and sensible heat produced: Thus this Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing embowelled in the Earth, and meeting there with convenient matter and adjuvant causes, doth proceed to produce Minerals, creating an actual heat, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it operates, as in Allum or Copperase Mines, which being broken, exposed, and moistned, will gather an actual heat, and produce much more of those Minerals, then else the Mine would yield, as <hi>Agricola</hi> and <hi>Thurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer</hi> do affirm, and is proved by common experience.</p>
                        <p>The like is generally observed in Mines, as <hi>Agricola, Erastus,</hi> and <hi>

                              </gap>ibanius, &amp;c.</hi> do affirm and avouch out of the dayly experience of Mineral men, who affirm, that in most places they find their Mines so hot, as they can hardly touch them; although it is likely that, where they work for perfect Minerals, the heat which was in fermentation whilst they were yet in breeding, is now much abated, the Mineral being grown to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as the skilful and excellent Doctor <hi>Jordan</hi> very well infers.</p>
                        <p>The like heat we observe constantly to be in our Cole-Pits: Nay, we sometimes observe in our Brass-lumps (as our Colliers call them) which is a kind of Marcasite, a very great heat; for being exposed to the moist Air, or sprinkled with water, they will smoak and grow exceeding hot; and if they be layd up on a heap and watered, they will turn into a glowing red hot fire, as I have seen them my self.</p>
                        <p>And it was a Casualty once terrible to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Town of <hi>Ealand</hi>; for there, one <hi>Wilson</hi> a Patient of mine, having pil'd up many Cart-loads of these Brass-lumps in a Barn of his, (for some secret purposes of his own) the Roof letting rain-water fall copiously in amongst them, they all began to smoak, and at last to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58849:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
take fire, and burnt like red hot Coals; so that the Town was in an uproar about quenching of them; and one thing further I took special notice of in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Experiment, that the Water which drained from the quenching of them, left little pieces and Crystals of Copperase sticking all along to the Piles of Grass, that grew in the Croft it run down.</p>
                        <p>Thus Antimony and Sublimate being mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will grow so hot (the one relaxing the fermenting spirit in the other) that they are not to be touched.</p>
                        <p>Thus in the Corrosion of Mettals by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> what a strong heat is there in the Liquor, and what a steam constantly evaporates during their fermentation. In the Commixtion of Oyl of Vitriol with Oyl of <hi>Tartar per deliquium,</hi> what a violent heat and effervescence do presently arise, besides a sharp and acrimonious vapour that strikes our nostrils. Nay, and we see our Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Damps do sometimes with intermixtion with the moist Air, grow to that over-height of fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they fire of themselves and strike down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Spirit of Niter mixed with Butter of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, grows so hot, that it is ready to rise in a flame.</p>
                        <p>Thus certainly do all Baths receive their heat from Mineral Vapours, or the Minerals themselves, being <hi>in solutis Principiis,</hi> and so the fermenting Spirit sets a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, as the Learned Doctor <hi>Jordan</hi> did most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conjecture.</p>
                        <p>This universal fermenting Spirit does not onely play these feats in the Mineral; but also operates in the same manner in the Vegetable Kingdome, which we ocular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold in the Artifice of Malt, where the Grains of Barly being moistned with water, the parts are relaxed,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58849:45"/>
the internal Spirits in them are dilated, and put into action; and the superfluity of water being removed (which might choak it) and the Barly being layd up in heaps, the fermentation and heat presently appears, with a kind of vinous steam and effluviums which passe from it, and therefore it shoots forth into Spires. Thus we see in wet-Hay, how the spirits work not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a heat, but (if they be not cooled and prevented by Ventilation) they break out into a flame also; Nay, in all Vegetables there is this constant Heat (though it be below our Sensation) as it is in some Fishes and colder Animals also, and a constant steam and transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of particles, as we have experimentally proved in our XXV. <hi>Observation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now let us pursue these Spirits into the Animal Kingdom, and we shall see that they have the like effects and operations there also, as is formerly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; onely, being there in greater plenty, and more purely refined, and in a constant state of Fusion and Volatility, they work nobler effects.</p>
                        <p>Now the Spirits that are lodged in all the meats and drinks we receive, being more or less fixed therein; What does the Soul, but (like an excellent Chymist) in this internal Laboratory of Man, by a fermentation of our nourishment in the stomach and guts, a filtration thereof through the <hi>Lacteae,</hi> a digestion in the Heart, a Circulation and Rectification in the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: what does she, I say, by these several <hi>Physico</hi>-Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical operations, but strive all this while to unfix, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt, and volatilize the Spirits conteined in our nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that so they may be transmitted to the Brain, and its divarications, and in that reconditory kept and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited for her use and service.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58849:46"/>So that these we now call Animal Spirits are the purest, subtlest, and most volatile particles and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest Atoms of the bloud, which by continual pulsation of the Heart are carried with the bloud by the carotidal Arteries up into the Brain, and there by that lax and boggy substance are imbibed and separated from the bloud, and thence by the Spinal Marrow and Nerves transmitted to all the parts of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Now as the Chyle is perfected in the stomach and guts, and their appendent Vessels, the lacteal Veins; and as the bloud is perfected in the Heart, and its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed Vessels, the Veins and Arteries: so the Animal Spirits are separated, preserved, and perfected in the Brain, with its continued trunk and branches, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spinal Marrow, Nerves, and Fibers, for the uses here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be declared.</p>
                        <p>Now the two former Liquors, the Chyle and the Bloud (because of their grosser liquidity) need to be conveyed in hollow Pipes and Channels (<hi>viz.</hi> the Veins and Arteries;) but the Spirits which is the quintessence of them both, can easily pass by a swift filtration, through the Brain, Spinal Marrow, and Nerves, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, and Fibers, which are as it were the Cords, Sayls, and Tackling, to move this Engine or Vessel we call the Body.</p>
                        <p>Nay, though we can give you no sensible eviction of it, Why may not all those long filaments of which the substance of the Brain, Spinal Marrow, and Nerves consists, be tubulous and hollow; so that the Animal-Spirits may be channelled through them, as the bloud through the Veins and Arteries? I am sure, we see by <hi>Observation</hi> xxxi. and L. what infinitely small filaments and vessels there are in Animals, and yet all tubulous
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58849:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and perforated; so that the suddain inflation of all those capillary threads or pipes, may serve for Motion of the Body, and the constant though flower filtration of the Spirits through their Coats and Cylindrical Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes may serve for Sensation. So that it seems, this Cottage of Clay, with all its Furniture within it, was but made in subserviency to the Animal Spirits; for the extraction, separation, and depuration of which, the whole Body, and all the Organs and Utensils therein are but instrumentally contrived, and preparatorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed. Just as the Chymical Elaboratory with all its Furnaces, Crucibles, Stills, Retorts, Cucurbits, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trats, Bolt-heads, Pelicans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were made for no other end by the ingenious Chymist, than for the extraction and depuration of his Spirits and Quintessences (which he draws from those Bodies he deals with) in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of which he hath come to the ultimate design of his indeavours.</p>
                        <p>Now as in Minerals and Vegetables the colluctancy of these fermenting Spirits with the grosser matter, does both create a constant heat and evaporation of Atoms: So in Animals, the like is more eminently conspicuous, to wit the vital heat, or <hi>calidum innatum,</hi> and those fuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous effluviums which pass constantly out of us by insensible transpiration; which <hi>Sanctorius</hi> hath proved to exceed the bulk and weight of all our sensible Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>Having thus demonstrated how the Soul obtains these Spirits after her several operations of Digestion, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, Sanguification, Circulation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the like now let us see what use she makes of so pretious a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                        <p>First, therefore we affirm, that this thin and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58849:47"/>
matter, which is called the Animal Spirits, is the immediate Instrument of the Soul, in all her operations both of Sense and Motion. First, for sense, it is plain by what is discovered in a <hi>Vertigo;</hi> for the Brain it self is not of such a fluid substance, as to turn round, and make all objects to do so too; wherefore tis a sign that the immediate corporeal instrument of conveying the images of things, is the Spirits in the Brain. Secondly, That they are the chief Engine of Sight, is plain; not onely because the eye is full of these livid Spirits, but also because dimness of sight comes from deficiency of them, though the parts of the eye otherwayes be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire enough, as in sick and old persons, and in those troubled with an <hi>Amaurosis,</hi> or <hi>Gutta Serena.</hi> I had the last year a Patient, a young Boy of seventeen years old, who fell casually stark blind of his right eye; in which you could outwardly discover no fault at all (the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease being an <hi>Amaurosis,</hi> or obstruction of the Optick Nerve) for, that Nerve being by successful means dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obstructed and relaxed, so that the Animal Spirits were able to flow done to the <hi>Retina</hi> again, he shortly after perfectly recovered his sight again, without any relapse at all, to this present day. Thirdly, If you cast a Ligature upon any Nerve, you destroy both the sense and motion of that part whither that Nerve was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated (as by that pleasant Experiment by tying the recurrent Nerves in a living Dogg, we have tryed) till by relaxing the Ligature the Spirits may have the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to channel into the Nerves again: Which truth is also handsomely made out, by that ordinary example of a mans Leg being asleep (as we call it) for by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Nerves, the propagation of the Spirits into the part is hindred; for, as sense and motion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58849:47"/>
you may feel something creep into the Leg, tingling and stinging like Pismires (as <hi>Spigelius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it) which is the return of the Animal Spirits into that part again. Fourthly, That Spontaneous motion is performed by continuation of the Animal Spirits, from the common Sensorium to the Muscle, (which is the gross Engine of Motion) is sensibly evinced in dead Palsies, where one side is taken away.</p>
                        <p>To all which add, the former Observation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits circumundulation when the Snail at any time mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and of their joint quiescency together.</p>
                        <p>Having now shown you how these Animal Spirits are generated in our Body, or, to speak more properly, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imprisoned and separated from our nutriment, and so from fixation, brought through Fusion to Volatilizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; having also shown you what use Nature makes of them in Sensation and Motion: let us screw our Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a little further, and see if we can discover how the Spirits move in the Brain and Nerves, to perform the same operations. First, therefore, we affirm that a lesser quantity and slower motion of the Spirits is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for Sensation, than there is for Motion; for in this the Muscle swells that moves the part, which is a plain Indication of a greater influx of Spirits directed thither; a greater, I say, for I do not deny but there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to sensation a moderate quantity and diffusion of the Spirits into all the parts of the Body, else we should alwayes be benummed and stupid (as when our Leg is asleep) by an interception of the Spirits. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that their motion is slower in sensation then motion; the former Experiment of the Snail does also manifest: whose Animal Spirits never begin to undulate till she begin to move, whereas she is sensible when they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58849:48"/>
are in Quiescency, as you may, by pricking her with a Needle, easily observe. Thirdly, in the return of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into the stupefied Leg, we plainly perceive by the prickling, what a flow motion the Spirits have. All which <hi>Phaenomena</hi> do seem to favour our former Conjecture, that for Motion the Spirits move impetuously down the nervous filaments, (which are hollow;) but for Sensation they onely creep by a filtration down their Coats and Membranes.</p>
                        <p>Now these Spirits being so subtle and dissipable, the Soul spends them every day in using of them, and they being much spent, she can hardly move the Body any longer: The sense whereof we call Lassitude; For certainly, as Doctor <hi>More</hi> very ingeniously inferrs, if it were an immediate faculty of the Soul to contribute Motion to any matter; I do not understand (that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty never failing nor diminishing, no more than the Soul it self can fail or diminish) that we should ever be weary.</p>
                        <p>Thus are the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Sense and Motion best salved, whilst we are awake; now what happens when we sleep, is a matter of further enquiry: Some have defined Sleep to be a migration of all the Spirits out of the Brain, into the exteriour parts of the Body; whereas by our former Observations, it may rather seem to the contrary; that is, The retraction of the Spirits into the Brain, or at least a restagnation of them in the nervous parts, does (till Nature being recruited by a new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and regeneration of them in the Brain) direct them into the Spinal Marrow and Nerves, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with them again, they run their current as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; so the whole Animal thereby is made capable of feeling the Impulses of any external object whatever
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58849:48"/>
(which we call, Walking) and during this Interval and Non-tearm of sensation (for so we may without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement call Sleep) why may not the Soul be retracted, and wholly intent upon, and busied about, her Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Plastical Operations? So that when she has locked up the doors of this Laboratory the Body, she may be busie in augmenting, repairing, and regenerating all the Organs and Utensils within, and painting and plaistring the Walls without. This I am sure we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be the greatest part of her obscure employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Womb, where the Embryo for the most part sleeps, whilst the Soul is in full exercise of her Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick and Organo-PoÃ¯etical Faculty.</p>
                        <p>Now these Animal Spirits being continually trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the Brain, through the Spinal Marrow, Nerves, Tendons, &amp; Fibers, into all the parts of the Body (especially whilst we are awaking) may, some of them at least, have a kind of circulation; for those which perspire not, having lost their motion, may either mix with the bloud <hi>in habitu partium,</hi> or relapse into a kind of insipid phlegm, as Chymical Spirits do, that are not purely rectified, and to be returned back by the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiducts again.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I have but one paradoxical and extravagant <hi>Quaere</hi> to make, and that is this; That since we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved these Animal Spirits to be the ultimate result of all the concoctions of the Body, the very top and perfection of all Nature's operations, the purest and most aetherial particles of all Bodies in the World whatsoever, (and so consequently of nearest alliance to Spiritualities) and the sole and immediate instrument of all the Soul's ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations here, even <hi>in statu conjuncto</hi> (the Body and the Organs thereof, being but secondary and subservient
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58849:49"/>
Instruments to the Spirits:) These things being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, may it not be probable enough that these Spirits in the other World, shall onely be the Soul's Vehicle and Habit, and indeed really that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                           </gap>, mentioned by the Apostle; by a vital re-union with which, it may supereminently out-act all that ever she was able to do in this earthly Prison and heavy Cottage of the Body; since also (which I may super-adde) those volatile Spirits (being freed by a constant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dissipation from the Body) are diffused through this great aetherial Ocean, as into their proper Element, ready to be united to the Soul at the instant of her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>Fourth Deduction.</head>
                        <p>FOurthly, The Physiologist also may gather some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the former Observations, touching the nature of Colours; that they are indeed nothing but the various modification of Light. For most, if not all, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in their minute particles (through which the Sun's Rays have more freedome to penetrate) seem to lose their Colours, and grow diaphanous, as you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the <hi>Microscope.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Is it not shrewdly probable, that since mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the cause of sight, (which is nothing else, but the impulse that the Luminous Atoms make upon the <hi>Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>:) Is it not, I say, shrewdly probable, that Colours are nothing else but a various modification of this motion, since we see that they are both naturally and artificially made by light, to which we can imagine nothing to be added or deducted to super-induce those fine Tinctures
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58849:49"/>
as in the Rain-bow, the Prisme, crystal Pendents, Glass-Globes filled full of water, and in those arenulous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in the former <hi>Experiment</hi> xxxiii. except some change in the motion of the Luminous Atoms, which must necessarily follow from the diversities of Objects and Mediums they either hit upon or pass thorow; and so consequently do either accelerate or retardate the Solary Atoms in their Dinetical and progressive Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whence arises both the diversity and variety of all colours whatsoever, as that profoundest Master of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks (<hi>Des-Cartes</hi>) hath both subtilly excogitated, and ingeniously illustrated by the Prisme.</p>
                        <p>To which we shall add some further experimental E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction:</p>
                        <p>First, If the Hole (through which the Species is transmitted into a dark room) be covered with a leaf of Beaten Gold, it will not onely look of a pure green co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but all the light trajected through it will put on the same Tincture.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If with a Prisme you strike the Rainbow-colours upon a wall, and observing where a red is proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, you there place an Eye, the Spectator shall judge it to be another colour; because that the Solary Atoms, which shot through the Prisme upon the wall, and there painted that colour, being again and again refracted by the Diaphanous Humours of the Eye, must needs, in all reason, exchange their motion, and so consequently paint the Retina with another colour: both which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments shew, that Colour is nothing else but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of Light, which by the alteration of its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is dyed into colours. The like Artificial alteration of the Colours may be made by interposing a Burning-Glass
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58849:50"/>
'twixt the Prisme and the Light, and 'twixt the Prisme and the Paper.</p>
                        <p>But this <hi>Cartesian</hi> Theory of Colours we shall further make out by several Experiments in the Extraction, Commixtion, and Transcoloration of Tinctures. First therefore,</p>
                        <p>If into the Infusion of Violets you put some few drops of the oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> it will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strike it into a green Tincture: now, if instead of that oyl you put in oyl of Vitriol, it strikes it into a purple Colour: to which if you super-add some drops of Spirit of Harts-Horn, it strikes it green again.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If into the Tincture of dryed Roses (drawn in Hot-water with oyl of Vitriol after the usual manner) you drop a few drops of Spirit of Harts-Horn, or of Urine, or of oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently strike the red into a green Colour; which by a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-addition of the oyl of Vitriol, you may re-tincture as before.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If into an Infusion of Copperose you shave a little Gall, it presently puts on a Sable inky Colour; into which if you put a few drops of the Spirit or oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, it strikes out the Colour immediately, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becomes white again; to which if you super-add a few drops of oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> it re-denigrates it again.</p>
                        <p>Thus a Glass of the Sweet-Spaw-water also, upon the Infusion of Gall, turns into a Claret-colour: but if you drop but a little of the said oyl or spirit into it, it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eats out the Colour, and the water returns to its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive clearness again.</p>
                        <p>Draw a faint Tincture of Brasil wood, bruised or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sped in luke-warm water, filter it, and clarifie it; then if
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58849:50"/>
you add a little sharp vineger to a good quantity of it, it will strike it into the exact colour of good stale Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Beer, and it will partly have the smell of it also.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If into another quantity of the said reddish Infusion you add a few drops of the oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> it will turn it to a pure purplish red, like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Claret.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If into this Artificial Claret you drop a few drops of the oyl of Vitriol, it will turn it into a pale Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber colour (like Sack as may be) which with addition of fair water you may empale as you please. By which ingenious commixtion of Spirits and Liquors did <hi>Floram Marchand,</hi> that famous Water-Drinker, exhibit those rare tricks and curiosity's at <hi>London,</hi> of vomiting all kind of Liquors at his mouth.</p>
                        <p>For, first; Before he mounts the Stage, he alwayes drinks in his private Chamber, fasting, a gill of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Brasil; then making his appearance, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents you with a pail full of luke-warm water, and twelve or thirteen glasses, some washed in vineger, others with oyl of Tartar, and oyl of Vitriol; then he drinks four and twenty glasses of the water, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taking up the glasse which was washed with oyl of Tartar, he vomits a reddish liquor into it, which present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is brightned up and ting'd into perfect and lovely Claret.</p>
                        <p>After this first assay, he drinks six or seven glasses more (the better to provoke his vomiting) as also the more to dilute and empale the Brasil Decoction within him, and then he takes a glass rinsed in vineger, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it full, which instantly, by its acidity is transcoloured into English Beer; and vomiting also at the same time into another glass (which he washes in fair water) he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58849:51"/>
presents the Spectators with a glass of paler Claret, or <hi>Burgundian</hi> wine; then drinking again as before, he picks out the glass washed with oyl of Vitriol, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting a faint Brasil-water into it, it presently appears to be Sack; and perchance if he wash'd the one half of the glass with spirit of Sack, it would have a faint odour and flavour of that Wine also.</p>
                        <p>He then begins his Carouse again, and drinking fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or sixteen glasses, till he has almost extinguished the strength and tincture of his Brasil water, he then vomits into a Vineger-glass again, and that presents white Wine. At the next disgorgement (when his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is full of nothing but clear water indeed (which he has fill'd so, by the exceeding quantity of water which at every interval he drinks) he then deludes the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators by vomiting Rose water, Angelica water, and Cinamon water into those glasses which have been formerly washed with those Spirits. And thus was that famous Cheat perform'd, and indeed acted with such a port and flowing grace, by that <hi>Italian</hi> Bravado, that he did not onely strike an Admiration into vulgar heads, and common Spectators, but even into the judicious and more knowing part of men, who could not readily find out the ingenuity of his knavery.</p>
                        <p>The Chymical Elaboratories likewise do teach us this Truth in Fumes and Smoaks, as well as Liquors (which indeed are but rarified and expaused Liquors;) for <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> it self, though nothing a kin to redness doth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation yield bloud-red Fumes (called by the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists Salamanders-bloud) which fall again into a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor which hath nothing of red in it.</p>
                        <p>So Soot (though black) yet when it is pressed and forced up into an exhalation by a strong fire, will fill
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58849:51"/>
the Receiver with Milk white Fumes; thus Sall-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, and black Antimony, being equally mixed and gradually sublimed in an Urinal, will exhibit a Scene of Colours, and will make a transition out of one into another with a delectable variety.</p>
                        <p>By all which pleasant Observations, it palpably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the nature of Colours consists in the free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, transition, refraction, or reflection of light, from the Objects discoloured; For first, you see seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Colours introduced into Liquors by those Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, that neither had nor could communicate any such tincture. Secondly, 'tis as plain, that the minute Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Atoms of those Bodies that were imbibed by the Liquors, and filled up their smallest Cavities or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terstices, accordingly as they were altered in their site, position, and motion; so were the Luminous Beams variously transmitted, refracted, or reflected, and so consequently thence resulted those several Scenes of Colours.</p>
                        <p>Thus when the Atoms wherewith the Liquor is fully impregnated do relax and open themselves, that the light may fairly penetrate, then is the Liquor limpid and clear; but if they draw up a little closer one to another, so that the light be refracted, then is the Liquor yellow; if closer yet to a greater refraction of the Light, then is the Liquor red: but if in this randezvouz they draw up into a very close Body indeed, so that by reason of their contiguity, both in rank and file, no light can be trajected through them; then opacity and darkness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises: If the Rays cannot break the front of them, then is a milky-Whiteness presented there.</p>

                        <head>The Fifth COROLLARY<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Anatomical Considerations about the Eye.</head>
                        <p>OUr next Reflections shall be made upon the Eye, to admire as well as contemplate Nature's variety in the constructure and conformation of so excellent an Organ: The two Luminaries of our <hi>Microcosm,</hi> which see all other things, cannot see themselves, nor discover the excellencies of their own Fabrick: Nature, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mistress of the Opticks, seems to have run through all the Conick Sections, in shaping and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring its Parts; and Dioptrical Artists have almost ground both their Brain and Tools in pieces, to find out the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Convexities of its prime parts, and are yet at a loss, to find their true Figurations, whereby to advance the Fabrick of their <hi>Telescopes</hi> and <hi>Microscopes</hi>: which practical part of Opticks is but yet in the rise; but if it run on as successfully as it has begun, our Posterity may come by Glasses to out-see the Sun, and Discover Bodies in the remote Universe, that lie in Vortexes, beyond the reach of the great Luminary. At present let us be content with what our <hi>Microscope</hi> demonstrates; and the former Observations, I am sure, will give all ingenious persons great occasion, both to admire Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Anomaly in the Fabrick, as well as in the number of Eyes, which she has given to several Animals: We see the <hi>Tunica Cornea</hi> in most Insects is full of perforati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if it were a <hi>Tunica Vvea</hi> pinked full of Holes, and whereas perfect Animals, have but one Aperture, these Insects have a thousand Pupils, and so see a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58849:52"/>
Hemisphere at once: and indeed 'tis worth our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to think, that since their Eye is perfectly fixed, and can move no wayes; it was requisite to lattice that Window, and supply the defect of its Motion, with the multiplicity of its Apertures, that so they might see at once what we can but do at several times, our Eyes having the liberty and advantage to move every way (like Balls in Sockets) which theirs have not.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, We observe no diaphanous parts in those lattic'd Eyes, since it is probable, that the Horney Coat of the Eye serves also for a <hi>Pericranium</hi> for their Brain: For, that the Brain of most Insects lies in their Eyes, seems to me more than a probability. First, because in Flies, Butter-flies, Bees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you can find no other place in their Heads, wherein any matter analogous to the Brain, can be lodged. Secondly, in the Eyes of those Insects you shall alwayes find great store of a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous substance, like to be Brain in those Creatures. Thirdly, the Eyes in all Insects are very large, and seem disproportional to so small Bodies, if intended for no other use than Vision. Fourthly, why may not this lattic'd film of their Eye be their <hi>Tunica Retina,</hi> which as it is concave in us, is convex in them; and as it is made of the Brain in us, so it is in them, and therefore lies contiguous to it, and may indeed be over-cast, by a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent <hi>Cornea,</hi> through which the Net-work of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour film may thus eminently appear; For certainly such Animals as have distinction of Senses, as Seeing, Feeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must needs have an Animal-Sensation; an Animal, I say, for I hold also a natural Sensation, which is performed without a Brain, and such an one is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable even in Animals, and in our own Selves; for besides the Animal-Sensation (whose original is in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58849:53"/>
Brain) the Stomach, Guts, and the <hi>Parenchymata</hi> of the Body, yea and the Bloud too has a natural Sensation of what is good, and what is bad for them, as Doctour <hi>Harvey</hi> has excellently proved, <hi>Lib. de Gener.</hi> and so some of the lowest rank of Animals (as the <hi>Zoophyta</hi> and plant-Animals) may perchance be utterly devoid of Animal, and have onely a Natural Sensation; but this belongeth to some Anatomical Observations I have by me, where I may perchance prove that all Vegetables (as well as the Sensitive and humble Plants) have this latter kind of Sensation, as well as Animals.</p>
                        <p>But let us return to the Eye again, of which curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Organ I am tempted to say much more; but that I have reserved that discourse as more proper for my Telescopical Observations. Onely for the present, to encourage the Lovers of free Philosophy, and to let them see that even the greatest Oculists and Dioptri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writers, that the World ever saw, <hi>Kepler, Des-Cartes, Schemar,</hi> and <hi>Hugenius,</hi> have not yet discovered all Nature's Curiosities, even in that Organ; I will here deliver one or two Optical Experiments: The first hints whereof, I must ingeniously confess, I received from some Fragments and Papers of our famous, and never to be forgotten Country-man, Master <hi>Gascoign</hi> of <hi>Midleton</hi> near <hi>Leeds,</hi> who was unfortunately slain in the Royal Service for His late Majesty; a Person he was of those strong Parts and Hopes, that not onely we, but the whole World of Learning suffered in the loss of him.</p>
                        <p>Take a fresh Eye, and, in a frosty Evening, place it with the Pupil upwards, where it may be frozen through, then in the Morning you may cut it as you please. If you cut it with a plain Parallel to the Optick Axis (which

Section <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> thought impossible) then shall you see all the Parts, as he has pictured them <hi>pag.</hi> 92. and each part will be very different in colour, and remain in their natural Site, which may be pricked forth in an oyled Paper: By this trick also you shall find, that there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crystalline humour, one circum-included within the other; if you do but thaw the Crystalline you shall see the outward will pill off from the inward: The right Figures of both which Crystallines are monstrous diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, if not impossible, to find out; hence it follows that every Ray of incidence is seven times refracted in the Eye before it reach the <hi>Retina,</hi> whatsoever <hi>Scheinar</hi> says to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>The second Experiment, is one of the ingenious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitations of M. <hi>Gascoign's,</hi> and it is to delineate the prime parts of the Eye; after this manner: Having a Glass and Table fitted to observe the Eye's spots, place an Eye with the Horny Tunicle either upwards or downwards, between the inmost Glass and Table; so near the Glass, as the Eye will almost fill up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the Eye's Image, then the representation of the Eye will be very large (proportionable to the Eye's Image) upon the Table, and thus you may prick out the three Figures of the <hi>Cornea,</hi> and the outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Crystallines. Many other neat wayes with my Dioptrical Glasses can I take the Figures of the prime Parts of the Eye, which shall be discovered in their fit places.</p>
                        <p>And now having done with the Fabrick, the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations lead us to the Consideration of the Number and Plurality of Eyes, that Nature hath afforded some Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. I must confess though I have been very curious and critical in observing; yet I could never find any
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58849:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Animal that was monocular, nor any that had a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Eyes, except Spiders, which indeed are so fair and palpable that they are clearly to be seen by any man that wants not his own. And though <hi>Argus</hi> has been held as prodigious a fiction as <hi>Polypheme,</hi> and a plurality of Eyes in any Creature, as great a piece of monstrosity, as onely a single one; yet our glasses have refuted this Errour (as <hi>Observat.</hi> viii. and ix. will tell you:) so that the Works of Nature are various, and the several wayes, and manifold Organization of the Body, inscru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; so that we had need of all the advantages that Art can give us, to discover the more mysterious Works of that divine Architectress; but especially, when she draws her self into so narrow a Shop, and works in the retiring Room of so minute an Animal.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, Many more hints might be taken from the former Observations, to make good the Atomical Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis; which I am confident will receive from the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope</hi> some further advantage and illustration, not onely as to its first universal matter, Atoms; but also, as to the necessary Attributes, or essential Properties of them, as Motion, Figure, Magnitude, Order, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of them in several Concretes of the World; especially if our <hi>Microscopes</hi> arise to any higher perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and if we can but, by any artificial helps, get but a glimpse of the smallest Truth, it is not to tell what a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of Philosophy may be raised from it; (for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with that Patriark of Experimental Philosophy, the Learned Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ake a Glass-Tube of above 29 inches in length, as AB, closed at the end B, and open at A: fill it full of Quicksilver, and so close the end A, exactly with the thumb (as with a stoppel;) then reverse it, and putting it and your finger together into the wooden vessel D, fill'd about two inches deep with Quicksilver, erect it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly therein; then drawing away your finger from the orifice, your shall see a great part of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58849:58"/>
Quicksilver in the Tube to make a quick and smart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent into the external Quicksilver in the vessel; and after it hath, by several vibrations up and down, found out a certain point or degree, there to stand still and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable: so that all the upper part of the Tube (which the <hi>Mercury</hi> has deserted) <hi>viz.</hi> from E to B, will seem to be a vacuity.</p>
                        <p>The first Inventor of this noble Experiment, was <hi>Torricellius</hi> the eminent Mathematician, and deserved Successour to the famous <hi>Gallilaeo,</hi> to whom all the Common-wealth of Learning are exceedingly oblieg'd, because thereby he has excited the greatest modern Wits to higher and nobler Experiments.</p>
                        <p>In this <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment (for so we shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hereafter call it) let me give you notice of these rare Observables:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If the Tube be not longer then 29. inches, the Quicksilver will not at all descend: this we have tryed in several Tubes of 18, 21, and 26 Â½ inches long.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In Tubes of a greater length then 29. inches, the Quicksilver will descend.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Quicksilver will not descend lower then 29. inches, or thereabouts; that is, the Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube will alwayes be 29. inches in height above the superficies of the restagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> in the vessel.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Quicksilver descends neither more nor less in Tubes of a greater or lesser Bore, provided they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the length of 29. inches.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. How long soever the Tube be, the Quicksilver will fall down to its wonted pitch and stint of 29. inches or thereabouts; as we have tryed in Tubes of 32, 35 Â½, 37, 45, and 50 inches in Longitude, and all of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Diameters and Bores.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="91" facs="tcp:58849:58"/>6. If you add any more Quicksilver to that in the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, then, that in the Tube rises proportionally the higher: and contrariwise, if you take any Quicksilver out of the vessel, that in the Tube descends lower; and so consequently, the internal Quicksilver in the Tube keeps alwayes the same height of that in the vessel.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That you may with great facility move the Tube to and fro in the vessel'd Quicksilver, but not draw it up towards the superficies of the external Quicksilver in the vessel without some reluctancy.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That if you tilt or incline the Glass-Tube, you shall see the Quicksilver gradually to ascend till it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most totally fill the Tube, at which Angle of Inclination the atletus or perpendicular will be equal to 29. inches, let the Tube be of what length soever.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. That upon removal of your finger from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, you shall see the Quicksilver to make a very Quick and Smart descent six inches at least below the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of its Altitude in the Glass of 45. inches long, and in others more or less; and after a few vibrations up and down, to settle at its wonted pitch and altitude of 29. inches, or thereabouts.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. That if any thing, considerably hot or cold, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Superiour part of the Tube, the Quicksilver therein will more or less ascend or descend, as the water in a Weather-glass, though with farr feebler and more insensible effects: So that any time of the year it will not much desert nor surmount the determinate height and pitch aforesaid of 29. inches.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. That this seeming vacuity in the Tube would be judged by any one that came in at an adventure, to be nothing but such like illuminated ayr as this we breathe in.</p>
                        <p n="12">
                           <pb n="92" facs="tcp:58849:59"/>12. If you dip your thumb into the vessel'd <hi>Mercury,</hi> and close the orifice of the Tube therin, and so gently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse it, you shal see the Quicksilver in the Tube to move more swiftly (though not without resistance, and ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) through that seeming vacuity; and the <hi>Mercury</hi> will pass with such shoggs towards the depressed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of the Tube, as will make you apprehend that the Tube will be either beaten out of your hand or broken: none of which <hi>Phaenomena</hi> will appear, if you let in the outward ayr into the cavity unpossessed by the <hi>Mercury.</hi> In which Interim of Motion, your thumb will be drawn and suck'd into the orifice of the Tube, not without some considerable pain.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. If before the removal of your thumb you reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge it again into the vessel'd Quicksilver as before, &amp; then draw the Tube perpendicularly quite out of the vessell'd Quicksilver, the Quicksilver in the Tube will rise to the top of the Glass with such a violence as will indanger the knocking out of the head of the Glass, and then the ayr will pass by a speedy ebullition through the Quicksilver, and it will totally descend into the vessel. I once brake a Glass-tube of near forty inches long, by plucking it suddenly out of the vessel'd <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="14">14. That you cannot so cautiously perform this Experiment in any Glass Tube whatsoever, but some little Air will be seen in the top of the Tube, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed, and before the removal of your Thumb, like the little Cap of Air in the obtuse end of an Egge; so that if you incline the Tube to what Angle soever (as in the eighth Observable aforesaid) the re-ascending Quicksilver will never totally and exactly fill the Tube, but a little Cap of Air will still stand in the top thereof.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. That, use all the Artifice and Industry you can,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58849:59"/>
you cannot so cautiously fill the Tube, but that the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of Quicksilver will seem cragged and itched, and never purely smooth and polished, (though your Glass be never so smooth and dry, and your Quicksilver never so well purged) which interstices are filled up with Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Air that lurk 'twixt the Contiguities of the Glass and Quicksilver: and which after the descent of the Quicksilver do bubble up, and shoot themselves little by little into that seeming vacuity (as you may ocularly behold them) and doubtless are the occasion and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance why upon inclination of the Tube (as in 8. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv.</hi>) the Quicksilver cannot totally replenish and fill the Tube again.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. We filled a Tube of 27. inches with Quicksilver, and after inversion of it into a Vessel of Quicksilver, as in the <hi>Torricellian</hi>-Experiment we perceived, just upon retracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the finger, the little Particles of Air which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained lurking between the sides of the Tube and the Quicksilver, on the suddain to become more visible, by a violent and rapid dilatation, flying out like so many little Springs wound up, and then all at once set at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. If you immerge the Tube into Vessels of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver of several Capacities and larger Surfaces, the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of it will not alter.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Observe that the height of the Mercurial Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which here with us is found to be 29. inches at the least (if you order the Tube handsomely in filling of it) may seem greatly different from the <hi>French</hi> Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and those of Forrain Experimenters, as <hi>Parricellius</hi> himself, Doctor <hi>Pascal, Roberual,</hi> Doctor <hi>Pettit,</hi> and <hi>Pecquet,</hi> who all assign its Altitude to be but about 27. inches. To this I shall onely at present answer, that this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58849:60"/>
difference of the Mercurial Cylinder, may partly arise from the variations of the Climates, the Air being more thin and hot then ours, partly from the difference and altitude of the Atmosphere here and there, (as shall hereafter be made more intelligible) and partly from the diversity of our measures and theirs, or from the club and combination of all these causes joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To which I may well super-add, the negligence or inconsideration of those that try this Experiment; for you may alter the height of the Mercurial Cylinder, as you do rudely or cautiously tunnel in the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver into the Tube; for I have some time with exact caution, made it to rise to 30. inches in altitude from the Surface of the restagnant Quicksilver in the Vessel. I set down 29. inches as its determinate height, to which it will for the most mount, though you use but a careless kind of carefulness in the management of the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. For, the Space deserted hath both Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity, therefore a Body; for the very nature of a Body consists onely in extension, which is the essential and unseparable property of all Bodies whatsoever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Again we have the sensible eviction of our own eyes to confute this Suppositional Vacuity; for we see the whole Space to be Luminous (as by <hi>Obser.</hi>) Now Light must either be a Substance, or else how should it subsist (if a bare Quality) in a Vacuity where there is nothing to support it?</p>

                        <p>First, By the flushing out of the Quicksilver, upon removal of your finger into the Vessel where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagnant Quicksilver receives it:</p>
                        <p>Secondly, By the re-ascent of the Quicksilver upon tilting or plucking the Gun quite out of the restagnant Mercury, as also by the forceable introsuction of your finger, if you close the muzzle of the Barrel within the Vessel'd Mercury, and so draw it out and reverse it, as also by the plucks and shogs it will give in that action:</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, and most perceptibly, By the repletion of it with water, if you draw the Tube gently out of the Quicksilver in the Vessel into a super-incumbent regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of water (which you first poured into the same Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel:)

                        <p>HAving filled, closed, and reversed the Tube AB as before into the vessel'd Quicksilver D, fill up the said Vessel with water about 2. inches deep, then lifting the Tube gently, but perpendicularly out of the vessel'd Quicksilver into the region of water, you shall see the Quicksilver and Water rise to the top of the Glass, and after a short (but confused) intermixion the one with the other, the Quicksilver will totally descend into the Vessel, and the water arise and fill the whole Tube excepting a little cap of Air in the top of the Tube, formerly hinted at in <hi>Obser.</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>Now if that Air in the Tube was Homogeneous to this in the Atmosphaere, the water would never rise to thrust it out of its proper place, or, if it did, it could not squeese through the Body of the Tube; but we plainly see the rising water does fill up the place (as likewise the Quicksilver does in the first Experiment, where you tilt and incline it) till it come to that particle of Air, which indeed is of the same nature with ours (and which we told you formerly lurked 'twixt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Surface of the Tube and the Cylinder of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver) and that neither the rising water nor ascending Quicksilver, can or does exterminate.</p>
                        <p>This Truth also is manifestly evinced from the twelfth Observable annexed to the first Hydrargyral Experiment, which palpably shows that it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Air which supplies that seeming Vacuity.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pecquet</hi> (who I think follows <hi>Roberuallius</hi> therein) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously conceives, that the whole mass of Ayr hath a Spontaneous Eleter, or natural aptitude in it self to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and expand it self upon the removal of all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambient obstacles (which he calls the Elastical motion of that Element) so that the particle of Ayr may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be as many little Springs, which if at liberty, and not bound and squeesed up, will powerfully, strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and spontaneously dilate and stretch out themselves, not onely to fill up a large room, but to remove great bodies: So that he compares this vast Element of Air, circumfused about this terraqueous Globe, to a great heap of Wooll-fleeces or Sponges, piled one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the superiour particles of the Ayr pressing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, and hindring their continual tendency to a self-dilatation; so that all the particles of this <hi>Atmosphaere</hi> (especially the inferiour sort) strive at all times to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand and dilate themselves: and when the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistency of other contiguous Bodies to them is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then they flye out into their desired expansion (or at least will dilate so far as neighbouring Obstacles will permit:) Just like the Spring of a Watch (which if the String be broke, presently flyes out into its fullest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion:)
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58849:64"/>
which Elastick motion in the Ayr then ceases, when it comes to an aequilibration with those circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Bodies that resisted it.</p>
                     <p>That this is not onely an Ingenious Hypothesis, but that there is much of reality and truth in it, I think our following Experiment will to safety of satisfaction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.</p>
                     <p>Onely we differ from <hi>Pecquet</hi> in the strict notion he hath of Rarefaction and Condensation, which he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth to be performed without either intromission or exclusion of any other extraneous Body whatsoever. Now how Ayr or any other Body should diminish or augment its Quantity (which is the most close and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Attribute to Bodies) without change of its own Substance, or at least without a reception or exclusion of some other extrinsecal Body, either into, or out of the Porosities thereof, sounds not onely harsh to our ears, but is besides an unintelligible difficulty.</p>
                     <p>Now though we cannot by Sensible and Mechanical Demonstration shew how any new Substance or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler matter (than Ayr is) which enters into the Tube to replenish that seeming vacuity, and to fill up the aerial interstices (which must needs be considerable in so great a self-dilation) yet we must (considering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of rarefaction aforesaid) be forced to believe it: and perhaps some happy Experimenter hereafter may come to give us a better then this Speculative and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Evidence of it.</p>
                     <p>That the hollow Cylinder in the Tube is not onely fill'd up with the dilated particles of Ayr, but also with a thin Aetherial Substance intermingled with them:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let us suppose therefore (at random if you please)
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58849:64"/>
that there is a thin subtle aetherial substance diffused throughout the Universe; nay, which indeed, by farr the greatest thereof: in which all these Luminous and Opace Bodies (I mean the Starrs and Planets) with their Luminous and Vaporous Sphaeres (continually ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviating from them) do swim at free and full Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us consider that this aether is of that Subtil and Penetrative Nature, that like the Magnetical Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums, it shoots it self through all Bodies whatsoever, whose small pores and interstices are supplyed and fill'd up with this aetherial Substance, as a Sponge with water.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let us add to the former Considerations, that the Ayr hath not onely a strong Elatery of its own (by which it presses continually upon the Earth, and all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies circuminclosed by it) but it also ponderates, and is heavy, in its own Atmosphaere.</p>
                     <p>But because I am resolved you shall take nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the trust and reputation of the best Authour, take this Experiment to prove the Ayr's gravitation (<hi>in proprio Loco</hi>) as the vulgar Philosophy cals it.</p>

                        <p>THe 6. of <hi>May,</hi> 1653. I took two Tubes, one of 45. inches, the other 35 Â½ in length, and of different Diameters; and filling them both at the Bottom of <hi>Hallifax-Hill,</hi> the Quicksilver in both came down to its wonted pitch of 29. inches, thence going immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the top of the said Hill, and repeating the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again, we found it there to fall more then half an inch lower then it did at the bottom or foot of the said Hill.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pecquet</hi> relates, That Dr. <hi>Pascal</hi> himself tryed this Experiment upon a Mountain of 500 perches high, near <hi>Claramont,</hi> and he found Quicksilver there at the Hill to descend lower by three inches, and somewhat more, then it did at the bottom; so that, according to the Analogy &amp; Proportion of both, and some other considerable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, we might not only Mechanically find out the Perpendicular height of our great Hill here at <hi>Hallifax,</hi> or any other Mountain whatsoever, but venture notably at the height of the Atmosphaere it self.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="105" facs="tcp:58849:65"/>For, to manage the Principles we have formerly laid down, First, The reason why the Quicksilver descends at all in the first Experiment, is from its exceeding gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Secondly, Why it falls no lower then 29. because a Cylinder of that weight does just aequipoise the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick power of the Ayr without, and therefore after a few vibrations up and down (as is Observable in all Statick Experiments) they arrive at a Counterpoise.</p>
                        <p>But the reason now (as to our particular Mountain's Experiment) why the Counterpoise should alter at the top from that at the bottom of the Hill, and the descent of the Quicksilver be so unequal, is not so much from any alteration in the Elastick power and virtue of that Ayr at the top, from that at the bottom of the Hill; as from the variation of the gravity of the Superincum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Ayr: For, a longer, and so consequently, more weighty Columne of Ayr, presses upon the vessel'd Quicksilver at the bottom of the Mountain, and so makes the Quicksilver in the Tube, rise higher than at the top of the Mountain; which being so much nearer the top of the Atmosphaere, a lesser weight of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderant Ayr makes a lesser quantity of Quicksilver arise in the Tube: and so come the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to vary in their Altitudes, <hi>viz.</hi> from the natural Supergravitation of more or less of the Superincumbent Atmosphaere. So that it is more than probable, that the higher one rises in the Ayr, to try this Experiment, the Quicksilver in the Tube would fall down lower; and if the Experiment could be try'd at the top of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphaere, no Quicksilver at all would remain in the Tube, but fall down to a level with that in the vessel. I could wish that some of our <hi>Canary</hi>-Merchants would get this Experiment try'd at the top of the Pike of

                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But I see you are ready to reply, and say, That the inequality of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder (in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Experiment aforesaid) may every whit as ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be supposed to proceed from a change in the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick property of the Ayr, which may be more vigorous at the bottom, and more faint and feeble at the top of the Hill, and so force a greater or lesser quantity of Quicksilver up into the Tube.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 2. I know how harsh it sounds, That Ayr should gravitate in its own Sphaere, and we, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Terrestrial Inhabitants, be insensible of it; and that which augments the improbability, is, That Water we experimentally know (which is a fluid and dissipable Body, as Ayr is) does not gravitate in its own proper place; for if we dive never so deep, it's so far from depressing of them lower, or weighing on them, that it is readier to buoy them up again: And why should not we conclude the like of its next neighbouring Element, the Ayr?</p>
                        <p>To the first Objection, I answer, That though I should grant that there should be some difference in the Elatery of some of the aerial particles from others, yet to be so great in so small a distance as four or five furlongs, 'tis not so easily credible.</p>

Let the vessel of water be of a greater or lesser plane in the surface, it matters not; because onely those parts of water that hang perpendicularly over the vessel'd Quicksilver do gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon it: We drown'd a Tube to 25. inches in depth, above the Superficies of the vessel'd Quicksilver, and it raised the Quicksilver in the Tube about 1 <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

now we may retort upon the Second Objection, and say, That if water do gravitate, then why not Ayr in their proper Sphaere? both being fluid, dissipable, and co-neighbouring Elements; and so consequently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Ayr or Water the Experiment be tryed, this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will follow, That the deeper you immerge the Tube in either Element, the higher will the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder rise: And contrariwise, As 32. foot of Superjacent wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would raise up a <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder of 29. inches; So the same Cylinder of 29. inches is raised by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of the height of the whole Atmosphaere it self.</p>
                        <p>But we may by a far more facile and cheaper Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment evince the gravitation of Water in its Sphaere, which is observable in the common Experiment of a Syphon; through which, the water, by Suction, being first set on motion, it is easily observable, that the flux in the extravasated leg of the Syphon, is at first most strong; and proportionally decreases, as the water in the vessel sinks lower and lower towards the bottom of that leg immerg'd in it: which cannot proceed from any other cause imaginable, but from the Supergravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the high parts of the water upon the lower, which being thereby more strongly forced up the shorter leg of the Syphon, the flux thereby is stronger in the longer; and so faints, as the bulk of the Superponderant continually decreases.</p>

                        <p>The Reasons of all those extravagant <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi> which we observed in the first Experiment of <hi>Torricellius.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. BEcause the smaller weight of Quicksilver is not able to master the Elastick pressure of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ayr.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because then the Cylinder of Quicksilver Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderates and overpowers both the Ayr's Elastick vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and gravity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because at that stint of 29. inches, the internal Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of Quicksilver comes to an aequilibration with the external Cylinder of Ayr, which presses upon the vessel'd Quicksilver.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. and 5. Because that in wider and longer Tubes there is at first included a greater quantity of Quicksilver, it does more strongly overpower the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick resistence of the Ayr, and so will come (though with more vehemence and swiftness) to its wonted Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 29. inches.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Because by Addition or Diminution of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel'd Quicksilver there is a change in the Tube and Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, but not in the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder in the Tube; for that alwayes keeps at an equal Altitude from that in the Vessel.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Because the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder is very heavy, and Quicksilver in Quicksilver moves as easily as a Bucket of water in the whole Well.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:58849:68"/>8. Because thereby there is onely a change in the Tube, but not in the Altitude of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for in that Angle of Inclination, the Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is still 29. inches.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Because the Quicksilver, by its long descent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acquired a greater motion than was requisite to bring it down to its determinate Altitude, cannot sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly stop there, but by several vibrations up and down, gradually comes back to its wonted Altitude; as we see Pendents, which multiply their undulations before they rest in their desired Perpendicularity.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Because the Atoms of Fire and Heat (which is alone) penetrating through the Tube, do expand and dilate the aetherial Ayr in that seeming Vacuity, and so consequently depresse the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder; or else, contrariwise, upon the approach of cold, some aetherial Atoms pass out again through the Glass, and so the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial</hi> Cylinder mounts higher.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Because it is a Medium somewhat thinner than Ayr alone is; the reason of your finger's exuction may be the Elastick pressure of the external Ayr, without striving either to come in it self, or thrust any other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the Tube; as also the Tendency of the aetherial Atoms within, to be a free and proportional commixtion with Aerial particles without.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Because when the Continuity of the external and internal Quicksilver is broke, the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is by the Elastick pressure of the Ayr (which then prevails) forced up into the top of the Tube; which done, then the Quicksilver, by its gravity overpowring, the Atmosphaerical, or unexpanded Ayr, falls down, and gives place to the lighter Body.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Because no Contiguity, it seems, in dry Bodies
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58849:68"/>
(how close soever) can exclude the interveniency of Ayr.</p>
                     <p>Having in our last (9. <hi>Experiment</hi>) proved suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the ponderosity of Water, and its gravitation upon the external Quicksilver in the Vessel, we will now come to shew you likewise its gravitation upon the internal Quicksilver in the Tube.</p>

                        <p>WE took such a like AB (as in the 1. <hi>Eperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) near four foot in length, and fill'd it full of Quicksilver, except a Segment (A of about 14. inches, which we filled up with water;) then reversing the Tube, and holding it so long in that posture, till the Quicksilver and Water had exchanged their places, we then drown'd it in the Vessel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â¢</desc>
                           </gap>d Quicksilver D, and there withdrawing our finger (as in the 1. <hi>Experiment</hi>) the Quicksilver in the Tube descended an inch, and more, lower than the ordinary stint, (<hi>viz.</hi> within 2 Â½ inches of that in the Vessel:) and this we try'd in Glass-Tubes of 40. and 45. inches in Longitude: So that the Tube will be replenished with three Cylinders (<hi>viz.</hi>) of Quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Water, and Ayr.</p>
                        <p>In which Experiment there are three or four remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Appearances, which ought not to pass our Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That after inversion of the Tube into the vessel'd Quicksilver, before you draw away your finger from the Orifice, you may observe continual Bubbles of Ayr to pass through the Water by an Ebullition, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58849:69"/>
to create the little Cap of Ayr, formerly observed (in our 14. <hi>Observ.</hi>) though in the interim the Orifice A, be never so closely stopped.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That after the removal of your finger, and collap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Mercury</hi> to, as aforesaid, the volatile bubbles of Ayr still pass through the Region of Water for a long time.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That if the Cylinder of Quicksilver, included in the Tube, be not above 29. inches, besides that of the Water, no effect at all will follow.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That if the Cylinder of Quicksilver, included in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tube, be but one inch higher than its ordinary pitch, then, upon making the Experiment, it will fall proportionally lower, according to the weight of the Supergravitating Water.</p>
                        <p>This Experiment, with those considerable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances annexed to it, makes the Water's gravitation more eminently appear: For, since 14. inches of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is almost aequiponderant to one inch of Quicksilver (as is evident by the Statick Tables of <hi>Getaldi</hi>) and the Quicksilver in the Tube being depressed by the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incumbent Cylinder of Water of 14. inches, it follows, that it would necessarily depress it one inch lower than the ordinary stint.</p>
                        <p>But unless the Cylinder of Quicksilver be so great, (or at least that of Quicksilver and Water to be so powerful) as that it be able to overcome the Elastick pressure of the Atmosphaere, no effect at all will follow, because there can be no descent of either: and as for those Aerial Atoms which pass by bubbles through the Body of the Water, they are those formerly observ'd for to lurk 'twixt the Contiguity of the Quicksilver and Tube; nay, and perchance, and in the Body of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58849:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Quicksilver and Water too, because they cease not after the collapsion and descent of the <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus having Mechanically evinced the gravitation of those two fluid Elements, both Water and Ayr, in their proper places and regions; we may come to make good the second Part of our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which is the Air's Elastick virtue and property. For the demonstrating of which, take this following Experiment.</p>

                        <p>FIll the Tube (as in the former Experiment) and let the Segment A of 14. inches, which was formerly fill'd with Water, be onely fill'd with Ayr; then, after you have revers'd it into the vessel'd Quicksilver D, and withdrawing your finger, you shall see the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver in the Vessel so to fall, that it came down 16. inches lower then its wonted and determinate Altitude: We fill'd the same Tube, of 45. inches long, within two inches of the top, and then reversing it, as before, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended two inches below the ordinary stint.</p>
                        <p>We also tunnell'd into the Tube a Cylinder of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver, but of five inches in Altitude (letting the Ayr sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the other Segment of 40. inches;) and reversing it, as before, it fell down within two inches of the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver in the Vessel.</p>
                        <p>Observe, that in these mixed Experiments of Ayr and Quicksilver, or Water and <hi>Mercury,</hi> or all three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that when you have revers'd the Tube, you must hold it close stop'd so long perpendicular, till the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies have acquired their several respective and proper places.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="114" facs="tcp:58849:70"/>To this Experiment likewise we must annex one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable <hi>Phaenomenon:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, That before you withdraw your finger, you shall perceive the internal Quicksilver in the Tube, to press so sensibly upon your finger, as if it would force an entrance out, both before and after it was immerg'd in the Vessel'd Quicksilver: which protrusion cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be supposed to proceed from any other cause, but the Elatery of the included Ayr (for the pressure was far greater than the natural gravity of the whole Tube of Quicksilver could make) which (upon the removal of your finger) having got some Liberty to manifest it self, it depells the Quicksilver so far below its determinate height: Hence it appears, that Ayr, besides its gravity, has a nobler rarefactive faculty, by which it forces the Quicksilver to so considerable a descent, whereas Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by its weight onely (as is manifest in the precedent Experiment) and no innate Elatery, did depel the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Quicksilver in the Tube.</p>
                        <p>But because the Ayr's Elatery is one of the chief parts of our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> we will not onely make it good by one, but confirm it by many more succeeding Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</p>

                        <p>FIll any manner of Tube, not above 29. inches in Length, half with Quicksilver, and half with Ayr, and then closing your Orifice with your finger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing it into Vessel'd Quicksilver, as in the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, you shall (upon removal of your finger) see the Quicksilver fall an inch lower then before, as being
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58849:70"/>
depell'd by the dilated Ayr; if then you pour water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the restagnant Quicksilver in the Vessel, to about one inch deep, and draw the Tube out of the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver into the region of Water above, you shall see the Quicksilver hastily to arise some inches in the Tube, and then the Water and it confusedly to intermingle one with the other. Lastly, (the Quicksilver being wholly descended into the Vessel) the Water will arise to fill the one half of the Tube. This we tried in Glasses of 18, 21, and 27 inches in Length.</p>
                        <p>In the first it fell 1. inch, in the second it fell 3 Â½ inches, in the third 5 inches, and more, from the first point it stood at, before you immers'd it in the Vessel'd <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Experiment drew me on to the trial of another: for I thought if Quicksilver would descend with a quantity of Ayr included with it in Tubes below the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired pitch and Standard of 29. inches, then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly some such like effect would follow in Water and Ayr (included in any of the longer sort of Tubes) though much lower then 32. foot, which is found to be the Standard of Water in its Ascent in Pumps and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Instruments (as is besides delivered in <hi>Exper.</hi>)</p>

                        <p>WE therefore fill'd our Glass-Tubes of 45 inches, half with Water, and the rest with Ayr, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards invers'd it into a pail of water, one or two inches deep; the success was, that withdrawing your finger, as before, the internal Water in the Tube, did shoot about two inches lower then before, and with such
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58849:71"/>
like vibrations (though far shorter than those in Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver) Lastly, if you immers'd the Tube one foot deep in the pail of water, the water in the Tube would rise somewhat higher than before.</p>
                        <p>Note, that in these two last Experiments, the descent or fall of the Quicksilver or Water, was most notable about the midst of the Tube, <hi>viz.</hi> when it was equally fill'd with Ayr and Quicksilver, or Ayr and Water.</p>
                        <p>Which Experiments do not onely make good what is formerly delivered of the Ayr's Elastick pressure, but also it renders Doctor <hi>Pascal's</hi> Experiment, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of Water to 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>WE also tried that Experiment of <hi>Roberuallius,</hi> quoted by <hi>Pecquet, pag.</hi> 50. I took one of those little Bladders that are in Fishes, (that in the little Fish, call'd with us, a Graining, is best) and after it had been a few dayes dried, I let out all the Ayr of it, and tyed the mouth of it again so close, that no new Ayr could re-enter; then I gently wet it on the out side, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it down to the bottom of the Tube, that it might the better stick there, and not be buoyed up with the Quicksilver poured in upon it; then cautiously tunnel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Quicksilver, and reversing the Tube, as in the first Experiment, we found that after the Quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was come down to its wonted pitch, the Fish-Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was full blown, and did swim on the top of the Quicksilver; which, upon the admission of the external Ayr, grew instantly flavid and empty again.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="117" facs="tcp:58849:71"/>Now, what else is the reason of the Bladder's intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mescences upon Collapsion of the Quicksilver to its wonted Standard, but the Spontaneous Dilatation and Elastick Rarefaction of that little remnant of Ayr, skulking in the rugosities thereof; and then (upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the circumpressing Quicksilver) expanding it self in the Bladder, as well as that does in the Tube? The reason of its flaccescency, upon admission of external Ayr, is, because then the Elater of the external Ayr is so strong, that it forces the embladder'd Ayr into its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer extension and consistency again.</p>
                        <p>But hold; Before I pass from this Experiment, I must take <hi>Pecquet</hi> in hand, who, upon confidence of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, insults highly over those that admit not of his Rarefaction, but will introduce a new aetherial sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to intermingle with the dilated Ayr to fill up this seeming Vacuity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If any aetherial Substance penetrate the Glass-Tube, it rushes in equally on all sides towards the Bladder, pendent in the Centre; and so, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, would rather press and squeese the vesicle on all sides closer together, than (by an opposite motion, and re-action upon it self) extend and dilate it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Again, Since it enters in so freely at the pores of the Bladder, what should improfen it there? Since the pores, which gave it admittance, are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally open, and manifest themselves so to be, when any external Ayr is admitted into the Tube, for then it seems the aether flyes out indeed, and the Ayr is recondensed again into its natural and ordinary Consistence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58849:72"/>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Again, If the Quicksilver descending do impel the aether through the pores of the Glass, to help the dilated Ayr, in suppliance of that seeming Vacuity; Why should not Quicksilver totally descend, and fill the whole Tube with aether, and so, consequently, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver should descend in any Tube (though lower than the ordinary stint of 29. inches) whatsoever contrary to Experiment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 4. But if there be a Superaerial region of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as much lighter and subtiller than Ayr, as Ayr is then Water, How comes any part of it to be diffused, or dispersed throughout our Elements? Or, if it be, Why should not the aetherial particles fly all away to their proper Sphaere (or be rather forced thither by the continual pressure of these heavier Bodies?) as we see no Ayr will abide in Water, but is forc'd up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its proper region and Element above it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Solut.</hi> 1. We grant, that the aether pierces equally in on all sides of the Tube, and so likewise on all sides of the Bladder (into which it would not have entred) had there been no Ayr at all which had freely open'd in its dilation to receive the coming aether into its intimate recesses.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Solut.</hi> 2. Why the aether hits not out again (during the interim of the Ayr's expansion) may be, because it has either changed its figure, or it and the aÃ«rial parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles may be in a new motion, which may not cease till overpowred by the re-admission of new Ayr. But what's the reason in a Bladder half-blown, and held to the fire, or laid in warm ashes, the internal Ayr should rise and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58849:72"/>
swell up the Bladder, as in this Experiment? If you say, From the Atoms of Fire, or Heat, which penetrate into the Bladder; the same Objection I then make to you, (as he there to me) Why could they not hit out, as well as in, through the same pores? The like may be said of the Ayr in a Weather-Glass, upon application of any thing that is hot to the head of the Tube.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Solut.</hi> 3. Now, why the Quicksilver does not totally descend, we have told you, is from the resistence of the <hi>Atmosphaerical</hi> Ayr, which forces up a Cylinder of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver of that height of 28. inches; but as we have since declared, if the Experiment could be made at the top of the <hi>Atmosphaere</hi> (which is not very high) then it would totally descend, and the aether there would fill the whole Tube.</p>
                        <p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58849:74"/>
any Tractate in all my life, wherein all things are so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously and critically handled, the Experiments so judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously and accurately tried, and so candidly and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly delivered. I no sooner read it, but it rubbed up all my old dormant Notions, and gave me a fresh view of all my former, and almost-forgotten, <hi>Mercurial</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Nay, it had not that effect onely on me, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it excited and stirr'd up the noble Soul of my ever honoured Friend, Mr. <hi>Townley,</hi> together with me, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt these following Experiments.</p>

                        <p>WE took a long Glass-Tube, open at both ends, and put the one end into Quicksilver about one inch deep; then at the upper end we poured in water by a Tunnel: the effect was this, (as was presurmised) That the water rise up to a Cylinder of 14. inches above the surface of the Quicksilver in the Vessel, but then it would rise no higher, but brake through the restagnant Quicksilver in the Vessel, and swum upon the top thereof, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the Series and Chain of our former Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: wherein it is proved, that one inch of Quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is aequiponderant to above one foot of Water; and therefore there was reason that one inch of restagnant Quicksilver should support a Cylinder of 14. inches of Water, but no more. But as touching this proportion of Water and Quicksilver, because we have formerly only given it to you upon trust from <hi>Maximius Gletaldi,</hi> we will now give you an Experimental eviction of it.</p>

We gently lifted one of the legs out of the vessel'd Quicksilver, and then the Quicksilver in that leg rose violently up, so that part of it passed over into the other shank: then having speedily again drown'd the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said leg into the Vessel, we observ'd the Quicksilver in both legs to have fallen much (upon the admission of that Ayr) and to stand in both legs at an equal pitch and height, as it did again the Second time, upon admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a little more Ayr, though the Quicksilver then did not rise high enough to pass over into the other shank as before.</p>

                        <p>The second effect was; Ayr being let in 'twixt C and B, the Quicksilver rose from D, its former Standard, to A: So that from A to B, and C to E (for so far as C it fell upon admission of Ayr) made up its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Standard again.</p>

                        <p>We tried the same Experiment with the like accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and in the same Tube, at the Beakon upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry top of <hi>Pendle</hi>-Hill, on the same day betwixt twelve and one a clock, (the Ayr being there much colder then at bottom, or at new Church aforesaid) though the Sky

                        <p>About three a clock of the same day, the said trial was made (with all the former circumstances) at <hi>Barlow,</hi> the lowest place (for conveniency) near the said Hill, much lower then the place of the first trial, the Ayr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much hotter then at the time of the first trial; and there the Cylinder of Quicksilver was equal to that in the first trial (<hi>viz</hi>) 28/4 inches.

                        <p>WE tried the <hi>Pascalian</hi>-Experiment in a Tin-Tube of 33. foot long, made of several sheets of Tin, and closely soddered up with Peuter: To the upper end whereof we fastned a long Glass-Tube, open at both ends; then, having soddered up the lower end, we rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tube to a Turret at <hi>Townley-Hall,</hi> and fill'd it with water; then closing the top of the Glass-Pipe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersing the other end of the Tin-Tube into a cistern of water a foot deep, we opened the lower end, and perceived the water to fall out of the Glass-Tube into the Tin, but how far we could not tell, onely we conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured to be about the proportion given by Doctor <hi>Pascal; viz</hi> that a Cylinder of water stood in a Tube about 32 foot high: but presently our Glass-tube, at the juncture to the Tin, began to leak, and let in Ayr; so we could make no further process in the Experiment: onely one thing we observed in filling of the Tube, that after the water which we tunnelled in had gone down a pretty way into the Tube, part of it (by the rebounding Ayr) was violently forced up again, and shot out at the upper end of our Glass-tube two or three foot high into the open Ayr: Which Experiment may be a caution to Pump-makers, &amp; all Artificers that deal in Water-works, that they attempt not to draw water higher then 33 foot (its Standard-Altitude) left they lose both their credit, cost, and pains in so unsuccessful a design. For I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in my Lady <hi>Bowles</hi> her new Water-work at <hi>Heath-Hall,</hi> near <hi>Wakefield,</hi> where the Water is raised at least 16. yards high, the simple workman undertook first to

do it by a single Pump; but seeing his endevours were frustrated, he was forced to cut his Cylinder in two Pumps, and to raise it, first, eight yards into a Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cistern, and then by another Pump to raise it out of that other, eight yards, into a cistern above.</p>

                     <p>NOw to salve all these <hi>Mercurial Phaenomena,</hi> as also those mixed Experiments of Quicksilver and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Quicksilver and Ayr, Ayr and Water, in single and double Tubes and Syphons of all Bores, divers learned and ingenious Heads have excogitated several neat, though different, <hi>Hypotheses</hi>: For, to omit the whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of two Grandees, that is, <hi>Valerianus</hi> and <hi>Hobbs,</hi> which so grosly Philosophize: the former affirming the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted space in the Tube to be an absolute Vacuity; the latter, to be replenished with this very Common Ayr which we breathe in; which creeping up 'twixt the Contiguity of the Glass and Quicksilver, fills up that conceited Vacuity. To omit these exorbitant Conceits, I find two or three more intelligible and rational <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first is of <hi>Roberual</hi> and <hi>Pecquet,</hi> of the Ayr's Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticity and Gravitation, which we have formerly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, onely with this addition, That whereas they will have Rarefaction and Condensation to be performed without any increase or loss of quantity (which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be conceived) we admit of an aetherial Substance or Matter intromitted and excluded, the Bodies so chang'd as we formerly explicated.</p>
                     <p>The second <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is of the Vacuist's; such, I
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58849:79"/>
mean, as, though they hold this Spring of Ayr, yet in its dilation will admit of no aether or forrain Substance to enter the pores thereof; but the particles, so dilated, to remain so with interspersed Vacuities: and this opinion hath many eminent Advocates and Avouchers, <hi>Gassend,</hi> Doctor <hi>Ward,</hi> Doctor <hi>Charleton,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The latest Novellist that hath undertaken this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Philosophy, is one <hi>Linus,</hi> aliÃ¢s <hi>Hall,</hi> who hath excogitated a new Principle of his own, whereby he not onely salves all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the <hi>Torricellian</hi>-Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments formerly delivered; but also all those stranger Experiments discovered since by <hi>Gerricus</hi> and <hi>Boyl's</hi> Pneumatical Engines. (His Principles he thus layes down.)</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is an inseparability of Bodies, so that there can be no Vacuities <hi>in rerum natura.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the deserted Space of the Tube (in the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricellian</hi>-Experiment) is fill'd with a small film of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver, which being taken off the upper part of it, is both extenuated and extended through that seeming Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That by this extended film, or rope (as he calls it) of dilated Quicksilver, the rest of the Quicksilver in the Tube is suspended, and kept up from falling into the Vessel.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That this funicle, or rope, is exceedingly rarefied and extended by the weight of the pendent Quicksilver, and will (upon removal of that violent Cause which so holds it) re-contract it self into its former dimensions again, and so draw up what Body soever it hath hold of along with it; as the effluviums of an Electrick upon its retreat, plucks up straws, or any other thing with it that it is able to wield.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:58849:80"/>5. That Rarefaction or Condensation is perform'd without any increase or losse of quantity in the Body so chang'd.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That this Extension of the film of Quicksilver, is not indefinite, but hath a certain limit, beyond which it will not be stretch'd; and therefore if the Tube be of an exceeding great height, the Quicksilver will rather part with another film, and extend that, and so a third, or fourth, till it come to the Standard of 29. inches, where it rests; having not weight, nor power enough to separate another film from it self.</p>
                     <p>Upon reliance on, and encouragement from these Principles, he undertakes all difficulties, and engages with three great Experimental-Philosophers, <hi>Torricelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Schotus,</hi> and <hi>Boyle,</hi> and resolves all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of their Engines.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As first, Why the Quicksilver in the Tube, under 29. inches, descends not at all? Because it sticks with its uppermost surface so close to the top of the Tube, that there is not weight enough to break that adhaesion: the reason whereof is, because there is nothing to succeed in the room of the descending Quicksilver, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it firmly sticks there, <hi>Ne daretur vacuum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In longer Tubes it falls to that Standard, because then the greater weight of the Quicksilver is able to break that linck of Contiguity or Adhaesion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the uppermost surface of the Quicksilver being sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced off, is dilated into a tenuous Column, or Funicle, which supplies that seeming Vacuity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The reason why the internal Quicksilver in the Tube does ascend, upon plucking the Tube out of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58849:80"/>
restagnant Quicksilver, is, Because then (some of the Quicksilver in the Tube falling out) the Contiguity is not onely broke, but the Quicksilver in the Tube being made thereby lighter, the rope is able to pluck it up; which it doth by retracting and shrivelling it self up to the smalness of its former dimension; and thus by no violent distention, but spontaneous, you must perceive all the Experiments of the Weather Glass to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a tenuous Funicle of Ayr, and, in the <hi>Pasca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>-Experiment, by a rope of Water; and so of other Liquors, where this seeming Vacuity is created. By this tast of Philosophy you may easily imagine how he salves all the <hi>Mercurial Phaenomena,</hi> and those of the Pneuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Engine.</p>
                     <p>The Arguments by which he strives to authenticate and make good his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> are these four Negative ones; by which he strives to impugn the Doctrine of those that hold the Ayr's gravitation and Elasticity.</p>
                     <p>The first (which is the main and <hi>Herculean</hi>-Argument) is from the introsuction of the finger, so observable in the <hi>Torricellian</hi>-Experiment: which, saith he, proceeds from something (that is at a stress) within the Tube, and from nothing that is at a full and free Liberty without: this suction and attraction of the finger he proves to be not onely eminently sensible in Tubes above the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard (whether open at both ends, or closed at the one) but also in Tubes under the Standard of 29. inches: for, saith he, take a small Tube, under the Standard, open at both ends, of 20. inches supposed in length, and fill it with Quicksilver, stopping the lower Orifice with your thumb, then closing the upper with your finger,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58849:81"/>
and immerging the lower into restagnant Quicksilver (as in the <hi>Torricellian</hi>-Experiment) you shall (saith he) upon removal of your thumb (though no Quicksilver fall out) feel a palpable suction of your finger, and the Tube will stick so close to the pulp of your finger, that you may quite lift it out of the Vessel, and carry it (with all the Quicksilver pendent in it) up and down the room. Therefore (saith he) the internal Cylinder of Quicksilver in the Tube is not held up by the preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Ayr without; for, if so, whence comes so strong a suction, and so firm an adhaesion of the Tube to your finger? For if the external Ayr thrust the Quicksilver upwards, it can never at the same time draw down the finger too.</p>
                     <p>His second Argument, That the standing Quicksilver in the Tube, is not held up there by the external Ayr, is fetch'd also from another Experiment in the same Tube: For (saith he) fill the same Tube almost full of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver (leaving a little space of Ayr within it) and then immerging it as before, you shall see the Quicksilver to make a considerable descent in it, <hi>viz.</hi> as far as that little Ayr could well be extended, also a strong introsuction of your finger as before: From whence he thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues; If the external Ayr cannot hold up 20. inches of Quicksilver (as we here see;) How can it hold up 29. I pray you (as in the <hi>Torricellian</hi>-Experiment?) This Experiment, as appears by our <hi>Mercurial</hi>-Observations, we made many years ago.</p>
                     <p>His third Argument is from the Non-gravitation of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder: For, saith he, the Quicksilver in that Station (<hi>viz.</hi> after it has fallen to its old Standard)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58849:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is not all ponderous, as you may perceive by your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Orifice of the Tube; from whence, saith he, 'tis plain, that the Quicksilver is there suspended by that tenuous, but tenaceous, rope in the Tube.</p>
                     <p>His fourth Argument is from the difficulty of Sucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Quicksilver up a Tube, open at both ends, of what length soever; through which, saith he, water is easily drawn up to the mouth: And why not Quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? Since here is nothing else required but the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the internal Cylinder of Ayr, which is easily done (saith he) by Suction, as is manifest by the ascension of water, but cannot be performed in Quicksilver (which should as easily be thrust up (to 29. inches at least) by the Superincumbent <hi>Atmosphaere</hi>) as the water which is repugnant to Experience of the fire: he concludes, 'Tis not the external Ayr that causes that effect, neither by its Elasticity, Gravitation, nor both.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Positive Arguments to avouch his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by, he has none at all; onely what he fetches <hi>Ã  po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriori,</hi> from his commodious Solution of Difficulties, and salving the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> better then others have done. For read him through, and you shall see he hangs so like a Tumbler by this rope, that swing him which way you will, you cannot get him off; though, I doubt not, but we shall prove his cord to be a mere rope of sand, and of his own twisting; and Reason will, <hi>Sampson</hi>-like, break it easily in pieces.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 1. IF you fill a Tube of 45. inches in length (as we have shewed you in <hi>Experiment</hi> 11.) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept 15. inches (which let the Ayr supply) and invert it, you shall perceive a greater protrusion of your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by the erupturient Quicksilver, than can possibly be imputed to the Supergravitation of the Quicksilver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Tube: for, if the whole Tube be fill'd with Quicksilver, and inverted, it shall not make such a forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pressure upon your finger (as that Cylinder of Quicksilver and Ayr does) which can be imputed to no other cause, then the Elasticity of the included Ayr; which, striving to dilate it self, detrudes the Quicksilver; and, when liberty is given, it forces it down much lower than its ordinary Standard of 28. inches: which shewes, that there is no such thing as Attraction in the Ayr, but rather a contrary power of Self-extending, and Dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now, I confess, this is but an Argument <hi>quoad sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi> and therefore not so much to be insisted upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not Mechanically demonstrable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Again, this is observable in all Bodies, that are capable of Extension, That still, as their Extension is augmented or increased, so must the force or power be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58849:82"/>
that extends them. As for example, in Ropes or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the first inch of their forced extension is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a lesser power then the second inch would be, and that then the third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now in the third of <hi>Boyle's</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. it is observed, That the Sucker is as easily drawn down, when it is nearer to the bottom of the Pump, as when it is much farther off; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of forced Extension, as is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Again, If (according to <hi>Linus</hi>) the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's intumescency, in <hi>Boyle's</hi> Engine, did proceed from the forced extension of the Ayr in the Receiver; then the first evacuation of the Pump would extend the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more then the second, and that than the third <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the contrary is avouched by his fourth Experiment, <hi>pag.</hi> 47. which proves against the Funicular Doctrine of <hi>Linus,</hi> but neatly makes out the Elasticity of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder'd Ayr, which gradually increases, as the debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Ayr in the Receiver gives room for its expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Again, <hi>Linus</hi> is refuted by the 19. <hi>Experiment</hi> in <hi>Boyle,</hi> which is an Experiment of a four-foot Tube, fill'd with water, and inclosed in the Receiver; by which he found that the water, included in the Tube, did not at all subside after several exsuctions, till the Elasticity of the included Ayr was no longer able to support that Cylinder of water; but, according to <hi>Linus,</hi> it should have subsided at the first exsuction, as well as the Quicksilver did when the <hi>Torricellian</hi>-Experiment was included in the said Receiver.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:58849:83"/>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 5. According to <hi>Linus</hi> his Principles, the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial</hi> Standard should be the same at the top of any eminent Hill, that it is at the bottom, especially if the Temperature of the Ayr be in both places alike; but this is contrary to the Experiments we tried at <hi>Hallifax</hi> and <hi>Pendle-Hill</hi> (as you may see in <hi>Experiment</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 19. also <hi>Experiment</hi> II. <hi>pag.</hi> 45.) where the coldness of the Ayr was a disadvantage to our Experiments; and yet, for all that, you see how considerably the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard did vary. Which Objection <hi>Linus</hi> has ingeniously confess'd to me himself (when once I had the happiness to see him) that he cannot as yet answer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 6. Take a Glass-Tube above the Standard, but of a small Bore, (that will not admit above a great Pea, or Cherry-stone) let it be closed at one end, and fill this with Quicksilver (which you shall find no easie thing to do; for I am sure we were a whole hour in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one, and still were forced to thrust the Quicksilver down into it with a small wire) then reverse it very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into a vessel of restagnant Quicksilver, and after it has come down to its wonted Standard, you may lift the Tube out of the vessel, and carry it up and down with the Quicksilver pendent in it; which will neither fall out, nor rise up to the top, to fill up the reputed Vacuity. Now what sayes <hi>Linus</hi> to this? Why does not his rope shrivel it self up, and pull up this <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder in this Tube, as well as in all others of a larger Bore?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 7. Take a Glass-Syphon A B, and having fill'd both legs with Quicksilver, open the longer into the vessel'd Quicksilver B; the effect is, That the Quicksilver in the longer shank will fall down to C (its

                        <p>TAke a small Capillary Glass-pipe, or Tube, open at both ends; and dipping the one extreme perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58849:84"/>
into the water, you shall see the water spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously arise to a competent height in the Tube, with a quick and smart ascent.</p>
                        <p>Note first, That the inside of the Pipe ought to be very clean, as well from dust, and little bubbles, as films of water, which will remain in the Pipe, when the water is blown, or suck'd out of it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It must be perfectly dry from any other Liquors which will not mingle with water, as Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If you moisten the Pipe first with water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you try the Experiment, the ascent of the water will be more quick and lively.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, That not onely Water, but Milk, Wine, Oil, and other Liquors, except Quicksilver, will likewise rise to a certain height in the said Pipes.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, After the Water has risen to its Standard-height, if you take it out of the Liquor, it shall not fall out at all; if you invert the Pipe, the included Cylinder of water will fall down also to the other extreme: also the deeper you immerge it in the vessel of water, the higher still will it rise in the Pipe, still keeping its Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-Altitude above the surface of the water in the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel: also if you suck it above the Standard, it will still fall back to its wonted Altitude.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, That not onely Water, but Milk, Wine, Oyl, and all other Liquors, will spontaneously arise in the said Pipes; but with this difference, That the heavier the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors are, the lower their Standard is, and the slower is their Ascent to it: thus you shall see Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> will not rise, by one third, so high as water; nor Oyl of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> by â so high as it; which may alter more or less, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the goodness of the said Oyls.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, Now if you take out a Pipe (wherein in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58849:85"/>
of the said Oyls has first risen up to its wonted Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard) and immerge the end thereof into a lighter Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor (as water) you shall see the Oyl fall gradually out into the water, and the Pipe gradually fill with water, and arise to its own Standard; which is higher a great deal than the Standard of either of the said Oyls, as is before delivered: the like will follow in Syphons.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, The smaller Bore that your Tube is of, the higher will your Water arise; yet we could never get it to arise to the height of 5. inches (as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> mentions) though we have attempted it in Tubes almost as small as Hairs, or as Art could make them.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, If the Tubes be of the Bore of an ordinary Quill, or bigger, no Water at all will arise.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, That little or no difference of the water's ascent in the former Tubes is perceptible at the bottom, or top of our Hill.</p>

                        <p>BEnd one of these Tubes into a little Syphon (which you may do by putting it into the flame of a Candle) and then putting the one extreme thereof into a vessel of water, you shall see it presently fall a running on its own accord. Observe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the perpendicular height of the flexure of the Syphon to the water's Superficies, be shorter, or at least exceed not that Standard-height, unto which the water would rise, were it a streight Pipe onely.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the pendent Shank hang not onely lower then the water's Superficies, but by such a determinate Length; for we have found, that if the pendent, or
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58849:85"/>
extravasated Leg be shorter, or equal, or but a little lower then the Superficies of the water in the vessel, no effect at all would follow; but the pendent Leg would hang full of water, without any flux at all. Now what this determinate length is, we conceive the pendent Shank must be longer from the flexure then the Standard of the Liquor would reach; and then it will run as other Syphons do which have a larger Bore: so that you see, the Mechanical reason (which is so universally received by all men) why the pendent Leg in Syphons must be longer than the other, to make the Liquor run out (<hi>viz.</hi>) because the greater weight of water in the pendent Leg, overpoises and sways down that in the shorter, as in a pair of Skales; is not universally true in all Syphons whatsoever.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If to the nose of the pendent Leg you apply a wet piece of Glass, the water then will begin to come out of the Pipe, and run down to the lowermost edge of the Glass; where, gathering it self into round bubbles, it would fall to the ground: but then you must observe that the nose of the pendent Shank be lower than the Surface of the water in the vessel.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58849:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it did run out into the Milk, and one might see it purl up again without mingling with the Milk, at a little dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish hole, like a Spring. Observe:</p>

                           <p>LEt the Glass DEF be fill'd with two several Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, so as they may remain in two distinct Regions, one above another, as AB, without the least mixture; (which may be performed in Milk and Water, placing a broad piece of Cork, or Bread, that will swim so upon the Milk, which must be the lower, as A, being heavier than Water, that it may receive the force of the Water's fal when you pour it upon the Milk:) this done, and the Cork or Bread being taken out, hang the Syphon ACB, first fill'd with Milk, upon the stick DCE, so artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that the longer end A may remain in the Region of Milk, and the shorter end B in the Region of Water; with this caution, That the flexure of the Syphon C be removed no higher from the Milk, than it would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ascend to, if the Syphon was streight: Now (saith Mr. <hi>Charles</hi>) Since in the former Experiment the Water would rise over the top of the Syphon, and drive back the Milk; and afterwards rise to the top thereof, and there swim aloft: why here in the Syphon ACB, the like should not follow, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Water at B drive the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58849:87"/>
Milk, (which is suppos'd first to fill the Syphon) back to C, then to A, where issuing out of the Pipe (as it did in the former Experiment) it would ascend to its proper Region of Water again, and so continue in a Circular Motion perpetually.</p>
                           <p>Now however this same Problem of M. <hi>Charles</hi> might seem probable in the Theory, yet it will prove more than most difficult (if not impossible) in the Practice. For,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. We fill'd the Glass DEF, half full of Milk, and half full of Water, as AB; then hanging the Syphon (first fill'd with Milk) so artificially on the stick DE, so that the longer Shank might reach the Milk A, and the shorter might open into the Superincumbent Region of Water B, we observ'd this effect, That the Milk did for a small time run out of the Orifice B, and seem'd to fall into the inferiour Region of Milk; but at last the Milk (or at least the serous or more watrish parts thereof) so intermixed with the Water (which we could discern by the whiteness and opacity of the Water) that the flux was quite stifled.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Contrary to Mr. <hi>Charles</hi> his Prognosticks, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did not rise up the short Shank, and drive back the Milk, but quietly permitted the Milk to drill through it; though I know it was not material which way the flux was performed, provided it would have been perpetual.</p>
                           <p>The Experiment failing in these two Liquors, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the same again in other two Liquors (which we were sure would not mix;) and to that purpose we fill'd the aforesaid Glass with Oyl of <hi>Tartar per deliquium,</hi> and Spirit of Wine, which we tinged yellow with Saffron, the better to distinguish the Liquors; and then adapting the Syphon, as before, we wish'd for a happy event in the Experiment. But Experience (which ought to be the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58849:87"/>
Mistress of wise men as well as fools) shew'd us the quite contrary; for the Syphon would not run at all, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued full, which we afterwards conjectured to proceed from the <hi>Heterogeneity</hi> of the two Liquors<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> so that the Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> would not break out into the Spirit of Wine, no more than Milk or Water will do into the open Ayr, where the pendent Shank is shorter than the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-height of those two Liquors. So that, it seems, to effect this Experiment indeed, two such Liquors must be found out, as are in some wise <hi>Homogeneous,</hi> and of a Congruity, and the one considerably lighter than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is <hi>tantÃ¹m non impossibile.</hi> For besides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Liquors, we have tried Oyl and Water, and no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all was perceived, for the same reason of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity formerly delivered.</p>
                           <p>But these, and a hundred more Experiments of this nature are every day excogitated and tried by our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Society of <hi>Gresham-Colledge,</hi> which in a little time will be improved into far nobler Consequences and Theories, than can possibly be done by the single Ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of any Person whatsoever.</p>

That the Magnetical Emissions and Fluors, are not bare Qualities, but indeed Corporeal Atoms, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from hence; That this virtue decayes in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of Time (as all Odours do) and is totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd

by Fire in a few minutes, and is capable of Rarity and Density, whence it is more potent near at hand than further off: all which are the proper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Attributes of Bodies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Again, it is further evinced by some Parallel and Analogical effects of Electrical with Magnetical Bodies, that they both work by Corporeal Effluviums; for a well polish'd stick of hard Wax (immediately after frication) will almost as vigorously move the Directory Needle, as the Loadstone it self; onely there is (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others) these considerable differences 'twixt these Eminent Bodies, that the Effluviums of the one, (as being more Gross and Corporeal) are intercepted by any medium; but Magnetical Effluviums are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred (because of their exceeding tenuity) by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of no Body whatsoever. Secondly, Whereas Electrical fluors do presently recoyl by short streight lines to their Bodies again, Magnetical Atoms do not so; but do wheel about, and, by a Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal motion, do make their return unto the Loadstone again, as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> hath excellently declared.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That the Magnetical Effluviums do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed intrinsecally from the Stone, but are certain extrinsecal particles, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching to the Stone, and finding congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pores and inlets therein, are channel'd through it; and having acquired a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby, do continue their Current so far, till being repulsed by the ambient Ayr, they recoyl again, and return in a Vortical Motion, and so continue their revolution for ever, through the Body of the Magnet.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>THis seems probable, first, from this, That if a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net it self be made red hot in the fire, it not onely amits the Magnetical vigour it had in it self before, but acquires a new one, according to the positional Laws in its Refrigeration; so that by inverting the Extremes (as it came out of the fire) you may alter the Poles thereof (at pleasure,) nay, you may change the Polarity of many
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58849:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feeble Stones, by a long Position, in a contrary posture to that which it naturally affects. Both which Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments seem to shew, That the Magnetical Effluviums are not Innate and Congenial to the Stone, but proceed <hi>ab extrinseco, &amp;c.</hi> therefore do impregnate the Stone again, upon their re-admission; or do change its Polarity, as the more powerful streams of Atoms do prevail. The like Experiment (if it could be tried) would doubtless hold good in the great Magnet of the Earth; for the <hi>Terrella</hi> we see in all other <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> is avouched by her Mother-Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 2. The said Argument we may assume from a certain Section of the Stone; for if you divide the Magnet through a meridian, or Saw of a Segment, parallel to the Axis, the former Axis and Poles will quite vanish away; and each Segment, by this division, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a new Axis of its own: which shews, That the external Magnetical Fluors, which pass'd through the Stone, all in one continued stream before, now passe by several currents through both Stones, and so create a new Axis and Poles in either.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 3. Is from the disponent or directive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty (as they call it) of the Stone; for to say, This Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary direction proceeds from it self, is to put a Soul, or Intelligence, at least, into the Stone; which must turn it about (as Angels are fained to do the Coelestial Orbs:) How much more credible is it, That the stream of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms from without, by beating upon the Stone, do turn it to and fro, till they have laid it in such a Position as is fittest for them to run through it, as a stream of water turns a hollow trunk of wood, or a long stick, till it come to lye parallel to its current.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:58849:92"/>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 4. Is from the different effects proceeding from all Effluxions that come from all other Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Magnetical, as Electrical, Odoriferous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all Bodies that effluviate intrinsecally from themselves, their exspirations flye quite away into the open Ayr, and never make any return again to the Body from whence they proceeded, so that in time they do not onely spend their quintessential and finer particles, but even their whole bulk and substance, as is Ocularly manifest in Camphire: Now 'tis not so in Magnetical Bodies, whose exspirations are continual and permanent, because they return in Circumgyrations to their Bodies again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 5. If the Magnetick rayes proceeded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally from the Stone, there is most reason they should proceed from the Centre, the Stone being all of an uniform Substance; as the Luminous rayes doe from the Body of the Sun, and as Odours do from their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; and so there would be no Poles, nor Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Magnets more in one Latitude than in another: But now since there are two Poles, where the Current of Effluxions are strongest, it is a sign the Magnetical Fluors coming from without, doe strike a stream in at one Pole; and finding the grain and bait of the Stone, to lye fit for their Tranation, do channel through to the opposite part of the Stone, and so continue their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Ayr, so far, till they are resisted and forced to recoyl by a double whirlpool-motion round about into the Magnet again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 6. That the Magnetick Fluors proceed not intrinsecally from the Stone, to cause the Self-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the Magnet, is further evident from this new
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58849:93"/>
Experiment: Take a wedge of Iron (which the Smiths call Puncheons) and heating it red-hot, you shall, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws in its refrigeration, endue it with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary verticity, as has been praeobserved by all Magnetick Writers: But that which will heighten the Experiment further, is, That though it hath but acquired a feeble virtue by its refrigeration, yet if you take it up cold, and with a few smart strokes of a great Mall, or Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, you beat the one end of it, setting the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some hard resisting matter, as Stone, Brass, Iron, or hard Wood, you shall thereby give it a most powerful Magnetisme, so that it will then as actively move the Needle, at a good distance, as the Loadstone it self: Now, say I, by those percussions you did so open and relax the pores in the Iron-wedge, that the Magnetical Atoms could then enter in, with a full Carriere, which before they could not; and having once got so free a passage, they will maintein the Current ever after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 7. Since a constant, steddy, and polary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of parts is onely observable in Bodies Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, we have reason to think and believe, that these Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical <hi>Effluvia</hi> (which are the cause of this peculiar di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection) are not only transmitted and channel'd through the Earth, but through many other Coelestial Bodies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as â <g ref="char:Moon">â½</g> â â, and, perchance, the rest of the Planets yea and Fixed Stars too, as by <hi>Telescopical Observations</hi> is now made very manifest in those Bodies that swim with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Planetary Systeme.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 8. Take a Rod of Iron (or a Puncheon) as before; heat it red-hot, and according to the Laws in its refrigeration, you may endue this or that Extreme
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58849:93"/>
with whether polarity you please; now afterwards by striking it with a Hammer in the same posture that it was cooled in, you may much advance and invigorate its Magnetical virtue, as we have formerly declared: But now the main Observable of all, is, That after both the reception of the virtue by convenient refrigeration, as also the augmentation of it by percussion, you may by inverting and repercussing the Extremes, alter the pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Iron at your pleasure; and then, which is stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that if you strike the Iron in the middle 'twixt the two Extremes, it will destroy its formerly acquired Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netism.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 9. If you bore with a Wimble in any hard piece of wood, till you heat it soundly, you will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to it a strong Verticity, insomuch that it will nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly turn a Magnetical Needle; but if with a dril of Iron or Steel you bore a piece of Brass or Iron till you heat it well, it will acquire so strong a Magnetism thereby, that it will not only turn an equilibrated Needle, but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously attract, and lift up a small Needle: and I have observed the small filings and shavings which fall out of the Drill-hole, to stick to the point of the Drill, as if it had been to a Magnet it self; which shews, that the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Atoms did more easily by far enter into the Drill or Wimble, when the parts thereof were heat and set in Motion, than before.</p>
                     <p>Which still seems to make out, That the Magnetical Atoms rather enter into, than proceed from those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies we call Magnetical, as the reaching soul of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> hath happily supposed.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> That the World was not made Primarily, nor Solely for the use of Man, nor in subserviency unto Him and his Faculties.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS I would not derogate from the Greatness and Eminency of Man (as being a very Noble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;) so I would not have him arrogate too much to himself: For though it may be a pious, and morally good conception, To think that the whole world was made for him, yet I am sure 'tis no real and Physical Truth.</p>
                     <p>For first, How many glorious Bodies of vast Bulks, and immense Distances, have appeared, nay, and may yet appear to future ages (as Comets and New Stars) which are now gone and vanish'd again, which no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man ever understood the reasons and causes of, nor received no good nor evil, either before or since their appearances? Nay, How many such Comets may have been near the Sun, whose first rise, continuation, and disappearance may have been made in six moneths time, of which (by reason of the Sun's vicinity to them) we could never see nor know any thing? Who can be so irrational, as to think that those innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Stars (with which the <hi>Via Lactea</hi> is powdred) and many other parts of Heaven are throng'd (as the <hi>Pleia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>) in which very Subconstellation I have seen above 20. Stars of a considerable Magnitude, and lesser ones
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58849:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
innumerable, also the <hi>Hyades,</hi> the <hi>Stellae Nebulosae,</hi> &amp;c. were ever made for the use of Us and our Earth, since they are at that immense distance, and invisible to our eyes; and had remain'd eternally so, had not the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable invention of <hi>Telescopes</hi> relieved our eye-sight herein? Nay, to come nearer, Who can imagine that any of the primary Planets were wholly designed for the service of Us and our Earth; whereas, if most of them were pluck'd out of the Heavens, we should no more feel the want of them, than the Countrey Swain that already knows of no such Wanderers? What then must we think of the Secondary Planets, as the Circum-Saturnian, and the four Jovialists, which are not onely indiscernable by us, and therefore were never designed for our use, but also have their peculiar Motion about their Primary Planets (which they orderly and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attend) which shews other ends that God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has designed them for, to wit, to be as wholly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to their Central Planets of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as the <hi>Moon</hi> is to us? Lastly, Who is there that knows not the vast disproportion 'twixt this Speck of Earth, and the immense Heavens, how that it is less than the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Mote or Atom, which we see to hover and play in the Sun's beams, in comparison of the Fixed Stars? So that if one stood but in the Firmament, it could never be seen at all; and if it were annihilated, would never be miss'd, being so small and inconsiderable a portion of the Creation: Nay, our Modern Philosophers have found, That not onely the Earth, but the whole <hi>Orbis Magnus</hi> (which is the Earth's Annual Circle it describes about the Sun) is but a Point, in regard of the immense distance of the Fixed Stars. Nay, the Noble and Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Soul of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> that has stretch'd it self yet a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58849:95"/>
pin higher, has done the Heavens and Upper World more right yet, as to the Magnificent vastness of its Expansion, and has shown us that every Fixed Star is a Sun, and is set in the Centre of a <hi>Vortex,</hi> or Planetary System, as ours is, and that they are as far remote one off another, as ours is off them; and that all our whole Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary <hi>Vortex</hi> shrinks almost into nothing, if compared to those innumerable Systems above us. What are we then but like so many Ants or Pismires, that toyl upon this Mole-hill, and could appear no otherwayes at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but as those poor Animals, the Mites, do to us through a good <hi>Microscope,</hi> in a piece of Cheese?</p>
                     <p>Let us not therefore pride our selves too much in the Lordship of the whole Universe, 'tis more, I am sure, than we could challenge from our Creatour, that he hath made us such Noble Creatures as we are, that he hath given us such a large Inheritance, as the whole Globe of the Earth, that he hath Subjugated all things therein to our use and service; and lastly, that he hath endued our Souls with such spiritual and prying faculties, that we can attempt and reach at the Superiour and more myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works of his Creation, and therein to admire those things we are not capable to understand. As for the Earth being the Centre of the World, 'tis now an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so generally exploded, that I need not trouble you nor my self with it. And, indeed, what need I take pains to refute that which is but <hi>gratÃ¬s dictum,</hi> and which he neither hath, nor all the Peripateticks in the world can ever prove.

                     <p>
                        <hi>To which we Reply,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, That he runs upon a false Assumption; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Angle of Variation it self is perpetually the same in the same place of the Earth, which is false; For Mr. <hi>Burrows, Ann. Dom.</hi> 1580. made an exact Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Needle's Variation towards the East at <hi>Lime-House,</hi>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:58849:96"/>
near <hi>London,</hi> and found it to amount to no less than 11 <hi>gr.</hi> 15â², and afterwards, <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1622. Mr. <hi>Gunter,</hi> at the same place, observed it to be diminished to onely 6 <hi>gr.</hi> and 13â². And <hi>Gildebrand, Ann. Dom.</hi> 1634. in the same place found it to come yet lower, and not to exceed 4 <hi>gr.</hi> 6 <hi>min.</hi> So that in process of time it is very probable it will come to an exact Meridionality, and, perchance veer as much on the other side of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Line (<hi>viz</hi>) Westwards, as it hath done of this.</p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Croone,</hi> my Worthy and most Ingenious Friend, writes me word, that in <hi>June</hi> last, 1661. the Magnetical Variation at <hi>London,</hi> was found to be by the best Observation 45â² 30â³ Westwards: so that it seems it has past the Meridian already. And of this mystery of the Variation of the Variation, <hi>Grandamicus</hi> himself was not ignorant; but because it would spoyl his glorious Invention, he therefore unhandsomly and unworthily asperses our <hi>English</hi> Observations, with Ignorance, Error, and Incertitude, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 73.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Observators nominated, were of that Knowledge and Perspicacity in the Mathematicks, that I am sure 'tis a Credit to <hi>Grandamicus</hi> to be inferiour to any of them. But we shall now tell him, That not onely the <hi>English,</hi> but his own Countrey-men have found out this truth. So that the like decrease of the Needle's Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation has been observed at <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Mersennus,</hi> and at <hi>Aix</hi> by <hi>Gassendus</hi>: So then this Angle of Variation being quite fallible, and alwayes variable, his other two Angles will prove nothing at all; for they are the same in the same Latitude or Parallel round about the Earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But granting him his three <hi>Data:</hi> I say, in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite point of the Globe (that is <hi>Antipodes</hi> to <hi>Rouen</hi>) all these three Angles are the same.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:58849:96"/>If you reply, and say, That though the Angles of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation and Inclination be the same, yet they will be pointed out by the opposite points of the Directory and Inclinatory Needles. To which we Counter-reply, That the same point of the Needle that pointed at the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole here, will there point at the South-pole; therefore he can have no evidence of the Needle of Variation, as is manifest by carrying the Needle from the one Pole of the <hi>Terrella</hi> to the other.</p>
                     <p>And for the Inclinatory Needle, we see what a tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish thing it is to make exactly, and though it be poized by a good Artificer, yet will it miss one or more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in hitting the true point of Inclination, which would be a considerable Error, to a Land-Traveller at least.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the Profit and Utility of this Invention, 'tis none at all: for to a Traveller that sails in one and the same Parallel (which he may do many a thousand miles) the Angles of Inclination and Elevation will remain the same with those at the Port from whence he set Sail; and though the Angle of Variation did alter (as he would have it) yet my Marriner can tell nothing at all thereby, but onely thus, That he is not at <hi>Rouen</hi>; but how far he is gone from it, either East or West, he knowes not at all; unless he foreknew the Angles of Variation in every Longitude, which is yet unknown: and if they were all now known, yet were it of little or no use or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, because in process of time the Variation it self va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as we have pre-observed.</p>

                     <p>To this Experiment therefore drawn from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular position of the Magnet, we answer, That the reason why the <hi>Terrella</hi> does wheel about, and direct certain parts of its Aequator, to certain and determinate points of the Horizon, is, Because it is overpower'd by the Magnetical Effluxions of the Earth; which, as a greater Magnet, does violently reduce it to that Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which probably is the same that those Aequatorial parts had in their Mineral Beds: And therefore this great Argument against the Dinetical Motion of the Earth, is no Argument at all, unless that he could prove to us that the <hi>Terrella</hi> could play this trick; it were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the sphaere of the Earth's Magnetisme, which is beyond his Philosophy ever to demonstrate.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Again, If this Motion of the Magnet did proceed from an Intrinsecal Tendency that it has of its own, to bring all its parts to their right and determinate points, there to remain in a perfect Stability, then would those parts constantly affect this (and no other) Situation, howsoever the Loadstone was posited (provided it be at Liberty to move it self to its desired position.) But this is false; For, in <hi>Grandamicus</hi> his Experiment, if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Poles of the Magnet, and set the North-Pole in the Zenith, and the South in the Nadir, you shall see the Stone to Counterchange its Situation, and those aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58849:97"/>
parts of the Magnet, which before respected the East, shall now wheel about, and fix themselves in the West; and the Northern parts turn to the South: which shews, That the Stone does not Tack about from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal principle and form of its own, but is turned by the extrinsecal Effluxions of the whole Earth; or rather by the stream of those Magnetical Atoms, that strike not onely through the Axis of the Earth, but also through the Body of every petty Loadstone, accordingly as they are best received by the Grain or Bait of the said Stone.</p>
                     <p>And now I am engaged in this Magnetick Discourse, I must tell you that I think our famous <hi>Gilbert</hi> has drawn a more prevalent Argument from this Magnetical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, to prove the Earth's Motion by, than <hi>Grandami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> has done to destroy it; for since it is demonstrated of late, that all the whole Earth is nothing but a great and Globular Loadstone, and that all the Circles of the Armillary Sphaere, are really, truly, and naturally inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Earth, by virtue of the transcurrent Atoms, How can we conclude otherwise but with <hi>Gilbert? Quis in posterum eum de facto moveri dubitabit, quum ei omnia ad motum planÃ¨ requisita, dedit natura</hi>; i. e. <hi>figuram rotundam, pendulam in medio Fluido positionem, &amp; omnes terminos motui Circulari inservientes, polos nempÃ¨, aequatorem, meridianos &amp; polares circulos, &amp; parallelos?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, As for his Universal Meridian, it is likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from his Anti-<hi>Copernican</hi> Experiment of the Loadstone swimming in a Boat, with its Poles vertically erected: For (saith he,) Since the Stone being Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally-placed, does not shew the true Meridian, but with an Angle of Variation, in most, if not in all places of the Earth, if you set it with its Axis perpendicular as before, it will (after some undulations to and fro) rest quietly,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58849:98"/>
with certain parts facing the Meridian; which points must be exactly marked, and through them a Circle drawn round about the Stone; by help of which, you may strike a true Meridian-Line, when and where you please.</p>
                     <p>Now, though we grant this Experiment to be true, and, probably, to hold good in all Longitudes and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; yet he that shall perpend<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> how many ticklish Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities, and nice Circumstances there are to perform this Experiment exactly, will find the Invention only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the Theory, but not in the Practice: For, 1. It is very difficult to place the <hi>Terrella</hi> in an exact perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; 2. When 'tis so, 'tis as difficult to keep it invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under the same Zenith; 3. Most difficult to draw an exact Meridian-Line from it: Not to mention how hard a thing it is; first, to find the two Polary points in a Globe-Loadstone; also to keep the Boat in a Fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, parallel to the Horizon.</p>

                     <p>THe sixth day of <hi>November,</hi> 1662. we repeated the same Experiment, as before, in a pit of 68. yards deep, and there we found, that at the bottom of the said pit the water in the Weather-Glasse, did rise very near four inches higher than the point C: <hi>viz.</hi> one inch higher than the point D to F. Now we observ'd, that in carrying down of the said Glass in a Scoop from the top to the middle of the Pit, there the water did not rise so much as it did from the middle to the bottom, by half an inch; so that it seems the rise of the water was not proportional to the Glasse's descent in the Pit.</p>

                     <p>WE took a very good arm'd Loadstone, of an Oval figure (whose poles lay in the long Diameter) and at the top of the Coal-pit we loaded the North-pole of it with the greatest weight it was able to carry, even to a Scruple; then taking the Stone down to the bottom of the pit, and hanging on the same weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, we could perceive no difference in the power of the Stone at the one place from the other; for it would neither lift more nor less there, than above: though to try this Experiment precisely, and to minute weights, is very ticklish; for the same Stone in any place will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lift a little more, and sometimes a little less.</p>

                     <p>We had tryed this with a Bladder full of water, and other substances also, but that our thread by often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twining broke it self.</p>

                     <p>THe Collyers tell us, That if a Pistol be shot off in a head remote from the eye of a pit, it will give but a little report, or rather a sudden thump, like a Gun shot off at a great distance; but if it be discharg'd at the eye of the pit in the bottom, it will make a greater noise than if shot off above-ground. But these Experiments are of a dangerous trial in our pits, and the Collyers dare not attempt them by reason of the craziness of the roof of their works, which often falls in of its own accord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Concussion at all.</p>
                     <p>Every Cole-pit hath its Vent-pit digg'd down at a competent distance from it, as 50. or 80. paces one from another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:58849:102"/>They dig a Vault under-ground from one pit to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (which they call the Vent-pit) that the Ayr may have a free passage from the one pit to the other; so that both pits with that Subterraneous intercourse, or vault, do exactly represent a Syphon invers'd. Now the Ayr always has a Motion, and runs in a stream from one pit to the other; for if the Ayr should have no Motion (or Vent, as they call it) but Restagnate, then they could not work in the pits.</p>
                     <p>It is not requisite that the Vent-pit should be as deep as the Cole-pit.</p>
                     <p>Now the Vent, or Current, of Subterraneous Ayr is sometimes one way, and sometimes another; sometimes from the Vent-pit to the Cole-pit, and sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise (as the Winds (above ground) do alter;) and also weaker and stronger at sometimes than at others: and sometimes the Vent plays so weakly, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work for want of Ventilation.</p>
                     <p>Then to gather Vent (as they call it) they straiten the Vault, and wall part of it up; so that the Ayr (which before run in a large stream) being now crowded into a lesser channel, and forced to pass through a narrower room, gathers in strength, and runs more swiftly.</p>
                     <p>Now it is observ'd, that the Subterraneous Ayr is alwayes warm, and in the coldest weather, the warmest; so that it never freezes in that pit, out of which the Vent plays.</p>

                     <head>Of Damps.</head>
                     <p>THere are three sorts of Damps, or rather three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the same Damp;
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Viz.</hi> The Common.</item>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Common Damp is that Subterraneous Steam, or Exhalation, which coming out of the Earth, restagnates in the heads and undergroundy-cavities, and hinders their Candles for burning, so that they cannot work.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If they incline their Candle downwards, towards their seat, it is observ'd, it will abide in the longer, and not sweal away, and stifle it self with too much tallow, as it would do above-ground.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though this Damp be so great, as it extinguishes the Candle, yet they can abide in it without Suffocation. Also the heavy vapour will restagnate there, and is not able to rise.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Damp is sometimes generated by the Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums and Perspirations that come out of their own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that work, if they sweat much; and if the Candle be within the sphaere of those Effluviums, it will extinguish it as the former; as the Collyers observe that pass from one head to another that is working in another head.</p>
                     <p>This Damp is sometimes on the one side of the heads and not on the other; and for the most part it runs all along the roof, so that a Candle will burn, if set upon the seat: but if you lift it up into the superincumbent
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58849:103"/>
Region of Damp-vapours, it will be immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd.</p>
                     <p>Now besides the playing of the Vent, they sometimes are necessitated to keep constant fires under-ground, to purifie and ventilate the Ayr: Sometimes the running of the Scoops (when they begin to work) will set it into Motion: Sometimes, if the Damp draw towards the eye of the pit, then they set it into Motion by throwing down of Cole-sacks.</p>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>Of the Suffocating Damp.</head>
                        <p>THe Suffocating or Choking Damp is a more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exhalation, or else a higher degree of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; into which no man is able to enter, but presently he is stifled and dyes. And it is observed, that the Bodies of those (which are so slain) do swell, and are puffed up exceedingly, as if poyson'd. This Damp is seldom here in our pits; but if it be, then the first person that is let down into it, is presently kill'd: so that afterwards they try, by letting down dogs, when it is removed, and fit to enter into; and most-part by letting down of lighted Candles, which will be extinguish'd by the Damp in the bottom of the pit, if any Damp be restagnant there.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>Of the Fiery Damp.</head>
                        <p>THe Fiery Damp is of all others the most dangerous, but is never seen in our pits, though in pits at <hi>Leeds,</hi> which is not above 12. miles off, as also in the <hi>Lancashire</hi> pits, and <hi>Newcastle</hi> pits, I have heard much of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="181" facs="tcp:58849:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>It is a Vapour, or Exhalation, which comes out of the Mineral, or out of the clifts in the Mineral, and it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times comes out Fired, and sometimes in the form of a Smoke, which afterwards fires of its own accord, and then forces its way with that vehemence and activity, that it drives all away before it, and kils without mercy; insomuch that I have heard, that not many years ago, three men in <hi>Newcastle</hi>-pits were so shattered with it, that their very limbs were sever'd.</p>
                        <p>This Fiery Meteor is observ'd to run all along the roof of the pit, so that if the Collyers have the fortune to see it issuing out, there is no way to secure themselves, but to lye flat along to the seat of the pit, and so do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times escape so great a danger. Sometimes it has taken its way up at the pit-eye, or shaft, with such vehemency, that it has thrown the Turn quite away from the mouth of the pit, which is a Cylinder of wood of a great weight, and has burnt and sindg'd the Rope, as black as Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning does Trees.</p>
                        <p>This is that Meteor, certainly, that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> calls the Coruscation of Metals, which, he sayes, is a sign of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in that place; and, doubtless, is it that occasions Earthquakes, whensoever it happens in any quantity, and can have no Vent.</p>

For, instead of solid and Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Philosophy, it has been held accomplishment enough to graduate a Student, if he could but stiffly wrangle out a vexatious dispute of some odd Peripatetick qualities, or the like; which (if translated into <hi>English</hi>) signified no more than a Heat 'twixt two Oyster-wives in <hi>Billings-gate</hi>:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58849:105"/>
Nay, these crimes have not onely stain'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but there are spots also to be seen even in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Gowns of Learning. For it hath been a great fault, and, indeed, a solemn piece of Folly, even amongst the Professors and nobler sort of Philosophers, That when they have arrived to a competent height in any Art or Science, if any difficulty do arise that their Art cannot presently reach unto, they instantly pronounce it a thing impossible to be done; which inconsiderable and rash censure and forestallment of their endevours, does not onely stifle their own further Enquiries, but also hangs, to all succeeding ages, as a Scar-crow to affright them for ever approching that difficulty. Hence it is, that most Arts and Sciences are branded at this day with some such ignominious Impossibility.</p>
            <p>Thus came they to upbraid Chymistry with the Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hest, and Philosophers-Stone; Geography, with Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; Geometry, with the Quadrature of a Circle; Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reometry, with the Duplication of the Cube; Trigono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, with the Trisection of an Angle; Algebra, with the Aequation of three discontinued Numbers; Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, with a Perpetual Motion; and our own Profession, with the incurability of Cancers and Quartans. Nay, the Spring and Nepetides in Natural Philosophy, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Comets in Astronomy, the Terra Incognita in Geography, the Heart's Motion in Anatomy, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Conick Sections in Dioptricks, the Various Variation in Magnetical Philosophy, are accounted as insuperable difficulties as the former, whose Causes (they say) defie all Humane Industry ever to discover them.</p>
            <p>But besides this Intestine war, and civil dissention that is 'twixt men of the same denomination and principles,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58849:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is one more general Impediment, which is an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick discouragement to the promotion of the Arts and Sciences, and that is, The Universal Exclamation of the World's decay and approximation to its period; That both the great and little World have long since pass'd the Meridian, and, That the Faculties of the one doe fade and decay, as well as the Fabricks and Materials of the other; which though it be a Conceit that hath pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd all ages past, as nearly as ours, yet the Clamour was never so high as it is now: Something, therefore, I shall here offer, that will abate and qualifie the rigour of this Conception.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>An Essay, to prove the World's Duration, from the slow motion of the Sun's <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeum,</hi> or the Earth's <hi>Aphelion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrst, We take for granted, from the Scripture-Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the World is about 5000. years old.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We take it for granted, that the Sun's <hi>Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeum</hi> was at the Creation set in the first point of <hi>Aries</hi>; for which you will anon see prevalent reasons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From Astronomical Observation 'tis now found, that the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> is about the sixth degree of <hi>Cancer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, By intervals of Observation it is likewise found, That the Motion of the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> in 100. years, is 1 <hi>gr.</hi> 42â² 33â³, which by retrocalculation will point out the time of the World's Nativity to be about 5000. years ago, which very handsomely draws nigh to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58849:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Scripture-Account, as the famous <hi>Longomontanus</hi> has ingeniously observed.</p>
               <p>Now in all likelihood, he that made this great Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maton of the world, will not destroy it, till the slowest Motion therein has made one Revolution.</p>
               <p>For would it not even in a common Watchmaker (that has made a curious Watch for some Gentleman or other, to shew him the rarity of his Art) be great indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and a most imprudent act, and argue also a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of his own work, to pluck the said Watch in pieces before every wheel therein had made one revolution at least? Now the <hi>Apogaeum</hi> (if it move equally, as it hath hitherto done) will not perfect one Revolution under 20000. years, whereof there is but one Quadrant yet spent, and 15000. years are yet to come.</p>
               <p>Besides, What reason is there that God should respect the one Hemisphaere of the Earth, more than the other? For, take the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> now as it is, and the North Hemisphaere of the Earth hath eight days more of the Sun's company than the South Hemisphaere hath (as is plain to every one's Observation) for it is eight dayes more from the Vernal to the Autumnal Aequinox, then it is from the Autumnal to the Vernal again; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality will be repaid to our Antoeci in one Revolution of the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum</hi>: for 5000. years hence, both He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphaeres will equally enjoy the Sun's illuminating pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and 5000. years after that, the Southern Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphaere will have the eight supernumerary dayes trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to them; and then at the period of the last 5000. years, both Hemisphaeres will be equilibrated again: Therefore, in all reason, those Southern Inhabitants may expect, and we must grant one Revolution of the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> at least, (which is 15000. years) yet to come, to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58849:107"/>
ballance our felicities in this world; and who knows, but it may be continued many more Revolutions?</p>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>Macrocosm</hi>: Now what decay there is in the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> we must be both Parties and Judges; and how far our Modern Wits have outdone the Ancient Sages, the parallel 'twixt the few Inventions of the one, and the rare Discoveries of the other, will easily determine. But the Learned <hi>Hackwell's</hi> Apology shall be mine at present, for not treating any further of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; he having long since perform'd that Task, to the conviction of Prejudice it self.</p>
               <p>Besides this Catholick one, there are other Remora's yet in the way, that have been accessory hindrances to the advancement of Learning, and that is, A diffidence and desperation of most men (nay even of those of more discerning faculties) of ever reaching to any eminent Invention; and an inveterate conceit they are possess'd with of the old Maxim, That <hi>Nil dictum, quod non priÃ¹s dictum:</hi> by which despondency of mind, they have not onely stifled the blossoming of the Tree of Knowledge in themselves, but also have nipp'd the very Buds and Sproutings of it in others, by blazing about the old and uncomfortable Aphorism of our <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> of Nature's obscurity, the Life's brevity, the Senses fallacity, and the Judgement's infirmity.</p>
               <p>Had the winged Souls of our modern Hero's been lime-twig'd with such ignoble conceptions as these, they had never flown up to those rare Inventions with which they have so enrich'd our latter dayes; we had wanted the useful Inventions of Guns, Printing, Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Paper, and Sugar; we had wanted Decimal and Symbolical Arithmetick, the Analytical Algebra, the Magnetical Philosophy, the Logarithms, the Hydrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyral
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58849:107"/>
Experiments, the glorious Inventions of Dioptrick Glasses, Wind-guns, and the Noble <hi>Boyle's</hi> Pneumatick Engine.</p>
               <p>Nay, what strangers had we been at home, and within the circle of our own selves? We had yet never known the Mesenterical and Thoracical <hi>Lacteae,</hi> the Blood's Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, the Lymphiducts, and other admirable Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this fabrick of our Selves.</p>
               <p>All which incomparable Inventions do not only soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, but, me-thinks, should inflame our endevours to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt even Impossibilities, and to make the world know There are not difficulties enough, in Philosophy, for a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and active Reason: 'Tis a Noble resolution to begin there where all the world has ended; and an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick attempt to salve those difficulties (which former Philosophers accounted <hi>impossibilities</hi>) though but in an Ingenious Hypothesis: And, certainly, there is no Truth so abstruse, nor so far elevated out of our reach, but man's wit may raise Engines to Scale and Conquer it: Though <hi>Democritus</hi> his pit be never so deep, yet by a long <hi>Sorites</hi> of Observations, and chain of Deductions, we may at last fathom it, and catch hold of Truth that hath so long sitt forlorn at bottom thereof.</p>
               <p>But these are Reaches that are beyond all those of the <hi>Stagyrite's</hi> Retinue, the Solutions of all those former Difficulties are reserved for you (most Noble Souls, the true Lovers of Free, and Experimental Philosophy) to gratifie Posterity withall.</p>
               <p>You are the enlarged and Elastical Souls of the world, who, removing all former rubbish, and prejudicial resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, do make way for the Springy Intellect to flye out into its desired Expansion. When I seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the freedom of your Spirits, the excellency of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58849:108"/>
your Principles, the vast reach of your Designs, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle all Nature; me-thinks, you have done more than men already, and may be well placed in a rank Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically different from the rest of groveling Humanity.</p>
               <p>And this is the Age wherein all mens Souls are in a kind of fermentation, and the spirit of Wisdom and Learning begins to mount and free it self from those drossie and terrene Impediments wherewith it hath been so long clogg'd, and from the insipid phlegm and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Mortuum</hi> of useless Notions, in which it has endured so violent and long a fixation.</p>
               <p>This is the Age wherein (me-thinks) Philosophy comes in with a Spring-tide; and the Peripateticks may as well hope to stop the Current of the Tide, or (with <hi>Xerxes</hi>) to fetter the Ocean, as hinder the overflowing of free Philosophy: Me-thinks, I see how all the old Rubbish must be thrown away, and the rotten Buildings be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and carried away with so powerful an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. These are the days that must lay a new Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a more magnificent Philosophy, never to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown: that will Empirically and Sensibly canvass the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, deducing the Causes of things from such Originals in Nature, as we observe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible by Art, and the infallible demonstration of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks: and certainly, this is the way, and no other, to build a true and permanent Philosophy: For Art, being the Imitation of Nature (or, Nature at Second-Hand) it is but a sensible expression of Effects, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the same (though more remote Causes;) and therefore the works of the one, must prove the most reasonable discoveries of the other. And to speak yet more close to the point, I think it is no Rhetorication to say, That all things are Artificial; for Nature it self is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58849:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing else but the Art of God. Then, certainly, to find the various turnings, and mysterious process of this divine Art, in the management of this great Machine of the World, must needs be the proper Office of onely the Experimental and Mechanical Philosopher. For the old Dogmatists and Notional Speculators, that onely gaz'd at the visible effects and last Resultances of things, understood no more of Nature, than a rude Countrey-fellow does of the Internal Fabrick of a Watch, that onely sees the Index and Horary Circle, and perchance hears the Clock and Alarum strike in it: But he that will give a satisfactory Account of those <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> must be an Artificer indeed, and one well skill'd in the Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work and Internal Contrivance of such Anatomical Engines.</p>
