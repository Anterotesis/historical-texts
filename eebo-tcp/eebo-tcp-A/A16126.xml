            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This face of the worlde, as it were lying ſicke of age (which age it ſelfe in deede is a malady vareco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable) this ſame laſt age of the world, may beſt be likened then vnto an old man: But an old man is twyſe a childe, children be fooliſh, &amp; froward,
<pb facs="tcp:8562:3"/>
and beſides the infirmitie of ſickneſſe, they be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and noyſome, full of vncleanneſſe, in whoſe frowarde follie, this aboue al thinges muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that old men, howe iuſt ſoeuer the cauſe be, can abyde no reprehenſion, nor cannot endure the hearyng of theyr faultes: And ſo for all the worlde, though neuer any age were ſo wicked, ſo foule, ſo filthy, ſo naſty, and ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as this our age is: yet we ſay, we be cleane and holſome, we ſay we be ſweete and ſauery, we ſay they be not wyſe that reprehende in age any thyng. Age in deede is honourable, howbeit not that age which <hi>Seneca ad Lucilium</hi> calleth <hi>Elementaria ſenectus,</hi> but that age whereof <hi>Tullie</hi> remembreth <hi>de ſenectute: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alwayes,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>that I ſpeake of that age whereof youth hath layde an honeſt foundation.</hi> It is not yeeres, or gray hears, nor wrinkles in the browe, nor furrowes in the face, that bryngeth reuerence vnto age, but an honeſt life paſt before, which continueth with reuerence vnto the ende. An olde Ruffian, or an auncient Callet, is not for theyr continuaunce in wickedneſſe worthy any reuerence. A ſleepie age geuen to idleneſse, that reſteth not without feare, and is voyde of hope of goodneſſe, ſeeking ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8562:3"/>
for the time, pretendyng that we were beſt be at quiet for the time of our lyfe, we are not able to endure the troubles that may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe vs: this age is not honorable. And ſuch is our age, and like altogeather vnto teſty old fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward age, that how iuſt ſoeuer the cauſe be, can abide no reprehenſion. What, we lyue in the olde age of the worlde, and haue the examples of all the ages of the worlde before vs, and our end is to be looked for, no man wotteth howe ſoone: Shal not our puniſhment be the greater, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation the more iuſt, howe much the more warninges and examples haue been geuen vnto vs ſince the beginning of the worlde, yf we take no heede thereby? And howe muche I pray you haue we profited? Amongſt Gods ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, is God honoured? Is Gods name reuerenced? Was euer any age ſo outragious in Othes? So blaſphemous in railing? So rooted in periurie? When God turned his gratious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to wardes vs againe, and renued the glory of his Goſpel, did we ſuſpect that wickedneſſe ſhould haue been vnweeded, that blaſphemie ſhould haue ſpred ſuch bloſſomes, that common ſwearing ſhould haue ben thus ſuffered as it is? Thought we that Papistes ſhould haue had any
<pb facs="tcp:8562:4"/>
place of aucthoritie? Thought we that contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould haue ben ſo common, or that conſience ſhould haue ben ruled by riches. Nay veryly, we hoped for better, and I wot not when any age was worſe. It is true that affliction and trouble tryeth: God is neuer letter ſerued, then in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie. Wealth maketh vs Wantons, peace bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth pride, we haue quite forgotten <hi>Mariana tempora.</hi> This complaint as it may truely be made in diuers reſpectes, ſo ſpecially in this, that Gods most glorious name is not halowed nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, but vainly vſed, terribly abuſed, &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed most outragiouſly. Some faultes against the ſecond table, becauſe they concerne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, are ſomewhat duely executed, nay I dare boldly ſay that lawes for haukes egges, for couies of Partriges, and eyes of Pheſantes, are with much diligence obſerued and looked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: (and good cauſe that ſo they ſhoulde) But this that concerneth Gods honour, and the glorie of his maiestie, this whereof God hath geuen a ſpecial charge, wherunto God hath annexed his terrible threatnings, this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the first Table, concerning the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Gods owne name, is (fie for ſhame) to much neglected. Yf Princes woulde forget it, if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8562:4"/>
Counſellours conſult for common wealth only, yet may not Diuines ſpeake? What though we be lyke vnto women, for that when we haue ſayd, we haue doone, our aucthoritie ſtretcheth no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet in a reaſonable cauſe a woman may ſpeake with honeſtie, and ſpeake agayne and agayne to, vntyl ſhe be heard. Vnto you therefore this I remember, not in ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your diligence, that be far from me, for I profeſse gladly, and I geue God thankes, I knowe that both in doctrine and life, none labour more feruently: but as litle ſand to continue a long laſting edge, vnto a ſtrong gentle Scithe: So I humbly beſeeche you ſtyll to continue your earnest Zeale, to the promoting of Gods glory, Namely, and moſt ſpecially when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of time and place ſhal ſerue, that ſome ſtrength of law earneſtly be by your wyſedomes required, againe and againe, to be eſtabliſhed for puniſhment of vaine ſwearing, and for the vtter cuttyng of, of forſwearing or periurie. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities of the outragious exceſſe in appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret breedeth much more woe then many deemes for: drunkennes, is a deathful diſeaſe, &amp; it diſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man, ſo that be ceaſſeth to be that he was: But this vice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth not man ſo much as God: No tonge can vtter, no pen can expreſſe, no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie
<pb facs="tcp:8562:5"/>
can conceiue the ſinful wickednes, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour vnto God, the miſchiefe and miſery vnto mankinde, that groweth therby: Of this it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to ſtyr me vp to write ſomewhat, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I yeeld moſt humble thanks vnto his maieſty, that it pleaſed hym I ſhould bring ſomewhat, whether it be heare or wooll, or ſand, or Oyſter ſhelles, to the building of his Temple. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is worthy for al men to regard, though it be a common thyng (euery body can ſay it is ſo) our age is dainty, and luſteth after nouelties: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith in religion, is like vnto our foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fancy in building. We delight in ſhewes, in trickes and toyes, in cornered Windowes, in tops of Chimneies, though the bottomes be not. So we diſpute curious vnprofitable preterneceſsarie que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, not regarding the grounde and ſubſtance, which is moſt neceſſary, as without the whiche we are not. That your godly wiſedome right wel conſidered, when in your auncient reuerend age, you wrote yet inſtructions for the tender youth, a Woorke which to your preſence for to commend, is not ſo ſeemely: it was in deede a hammer, a Hatchet, a ſwoorde, an axe, to beat, to cut, to wounde, to deſtroy Antechriſt and all Heritiques. Old men are vncleane and naſtie,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8562:5"/>
the hope is in the youth, whom well to enſtructe in faythfull literature, and ſtudiouſly to traine vp to his glory, is the only hope that remaines to our age: the ſtrength of which hope, is the ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good lawes in tyme, for the reuerende vſe and honour of Gods name. Which neglected or intermitted, the euyl of example that amongst vs remayneth, is lyke to poyſon more pottes, then all the Vineger in <hi>Europe</hi> is able hereafter to make ſweete or ſeaſonable. God graunt that his honour may moſt ſpecially be tendred, and that thereunto all other Potentates, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Dominions whatſoeuer, may with condigne reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence bende and obey.

What mockery and deriſion is this agaynſt Chriſte, in the Churche, when the name of Chriſte Ieſus is ſounded, to bende or bowe in token of reuerence, and all the weeke after to ſweare by hym, as though he were woorthy none honour at all: The <hi>Iewes,</hi> as we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande by the geſture of the hygh Prieſtes, vſed to teare their garmentes when they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <note place="margin">Mar. 14.</note> that they heard any blaſphemie.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8562:24"/>
that his meſſage was not profitable for his Countrey: and for his othes ſake yet, not otherwyſe compelled, but onely to keepe his oth, he returned as a priſoner to <hi>Carthage:</hi> where, after the moſt cruelleſt maner that the miſchiefe of their moſt blooddie mindes could inuent, after ſuch a ſort as I neuer read the lyke, they put hym to death moſt terribly. This was their guyſe. They compaſſed hym cloſe rounde about with plankes, the plankes were driuen thycke with Iron prickes, the poyntes wherof were made exceeding ſharpe, ſo that he coulde not bende hym ſelfe to leane any way, without greeuous woundes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his fleſhe rancklyng, the longer he lyued, the more grecuous woulde be his payne, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng or ſleepyng his feete muſt beare the burden of his whole body: he myght truely ſay, <hi>Viuus, videnſ<expan>

The firſt, ſubtilly left his ſworde behinde hym, and when he was gone a good way of from the Campe, he returned agayne to fetche his ſwoorde: meaning by his ſubtyl recurnyng, to ſaue his oth, and neuer more to returne. But when this caſe came to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Heathen Romanes ſent hym backe agayne as a periured perſon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that an othe ought ſo to be perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as he vnto whom the oth was made dyd vnderſtande the promiſe. What ſhame is this to Chriſtians, that the Heathen people which knowe not GOD, woulde not ſweare raſhly, but reuerently? and duely dyd keepe theyr fayth promiſed. And we, that profeſſe Chriſt, ſweare raſhly, and vnreuerently: and, ſo we be truſted when we ſweare, we care not afterwarde for keepyng our fayth. Beleeue not a common or cuſtomable ſwearer: howe <note place="margin">Counſell.</note> can he keepe any fayth or credit in hym, that powreth it out continually? He that ſweareth alwayes by his fayth, ſweareth all away. So a ſwearer may be beleeued, his care is neuer after to perfourme his fayth. If a common ſwearer dyd beleeue in God, yf he dyd hope to he comforted by hym, yf he dyd thynke that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8562:25"/>
God woulde puniſhe his perturie, ſurely he would not, without reuerence and feare, he woulde not without vrgent cauſe in caſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, take once the moſt bleſſed name of Gods maieſtie in his mouth. Nowe when he beleeueth not hym ſelfe that whiche he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth vnto another, who ſhal beleeue hym? Why do we not ſay vnto common ſwearers, why do you lye?

If you do not beleeue in God, why woulde you haue me to beleeue you, when you ſweare by that God, in whom you your ſelfe do not beleeue? <hi>Solomon</hi> in the caſe of two women contendyng for one chyld, to crye where true natural loue reſted, made a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance as though he would haue cut the child in peeces.
