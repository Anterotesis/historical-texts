            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:24672:3"/>Secondly it is ob≈øerued, that during the continuance of this treatie, and by rea≈øon of the ≈øame Popi≈øh faction, haue exceedingly increa≈øed in this Realme, both in multitude and boldne≈ø≈øe.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, it is ob≈øerued, that by aduantage of the≈øe Treaties, and thereby keeping of his Maie≈øty in hope of a generall peace, they haue contrarily vnder the pretence of a≈ø≈øi≈øting the Emperour, oppre≈ø≈øed the Prote≈øtants party in mo≈øt parts of Chri≈øtendome, being the ancient Alies and confederates of this Crowne, to the endangering not onely of the whole State of the reformed Religion, but al≈øo of the Common ≈øafety of all the profe≈ø≈øors of the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, during the time of the≈øe Treaties of loue with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øty, they haue with all kind of ho≈øtility, ≈øet vpon his Maie≈øties ≈øonne in Law, the husband of his onely and mo≈øt Royall Daughter, inuade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Townes and Territories in all places, and infine di≈ø-inherited him with all that Royall Off-≈øpring of all his ancient Patrimoniall Honors and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, to the great di≈øhonor of his Maie≈øty, and extreame griefe of all his well affected Subiects. And now al≈øo at the la≈øt, when they ≈øhould come to make good the hope of re≈øtitution, they haue layd new grounds for endle≈ø≈øe delayes, and turned pretended difficulties into apparant impo≈ø≈øibilities, not forbearing al≈øo now to annexe as a Condition to the weake hope of their vncertaine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect re≈øolutions.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:24672:5"/>And when the States which had ≈øworne hereunto with an high Oath, then were they pre≈øently admitted, that tho≈øe affaires concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Land, which pre≈øently in the beginning of the treatie of peace were begunne, but could not be concluded vpon, that they ≈øhould be di≈øpatched and concluded in the next a≈ø≈øembly of the States.</p>
            <p>But yet <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> who≈øe affection burned with a lu≈øt and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing de≈øire, by ≈øome ≈øecret and concealed practice to breake the peace, and to begin the warre againe, ca≈øting all the≈øe conditions and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes at his heeles, made a way for tho≈øe complaints which <hi>Phillip,</hi> and all the former Governours had v≈øed as a cloake to cover all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Vpon this Anvile did they hammer night and day? they a≈ø≈øayled the States, and were exceeding trouble≈øome vnto them, coun≈øelling them that they altogether ≈øhould beginne the warres, again≈øt <hi>Holland, Sealand,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was the mo≈øt eminent Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion again≈øt the vniu≈øt government of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who indeede had beene exceeding beneficiall to the whole Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>In this coun≈øell <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had his eye vpon the≈øe two obiects, which ≈øhould be exceeding profitable and ≈øerviceable to further his intent; that by their Ciuill warres, the ≈øub≈øtance and trea≈øure of the land might be exhau≈øted, and they being weakned and bruy≈øed by their owne Warre, that then he, with the more ea≈øe and conveniency might ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe them together.</p>
            <p>Whereas he ≈øtill per≈øi≈øting with the≈øe de≈øires and intreaties, being as it were da≈øht again≈øt a Rocke by a Tempe≈øt: The States an≈øwered him; that it were better and more profitable for the Common-wealth, That concerning all tho≈øe matters whereof <hi>Don Iohn</hi> made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, to haue them by a friendly compo≈øition decided, and vnited, in the a≈ø≈øembly of the States; and if they could haue imprinted or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded him to haue beleeued the ≈øame, we had never fallen into the mi≈øeries of a Ciuill Warre.</p>

            <p>But how profitable, good, and wel-ordred is the cum≈øtome of the Common-wealth of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which I lately ≈øaw and ob≈øerved; where they will not ≈øuffer that the principall Nobles them≈øelues of that flouri≈øhing Common-wealth, ≈øhould contend, chide, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine enmity among them≈øelues, for, or about other mens ≈ømall and petty affaires.

            <p>Which cu≈øtome aboue all other affaires ought to be v≈øed in the affaires concerning the Land, and ought to be e≈øteemed of in all wel-ordered Common-wealths. If this were ≈øo, we ≈øhould not ≈øee one City ≈øo again≈øt another (oftentimes in one Province or Rei-publicke) or one Noble-man ≈øo again≈øt another of the contrary party, to threaten warre, murther, de≈øtruction, burning and blaking, nor violence to a≈ø≈øault each other.</p>
            <p>But now to returne to our former purpo≈øe, in re≈øpect that there are two ≈øorts of Warres: the one with words by way of Iu≈øtice; the other with violence.

blood of the Citizens. Contrarily <hi>Don Iohn</hi> complaineth of the States very publiquely: Hee reprooues and vpbraids them all for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and then deales with the High-dutch Souldiers no longer by ≈øecret dealing in the affaires very prejudiciall to the Common-wealth (with whom very cunningly hee had long time dealt with all) but then began he very publickly to deale with them; ≈øo that the whole di≈øcovery of that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, by divers intercepted letters, was fully come to the knowledge of the States. And many things they dayly ≈øaw with their eyes, as fir≈øt when he removed his Court and family, with his Councell-companions to <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Henegow</hi> (being a very ≈øtrong Towne, and very fit for his conjurations and complottings) and commanded that the ≈øame ≈øhould bee provided with a ≈øtrong Garri≈øon.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when as he ≈øurprized the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, and did ≈øurprize tho≈øe well provided and fortified Townes of <hi>Namen</hi> and <hi>Charlemont,</hi> and put a ≈øtrong guard into them of his owne ≈øouldiers, thinking thereafter by treachery to haue taken in the Towne of <hi>Bru≈ø≈øels,</hi> So that already the principall and chiefe Cities and Townes, by the great number of his Forts and <hi>Citadels,</hi> where beleagred and oppre≈ø≈øed; and then he wholly beganne to ≈øet vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe again≈øt the Rei-publick; and al≈øo many other things were then done by his advi≈øe and motion: whereas hee according to his oath, ought to haue advi≈øed, that all the ≈øouldiers ≈øhould haue layd downe their Armes, and pre≈øently to haue departed out of the Country.</p>
            <p>All which things appearing manife≈øtly to the eyes of the States, who adjudged that the ≈øame tented to the ≈øubver≈øion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; they thought that they were bound continually to keepe a good coun≈øel-watch; neither did they turne their eyes a≈øide from the Rei-publick, from that time that he ≈øought to haue all the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, vnto whom they in all officiou≈øne≈ø≈øe (not being mooved by any di≈øtemperature of minde) ≈øent as Emba≈ø≈øadours vnto him, <hi>Marolaus</hi> and <hi>Bru≈øus,</hi> charging them that they ≈øhould pre≈øent and ≈øhew, their full performance, innocency, and integrity, and ≈øhould free them from all ≈øu≈øpition and evill conceit, (the which they mo≈øt certainly knew, that he mi≈øchievou≈øly had di≈ø≈øembled,) that the faith that was given at <hi>Gent</hi> ≈øhould be renued: They ≈øhould al≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, that the States ≈øhould make diligent enquirie, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

≈øeuere puni≈øhment vppon tho≈øe Treacherous murtherers and con≈øpirators, who (as he ≈øayd) layd waite for his life, and had con≈øpired again≈øt him; (making a ≈øhewe and di≈ø≈øembling, as if to prevent the ≈øame, hee went to <hi>Namen</hi>:) They would aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Guard more then tho≈øe he had already, to the number of three hundred compleat armed men, who ≈øhould bee all of them <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> the which before that time was never offered to any Governour or Ruler. And yet with all the≈øe ≈øupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intreaties they effected nothing; for there was neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øty nor rea≈øon to be found in <hi>Don Iohn.</hi> Nay, hee could not bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nor keepe in his owne evill arrogancy and audacious pa≈ø≈øion; but declared the ≈øame to <hi>Marollaus</hi> at the ≈øame time of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øage, boa≈øting him≈øelfe, that hee now did wholly a≈ø≈øure him≈øelfe, and that hee doubted not, but that hee had brought vnder the ≈øubjection of his will and command, the Citie of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe,</hi> that hee had no lacke neither of money nor men; that hee now had all things in a readine≈ø≈øe, for the furni≈øhing of a Warre; and that hee with his ≈øword, would purcha≈øe vnto him≈øelfe a greater authority, power, command and government; then the States had promi≈øed and granted him in the pacification of <hi>Gent</hi>; and that it was his will, that the≈øe Emba≈ø≈øadours ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all the≈øe things vnto the States, for he would not conceale any thing from them that hee knew to appertaine to this his intent and will. This matter is undoubtedly ≈øure and certaine, and ≈øufficiently knowne before this, ≈øo that heere it is not needefull to produce witne≈ø≈øes. And although it be a very mi≈øerable thing, not to be able to deny, and very ≈øhamefull to be confe≈øt; yet I thinke verily that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> them≈øelues (although they be le≈ø≈øe ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe then a man would beleeue they are) cannot deny this at any time. <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had written vnto <hi>Tre-longe,</hi> and to his other companions and fellow-workers of his ≈øecret trickes and con≈øpiracies, That hee had given as a Cymbrian ≈øpoyle the wealth of the Citizens of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe, for a prey vnto his Souldiers. The ≈øouldiers ranged already through the City, as mortall enemies, and forced the Citizens to giue them what≈øoever they li≈øted: Many of the principall citizens began to flye out of the City, and as it were bani≈øhed: by which meanes the traffique and trading of the Marchants by ≈øhipping, beganne to cea≈øe.
<pb facs="tcp:24672:7"/>
And although there were great and manife≈øt tokens of their malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant enmity; yet neuertheles the States did beare al this very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly and mode≈øtly, and indeed would haue born yet much more, if that mortall and pittifull proiect which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> intended, had not beene di≈øcouered and made manife≈øt as the day; euen as if a man at the fir≈øt ≈øight ≈øeemed to perceiue ≈øome livele≈ø≈øe and in≈øen≈øible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and afterwards by more certain and ≈øure ≈øignes and tokens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to think of what quality that was whereof hee doubted: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ≈øo the States did al≈øo very ea≈øily vnder≈øtand, by all tho≈øe things which they had ≈øeene, that this prince did cheri≈øh in his mind and coun≈øels, an hatred tending to the ruine of the common-wealth: but of what qualitie that he was, and how farre he would extend him≈øelfe ouer the reipublick, that they mo≈øt euidently di≈øcerned and di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed thereafter, both out of his owne, and by letters from others. For there were many letters intercepted in Ga≈øconie, viz. Two of <hi>Don Iohns,</hi> written by him≈øelfe vnto the King, and other from him written to <hi>Anthonie Perez</hi> the chiefe of the Kings Covncell; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over fiue letters from <hi>E≈øcouedo</hi> to the King, out of which the States might a≈ø≈øuredly vnder≈øtand, that there were fed and bred mon≈øters, and ≈øtrang impo≈øtures; that privat con≈øpiracies were there practi≈øed; that there was great di≈ø≈øention mingled among the Cities and the Nobilitie of the Netherlands; and by what meanes the ≈øame was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and how fit and ≈øerviceable it was that tyrany and the Inqvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, according to that firme re≈øolution of the Spaniards, ≈øhould bee brought in &amp; e≈øtabli≈øhed; and to that end ≈øoldiers, armes, and all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke preparation very earne≈øtly was required for the King.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider and vnder≈øtand, <hi>illu≈øtrious Princes,</hi> the ≈øecret and privie con≈øpiracies of this man: Heare the words which this man v≈øeth in his letters written to the King, which (as I ≈øaid before) were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. <hi>In regard that this bodie</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>is ≈øo vnhealthful, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured any otherwi≈øe, but by cutting off of the vn≈øound members, you mu≈øt now carefully ob≈øerue this occa≈øion which is pre≈øented.</hi> And <hi>E≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couedo</hi> adds thereunto the re≈øt very amply, as a good interpreter of his meaning, who might very well write that which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> him≈øelfe would not giue to vnder≈øtand. This <hi>E≈øcouedo</hi> was the right minion and ≈øeruant of Audacitie and Treacherie, whom I thinke by rea≈øon of his nature and manners, was named <hi>E≈øcouedo,</hi> becau≈øe that hee knew
<pb facs="tcp:24672:7"/>
by his deceit to bring the mi≈øerable Netherlanders into his net. He wrot that vnto the King which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> would haue him to write, viz. <hi>That it po≈ø≈øibly could not be, that the Netherlanders ≈øhould be brought vnder the pure and perfect obedience and will of the King, vnle≈ø≈øe that fir≈øt they were tamed and con≈øtrained thereunto with fire and ≈øword. That therfore both men and armes were very needfull, and that the ≈øame mu≈øt be effected by warre.</hi> By the which as a good architecture of the Spani≈øh tyranny, he gaue them to vnder≈øtand, that the crueltie and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour which <hi>Alua</hi> and <hi>Requi≈øenius</hi> had abu≈øed, mu≈øt not continually be put in practi≈øe, but that the Netherlanders mu≈øt bee en≈ønared by a greater deceit and hypocri≈øie. Like as in Nauigation, it is a point of knowledge to ≈øee before hand the ≈øtorme, that although men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine the hauen, yet (if altering the cour≈øe) you may attaine thereinto, then it is a fooli≈øh deed to keepe that cour≈øe which before was taken with great perill and danger, rather then that you altering the ≈øame, might attaine to the wi≈øh for haven. For ≈øo was his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the fir≈øt raging and madne≈ø≈øe of the Spaniards mu≈øt bee ≈øomewhat mollified, and now mu≈øt go to worke with di≈ø≈øembled faith and promi≈øes. That <hi>Don Iohn</hi> who had an incredible modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an indifferent minde betwixt Ambition and Crueltie, might very fortunately effect the ≈øame. Hee adui≈øed by his owne and his ma≈øters coun≈øell, that England ≈øhould be fir≈øt ≈øurpri≈øed and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by warre, and then it would be ea≈øie to ≈øvrprize the Netherlandi≈øh prouinces.</p>
            <p>In tho≈øe letters which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> ≈øent vnto <hi>Anthony Perez</hi> his ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friend; He gaue him to vnder≈øtand that he was of ≈øuch a nature and condition, that he could not liue ≈øtill in idlene≈ø≈øe, nor could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the lawes of peace; and that his mind and con≈øcience could not indure that he ≈øhould wholly ≈øubmit him≈øelfe to the priuiledges and lawes of the Netherlanders, but that he farre rather by force of Armes would obtaine and effect for the King, a whole ab≈øolute, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited government over the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>And if now you do not ≈øufficiently ≈øee and perceiue, that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> fir≈øt broak the pacification of <hi>Gent,</hi> where the ≈øame by ≈øo many and cleare proofes doth appeare. Then remember (by the Eternall God) remember, I ≈øay, what rea≈øons he v≈øed to the Emba≈ø≈øadours of our States at <hi>Marche</hi> and <hi>Famines,</hi> when he ≈øayd, that he would keepe
<pb facs="tcp:24672:8"/>
the contracts and conditions of peace ≈øo long, vntill that covenant which was begun, ≈øhould repent him, that is, vntill hee by his ≈øweet enti≈øings, and hypocriticall lenitie, hauing rockt the States a≈øleepe, at the la≈øt might de≈øtroy them; and with them ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe the whole Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. For after the death of <hi>Iohn, Philip</hi> ≈øhewed very manife≈øtly that that ≈øame in very deed ≈øhould haue befallen vs, like as he at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlen</hi> by the Lord of <hi>Selles</hi> certified and gaue them to vnder≈øtand, that he would breake the lawes of the peace, and that hee no longer would be bound to keepe them. But I pray you for what occa≈øion? was it for neglecting the Romi≈øh Religion? A≈ø≈øuredly it had neuer beene more v≈øed nor reuerenced with the like deuotion, care and diligence, nor neuer was the zeale of our people ≈øo greatly affected thereunto as then. The Bi≈øhops of the Churches were then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; the Schooles and Colleges were partly in≈øtituted, partly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and augmented. Finally, there was not any thing omitted that ≈øerued for the maintaining of the cu≈øtomes and ceremonies of the Romi≈øh Church. So that our Netherland might well haue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, matched and ≈øtrouen with Italy and with Rome the chiefe ≈øeate and Metropolitane of that Religion. The which the Popes <hi>Nuncius,</hi> (or ≈øpirituall Emba≈ø≈øadour) who in his behalfe was ≈øent vnto vs, ≈øhal not deny the ≈øame. For hee writing him≈øelfe vnto the Pope concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this, ≈øaith, that he did much admire, and was therefore excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioyfull, that tho≈øe pre≈øcriptions and duties (or ≈øeruices) of the Romi≈øh Church, were exceeding well maintained by the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers in great devotion and pietie.</p>
            <p>How and after what manner the affections, wils, and devotions of all our States, and of all the Netherlanders were affected to the king, I need not to make repetition; neither is it needfvll to proove, that they delighted or loved any thing ≈øo mvch as to fvlfill the kings commands, and to ≈øhew obedience therevnto. The Trophaes, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramedes and Pageants which were made and prepared ≈øo ≈øvmptvous and co≈øtly to the honor, and at the entrance of <hi>Iohn,</hi> can te≈øtifie this. How did all the Nobles with ≈øvch exceeding ioy, wi≈øhing him good luck, receiue him? How did all the people with great mirth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycings receive him? What bankets and ≈øumptuous fea≈øts at the lands charge, were then with mvch delight made for ioy thereof, that this peace was made and concluded? And what great triumphs
<pb facs="tcp:24672:8"/>
all the Netherlanders made and demon≈øtrated vpon all their Theaters when this peace was made, is yet te≈øtified by all the inhabiting ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who were thereat exceedingly droven to admiration, yea were euen a≈øtoni≈øhed.</p>
            <p>It was no otherwi≈øe then, but as if the Netherlanders had then found the beginning and principles of a wel-governed Common-wealth in the per≈øon of this their Chiefe, or Gouernour. Yea, thou thy ≈øelfe <hi>Iohn,</hi> if thou wilt but enter into thine owne heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, ≈øhalt not be able to deny the ≈øame, That the Netherlanders did fully keep and ob≈øerue all the contracts and conditions of the peace, which they were bound to keep; and neuer denied obedience vnto the commandement of the king, if they were not more vile then the commandements of <hi>Manlius,</hi> if they did not to too much oppugne the lawes and priviledges.</p>
            <p>But to the end that I may produce one in≈øtance which farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all mens admiration; and which ≈øhall perfect this our di≈øputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: you mu≈øt for a certainty acknowledge, that the ≈øtates had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with force of Armes to haue forced the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> to haue done tho≈øe things which you mo≈øt de≈øired, which was the induction, and as it were the ground-worke of your accu≈øations and complaints, if in ca≈øe they by right, rea≈øon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, could not be brought thereunto; which things you altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øcorned and rejected, and to the end that this one pretext, this onely pretence might remaine for matter for your fal≈øe accu≈øations; And that this might be a ju≈øt occa≈øion for your conjurations: yet this occa≈øion was not ≈øufficient thereunto, neither could it be ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enough, in regard the ≈øame is manife≈øtly knowne vnto all men, not onely to Netherlanders, but al≈øo to all ≈øtrangers, who either ≈øaw the whole bu≈øine≈ø≈øe as it was carried, or el≈øe haue heard the ≈øame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> haue alwayes entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, received, and accompli≈øhed the precepts and commandements of the King, no otherwi≈øe then if they had been the Oracles or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God: That they neuer were carele≈ø≈øe nor negligent in their offices or duties which by the law of Nature they were ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Prince.

And if they now ≈øay, that the authoritie, re≈øpect and commandement of the King con≈øi≈øted therein; and that you in re≈øpect thereof, would not giue way, nor be obedient vnto the ≈øame; wherein indeed con≈øi≈øteth your glory, and whereof you may ju≈øtly boa≈øt; Yet you confe≈ø≈øe, to your great commendation, that you haue given the≈øe occa≈øions vnto the accu≈øations of <hi>Don Iohn</hi>: That you, being free from all faults, yet in this you are and will be faulty. And herein you may boa≈øt, That you with an e≈øpeciall providence and wi≈øedome, haue careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watched and kept your ≈øelues, ≈øo that at no time, neither by any of the≈øe, nor any other Spani≈øh trecheries, periuries, tricks, or traps, you haue been cou≈øoned, debaucht, nor in≈ønared: that you were the fir≈øt which were inflamed with a ≈øingular con≈øtancie and courage, to deliuer the Reipublicke from the grievous yoake of tyranny and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell government. That you with the toarch of your libertie, haue been a light to enlighten all the other Provinces. And that you had farre rather, by the≈øe long-during warres, be ≈øpent, die, and indure all kinds of mi≈øery and adver≈øitie: then to for≈øake your cu≈øtomes, lawes and priviledges. I be≈øeech the Lord God, by who≈øe only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, grace and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, you haue atchived ≈øuch admirable things, that you may pro≈øperou≈øly continue &amp; per≈øeuere therin from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth perpetually. Now will I turne me againe vnto that from which I haue digre≈ø≈øed, and recommend vnto your judgment and arbittre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Oh Chri≈øtian Princes, all what I haue ≈øpoken of the deeds of <hi>Don Iohn.</hi> Take notice, iudge, and ≈øpeake what you thinke thereof. Con≈øidering that of all the States parts, there is nothing omitted, which by the law and contract they had promi≈øed to doe: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily for <hi>Don Iohns</hi> part, of the ten parts of the agreement or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition, which wholly he ought to haue performed, he hath not
<pb facs="tcp:24672:9"/>
di≈øcharged any one point thereof well nor hone≈øtly as hee ought. And hereby you may ≈øee, with what ju≈øtice and equity we vndertook this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and how we (having vndertaken the ≈øame) haue dealt and proceeded therein.</p>
            <p>For when the States perceiued, that all their hope and tru≈øt for the ca≈øhiering of tho≈øe great numbers of the Germane ≈øouldiers was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate, and that they were laid in the cities, townes, and mouthes of the frontier garri≈øons, and that they kept <hi>Namen</hi> &amp; <hi>Charlemont,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cities and Ca≈øtles that were very well provided; to the end that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> that way, might receiue and bring into the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands that great army which hee had de≈øired of the King in his letters; and moreover they perceiving that the hate and enuy of all the ≈øouldiers was turned vpon them, and that they with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greedy de≈øire longed for the pilaging of the greate≈øt Cities, And that they attended onely but for the lea≈øt ≈øigne and token of their Prince, to have falne rauenou≈øly and furiou≈øly, as raging bea≈øts, and to haue ceized vpon the liues, goods, and meanes of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders. That <hi>Don Iohn</hi> him≈øelfe, and other naughty people daily threatned the ruine and ≈øubver≈øion of our natiue Countrey. That they by the demo≈øtrations, hand-writings, mouthes and letters of their confederates, were them≈øelues conuinced. That they all had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ≈øet the cities and towns on fire, and to haue ≈ølaine all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and chiefe of the Citizens, to haue de≈øtroyed the Netherlands, and to have rooted out the Reipublick. Who is he then that would not be awaked and ≈øtirred vp for the defence and pre≈øeruation of the common good? Who is he that with good coun≈øell would not prevent the trecheries of <hi>Iohn</hi>: Who would be ≈øo vnprovident, and ≈øuch a coward, that would not defend and maintaine his owne life, with weapons and warre? A≈ø≈øuredly rea≈øon hath taught the learned; nece≈ø≈øitie the Barbarians; cu≈øtome the heathens; and nature it ≈øelfe the vnrea≈øonable bea≈øts, to repell violence with violence, euen to their vttermo≈øt ability.</p>
            <p>You your ≈øelues, Oh great and gracious Princes, which po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe kingdomes freely and in pro≈øperitie; may ea≈øily know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand this; and know al≈øo that even ≈øo it mu≈øt be done. But what do I ≈øay, that you mu≈øt know it? All the Spaniards our enemies do know it, and will freely confe≈ø≈øe the ≈øame. For they demon≈øtrate it in their deeds, that the ≈øame hath been ju≈øt, and is ≈øo yet. For con≈øidering
<pb facs="tcp:24672:10"/>
that <hi>Henricus Ca≈øtellanus</hi> (being a ba≈øtard) and the great Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of King <hi>Phillip,</hi> did expell <hi>Peter</hi> his lawfull brother and right heire, out of the kingdome, becau≈øe he ≈øeemed to v≈øe tyrannicall dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and becau≈øe he ≈øeemed to dominiere contrary to the lawes and cu≈øtomes of his kingdome; And, that King <hi>Phillip</hi> vpon the ≈øame conditions that he inherited Spaine, did inherit the Netherlands, (viz. that he ≈øhould maintaine and religiou≈øly ob≈øerue the lawes and cu≈øtomes.) Wherefore then may not we, as the Spaniards did reject <hi>Peter,</hi> even as wel reject <hi>Phillip</hi> (who oppre≈ø≈øeth his ≈øubjects with an vnju≈øt and vnlawfull government) and expel him with our armes for euer out of our Provinces.</p>
            <p>But I feare, O Princes, that I haue too much abu≈øed your patience, and that my oration ≈øeemeth to haue run ≈øuch a cour≈øe, that I neede not adde any thing more thereunto. Yet I intreat your leaue, that you be plea≈øed to ≈øuffer me, though very briefly to continue in that which <hi>Phillip</hi> ≈øought to effect after the government of <hi>Iohn,</hi> by the deceit of an hypocriticall and di≈ø≈øembled peace; to the end that you may clearely ≈øee and perceiue, wherfore that we, ≈øo long as the world ≈øtands, may neuer make any peace with <hi>Phillip,</hi> but now and for euer without cea≈øing, are bound to Warre again≈øt him. The very name of peace (I confe≈ø≈øe) is exceeding ≈øweete, a peace that is good and ≈øound: But betweene peace and that bondage which is cloaked, covered, and fal≈øly folded vp in a concealed peace, is indeede a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Peace is a ≈øtill and quiet liberty: but that bondage, or all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of feare thereof, is the extreame of all euils and mi≈øchieues. Such was the peace, (if a man may call that peace) which induced, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øeduced the Netherlanders even vnto <hi>Collen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When at the States by their Emba≈ø≈øadours and letters vnto you and your predece≈ø≈øors, <hi>Oh all you Princes of Chri≈øtendome,</hi> had againe intreated; that you by your authorities, re≈øpect, and exhortations, ≈øhould ratifie, e≈øtabli≈øh, confirme, and looke vnto that peace which <hi>Phillip</hi> after a new cou≈øening manner ≈øhould make, that the ≈øame ≈øhould not be deceitfull: Like as he certainely and mo≈øt maliciou≈øly by his deceit ouer-threw the fame. For the Spaniards then made no delay, but pre≈øently brought in new di≈ø≈øentions into <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Henego<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> cau≈øing them to fall away from the other Provinces, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the which they euen vnto this pre≈øent haue dominiered. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by force of Armes, violently they ≈øurpri≈øed <hi>Ma≈øtricht,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:24672:10"/>
and moreouer and aboue they, partly by violence, and partly by great promi≈øes, haue ≈øovght to get into their power many other cities and prouinces.</p>
            <p>And finally is that <hi>Vli≈ø≈øes</hi>-like-wit <hi>Alexander Farne≈øius</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> brought out of <hi>Italie,</hi> who like vnto a mo≈øt craftie and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning bird-catcher, with the ≈øong of his lenitie, and promi≈øes of great rewards, in≈ønared and captiuated all the Cities and Townes of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant and Flaunders.</p>
            <p>Of this Prince I could ≈øay very much, which I am con≈øtrained to omit: Yet this one matter I cannot pa≈ø≈øe by in ≈øilence; That, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the time of his gouernment hee effected many things very great and eminent for <hi>Philip,</hi> yet could hee not e≈øcape of being ≈øu≈øpected, as if hee would haue vndermined the King in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, becau≈øe that through his gentlene≈ø≈øe, linitie and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; he had drawne vnto him the affections of all the Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that hee al≈øo ≈øeemed per≈øpicuou≈øly to haue looked into, and al≈øo to beare a hatred to the wickedne≈ø≈øe and fraudulent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and deceites of the Spaniards. Therefore <hi>Philip</hi> gaue him <hi>fungos,</hi> or Toads-bread to eate, which <hi>Agrippina</hi> had ≈øo commended to the Emperour, to the end that by the power and operation thereof, he might be admitted, counted and receiued into the number of the gods.</p>
            <p>But I pray you, what was that at la≈øt for a peace, which as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met or bright ≈øhining ≈øtarre, ≈øhined vnto vs out of the firmament of the Spani≈øh trecheries vnto which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> coun≈øelled vs, at what time the Arch-enemy ≈øtood, as it were, ouer our heads, and that the incredible great Spani≈øh Fleet filled and couered the great Ocean or main Sea? A Fleet which was ≈øo terrible to behold, that I can hardly iudge, whether the Fleet that <hi>Xerxus</hi> had, which couered the Sea called <hi>Mare Ponticum</hi> had a greater number of Shippes, more Souldiers, or greater warlike preparation. With this Fleet <hi>Phillip</hi> had thought totally to haue ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed vs: who were at that time ravi≈øhed, as it were, with that plea≈øant and delightfull ≈øound of peace. Yet when this Fleet, by the onely power of the Almighty God, was wonderfully de≈øtroyed and brought to naught; then pre≈øently by the Emperours Emba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours hee offered the≈øe Prouinces a new Treatie of Peace, to the end, that he thereby might tran≈øport all his Army and power of
<pb facs="tcp:24672:11"/>
warre out of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> The treacheries which many yeeres before he had plotted again≈øt that kingdome, beganne then to haue a wonderfull good progre≈ø≈øion: For his naturall kin≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Henry</hi> being made away by paracide, (or his murthering of a kin≈øman,) and the ≈øtate of all that kingdome, being vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed with Ciuill warre; then the matter, and the pre≈øent occa≈øion required, that he with Armes and a mighty Hoa≈øt ≈øhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecute his de≈øigne, in that flouri≈øhing and famous great Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> which Kingdome hee by violence hauing taken in and conquered, he might thereafter, without any trouble at all, haue ≈øubiugated tho≈øe Netherlandi≈øh Prouinces, and all the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Chri≈øtendom.</p>
            <p>What? Is it yet lawfull for me, or may I yet ≈øpeake any more of Arrereges, or re≈øidue of the dangers of this Reipublicke? Yes, it is lawfull for me, and it ≈øhall be lawful for me alwayes to ≈øtand for the dignity of my natiue Countrey, and to confe≈ø≈øe the truth. Like as all good Orators, or eloquent ≈øpeakers, doe euer keepe ≈øome of their mo≈øt forcible and ponderous Arguments to the la≈øt. And like as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Generals v≈øe to place their be≈øt ≈øouldiers in the la≈øt rankes; euen ≈øo <hi>Phillip</hi> in the≈øe latter yeares pre≈øented a peace vnto the≈øe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> which ≈øhould be adorned and confirmed with notable fidelity; the whole foundation and chiefe ground worke thereof, lay and con≈øi≈øted in the vertues, mercy, endeuors, diligence, and in the loue of the Arch-duke <hi>Erne≈øtus</hi> his ≈øi≈øters ≈øonne; who, after the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> was placed in the gouernment of the≈øe Prouinces: He promi≈øed the≈øe Prouinces a peace; not ≈øuch a peace as ≈øhould be limited with any grieuous or heauie conditions and contracts, like as the former was; but ≈øuch a peace as they them≈øelues would wi≈øh or de≈øire. In the meane time <hi>Phillip</hi> ≈øent his great and huge Armies into <hi>France,</hi> and his ≈øecret murtherers into <hi>Holland,</hi> to haue murthered the Illu≈øtrious Prince <hi>Mauritts,</hi> Earle of <hi>Na≈ø≈øow,</hi> a famous and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imitator of the vertues and valour of his father, and a ≈øingular defender of our Liberty; and by ≈øuch an odious and treacherous villainy, to haue made him away; like as they, but a little before, by a mo≈øt cruell and trecherous hand, had murthered his mo≈øt worthy and valiant father, the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And finally <hi>Phillip</hi> concluded many more mi≈øchieuous, and more wicked purpo≈øes again≈øt the≈øe Prouinces, then euer before he could
<pb facs="tcp:24672:11"/>
haue bethought him≈øelfe of. I doe not ≈øpeake any thing vnadui≈øedly, <hi>√¥ Princes,</hi> but that which thou≈øands be≈øides me of good reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can te≈øtifie in faith and verity, and that which <hi>Phillips</hi> owne let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe make good.</p>
            <p>What then? Meaneth the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that our States by any propo≈øitions of peace, can bee diuerted from their enterpri≈øes and de≈øignments? Doth he not yet know and vnder≈øtand, that all our affections are ≈øo abdurate and hardned, that we will far rather yeeld and giue place to Armes and Warre, then to any kind of new inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peace-treacheries, after what manner ≈øoeuer the ≈øame might be propounded? Or, thinketh he peraduenture, that the affections of our States euery day, lie open to his de≈øire and appetite? What? Is he yet ignorant, that the coun≈øels of all our people, with a generall con≈øent and vniformity of voices, are long agoe vnited and knit fa≈øt together in this point; and that they will farre rather honourably in warre and Armes liue and die, for their Lawes, and for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Country; then from henceforth ≈øhamefully to ≈øinke or quaile, vnder his treacheries and deceits? What, doe I ≈øay ≈øinke or quaile? Nay, to come into the extreame≈øt euills of Tyrannie; to bee bound with vntolerable and inhamane bonds of ≈ølauerie, and to bee recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and accounted among tho≈øe ≈ølaues that are bought and ≈øould. We haue prepared, made ready and ≈øharpened, a perpetuall and an euerla≈øting warre and Armes again≈øt him: we neither haue, nor may ca≈øt our eyes vpon any other peace, then vpon ≈øuch a peace as is grounded, confirmed, and may bee maintained with force and Armes.</p>
            <p>But in regard that a little before I beganne to ≈øpeak of <hi>France,</hi> and to proue that our warre partly was joyned with that ≈øame; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will proceede to adde ≈øome other matters hereunto, by the which you may evidently ≈øee and perceiue, how many treacheries, traps and deceits that <hi>Phillip</hi> hath laid for them.</p>
            <p>He hath a long time ≈øince, as you know, <hi>O Princes,</hi> laboured and endeuored to a≈ø≈øaile <hi>France,</hi> with all the violence and force of his warre; to the end that he by the occa≈øion of the Civill di≈ø≈øentions in <hi>France,</hi> might effect ≈øo much by his wars and charges: that if he could not ≈øwallow and devoure the whole Kingdome; yet that at the lea≈øt he might get a great part thereof. For he had made his full reckoning and accovnt before hand, by preparing of that cruell
<pb facs="tcp:24672:12"/>
Fleet, that both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> had been a prey vnto their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Wheras tho≈øe good Princes, notwith≈øtanding had nothing at all endamaged him, neither was he by any juiu≈øtice provoked to that warre; vnle≈ø≈øe peradventure it be, that he thought this occa≈øion ≈øufficient; that the Pope, at the will and de≈øire of <hi>Phillip</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated tho≈øe two flouri≈øhing Kingdoms, for their exerci≈øing and mini≈øtery of the Reformed Religion; who for the extirpation and eradication of that Religion; <hi>Phillip</hi> as a <hi>Cato Maior,</hi> with the pui≈ø≈øance of the Romi≈øh Cen≈øores (or correction ma≈øters) v≈øeth to haue regard vnto all the Kings and people of the earth, and therefore to correct and puni≈øh them, which is indeede a matter known vnto you all; for which no man can ≈øufficiently wonder at the ≈øhamefulne≈ø≈øe thereof, and might now neither be pa≈ø≈øed by nor omitted. And that <hi>Phillip</hi> in the≈øe warres of France dealt mo≈øt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtly, and with the greate≈øt diligence and alacrity, with the Duke of <hi>Feres,</hi> and other Spaniards of the League, whom he as compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had a≈ø≈øi≈øted in that warre, to haue e≈øtranged the Right and Title of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> not onely from the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion or de≈øcent of the Kings blood and kinred, but euen from all Frenchmen, and to haue drawne the ≈øame to <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The≈øe things are ≈øo certaine, <hi>O Princes,</hi> that there is no man which doubteth of the truth hereof. But to what end do I bring the≈øe into your Remembrances; What is this to maintaine the purpo≈øe I haue in hand; For this end it ≈øerueth; thereby to proue how excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great the ambition is of this mo≈øt cruell Tyrant; and to the end you may perceiue and ≈øee how greatly, not onely we, but euen all of you together, mu≈øt keep good watch and looke vnto it. For like as the nature of the Vine, is to extend the branches, as the armes thereof farre and wide, and therewith embraceth and layeth hold vpon euery thing that is neer it, if it be not lopt and pruned; Euen ≈øo ≈øhall <hi>Phillip,</hi> if you doe not all at once make re≈øi≈øtance, at the la≈øt de≈øtroy and devoure all Chri≈øtendom, with mo≈øt cruell and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy warre.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he by his Btibery, and ≈øecret con≈øpiracy had lately effected ≈øo much in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that ≈øome of the chiefe of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ≈øhould haue received and taken in twenty thou≈øand Spaniards, if they had not been puni≈øhed (after the matter was knowne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed) according as their trea≈øon de≈øerued. I need not to thinke
<pb facs="tcp:24672:12"/>
with my ≈øelfe, that I can ≈øufficiently expre≈ø≈øe with words, what trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, what perills, what daungers, he, ≈øo oftentimes hath attempted again≈øt the Queene and Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> Can ambition and violence proceed yet any further? Yes truely, For the like treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries practi≈øed hee a little before again≈øt the Principallity of <hi>Collen,</hi> the Dukedomes of <hi>Gelders, Gulich, Cleane</hi>; the County of <hi>Berghe,</hi> and that ancient Emperiall Towne of <hi>Aken</hi>: All which is mo≈øt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtly and apparantly knowne by good Te≈øtimony, and by his owne letters. And who knoweth in what lurking hole and corner of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocri≈øie and di≈ø≈øimulation, he hideth and ≈øheltreth his mo≈øt mortall hate again≈øt the mo≈øt mighty Princes of <hi>Italy</hi>; whom (as ≈øoone as the wind of the fir≈øt oportunity ≈øhall blow (very ≈øuddenly, ≈øhall be turned into coales and a≈øhes, by his vnquenchable and fearefull great flames of Warre.</p>
            <p>Doe ye not yet ≈øee and perceiue enough, <hi>√¥ Princes,</hi> what treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and deceits that <hi>Philip</hi> prepareth, for your mo≈øt happy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Prouinces, which are your Patrimonies? Con≈øidering there is no man ≈øo blind nor ≈øen≈øele≈ø≈øe, who ≈øeeth not, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandeth not that the ambition of <hi>Phillip</hi> neuer re≈øteth, but dayly draweth him from land to land, and rai≈øeth a new warre out of war; So that he by warres, ≈øinne, mi≈øchiefe, and meere villanous deceits and treacheries, vnder the pretence of a ≈øeeming-peace, ≈øeeketh to deject and detrude euery one of you from the ≈øeate of your Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For this his de≈øire is vn≈øatiable and immoderate, and cannot be included nor ≈øhut vp, neither in Heauen nor in Earth. If that all <hi>Phillips</hi> Kingdomes which he u≈øeth commonly in that long traine or taile of his mo≈øt proud Titles and Termes of Honour were put or layd into one of the Seales of <hi>Critolaes</hi> ballance, and in his other ≈øeale his Ambition or greedie de≈øire of Honour; All the Kingdomes would ≈øcarcely weigh the quantity of one graine, in compari≈øon of his Ambition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great looked about for more worlds, when he had conquered the whole world; but <hi>Phillip</hi> would, if he could, with the Gyants a≈ø≈øault the heauens. And therefore, <hi>O Princes,</hi> and you <hi>mo≈øt peacefull Princes,</hi> I intreate you, and I would admoni≈øh you, that you judge no more of the occa≈øion and lawfulne≈ø≈øe of our warre; but in your judgements and opinions to hold it for good: and I exhort you mo≈øt earne≈øtly againe and againe, that you by all
<pb facs="tcp:24672:13"/>
meanes, both in your vnder≈øtandings, and with all your powers, will take heed of the treacheries, robberies, and mi≈øchievous practi≈øes of <hi>Phillips</hi> deceit.</p>
            <p>In former times, whenas the Athenians, partly with warre, and partly with deceits and treacheries, ≈øought to get unto them≈øelues certaine neere adjacent places, as the Cities of <hi>Syracu≈øa, Lacaedemon, Me≈ø≈øena</hi> and <hi>Catina</hi>: they by their immoderate Ambition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire of others Rights, drewe ≈øuch an hatred upon their owne heads, that <hi>Darius</hi> the mo≈øt mighty King of <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> with the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Grecia,</hi> voluntarily undertooke and pro≈øecuted warre again≈øt them, unto which euery man ranne and ha≈øted, as to quench a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke flame. But you, <hi>O mo≈øt Illu≈øtrious Princes,</hi> ought long ago to haue expelled <hi>Phillip,</hi> (with your conjoyned forces from you, and from your pro≈øperous States) that ≈øeeketh continually your liues and Kingdomes, by mo≈øt unju≈øt warre, and by mo≈øt wicked enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øes.</p>
            <p>And it concernes, and is fitting, not onely for you, who for a long time ≈øince, haue beene provoked, ≈øpurred, and ≈øtirred up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by the many injuries and ambition of <hi>Phillip,</hi> but euen you altogether, who ≈øee and perceiue, that he incroacheth with violence upon the limmits of your neighbours; and with an ea≈øie and ≈ølow pace creepeth and incroacheth towards your Countries.

            <p>When as <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, after the Battell with the <hi>Tribaldes,</hi> had entertained a long di≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling warre with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the <hi>Thebeans</hi> a≈ø≈øembled them≈øelues for this occa≈øion; fearing, le≈øt when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had bene conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the fire of their neighbouring-warre might haue flowne unto them. And a little before, there being a confederacy made betwixt two of the mightie≈øt Cities; who, before had bene at extreme enmity with each other, terrified thereby, and by their Emba≈ø≈øadors, all the Country of <hi>Grecia</hi>: e≈øteeming it ≈øo, that a common enemy ought and mu≈øt be repelled with common force; ≈øo that if the fir≈øt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> had had good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe; he would not haue held up, nor re≈øted untill he had conquered and ≈øubjugated the
<pb facs="tcp:24672:13"/>
whole country of <hi>Grecia.</hi> The <hi>Romanes</hi> in former time, perceauing that the power of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> increa≈øed and grew great, they had an e≈øpecial care that the <hi>Carthagenians</hi> ≈øhould not grow ≈øo great as to ouer-ma≈øter them: And for that end they ≈øent their ≈øouldiers to relieue the <hi>Mamertines</hi> from the beleagring, and to relieue <hi>Spain</hi> from ≈øeruitude of the <hi>Africans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are not very lightly incited to warre, but when the matter of nece≈ø≈øity con≈øtrayneth them: Yet they neuer tefu≈øed to ≈øend their warlike power for the ≈øuccour of others that were under them, when they perceaued that their neighbours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with each other, with an vnrea≈øonable and an immoderate violent ambitione.</p>
            <p>The≈øe, and the like even to an innumirable examples (or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes) doe teach you, how carefully you mu≈øt take heede of that mo≈øt pe≈øtilent evill, of the Spani≈øh ambition; and do ≈øhew; or proue, that it is a righteous and ju≈øt cau≈øe, that even all you with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent with us, pro≈øecute a warre again≈øt that Tyrant.</p>
            <p>For our States do know, that the occa≈øion of their warre again≈øt <hi>Phillip,</hi> is not onely exceeding ju≈øt and righteous, and ever was: but al≈øo, that they at no time, now nor never, may cea≈øe their warre, that they may make no peace with <hi>Phillip,</hi> but alwayes mu≈øt maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine warre again≈øt that Tyrant. For we are taught by our friends, how we mu≈øt take heed of our enemies: For if <hi>Phillip</hi> do gape and long ≈øo earne≈øtly, and with ≈øuch diligence for your Kingdomes; like as you ≈øee he daily doth; how then ≈øhall we ≈øpeed? For a≈ø≈øuredly he wil never lay a≈øide Armes before that he hath ≈øubjugated all the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> under him, becau≈øe it is a Countrey ≈øo fit for his purpo≈øe; who, out of them may attempt many enterpri≈øes upon your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and dayly may beginne to rai≈øe new warres again≈øt you, and draw out of them Souldiers, Armes, and all manner of warlike provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion again≈øt your adjacent Countries. And therefore he would farre rather ca≈øt the greate≈øt part of Chri≈øtendome for a prey to the <hi>Turke</hi>; then to cea≈øe the≈øe warres.</p>
            <p>At the la≈øt Parliament in <hi>Germany,</hi> he would not con≈øent to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the Emperor with any ≈øoldiers, nor a≈ø≈øi≈øtance again≈øt the <hi>Turke</hi>; and the rea≈øon was, becau≈øe he might the better vexe Chri≈øtendome with warre.</p>
            <p>Doe yee yet doubt of this, <hi>O yee Princes,</hi> which you your ≈øelues
<pb facs="tcp:24672:14"/>
haue ≈øeene, that <hi>Phillip</hi> in the beginning of our ciuill commotions, had far rather loo≈øe two Kingdoms, <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Goulet,</hi> which the <hi>Turkes,</hi> under their General <hi>Sinam Ba≈øcha</hi> then recouered from him, then that hee would for a while cea≈øe his warres with us; or would remoue his Souldiers out of the≈øe Prouinces, again≈øt the mo≈øt deadly and mortal enemy of all Chri≈øtendome.</p>
            <p>And you know how many Souldiers, how much Armes, and what charges <hi>Phillip</hi> hath been at, and wa≈øted, to maintain this war again≈øt us. So that if you would but reckon up the ≈øame, you ≈øhall find that he might haue bought and purcha≈øed two <hi>Netherlands</hi> with that mony: although notwith≈øtanding they be very great, rich, and exceeding copious. So that there is no doubte of this, but <hi>Phillip</hi> would far rather endure the greate≈øt lo≈ø≈øe that might betide him then that he would leaue <hi>Bellgium</hi> with out <hi>bellum,</hi> or the Low-countries without long encountrings of warre, with out ≈øtrife, without ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they might liue in peace and quietne≈ø≈øe, freely and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to their Lawes and priuiledges. For by this war, and with the conque≈øt of our Prouinces, he wil lay and e≈øtabli≈øh the ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt foundation and ≈øure≈øt ground-worke of his Monarchy, Sole-dominion, Tyrannie, and cruel Gouernment. For when he ≈øaw and perceaued that the≈øe Countries were ≈øo ≈øingularly fitting for his cruel treacheries and de≈øgnments, and that our Lawes and Liberties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traryly did wholy oppo≈øe the ≈øame: therfore ≈øought he fir≈øt of all with warre, with force and violence, to plucke vp, teare in ≈øunder, and with violence, to oppre≈ø≈øe the ≈øame, to the end, that his ≈øubiects of other Kingdoms, which at this pre≈øent he hath ≈øubiugated, or el≈øe might ≈øubiugate hereafter; from this our concording, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall defence of our Lawes and Liberty, might take no example or in≈øtance, with the greater courage and alacrity, to ≈øtand for, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their liberty.</p>
            <p>What do you then iudge, <hi>√¥ you mo≈øt peaceful Princes?</hi> or what is your conclu≈øion that our States ought to doe, who chiefly ≈øeek for the common good of their natiue Countrey? Verily it cannot be with them, as it is vnder the Gouernment of a cruel Tirant, and as it u≈øually is in ill-gouerned Reipublicks: they are not v≈øed to be lead, and to ≈øubmit them≈øelues at any time, with cap and knee, as flatterers doe? to the wills, de≈øires, and lu≈øts of their ≈øuperiour Lords, nor to be dealt with all as hired ≈ølaues? con≈øidering that
<pb facs="tcp:24672:14"/>
they neuer would admit nor ≈øuffer, that their Lawes, Liberties, nor their Reipublick, ≈øhould bow or ≈øubmit vnder the yoake of vniu≈øt and vnlawfull Government: But haue as good fathers of their natiue-Countrey; as good fighters for their freedome, and Defendors of their Lawes, (like as it mu≈øt be in a Reipublick which is moderately and ciuilly gouerned by their Prince) directed their de≈øignes, wils, and gouernment of their ≈øuperiour Lord; according to their Lawes, and the pre≈øeruation of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>Do you think that the Spaniards ≈øhall ≈øpoyle and cruell vexe and torment our Reipublick; and that we with ≈øhame will leaue and quit the ≈øame? Shall we neglect our deare countrey and liberty? Mu≈øt we de≈øpi≈øe the lawes of our predece≈ø≈øors? And ≈øhall they peruert &amp; turn top≈øie-turvie our ciuill orders and policy into tyranny? And ≈øhall we with wringing hands look vpon the coar≈øe, and behold the exequies or funerall of our <hi>patria</hi> and natiue countrey? Shal they rend &amp; teare in peeces the body of our common-wealth, and like mo≈øt ravenous bea≈øts deuoure the ≈øame? And ≈øhall we like ≈ølaues, with praying and intreating, hardly pre≈øerue our own liues, goods, and meanes? Or do ye not far rather laud &amp; extol with the highe≈øt commendation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, this will and affection of our States, for their manumi≈øing and pre≈øeruing of their deare and natiue countrey? Incite and exhort you them to proceed as they are be≈øt able, and to the vttermo≈øt of their powers, for the pre≈øervation and manumi≈øing of their owne liues and liberty? Come not the≈øe things daily into your remembrances, when you think of the Netherlandi≈øh warre, or di≈øcour≈øe thereof, which I haue now demon≈øtrated, and with ≈øure and infallible and vncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable rea≈øons proued vnto you, viz. that our States, &amp; all the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, being drenched and ≈øoaked in mi≈øery, and oppre≈ø≈øed with the cruelty of the Spaniards; and being expeld out of their natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, of meere nece≈ø≈øity were con≈øtrained to take Arms again≈øt <hi>Philip.</hi> And that now all the other treacheries, infidelities &amp; iniuries which the Spaniards during the time of the≈øe wars haue done vnto the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders, being ≈øo great, ≈øo inhumane, and ≈øo incredible, that they them≈øelues (≈øo to ≈øpeak) do earne≈øtly exhort, do require &amp; command, that the States with a con≈øtant courage, ≈øhould keepe and maintaine their armes, and neither now, nor neuer, to lay them out of their hands; but to ≈øhew vnto the other ≈øubiects of <hi>Phillip</hi> (tho≈øe of <hi>Sicilia,
<pb facs="tcp:24672:15"/>
Calabria, Lombardy, Arragon, Ca≈øtile, India,</hi> &amp; <hi>Portugal</hi>) yea euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ≈øelues, <hi>O Illu≈øtrious Princes,</hi> I ≈øay to ≈øhew, and with valiant deeds to proue, that not onely we, but all of you together, yea and all men vpon the face of the earth, far rather ought to dye, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or looke vpon the face of that tyrant.</p>
            <p>Do ye yet think, or can you imagine with your ≈øelues, that <hi>Phillip,</hi> with the limits of our countrey, hath limited in his tyranny? Do yee not yet ≈øee and perceiue, that the high a≈øcending and mortall flames of the Spani≈øh tyranny, devoureth and ≈øwalloweth vp the tre≈øholds, doores, and turrets of your kingdomes? Ari≈øe, and at the la≈øt awake out of this your ≈øleepe and carele≈øne≈ø≈øe; come hither with ≈øpeede, and in all ha≈øte flye hereinto, for to quench the≈øe vniuer≈øall fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames. Wherefore do yee ≈øeeke vnto vs again≈øt our wils, by your coun≈øels, authorities, and re≈øpects, to induce vs to make peace with <hi>Phillip</hi>; whereas it had been more fitting, that you your ≈øelues long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, with warre and force of armes ≈øhould haue expelled <hi>Philip,</hi> and with an e≈øpeciall force and power to haue ≈øuppre≈øt him?</p>
            <p>And to the end I may ≈øpeake vnto you all one after another, you <hi>mo≈øt mighty Princes of Germany,</hi> be ≈øencible, that <hi>Philip</hi> in your Dutchland doth not hunt after a cruell and vniu≈øt government; but (≈øo to ≈øpeake) doth po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe the ≈øame already. For he hauing once conquered the≈øe Netherlandi≈øh prouinces; when you will not bow and ≈øubmit to his gouernment: he will haue all the hauens of the ≈øea, and the mouthes of all the Germane riuers at his owne will, and in his owne power: thereby afterwards to impo≈øe ≈øuch grieuous toles and taxations, vpon your nauigation and trading, or el≈øe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will hinder the ≈øame, euen as it ≈øhall plea≈øe him≈øelfe. And this is that for which, and in behalfe whereof, one or two of the prouinces doe appeare in your a≈ø≈øemblies and con≈øultations: you heare him publickly ≈øpeak his minde, and you e≈øteeme and preferre his tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call advice and coun≈øell, before your owne pro≈øperity and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. You haue him, the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Fri≈øinghen</hi> and <hi>Hilde≈øhem</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before; and you haue ≈øeene them made Princes and Prince-Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Empire; The Bi≈øhop of <hi>Collen, Liege,</hi> and <hi>Magdeborgh</hi>: and you haue ≈øeene that the mo≈øt ambitious Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> hath laid ≈ønares for you all.</p>
            <p>And to the end that I may turne my ≈øpeech vnto you, <hi>O you illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrious &amp; mighty powerful Princes of Poland,</hi> hath not <hi>Philip</hi> brought
<pb facs="tcp:24672:15"/>
a great number of that generation of mankind, (I ≈øay Ie≈øuites) into your Countrey, by who≈øe religion and policy they haue brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt the whole world into an vp-rore, to the end that he by their meanes, with Sun-≈øhine-like deceits, might propound vnto you what his will and coun≈øell is.</p>
            <p>To you al≈øo, <hi>mo≈øt peaceful Princes of Italy,</hi> I haue already ≈øayd, and ≈øay againe, that the ≈øword of the Spani≈øh tyranny hangeth by a very ≈ømall threed ouer your heads, already naked and drawne out of the ≈øcabberd.</p>
            <p>And for you, <hi>O mo≈øt illu≈øtrious Senators (or Priuy Councellors) of Venice,</hi> you your ≈øelues haue ≈øeen and beheld the tyranny of <hi>Phillip</hi> in your owne State and gouernment, when he ≈øent money to arme the Turke again≈øt you; and diuerted the power and force of the Turk from his owne dominions vpon <hi>Cypris</hi>; although that hee by thee quity and right of the covenant, had been exceedingly oblie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and beholding vnto you.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>O Princes of Christendome,</hi> yet euen now, at the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øt, be carefull of your owne e≈øtates and affaires, of your owne liues and pro≈øperitie; marke and con≈øider it well, that <hi>Phillip</hi> is enemy and tyrant to you all, and ≈øuffer him to liue no longer in the world: but re≈øi≈øt and impeach his ambition to reigne, and that his pe≈øtilent and mortall government proceed no further. And like as ≈øome certaine members are cut off when they begin to be without life and blood, and are hurtfull to all the other parts of the body; euen ≈øo mu≈øt you al≈øo e≈øteeme, that this inhumane cruelty in humane ≈øhape, mu≈øt (≈øo to ≈øpeak) be ≈øeparated and cut from the common body of men. Verily the deed of the Per≈øians is much to be commended, and ought to be wel thought upon of you all; who when <hi>Cometes</hi> and <hi>Oropa≈øtes</hi> two of their Magicians (or wi≈øe men) by the like tyrannie and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Smerdis,</hi> King of Per≈øia, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the Kingdom: they were ≈ølaine by the valour of ≈øeuen of the able≈øt Princes of Per≈øia, all of them running with a ≈øingular affection, diligence, and burning zeale to kill and to de≈øtroy tho≈øe tyrants with their ≈øwords, one of the Magitians cla≈øped about the neck of one of the Princes who≈øe name was <hi>Gebrias,</hi> which made his companions to linger the more, becau≈øe they would not kill him in ≈øteed of the Magician (for this was done in a dark place) who commanded the Magician to thru≈øt his ≈øword through his body. Yet in the end the Magician was ≈ølaine, and this
<pb facs="tcp:24672:16"/>
valiant <hi>Gebrias</hi> (who had rather to haue died, then that the tyrant ≈øhould haue e≈øcaped with life) was ≈øaved, and had his life pre≈øerved, Such an hate did the≈øe men beare to tyrants.</p>
            <p>The Grecians informer times attributed divine honour to tho≈øe men who had ≈ølaine a tyrant, And doe you thinke that the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers ≈øhall do euill, or more vniu≈øt, that they oppo≈øe and re≈øi≈øt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> that jnhumane tyrant.</p>
            <p>The Romanes expelled their King <hi>Taquinus Superbus,</hi> becau≈øe that he, did but in ≈øome ≈øort weaken the ≈øtate of their common-wealth; and ≈øhall we ≈øuffer or indure <hi>Phillip</hi> in our common-wealth, who not onely with fire and ≈øword would de≈øtroy and turn-vp-≈øide-downe all the Netherlands, but euen the whole world? No, by no meanes. Our States without doubt, will proceede and prepare the way for you to break off, and to expel this tyrant. They wil per≈øeuere to diuert, driue away, and to foyle him ≈øo farre and wide from ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øing and killing of our pro≈øperity, that once, not onely they and theirs, but al≈øo euen the other provinces of the Netherlands, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re-e≈øtabli≈øhed in their former liberty, and may lead them out of the ≈øtraights of the Spani≈øh tyranny, and repo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe them in the po≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ø≈øion of their predece≈ø≈øors. That finally, they being re-e≈øtabli≈øhed, and better ordered, and vnited and bound with the Prouinces of the whole Netherlands; they may ≈øtop the incur≈øion and inva≈øion of this cruell tyrant, and altogether with one accord may expell him from their pro≈øperity, and from their common liberty. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>But he pretended this to be the cau≈øe of his wroth, becau≈øe he ≈øaw that there were ≈øome among them, that did defie the Pope and all his Religion: but that could not be, for the Citie of <hi>Ael≈øt</hi> was as ≈øuper≈øtitious in that Religion as <hi>Rome</hi> it ≈øelfe; for they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecute the Reformed Religion euen vnto death: and yet for all that both they, and 170 faire Villages that belonged vnto them, were by them plundered and ≈øpoyled of all their goods, and many of them wounded and tormented for to confe≈ø≈øe where their mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney was, and many were killed.

            <p>It was concluded that the Marque≈ø≈øe of Bargen, and the Lord of Mountigny ≈øhould goe into Spaine, who humbly pre≈øented their ≈øuit to the King, but could get no an≈øwer in 16 Moneths after.</p>
