            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST it is to be obſerved, that the State of <hi>Spaine,</hi> not content with thoſe ordinary prouiſions for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Romane Religion, by the Infanta, and her family, (which other Princes in like caſe would haue demaunded, and which his Maieſty with great reaſon, might at the beginning of the Treaty haue conceived they would haue beene contented with: Haue with great vehemency (upon advantage of having the Princes Perſon in their poſſeſſion) preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a generall conniuence for all his Maieſties ſubiects of the Romane Religion; to the great diſhonor of Almighty God, in the ſincerity of his ſeruice in this Realme, and to the great derogation of the Lawes of this Kingdome. And laſtly, to the great diſcouragement, and griefe of all his Maieſties well affected ſubiects, from whoſe generall diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they expect (as well appeareth) a conſequence of no ſmall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:24672:3"/>Secondly it is obſerued, that during the continuance of this treatie, and by reaſon of the ſame Popiſh faction, haue exceedingly increaſed in this Realme, both in multitude and boldneſſe.</p>
            <p>And whereas they haue beene divided heretofore amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the part of the Ieſuites depending vpon <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſts otherwiſe, They are generally now ſtrongly vnited toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depending no leſſe vpon <hi>Spaine</hi> for temporall reſpects, then vpon <hi>Rome</hi> for ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>And conſidering the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> hath beene alwayes a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall enemy to our Religion to increaſe their owne greatneſſe, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpiting the proteſtant party in all places where they can prevaile. It cannot but be of moſt dangerous conſequence, to the ſafety of the King, and the Realme vnleſſe remedy be prouided with ſpeede, for the abating of that party here at home, which cannot be during the time that theſe Treattſe are on foote.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is obſerued, that by aduantage of theſe Treaties, and thereby keeping of his Maieſty in hope of a generall peace, they haue contrarily vnder the pretence of aſſiſting the Emperour, oppreſſed the Proteſtants party in moſt parts of Chriſtendome, being the ancient Alies and confederates of this Crowne, to the endangering not onely of the whole State of the reformed Religion, but alſo of the Common ſafety of all the profeſſors of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, during the time of theſe Treaties of loue with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, they haue with all kind of hoſtility, ſet vpon his Maieſties ſonne in Law, the husband of his onely and moſt Royall Daughter, inuade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Townes and Territories in all places, and infine diſ-inherited him with all that Royall Off-ſpring of all his ancient Patrimoniall Honors and Poſſeſſions, to the great diſhonor of his Maieſty, and extreame griefe of all his well affected Subiects. And now alſo at the laſt, when they ſhould come to make good the hope of reſtitution, they haue layd new grounds for endleſſe delayes, and turned pretended difficulties into apparant impoſſibilities, not forbearing alſo now to annexe as a Condition to the weake hope of their vncertaine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect reſolutions. That the eldeſt ſonne of the Count Pallatine, ſhould be brought vp in the Emperours Court: ſo reſtleſſe are their deſires to worke the ouerthrow of Religion by all poſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:24672:3"/>Laſtly, it is apparant how manifoldly from time to time, they haue deluded and abuſed his Maieſty with their Treaties, how ſmall reſpect they haue ſhewed to the Prince his Greatneſſe and worth, what endignities they haue offered againe and againe, to his highneſſe, by importuning him vpon all aduantages to forſake his Religion, contrary to the cuſtome of all Princes, and contrary to the ancient Lawes of Honor, and Hoſpitality, who ought to haue beene vſed there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Princely freedome, and preſſed to nothing vnto which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed, conſidering with what confidence (being ſo great a Prince) he had put himſelfe within their power, although it pleaſed God to guide and fortefie ſo his Princely heart, that he conſtantly withſtood all their attempts, and ſtratagems, to his owne immortall honor, and to the vnſpeakeable comfort of the good people of his Fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; Wherevnto may be added their infinite aduantagiouſneſſe, and endleſſe delayes in their Treaties. And finally what diſhonor they haue obtruded vpon our Nation and Religion in inviting ſtill to new Treaties, and turning al to the aduantage of their owne particuler ends, being true to nothing but their owne grounded Maximes, with which neither the Match nor the reſtitution of the Pallatinate can poſſibly conſiſt, but vppon ſuch termes as threaten to our State, an incurable miſchiefe.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat and Mighty are the Kingdoms in your poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which extend far and wide, throughout all the world: but much more great, and farre more excellent are the vertues and knowledge, by which you hold, preſerue and governe the ſame righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, even to the vttermoſt extent of felicity.</p>
            <p>In the meane time let me now intreat you, <hi>ô moſt peaceful Princes,</hi> that you will heare me with a friendly and well-affected minde, the ſequell hereof, and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally will underſtand wherefore the <hi>Spaniards</hi> doe moſt falſely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe vs; That this peace was violated and broken by vs: which accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation I hold to be very grievous.</p>
            <p>Among other Conditions, Lawes, and Contracts of this peace, this was one of the chiefeſt and weightieſt: That <hi>Don Iohn</hi> ſhould not admit any <hi>Spaniard</hi> or ſtranger, nor any of them; by whoſe counſell and adviſe it was evidently knowne, that the Provinces were brought into that extreme ſpoyle, into the Councell: And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,

hee called, and ſent for them to him, kept them in his Court, and in his moſt ſecret chambers; That <hi>Baptiſta Taxis,</hi> a moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spie, and enemy of our common affaires, who a little before had beene Secretary vnto Duke <hi>d' Alva,</hi> who was not onely adioyned to his priuy Counſell, but alſo was made and ſet ouer them. Beſides him one <hi>Octauius Gonzago</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> as alſo hee tooke vnto him one <hi>Eſcouedo,</hi> a crafty Spaniſh Fox, vnto whom hee adioyned certaine <hi>Netherlanders.</hi> But what <hi>Netherlanders</hi> I pray you? Thoſe who partly had beene the ſtirrers vp and fauourers of ſo many miſeries; who were both hated of their natiue Countrey, and of all good men; <hi>viz. Barlemont, Megan, Hierge, Flojon, Hautepenny, Aſſonuille,</hi> and other plagues of their Countrey, who hauing ordained the Law of <hi>Lentulus, Cataline</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> eſtabliſhed the ſame with their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels &amp; deeds, <hi>viz. That all thoſe that by preſeruing the Common-wealth would be preſerued, ſhould be declared for enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this counſell and aduice, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> preſently, euen at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this peace, ſhould haue ſurprized the Towne of <hi>Gent,</hi> if the good and profitable counſell, and alſo the valiant deeds of the States, had not hindred the ſame; For <hi>don Iohn</hi> himſelfe could not refraine nor keep in his hatred and enmity any longer, which he bore to the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> but had quickly forgot that ſacred oath, which he had ſworne, vpon the Euangeliſts, before the Biſhop of <hi>Shertogen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſeh,</hi> and the Popes <hi>Nuncius,</hi> or ſpirituall Embaſſadour.</p>
            <p>He had promiſed and ſworn; that hee would deale with all the ſouldiers in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who were 15000, about their Arreara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to the end, that they thereupon might bee diſcharged, like as in the agreement of the peace had beene concluded. And contrarily thereunto, he promiſed the Souldiers, in the Kings behalfe, anew, to haue greater meanes, honours, offices and rewards: and held a moſt miſchieuous counſel with <hi>Fronſberghen</hi> and <hi>Focker,</hi> Collonels of the German ſouldiers; part of whoſe wicked counſell hee effected, and the reſt being hindred by the States he could not effect.</p>
            <p>But yet to the end, that you may ſee and know the ground of this Buſineſſe, I will in few words declare vnto you how the matter fell out: For vnder theſe two conditions or couenants, <hi>viz.</hi> in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Romiſh Religion; and in yeelding lawfull obedience to the King, did the whole Treatie of the peace conſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:24672:5"/>And when the States which had ſworne hereunto with an high Oath, then were they preſently admitted, that thoſe affaires concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Land, which preſently in the beginning of the treatie of peace were begunne, but could not be concluded vpon, that they ſhould be diſpatched and concluded in the next aſſembly of the States.</p>
            <p>But yet <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> whoſe affection burned with a luſt and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire, by ſome ſecret and concealed practice to breake the peace, and to begin the warre againe, caſting all theſe conditions and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at his heeles, made a way for thoſe complaints which <hi>Phillip,</hi> and all the former Governours had vſed as a cloake to cover all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Vpon this Anvile did they hammer night and day? they aſſayled the States, and were exceeding troubleſome vnto them, counſelling them that they altogether ſhould beginne the warres, againſt <hi>Holland, Sealand,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was the moſt eminent Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion againſt the vniuſt government of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who indeede had beene exceeding beneficiall to the whole Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>In this counſell <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had his eye vpon theſe two obiects, which ſhould be exceeding profitable and ſerviceable to further his intent; that by their Ciuill warres, the ſubſtance and treaſure of the land might be exhauſted, and they being weakned and bruyſed by their owne Warre, that then he, with the more eaſe and conveniency might ſuppreſſe them together.</p>
            <p>Whereas he ſtill perſiſting with theſe deſires and intreaties, being as it were daſht againſt a Rocke by a Tempeſt: The States anſwered him; that it were better and more profitable for the Common-wealth, That concerning all thoſe matters whereof <hi>Don Iohn</hi> made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, to haue them by a friendly compoſition decided, and vnited, in the aſſembly of the States; and if they could haue imprinted or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to haue beleeued the ſame, we had never fallen into the miſeries of a Ciuill Warre.</p>
            <p>For what is more repugnant to the common good, and to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes and Iuſtice; then to try by warre, thoſe controverſies,

                  </gap>damus</hi> (though no Chriſtian King, but of a ſtately, honourable any provident Nation) ſayd; That it <hi>was vnlawfull to take Armes againſt thoſe, who were willing to haue the matter tryed by Law.</hi> When and iniury had beene offered to the Romanes themſelues; they did not preſently begin with wars: but did firſt ſend <hi>Clarigatum,</hi> that is, they cauſed thoſe things that were ſtollen or taken away, to be more apparently and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demanded againe.</p>
            <p>But how profitable, good, and wel-ordred is the cumſtome of the Common-wealth of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which I lately ſaw and obſerved; where they will not ſuffer that the principall Nobles themſelues of that flouriſhing Common-wealth, ſhould contend, chide, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine enmity among themſelues, for, or about other mens ſmall and petty affaires. But they bring the ſame into their Senate, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and there they deſire, pray, and admoniſh them, that they will remember, and be mindfull, that they are all of them Saint <hi>Markes</hi> children (which name they haue given their Rei-publicke) and that they are brethren, and Burgeſes of ſuch a free and happy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it was not beſeeming for them, for any particular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to cheriſh and foſter any private diſſention or hatred, which might thereafter prooue to be more generall, to the perill and danger of that Rei-publicke.</p>
            <p>Which cuſtome aboue all other affaires ought to be vſed in the affaires concerning the Land, and ought to be eſteemed of in all wel-ordered Common-wealths. If this were ſo, we ſhould not ſee one City ſo againſt another (oftentimes in one Province or Rei-publicke) or one Noble-man ſo againſt another of the contrary party, to threaten warre, murther, deſtruction, burning and blaking, nor violence to aſſault each other.</p>
            <p>But now to returne to our former purpoſe, in reſpect that there are two ſorts of Warres: the one with words by way of Iuſtice; the other with violence. The firſt being proper to men, the ſecond to vnreaſonable beaſts. And that wee muſt neceſſarily avoyde vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, vnleſſe the courſe of Iuſtice be denyed vs. Therefore we muſt beleeue that the States farre rather would haue decyded thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, by their good and wholeſome counſels, by reaſon and conference; then to make them greater by Warre and ſpilling the
<pb facs="tcp:24672:6"/>
blood of the Citizens. Contrarily <hi>Don Iohn</hi> complaineth of the States very publiquely: Hee reprooues and vpbraids them all for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and then deales with the High-dutch Souldiers no longer by ſecret dealing in the affaires very prejudiciall to the Common-wealth (with whom very cunningly hee had long time dealt with all) but then began he very publickly to deale with them; ſo that the whole diſcovery of that buſineſſe, by divers intercepted letters, was fully come to the knowledge of the States. And many things they dayly ſaw with their eyes, as firſt when he removed his Court and family, with his Councell-companions to <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Henegow</hi> (being a very ſtrong Towne, and very fit for his conjurations and complottings) and commanded that the ſame ſhould bee provided with a ſtrong Garriſon.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when as he ſurprized the Caſtle of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, and did ſurprize thoſe well provided and fortified Townes of <hi>Namen</hi> and <hi>Charlemont,</hi> and put a ſtrong guard into them of his owne ſouldiers, thinking thereafter by treachery to haue taken in the Towne of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> So that already the principall and chiefe Cities and Townes, by the great number of his Forts and <hi>Citadels,</hi> where beleagred and oppreſſed; and then he wholly beganne to ſet vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt the Rei-publick; and alſo many other things were then done by his adviſe and motion: whereas hee according to his oath, ought to haue adviſed, that all the ſouldiers ſhould haue layd downe their Armes, and preſently to haue departed out of the Country.</p>
            <p>All which things appearing manifeſtly to the eyes of the States, who adjudged that the ſame tented to the ſubverſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; they thought that they were bound continually to keepe a good counſel-watch; neither did they turne their eyes aſide from the Rei-publick, from that time that he ſought to haue all the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, vnto whom they in all officiouſneſſe (not being mooved by any diſtemperature of minde) ſent as Embaſſadours vnto him, <hi>Marolaus</hi> and <hi>Bruſus,</hi> charging them that they ſhould preſent and ſhew, their full performance, innocency, and integrity, and ſhould free them from all ſuſpition and evill conceit, (the which they moſt certainly knew, that he miſchievouſly had diſſembled,) that the faith that was given at <hi>Gent</hi> ſhould be renued: They ſhould alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that the States ſhould make diligent enquirie, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb facs="tcp:24672:6"/>
ſeuere puniſhment vppon thoſe Treacherous murtherers and conſpirators, who (as he ſayd) layd waite for his life, and had conſpired againſt him; (making a ſhewe and diſſembling, as if to prevent the ſame, hee went to <hi>Namen</hi>:) They would aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Guard more then thoſe he had already, to the number of three hundred compleat armed men, who ſhould bee all of them <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> the which before that time was never offered to any Governour or Ruler. And yet with all theſe ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intreaties they effected nothing; for there was neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty nor reaſon to be found in <hi>Don Iohn.</hi> Nay, hee could not bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nor keepe in his owne evill arrogancy and audacious paſſion; but declared the ſame to <hi>Marollaus</hi> at the ſame time of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, boaſting himſelfe, that hee now did wholly aſſure himſelfe, and that hee doubted not, but that hee had brought vnder the ſubjection of his will and command, the Citie of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe,</hi> that hee had no lacke neither of money nor men; that hee now had all things in a readineſſe, for the furniſhing of a Warre; and that hee with his ſword, would purchaſe vnto himſelfe a greater authority, power, command and government; then the States had promiſed and granted him in the pacification of <hi>Gent</hi>; and that it was his will, that theſe Embaſſadours ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all theſe things vnto the States, for he would not conceale any thing from them that hee knew to appertaine to this his intent and will. This matter is undoubtedly ſure and certaine, and ſufficiently knowne before this, ſo that heere it is not needefull to produce witneſſes. And although it be a very miſerable thing, not to be able to deny, and very ſhamefull to be confeſt; yet I thinke verily that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelues (although they be leſſe ſhameleſſe then a man would beleeue they are) cannot deny this at any time. <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had written vnto <hi>Tre-longe,</hi> and to his other companions and fellow-workers of his ſecret trickes and conſpiracies, That hee had given as a Cymbrian ſpoyle the wealth of the Citizens of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe, for a prey vnto his Souldiers. The ſouldiers ranged already through the City, as mortall enemies, and forced the Citizens to giue them whatſoever they liſted: Many of the principall citizens began to flye out of the City, and as it were baniſhed: by which meanes the traffique and trading of the Marchants by ſhipping, beganne to ceaſe.
<pb facs="tcp:24672:7"/>
And although there were great and manifeſt tokens of their malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant enmity; yet neuertheles the States did beare al this very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly and modeſtly, and indeed would haue born yet much more, if that mortall and pittifull proiect which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> intended, had not beene diſcouered and made manifeſt as the day; euen as if a man at the firſt ſight ſeemed to perceiue ſome liveleſſe and inſenſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and afterwards by more certain and ſure ſignes and tokens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to think of what quality that was whereof hee doubted: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the States did alſo very eaſily vnderſtand, by all thoſe things which they had ſeene, that this prince did cheriſh in his mind and counſels, an hatred tending to the ruine of the common-wealth: but of what qualitie that he was, and how farre he would extend himſelfe ouer the reipublick, that they moſt euidently diſcerned and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed thereafter, both out of his owne, and by letters from others. For there were many letters intercepted in Gaſconie, viz. Two of <hi>Don Iohns,</hi> written by himſelfe vnto the King, and other from him written to <hi>Anthonie Perez</hi> the chiefe of the Kings Covncell; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over fiue letters from <hi>Eſcouedo</hi> to the King, out of which the States might aſſuredly vnderſtand, that there were fed and bred monſters, and ſtrang impoſtures; that privat conſpiracies were there practiſed; that there was great diſſention mingled among the Cities and the Nobilitie of the Netherlands; and by what meanes the ſame was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and how fit and ſerviceable it was that tyrany and the Inqvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, according to that firme reſolution of the Spaniards, ſhould bee brought in &amp; eſtabliſhed; and to that end ſoldiers, armes, and all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke preparation very earneſtly was required for the King.</p>
            <p>Conſider and vnderſtand, <hi>illuſtrious Princes,</hi> the ſecret and privie conſpiracies of this man: Heare the words which this man vſeth in his letters written to the King, which (as I ſaid before) were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. <hi>In regard that this bodie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is ſo vnhealthful, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured any otherwiſe, but by cutting off of the vnſound members, you muſt now carefully obſerue this occaſion which is preſented.</hi> And <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couedo</hi> adds thereunto the reſt very amply, as a good interpreter of his meaning, who might very well write that which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> himſelfe would not giue to vnderſtand. This <hi>Eſcouedo</hi> was the right minion and ſeruant of Audacitie and Treacherie, whom I thinke by reaſon of his nature and manners, was named <hi>Eſcouedo,</hi> becauſe that hee knew
<pb facs="tcp:24672:7"/>
by his deceit to bring the miſerable Netherlanders into his net. He wrot that vnto the King which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> would haue him to write, viz. <hi>That it poſſibly could not be, that the Netherlanders ſhould be brought vnder the pure and perfect obedience and will of the King, vnleſſe that firſt they were tamed and conſtrained thereunto with fire and ſword. That therfore both men and armes were very needfull, and that the ſame muſt be effected by warre.</hi> By the which as a good architecture of the Spaniſh tyranny, he gaue them to vnderſtand, that the crueltie and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour which <hi>Alua</hi> and <hi>Requiſenius</hi> had abuſed, muſt not continually be put in practiſe, but that the Netherlanders muſt bee enſnared by a greater deceit and hypocriſie. Like as in Nauigation, it is a point of knowledge to ſee before hand the ſtorme, that although men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine the hauen, yet (if altering the courſe) you may attaine thereinto, then it is a fooliſh deed to keepe that courſe which before was taken with great perill and danger, rather then that you altering the ſame, might attaine to the wiſh for haven. For ſo was his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the firſt raging and madneſſe of the Spaniards muſt bee ſomewhat mollified, and now muſt go to worke with diſſembled faith and promiſes. That <hi>Don Iohn</hi> who had an incredible modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an indifferent minde betwixt Ambition and Crueltie, might very fortunately effect the ſame. Hee aduiſed by his owne and his maſters counſell, that England ſhould be firſt ſurpriſed and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by warre, and then it would be eaſie to ſvrprize the Netherlandiſh prouinces.</p>
            <p>In thoſe letters which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> ſent vnto <hi>Anthony Perez</hi> his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friend; He gaue him to vnderſtand that he was of ſuch a nature and condition, that he could not liue ſtill in idleneſſe, nor could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the lawes of peace; and that his mind and conſcience could not indure that he ſhould wholly ſubmit himſelfe to the priuiledges and lawes of the Netherlanders, but that he farre rather by force of Armes would obtaine and effect for the King, a whole abſolute, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited government over the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>And if now you do not ſufficiently ſee and perceiue, that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> firſt broak the pacification of <hi>Gent,</hi> where the ſame by ſo many and cleare proofes doth appeare. Then remember (by the Eternall God) remember, I ſay, what reaſons he vſed to the Embaſſadours of our States at <hi>Marche</hi> and <hi>Famines,</hi> when he ſayd, that he would keepe
<pb facs="tcp:24672:8"/>
the contracts and conditions of peace ſo long, vntill that covenant which was begun, ſhould repent him, that is, vntill hee by his ſweet entiſings, and hypocriticall lenitie, hauing rockt the States aſleepe, at the laſt might deſtroy them; and with them ſuppreſſe the whole Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. For after the death of <hi>Iohn, Philip</hi> ſhewed very manifeſtly that that ſame in very deed ſhould haue befallen vs, like as he at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlen</hi> by the Lord of <hi>Selles</hi> certified and gaue them to vnderſtand, that he would breake the lawes of the peace, and that hee no longer would be bound to keepe them. But I pray you for what occaſion? was it for neglecting the Romiſh Religion? Aſſuredly it had neuer beene more vſed nor reuerenced with the like deuotion, care and diligence, nor neuer was the zeale of our people ſo greatly affected thereunto as then. The Biſhops of the Churches were then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; the Schooles and Colleges were partly inſtituted, partly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and augmented. Finally, there was not any thing omitted that ſerued for the maintaining of the cuſtomes and ceremonies of the Romiſh Church. So that our Netherland might well haue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, matched and ſtrouen with Italy and with Rome the chiefe ſeate and Metropolitane of that Religion. The which the Popes <hi>Nuncius,</hi> (or ſpirituall Embaſſadour) who in his behalfe was ſent vnto vs, ſhal not deny the ſame. For hee writing himſelfe vnto the Pope concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this, ſaith, that he did much admire, and was therefore excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioyfull, that thoſe preſcriptions and duties (or ſeruices) of the Romiſh Church, were exceeding well maintained by the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers in great devotion and pietie.</p>
            <p>How and after what manner the affections, wils, and devotions of all our States, and of all the Netherlanders were affected to the king, I need not to make repetition; neither is it needfvll to proove, that they delighted or loved any thing ſo mvch as to fvlfill the kings commands, and to ſhew obedience therevnto. The Trophaes, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramedes and Pageants which were made and prepared ſo ſvmptvous and coſtly to the honor, and at the entrance of <hi>Iohn,</hi> can teſtifie this. How did all the Nobles with ſvch exceeding ioy, wiſhing him good luck, receiue him? How did all the people with great mirth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycings receive him? What bankets and ſumptuous feaſts at the lands charge, were then with mvch delight made for ioy thereof, that this peace was made and concluded? And what great triumphs
<pb facs="tcp:24672:8"/>
all the Netherlanders made and demonſtrated vpon all their Theaters when this peace was made, is yet teſtified by all the inhabiting ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who were thereat exceedingly droven to admiration, yea were euen aſtoniſhed.</p>
            <p>It was no otherwiſe then, but as if the Netherlanders had then found the beginning and principles of a wel-governed Common-wealth in the perſon of this their Chiefe, or Gouernour. Yea, thou thy ſelfe <hi>Iohn,</hi> if thou wilt but enter into thine owne heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſhalt not be able to deny the ſame, That the Netherlanders did fully keep and obſerue all the contracts and conditions of the peace, which they were bound to keep; and neuer denied obedience vnto the commandement of the king, if they were not more vile then the commandements of <hi>Manlius,</hi> if they did not to too much oppugne the lawes and priviledges.</p>
            <p>But to the end that I may produce one inſtance which farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all mens admiration; and which ſhall perfect this our diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: you muſt for a certainty acknowledge, that the ſtates had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with force of Armes to haue forced the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> to haue done thoſe things which you moſt deſired, which was the induction, and as it were the ground-worke of your accuſations and complaints, if in caſe they by right, reaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, could not be brought thereunto; which things you altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcorned and rejected, and to the end that this one pretext, this onely pretence might remaine for matter for your falſe accuſations; And that this might be a juſt occaſion for your conjurations: yet this occaſion was not ſufficient thereunto, neither could it be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enough, in regard the ſame is manifeſtly knowne vnto all men, not onely to Netherlanders, but alſo to all ſtrangers, who either ſaw the whole buſineſſe as it was carried, or elſe haue heard the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> haue alwayes entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, received, and accompliſhed the precepts and commandements of the King, no otherwiſe then if they had been the Oracles or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God: That they neuer were careleſſe nor negligent in their offices or duties which by the law of Nature they were ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Prince. Yet this I will freely confeſſe, (which I will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute and conſecrate to their immortall and moſt high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> were the firſt counſellors, and ſhewed the way firſt to the other Provinces, to free and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="tcp:24672:9"/>
the common liberty. For I will at the laſt, <hi>O you moſt provident men, you moſt mighty States of Holland and Zealand,</hi> convert and turn my ſpeech and oration from thoſe wicked and horrible dealings of that diſhonorable man; to your vertues, valours, and abilities. Should I ſo ſleightly paſſe by the worthineſſe and valiant deeds, and manly courage, whereof every mans mouth is full: and for which euery one ſo highly commendeth, loveth, and honoreth you for.</p>
            <p>You haue evermore with a valiant, conſtant and perſevering cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, reſiſted and rejected that moſt intolerable and moſt cruell ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and thraldome of the Inquiſition, or Faith-preſſe. And if they now ſay, that the authoritie, reſpect and commandement of the King conſiſted therein; and that you in reſpect thereof, would not giue way, nor be obedient vnto the ſame; wherein indeed conſiſteth your glory, and whereof you may juſtly boaſt; Yet you confeſſe, to your great commendation, that you haue given theſe occaſions vnto the accuſations of <hi>Don Iohn</hi>: That you, being free from all faults, yet in this you are and will be faulty. And herein you may boaſt, That you with an eſpeciall providence and wiſedome, haue careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watched and kept your ſelues, ſo that at no time, neither by any of theſe, nor any other Spaniſh trecheries, periuries, tricks, or traps, you haue been couſoned, debaucht, nor inſnared: that you were the firſt which were inflamed with a ſingular conſtancie and courage, to deliuer the Reipublicke from the grievous yoake of tyranny and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell government. That you with the toarch of your libertie, haue been a light to enlighten all the other Provinces. And that you had farre rather, by theſe long-during warres, be ſpent, die, and indure all kinds of miſery and adverſitie: then to forſake your cuſtomes, lawes and priviledges. I beſeech the Lord God, by whoſe only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, grace and aſſiſtance, you haue atchived ſuch admirable things, that you may proſperouſly continue &amp; perſeuere therin from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth perpetually. Now will I turne me againe vnto that from which I haue digreſſed, and recommend vnto your judgment and arbittre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Oh Chriſtian Princes, all what I haue ſpoken of the deeds of <hi>Don Iohn.</hi> Take notice, iudge, and ſpeake what you thinke thereof. Conſidering that of all the States parts, there is nothing omitted, which by the law and contract they had promiſed to doe: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily for <hi>Don Iohns</hi> part, of the ten parts of the agreement or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which wholly he ought to haue performed, he hath not
<pb facs="tcp:24672:9"/>
diſcharged any one point thereof well nor honeſtly as hee ought. And hereby you may ſee, with what juſtice and equity we vndertook this buſineſſe, and how we (having vndertaken the ſame) haue dealt and proceeded therein.</p>
            <p>For when the States perceiued, that all their hope and truſt for the caſhiering of thoſe great numbers of the Germane ſouldiers was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and that they were laid in the cities, townes, and mouthes of the frontier garriſons, and that they kept <hi>Namen</hi> &amp; <hi>Charlemont,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cities and Caſtles that were very well provided; to the end that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> that way, might receiue and bring into the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands that great army which hee had deſired of the King in his letters; and moreover they perceiving that the hate and enuy of all the ſouldiers was turned vpon them, and that they with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greedy deſire longed for the pilaging of the greateſt Cities, And that they attended onely but for the leaſt ſigne and token of their Prince, to have falne rauenouſly and furiouſly, as raging beaſts, and to haue ceized vpon the liues, goods, and meanes of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders. That <hi>Don Iohn</hi> himſelfe, and other naughty people daily threatned the ruine and ſubverſion of our natiue Countrey. That they by the demoſtrations, hand-writings, mouthes and letters of their confederates, were themſelues conuinced. That they all had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ſet the cities and towns on fire, and to haue ſlaine all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and chiefe of the Citizens, to haue deſtroyed the Netherlands, and to have rooted out the Reipublick. Who is he then that would not be awaked and ſtirred vp for the defence and preſeruation of the common good? Who is he that with good counſell would not prevent the trecheries of <hi>Iohn</hi>: Who would be ſo vnprovident, and ſuch a coward, that would not defend and maintaine his owne life, with weapons and warre? Aſſuredly reaſon hath taught the learned; neceſſitie the Barbarians; cuſtome the heathens; and nature it ſelfe the vnreaſonable beaſts, to repell violence with violence, euen to their vttermoſt ability.</p>
            <p>You your ſelues, Oh great and gracious Princes, which poſſeſſe kingdomes freely and in proſperitie; may eaſily know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this; and know alſo that even ſo it muſt be done. But what do I ſay, that you muſt know it? All the Spaniards our enemies do know it, and will freely confeſſe the ſame. For they demonſtrate it in their deeds, that the ſame hath been juſt, and is ſo yet. For conſidering
<pb facs="tcp:24672:10"/>
that <hi>Henricus Caſtellanus</hi> (being a baſtard) and the great Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of King <hi>Phillip,</hi> did expell <hi>Peter</hi> his lawfull brother and right heire, out of the kingdome, becauſe he ſeemed to vſe tyrannicall dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and becauſe he ſeemed to dominiere contrary to the lawes and cuſtomes of his kingdome; And, that King <hi>Phillip</hi> vpon the ſame conditions that he inherited Spaine, did inherit the Netherlands, (viz. that he ſhould maintaine and religiouſly obſerue the lawes and cuſtomes.) Wherefore then may not we, as the Spaniards did reject <hi>Peter,</hi> even as wel reject <hi>Phillip</hi> (who oppreſſeth his ſubjects with an vnjuſt and vnlawfull government) and expel him with our armes for euer out of our Provinces.</p>
            <p>But I feare, O Princes, that I haue too much abuſed your patience, and that my oration ſeemeth to haue run ſuch a courſe, that I neede not adde any thing more thereunto. Yet I intreat your leaue, that you be pleaſed to ſuffer me, though very briefly to continue in that which <hi>Phillip</hi> ſought to effect after the government of <hi>Iohn,</hi> by the deceit of an hypocriticall and diſſembled peace; to the end that you may clearely ſee and perceiue, wherfore that we, ſo long as the world ſtands, may neuer make any peace with <hi>Phillip,</hi> but now and for euer without ceaſing, are bound to Warre againſt him. The very name of peace (I confeſſe) is exceeding ſweete, a peace that is good and ſound: But betweene peace and that bondage which is cloaked, covered, and falſly folded vp in a concealed peace, is indeede a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Peace is a ſtill and quiet liberty: but that bondage, or all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of feare thereof, is the extreame of all euils and miſchieues. Such was the peace, (if a man may call that peace) which induced, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeduced the Netherlanders even vnto <hi>Collen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When at the States by their Embaſſadours and letters vnto you and your predeceſſors, <hi>Oh all you Princes of Chriſtendome,</hi> had againe intreated; that you by your authorities, reſpect, and exhortations, ſhould ratifie, eſtabliſh, confirme, and looke vnto that peace which <hi>Phillip</hi> after a new couſening manner ſhould make, that the ſame ſhould not be deceitfull: Like as he certainely and moſt maliciouſly by his deceit ouer-threw the fame. For the Spaniards then made no delay, but preſently brought in new diſſentions into <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Henego<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> cauſing them to fall away from the other Provinces, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the which they euen vnto this preſent haue dominiered. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by force of Armes, violently they ſurpriſed <hi>Maſtricht,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:24672:10"/>
and moreouer and aboue they, partly by violence, and partly by great promiſes, haue ſovght to get into their power many other cities and prouinces.</p>
            <p>And finally is that <hi>Vliſſes</hi>-like-wit <hi>Alexander Farneſius</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> brought out of <hi>Italie,</hi> who like vnto a moſt craftie and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning bird-catcher, with the ſong of his lenitie, and promiſes of great rewards, inſnared and captiuated all the Cities and Townes of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant and Flaunders.</p>
            <p>Of this Prince I could ſay very much, which I am conſtrained to omit: Yet this one matter I cannot paſſe by in ſilence; That, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the time of his gouernment hee effected many things very great and eminent for <hi>Philip,</hi> yet could hee not eſcape of being ſuſpected, as if hee would haue vndermined the King in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, becauſe that through his gentleneſſe, linitie and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; he had drawne vnto him the affections of all the Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that hee alſo ſeemed perſpicuouſly to haue looked into, and alſo to beare a hatred to the wickedneſſe and fraudulent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and deceites of the Spaniards. Therefore <hi>Philip</hi> gaue him <hi>fungos,</hi> or Toads-bread to eate, which <hi>Agrippina</hi> had ſo commended to the Emperour, to the end that by the power and operation thereof, he might be admitted, counted and receiued into the number of the gods.</p>
            <p>But I pray you, what was that at laſt for a peace, which as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met or bright ſhining ſtarre, ſhined vnto vs out of the firmament of the Spaniſh trecheries vnto which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> counſelled vs, at what time the Arch-enemy ſtood, as it were, ouer our heads, and that the incredible great Spaniſh Fleet filled and couered the great Ocean or main Sea? A Fleet which was ſo terrible to behold, that I can hardly iudge, whether the Fleet that <hi>Xerxus</hi> had, which couered the Sea called <hi>Mare Ponticum</hi> had a greater number of Shippes, more Souldiers, or greater warlike preparation. With this Fleet <hi>Phillip</hi> had thought totally to haue ſuppreſſed vs: who were at that time raviſhed, as it were, with that pleaſant and delightfull ſound of peace. Yet when this Fleet, by the onely power of the Almighty God, was wonderfully deſtroyed and brought to naught; then preſently by the Emperours Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours hee offered theſe Prouinces a new Treatie of Peace, to the end, that he thereby might tranſport all his Army and power of
<pb facs="tcp:24672:11"/>
warre out of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> The treacheries which many yeeres before he had plotted againſt that kingdome, beganne then to haue a wonderfull good progreſſion: For his naturall kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Henry</hi> being made away by paracide, (or his murthering of a kinſman,) and the ſtate of all that kingdome, being vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with Ciuill warre; then the matter, and the preſent occaſion required, that he with Armes and a mighty Hoaſt ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his deſigne, in that flouriſhing and famous great Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> which Kingdome hee by violence hauing taken in and conquered, he might thereafter, without any trouble at all, haue ſubiugated thoſe Netherlandiſh Prouinces, and all the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>What? Is it yet lawfull for me, or may I yet ſpeake any more of Arrereges, or reſidue of the dangers of this Reipublicke? Yes, it is lawfull for me, and it ſhall be lawful for me alwayes to ſtand for the dignity of my natiue Countrey, and to confeſſe the truth. Like as all good Orators, or eloquent ſpeakers, doe euer keepe ſome of their moſt forcible and ponderous Arguments to the laſt. And like as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Generals vſe to place their beſt ſouldiers in the laſt rankes; euen ſo <hi>Phillip</hi> in theſe latter yeares preſented a peace vnto theſe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> which ſhould be adorned and confirmed with notable fidelity; the whole foundation and chiefe ground worke thereof, lay and conſiſted in the vertues, mercy, endeuors, diligence, and in the loue of the Arch-duke <hi>Erneſtus</hi> his ſiſters ſonne; who, after the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> was placed in the gouernment of theſe Prouinces: He promiſed theſe Prouinces a peace; not ſuch a peace as ſhould be limited with any grieuous or heauie conditions and contracts, like as the former was; but ſuch a peace as they themſelues would wiſh or deſire. In the meane time <hi>Phillip</hi> ſent his great and huge Armies into <hi>France,</hi> and his ſecret murtherers into <hi>Holland,</hi> to haue murthered the Illuſtrious Prince <hi>Mauritts,</hi> Earle of <hi>Naſſow,</hi> a famous and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imitator of the vertues and valour of his father, and a ſingular defender of our Liberty; and by ſuch an odious and treacherous villainy, to haue made him away; like as they, but a little before, by a moſt cruell and trecherous hand, had murthered his moſt worthy and valiant father, the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And finally <hi>Phillip</hi> concluded many more miſchieuous, and more wicked purpoſes againſt theſe Prouinces, then euer before he could
<pb facs="tcp:24672:11"/>
haue bethought himſelfe of. I doe not ſpeake any thing vnaduiſedly, <hi>ô Princes,</hi> but that which thouſands beſides me of good reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can teſtifie in faith and verity, and that which <hi>Phillips</hi> owne let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe make good.</p>
            <p>What then? Meaneth the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that our States by any propoſitions of peace, can bee diuerted from their enterpriſes and deſignments? Doth he not yet know and vnderſtand, that all our affections are ſo abdurate and hardned, that we will far rather yeeld and giue place to Armes and Warre, then to any kind of new inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peace-treacheries, after what manner ſoeuer the ſame might be propounded? Or, thinketh he peraduenture, that the affections of our States euery day, lie open to his deſire and appetite? What? Is he yet ignorant, that the counſels of all our people, with a generall conſent and vniformity of voices, are long agoe vnited and knit faſt together in this point; and that they will farre rather honourably in warre and Armes liue and die, for their Lawes, and for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Country; then from henceforth ſhamefully to ſinke or quaile, vnder his treacheries and deceits? What, doe I ſay ſinke or quaile? Nay, to come into the extreameſt euills of Tyrannie; to bee bound with vntolerable and inhamane bonds of ſlauerie, and to bee recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and accounted among thoſe ſlaues that are bought and ſould. We haue prepared, made ready and ſharpened, a perpetuall and an euerlaſting warre and Armes againſt him: we neither haue, nor may caſt our eyes vpon any other peace, then vpon ſuch a peace as is grounded, confirmed, and may bee maintained with force and Armes.</p>
            <p>But in regard that a little before I beganne to ſpeak of <hi>France,</hi> and to proue that our warre partly was joyned with that ſame; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will proceede to adde ſome other matters hereunto, by the which you may evidently ſee and perceiue, how many treacheries, traps and deceits that <hi>Phillip</hi> hath laid for them.</p>
            <p>He hath a long time ſince, as you know, <hi>O Princes,</hi> laboured and endeuored to aſſaile <hi>France,</hi> with all the violence and force of his warre; to the end that he by the occaſion of the Civill diſſentions in <hi>France,</hi> might effect ſo much by his wars and charges: that if he could not ſwallow and devoure the whole Kingdome; yet that at the leaſt he might get a great part thereof. For he had made his full reckoning and accovnt before hand, by preparing of that cruell
<pb facs="tcp:24672:12"/>
Fleet, that both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> had been a prey vnto their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Wheras thoſe good Princes, notwithſtanding had nothing at all endamaged him, neither was he by any juiuſtice provoked to that warre; vnleſſe peradventure it be, that he thought this occaſion ſufficient; that the Pope, at the will and deſire of <hi>Phillip</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated thoſe two flouriſhing Kingdoms, for their exerciſing and miniſtery of the Reformed Religion; who for the extirpation and eradication of that Religion; <hi>Phillip</hi> as a <hi>Cato Maior,</hi> with the puiſſance of the Romiſh Cenſores (or correction maſters) vſeth to haue regard vnto all the Kings and people of the earth, and therefore to correct and puniſh them, which is indeede a matter known vnto you all; for which no man can ſufficiently wonder at the ſhamefulneſſe thereof, and might now neither be paſſed by nor omitted. And that <hi>Phillip</hi> in theſe warres of France dealt moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and with the greateſt diligence and alacrity, with the Duke of <hi>Feres,</hi> and other Spaniards of the League, whom he as compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had aſſiſted in that warre, to haue eſtranged the Right and Title of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> not onely from the ſucceſſion or deſcent of the Kings blood and kinred, but euen from all Frenchmen, and to haue drawne the ſame to <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſo certaine, <hi>O Princes,</hi> that there is no man which doubteth of the truth hereof. But to what end do I bring theſe into your Remembrances; What is this to maintaine the purpoſe I haue in hand; For this end it ſerueth; thereby to proue how excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great the ambition is of this moſt cruell Tyrant; and to the end you may perceiue and ſee how greatly, not onely we, but euen all of you together, muſt keep good watch and looke vnto it. For like as the nature of the Vine, is to extend the branches, as the armes thereof farre and wide, and therewith embraceth and layeth hold vpon euery thing that is neer it, if it be not lopt and pruned; Euen ſo ſhall <hi>Phillip,</hi> if you doe not all at once make reſiſtance, at the laſt deſtroy and devoure all Chriſtendom, with moſt cruell and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy warre.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he by his Btibery, and ſecret conſpiracy had lately effected ſo much in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that ſome of the chiefe of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſhould haue received and taken in twenty thouſand Spaniards, if they had not been puniſhed (after the matter was knowne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed) according as their treaſon deſerued. I need not to thinke
<pb facs="tcp:24672:12"/>
with my ſelfe, that I can ſufficiently expreſſe with words, what trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, what perills, what daungers, he, ſo oftentimes hath attempted againſt the Queene and Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> Can ambition and violence proceed yet any further? Yes truely, For the like treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries practiſed hee a little before againſt the Principallity of <hi>Collen,</hi> the Dukedomes of <hi>Gelders, Gulich, Cleane</hi>; the County of <hi>Berghe,</hi> and that ancient Emperiall Towne of <hi>Aken</hi>: All which is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly and apparantly knowne by good Teſtimony, and by his owne letters. And who knoweth in what lurking hole and corner of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and diſſimulation, he hideth and ſheltreth his moſt mortall hate againſt the moſt mighty Princes of <hi>Italy</hi>; whom (as ſoone as the wind of the firſt oportunity ſhall blow (very ſuddenly, ſhall be turned into coales and aſhes, by his vnquenchable and fearefull great flames of Warre.</p>
            <p>Doe ye not yet ſee and perceiue enough, <hi>ô Princes,</hi> what treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and deceits that <hi>Philip</hi> prepareth, for your moſt happy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Prouinces, which are your Patrimonies? Conſidering there is no man ſo blind nor ſenſeleſſe, who ſeeth not, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not that the ambition of <hi>Phillip</hi> neuer reſteth, but dayly draweth him from land to land, and raiſeth a new warre out of war; So that he by warres, ſinne, miſchiefe, and meere villanous deceits and treacheries, vnder the pretence of a ſeeming-peace, ſeeketh to deject and detrude euery one of you from the ſeate of your Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For this his deſire is vnſatiable and immoderate, and cannot be included nor ſhut vp, neither in Heauen nor in Earth. If that all <hi>Phillips</hi> Kingdomes which he uſeth commonly in that long traine or taile of his moſt proud Titles and Termes of Honour were put or layd into one of the Seales of <hi>Critolaes</hi> ballance, and in his other ſeale his Ambition or greedie deſire of Honour; All the Kingdomes would ſcarcely weigh the quantity of one graine, in compariſon of his Ambition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great looked about for more worlds, when he had conquered the whole world; but <hi>Phillip</hi> would, if he could, with the Gyants aſſault the heauens. And therefore, <hi>O Princes,</hi> and you <hi>moſt peacefull Princes,</hi> I intreate you, and I would admoniſh you, that you judge no more of the occaſion and lawfulneſſe of our warre; but in your judgements and opinions to hold it for good: and I exhort you moſt earneſtly againe and againe, that you by all
<pb facs="tcp:24672:13"/>
meanes, both in your vnderſtandings, and with all your powers, will take heed of the treacheries, robberies, and miſchievous practiſes of <hi>Phillips</hi> deceit.</p>
            <p>In former times, whenas the Athenians, partly with warre, and partly with deceits and treacheries, ſought to get unto themſelues certaine neere adjacent places, as the Cities of <hi>Syracuſa, Lacaedemon, Meſſena</hi> and <hi>Catina</hi>: they by their immoderate Ambition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of others Rights, drewe ſuch an hatred upon their owne heads, that <hi>Darius</hi> the moſt mighty King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> with the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Grecia,</hi> voluntarily undertooke and proſecuted warre againſt them, unto which euery man ranne and haſted, as to quench a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke flame. But you, <hi>O moſt Illuſtrious Princes,</hi> ought long ago to haue expelled <hi>Phillip,</hi> (with your conjoyned forces from you, and from your proſperous States) that ſeeketh continually your liues and Kingdomes, by moſt unjuſt warre, and by moſt wicked enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes.</p>
            <p>And it concernes, and is fitting, not onely for you, who for a long time ſince, haue beene provoked, ſpurred, and ſtirred up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by the many injuries and ambition of <hi>Phillip,</hi> but euen you altogether, who ſee and perceiue, that he incroacheth with violence upon the limmits of your neighbours; and with an eaſie and ſlow pace creepeth and incroacheth towards your Countries. It ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you upon in time to looke unto it; to the end, that your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries, being conquered and brought under his ſlauery and bondage, Tyranny, when you leſt thinke upon it, do not incroach upon you.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, after the Battell with the <hi>Tribaldes,</hi> had entertained a long diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling warre with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the <hi>Thebeans</hi> aſſembled themſelues for this occaſion; fearing, leſt when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had bene conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the fire of their neighbouring-warre might haue flowne unto them. And a little before, there being a confederacy made betwixt two of the mightieſt Cities; who, before had bene at extreme enmity with each other, terrified thereby, and by their Embaſſadors, all the Country of <hi>Grecia</hi>: eſteeming it ſo, that a common enemy ought and muſt be repelled with common force; ſo that if the firſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> had had good ſucceſſe; he would not haue held up, nor reſted untill he had conquered and ſubjugated the
<pb facs="tcp:24672:13"/>
whole country of <hi>Grecia.</hi> The <hi>Romanes</hi> in former time, perceauing that the power of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> increaſed and grew great, they had an eſpecial care that the <hi>Carthagenians</hi> ſhould not grow ſo great as to ouer-maſter them: And for that end they ſent their ſouldiers to relieue the <hi>Mamertines</hi> from the beleagring, and to relieue <hi>Spain</hi> from ſeruitude of the <hi>Africans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are not very lightly incited to warre, but when the matter of neceſſity conſtrayneth them: Yet they neuer tefuſed to ſend their warlike power for the ſuccour of others that were under them, when they perceaued that their neighbours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with each other, with an vnreaſonable and an immoderate violent ambitione.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and the like even to an innumirable examples (or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes) doe teach you, how carefully you muſt take heede of that moſt peſtilent evill, of the Spaniſh ambition; and do ſhew; or proue, that it is a righteous and juſt cauſe, that even all you with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us, proſecute a warre againſt that Tyrant.</p>
            <p>For our States do know, that the occaſion of their warre againſt <hi>Phillip,</hi> is not onely exceeding juſt and righteous, and ever was: but alſo, that they at no time, now nor never, may ceaſe their warre, that they may make no peace with <hi>Phillip,</hi> but alwayes muſt maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine warre againſt that Tyrant. For we are taught by our friends, how we muſt take heed of our enemies: For if <hi>Phillip</hi> do gape and long ſo earneſtly, and with ſuch diligence for your Kingdomes; like as you ſee he daily doth; how then ſhall we ſpeed? For aſſuredly he wil never lay aſide Armes before that he hath ſubjugated all the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> under him, becauſe it is a Countrey ſo fit for his purpoſe; who, out of them may attempt many enterpriſes upon your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and dayly may beginne to raiſe new warres againſt you, and draw out of them Souldiers, Armes, and all manner of warlike provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt your adjacent Countries. And therefore he would farre rather caſt the greateſt part of Chriſtendome for a prey to the <hi>Turke</hi>; then to ceaſe theſe warres.</p>
            <p>At the laſt Parliament in <hi>Germany,</hi> he would not conſent to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Emperor with any ſoldiers, nor aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Turke</hi>; and the reaſon was, becauſe he might the better vexe Chriſtendome with warre.</p>
            <p>Doe yee yet doubt of this, <hi>O yee Princes,</hi> which you your ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:24672:14"/>
haue ſeene, that <hi>Phillip</hi> in the beginning of our ciuill commotions, had far rather looſe two Kingdoms, <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Goulet,</hi> which the <hi>Turkes,</hi> under their General <hi>Sinam Baſcha</hi> then recouered from him, then that hee would for a while ceaſe his warres with us; or would remoue his Souldiers out of theſe Prouinces, againſt the moſt deadly and mortal enemy of all Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>And you know how many Souldiers, how much Armes, and what charges <hi>Phillip</hi> hath been at, and waſted, to maintain this war againſt us. So that if you would but reckon up the ſame, you ſhall find that he might haue bought and purchaſed two <hi>Netherlands</hi> with that mony: although notwithſtanding they be very great, rich, and exceeding copious. So that there is no doubte of this, but <hi>Phillip</hi> would far rather endure the greateſt loſſe that might betide him then that he would leaue <hi>Bellgium</hi> with out <hi>bellum,</hi> or the Low-countries without long encountrings of warre, with out ſtrife, without ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they might liue in peace and quietneſſe, freely and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to their Lawes and priuiledges. For by this war, and with the conqueſt of our Prouinces, he wil lay and eſtabliſh the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt foundation and ſureſt ground-worke of his Monarchy, Sole-dominion, Tyrannie, and cruel Gouernment. For when he ſaw and perceaued that theſe Countries were ſo ſingularly fitting for his cruel treacheries and deſgnments, and that our Lawes and Liberties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traryly did wholy oppoſe the ſame: therfore ſought he firſt of all with warre, with force and violence, to plucke vp, teare in ſunder, and with violence, to oppreſſe the ſame, to the end, that his ſubiects of other Kingdoms, which at this preſent he hath ſubiugated, or elſe might ſubiugate hereafter; from this our concording, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall defence of our Lawes and Liberty, might take no example or inſtance, with the greater courage and alacrity, to ſtand for, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their liberty.</p>
            <p>What do you then iudge, <hi>ô you moſt peaceful Princes?</hi> or what is your concluſion that our States ought to doe, who chiefly ſeek for the common good of their natiue Countrey? Verily it cannot be with them, as it is vnder the Gouernment of a cruel Tirant, and as it uſually is in ill-gouerned Reipublicks: they are not vſed to be lead, and to ſubmit themſelues at any time, with cap and knee, as flatterers doe? to the wills, deſires, and luſts of their ſuperiour Lords, nor to be dealt with all as hired ſlaues? conſidering that
<pb facs="tcp:24672:14"/>
they neuer would admit nor ſuffer, that their Lawes, Liberties, nor their Reipublick, ſhould bow or ſubmit vnder the yoake of vniuſt and vnlawfull Government: But haue as good fathers of their natiue-Countrey; as good fighters for their freedome, and Defendors of their Lawes, (like as it muſt be in a Reipublick which is moderately and ciuilly gouerned by their Prince) directed their deſignes, wils, and gouernment of their ſuperiour Lord; according to their Lawes, and the preſeruation of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>Do you think that the Spaniards ſhall ſpoyle and cruell vexe and torment our Reipublick; and that we with ſhame will leaue and quit the ſame? Shall we neglect our deare countrey and liberty? Muſt we deſpiſe the lawes of our predeceſſors? And ſhall they peruert &amp; turn topſie-turvie our ciuill orders and policy into tyranny? And ſhall we with wringing hands look vpon the coarſe, and behold the exequies or funerall of our <hi>patria</hi> and natiue countrey? Shal they rend &amp; teare in peeces the body of our common-wealth, and like moſt ravenous beaſts deuoure the ſame? And ſhall we like ſlaues, with praying and intreating, hardly preſerue our own liues, goods, and meanes? Or do ye not far rather laud &amp; extol with the higheſt commendation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, this will and affection of our States, for their manumiſing and preſeruing of their deare and natiue countrey? Incite and exhort you them to proceed as they are beſt able, and to the vttermoſt of their powers, for the preſervation and manumiſing of their owne liues and liberty? Come not theſe things daily into your remembrances, when you think of the Netherlandiſh warre, or diſcourſe thereof, which I haue now demonſtrated, and with ſure and infallible and vncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable reaſons proued vnto you, viz. that our States, &amp; all the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, being drenched and ſoaked in miſery, and oppreſſed with the cruelty of the Spaniards; and being expeld out of their natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, of meere neceſſity were conſtrained to take Arms againſt <hi>Philip.</hi> And that now all the other treacheries, infidelities &amp; iniuries which the Spaniards during the time of theſe wars haue done vnto the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders, being ſo great, ſo inhumane, and ſo incredible, that they themſelues (ſo to ſpeak) do earneſtly exhort, do require &amp; command, that the States with a conſtant courage, ſhould keepe and maintaine their armes, and neither now, nor neuer, to lay them out of their hands; but to ſhew vnto the other ſubiects of <hi>Phillip</hi> (thoſe of <hi>Sicilia,
<pb facs="tcp:24672:15"/>
Calabria, Lombardy, Arragon, Caſtile, India,</hi> &amp; <hi>Portugal</hi>) yea euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelues, <hi>O Illuſtrious Princes,</hi> I ſay to ſhew, and with valiant deeds to proue, that not onely we, but all of you together, yea and all men vpon the face of the earth, far rather ought to dye, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or looke vpon the face of that tyrant.</p>
            <p>Do ye yet think, or can you imagine with your ſelues, that <hi>Phillip,</hi> with the limits of our countrey, hath limited in his tyranny? Do yee not yet ſee and perceiue, that the high aſcending and mortall flames of the Spaniſh tyranny, devoureth and ſwalloweth vp the treſholds, doores, and turrets of your kingdomes? Ariſe, and at the laſt awake out of this your ſleepe and careleſneſſe; come hither with ſpeede, and in all haſte flye hereinto, for to quench theſe vniuerſall fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames. Wherefore do yee ſeeke vnto vs againſt our wils, by your counſels, authorities, and reſpects, to induce vs to make peace with <hi>Phillip</hi>; whereas it had been more fitting, that you your ſelues long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, with warre and force of armes ſhould haue expelled <hi>Philip,</hi> and with an eſpeciall force and power to haue ſuppreſt him?</p>
            <p>And to the end I may ſpeake vnto you all one after another, you <hi>moſt mighty Princes of Germany,</hi> be ſencible, that <hi>Philip</hi> in your Dutchland doth not hunt after a cruell and vniuſt government; but (ſo to ſpeake) doth poſſeſſe the ſame already. For he hauing once conquered theſe Netherlandiſh prouinces; when you will not bow and ſubmit to his gouernment: he will haue all the hauens of the ſea, and the mouthes of all the Germane riuers at his owne will, and in his owne power: thereby afterwards to impoſe ſuch grieuous toles and taxations, vpon your nauigation and trading, or elſe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will hinder the ſame, euen as it ſhall pleaſe himſelfe. And this is that for which, and in behalfe whereof, one or two of the prouinces doe appeare in your aſſemblies and conſultations: you heare him publickly ſpeak his minde, and you eſteeme and preferre his tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call advice and counſell, before your owne proſperity and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. You haue him, the Biſhop of <hi>Friſinghen</hi> and <hi>Hildeſhem</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before; and you haue ſeene them made Princes and Prince-Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Empire; The Biſhop of <hi>Collen, Liege,</hi> and <hi>Magdeborgh</hi>: and you haue ſeene that the moſt ambitious Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> hath laid ſnares for you all.</p>
            <p>And to the end that I may turne my ſpeech vnto you, <hi>O you illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious &amp; mighty powerful Princes of Poland,</hi> hath not <hi>Philip</hi> brought
<pb facs="tcp:24672:15"/>
a great number of that generation of mankind, (I ſay Ieſuites) into your Countrey, by whoſe religion and policy they haue brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole world into an vp-rore, to the end that he by their meanes, with Sun-ſhine-like deceits, might propound vnto you what his will and counſell is.</p>
            <p>To you alſo, <hi>moſt peaceful Princes of Italy,</hi> I haue already ſayd, and ſay againe, that the ſword of the Spaniſh tyranny hangeth by a very ſmall threed ouer your heads, already naked and drawne out of the ſcabberd.</p>
            <p>And for you, <hi>O moſt illuſtrious Senators (or Priuy Councellors) of Venice,</hi> you your ſelues haue ſeen and beheld the tyranny of <hi>Phillip</hi> in your owne State and gouernment, when he ſent money to arme the Turke againſt you; and diuerted the power and force of the Turk from his owne dominions vpon <hi>Cypris</hi>; although that hee by thee quity and right of the covenant, had been exceedingly oblie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and beholding vnto you.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>O Princes of Christendome,</hi> yet euen now, at the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt, be carefull of your owne eſtates and affaires, of your owne liues and proſperitie; marke and conſider it well, that <hi>Phillip</hi> is enemy and tyrant to you all, and ſuffer him to liue no longer in the world: but reſiſt and impeach his ambition to reigne, and that his peſtilent and mortall government proceed no further. And like as ſome certaine members are cut off when they begin to be without life and blood, and are hurtfull to all the other parts of the body; euen ſo muſt you alſo eſteeme, that this inhumane cruelty in humane ſhape, muſt (ſo to ſpeak) be ſeparated and cut from the common body of men. Verily the deed of the Perſians is much to be commended, and ought to be wel thought upon of you all; who when <hi>Cometes</hi> and <hi>Oropaſtes</hi> two of their Magicians (or wiſe men) by the like tyrannie and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Smerdis,</hi> King of Perſia, poſſeſſed the Kingdom: they were ſlaine by the valour of ſeuen of the ableſt Princes of Perſia, all of them running with a ſingular affection, diligence, and burning zeale to kill and to deſtroy thoſe tyrants with their ſwords, one of the Magitians claſped about the neck of one of the Princes whoſe name was <hi>Gebrias,</hi> which made his companions to linger the more, becauſe they would not kill him in ſteed of the Magician (for this was done in a dark place) who commanded the Magician to thruſt his ſword through his body. Yet in the end the Magician was ſlaine, and this
<pb facs="tcp:24672:16"/>
valiant <hi>Gebrias</hi> (who had rather to haue died, then that the tyrant ſhould haue eſcaped with life) was ſaved, and had his life preſerved, Such an hate did theſe men beare to tyrants.</p>
            <p>The Grecians informer times attributed divine honour to thoſe men who had ſlaine a tyrant, And doe you thinke that the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers ſhall do euill, or more vniuſt, that they oppoſe and reſiſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> that jnhumane tyrant.</p>
            <p>The Romanes expelled their King <hi>Taquinus Superbus,</hi> becauſe that he, did but in ſome ſort weaken the ſtate of their common-wealth; and ſhall we ſuffer or indure <hi>Phillip</hi> in our common-wealth, who not onely with fire and ſword would deſtroy and turn-vp-ſide-downe all the Netherlands, but euen the whole world? No, by no meanes. Our States without doubt, will proceede and prepare the way for you to break off, and to expel this tyrant. They wil perſeuere to diuert, driue away, and to foyle him ſo farre and wide from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing and killing of our proſperity, that once, not onely they and theirs, but alſo euen the other provinces of the Netherlands, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re-eſtabliſhed in their former liberty, and may lead them out of the ſtraights of the Spaniſh tyranny, and repoſſeſſe them in the poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of their predeceſſors. That finally, they being re-eſtabliſhed, and better ordered, and vnited and bound with the Prouinces of the whole Netherlands; they may ſtop the incurſion and invaſion of this cruell tyrant, and altogether with one accord may expell him from their proſperity, and from their common liberty. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, thou art to vnderſtand, gentle Reader, that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> was louingly receiued here in the 17 Prouinces, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath was taken on both parts; the King for his part ſwore to maintaine all their Lawes and Priuiledges, and they to him all due homage and allgeance: Hee preſently demanded of them a ſumme of money, whereupon the States did aſſemble, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for him 40. millions of Florines, of <hi>Brabants</hi> money, to be paid in nine yeares, and paid it into his Exchequer; and although it was more then they had paid before to his predeceſſours, yet vpon this he did take great diſpleaſure againſt them; and, as they write, he for this did hate them to death.</p>
            <p>But he pretended this to be the cauſe of his wroth, becauſe he ſaw that there were ſome among them, that did defie the Pope and all his Religion: but that could not be, for the Citie of <hi>Aelſt</hi> was as ſuperſtitious in that Religion as <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe; for they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Reformed Religion euen vnto death: and yet for all that both they, and 170 faire Villages that belonged vnto them, were by them plundered and ſpoyled of all their goods, and many of them wounded and tormented for to confeſſe where their mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney was, and many were killed. Thus much by the way.</p>
            <p>My ſcope and chiefe intent, is to ſhew the firſt and iuſt cauſe of the warres in the <hi>Netherlands</hi>; whereby the diligent Reader (not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affected) may clearely vnderſtand, that the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> did not rebelliouſly take vp Armes againſt a lawfull Prince, (as ſome ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly thinke and ſpeake) but iuſtly and religiouſly defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt a perfidious Tyrant who ſought their ruine, by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes he could, and the ſubuerſion of the whole State. A long while they patiently vnder-went his cruell oppreſſions, and intollerable vexations, as the Hiſtories clearely manifeſt; till there was no hope, but either they muſt become ſlaues in ſoule and body, worſe then that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they and theirs for euer, or elſe be butchered by mercileſſe executioners of a cruell Tyrant.<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:24672:17"/>
which ſaid Inquiſition (raiſed in <hi>Spaine</hi>) concluded and pronounced certaine Articles, the tenth of February 1568, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the King, the 26. following. Now becauſe it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare I doe them no wrong in this charge, I will lay downe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles themſelues verbatim.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſacred Office of Inquiſition ſo often attempted in the Netherlands by his Maieſtie, and hindered vntill this time, ſhall be inſtituted and aduanced in this manner, which is moſt expedient.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They muſt perſwade the Emperour, being gone aſtray, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly confederated with heretikes, that hee reſigne his Kingdomes vnto his Sonne, with the whole adminiſtration of the Neither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That the Emperour with his two ſiſters, hauing giuen ouer all affaires, leauing the Netherlands, ſhall retire into Spaine vnto Vs, being aſſured that they ſhall neuer returne more to doe any harme.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Theſe being diſpatcht, we muſt alſo draw the king to vs, and keepe him for euer that he part not, and not ſuffer any Flemmings to haue acceſſe or conference with him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That the King write vnto, and command the Clergie of the Netherlands that with the Inquiſition they ſhould accept of 15 new Biſhops, the which ſhould be free from all ſecular iuriſdiction, yea in caſes of treaſon.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The ſubiects of the Netherlands through their malice and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, will reuolt and moue ſeditions and tumults, pleaſing to all but to our companie.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The Princes and Noblemen, heads and authours of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with the ſubiects, muſt be taken away, and the others redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto reaſon.</p>
            <p n="7">7 They ſhall hire at our charge theeues and ſpoilers of Churches and Images, whoſe offences ſhall be by all the world imputed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, by ſome ſubtill meanes, and ſo we ſhall vanquiſh them.</p>
            <p n="8">8 That all Comerce, Negotiation, Liberties and Priuiledges, ſhall be rooted out, and that all be reduced to extreame pouertie, whereby the realme ſhall be permanent for Vs.</p>
            <p n="9">9 No man of all thoſe Countries (except he be of our faction) ſhall be held worthy to liue; and finally all to be rooted out: and all Goods, Poſſeſſions, Arts, and Trades, and all Orders to bee
<pb facs="tcp:24672:18"/>
taken away, vntill there may bee a new Realme, and a new people.</p>
            <p n="10">10 In this action the wiſe and valiant Duke <hi>Alva</hi> ſhal be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in perſon; whereas any other, were he of the bloud Royall, or a Prince, ſhall be of no eſteeme: ſo as being ſuſpect, yea in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt matters, they muſt be diſpatcht.</p>
            <p n="11">11 No Contracts, Rights, Promiſes, Donations, Oathes, Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and ſolemne Aſſertions of the Netherlands, ſhall be of any force for the Inhabitants, as being guilty of high treaſon.</p>
            <p n="12">12 But aboue al we muſt haue an eſpeciall care that in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſo great weight and moment, wee proceed not violently, but by meanes, by degrees, and that diſcreetly, to the end the Princes, Nobilitie, and inferiour ſubiects may mutinie amongſt themſelues, ſo that one may perſecute, yea execute the other vntill at laſt the hangman be executed himſelfe. For in all Chriſtendome is there not a Nation more fooliſh and indiſcreet, and whoſe levitie and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy may ſooner be deceiued then theſe Netherlanders and God puniſheth them accordingly.</p>
            <p>There were other Articles found in Preſident <hi>Vergaes</hi> chamber at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> and there Printed; and thoſe are more cruell then theſe.</p>
            <p>By theſe articles and vnlimited power of theſe lawleſſe Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, no man had any aſſurance of life or goods for a day, but were in danger continually to be called into queſtion, either for the law of their God, or for ſome work of mercie, which either religion, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall equitie, or the bond of nature called for: or elſe if they had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for none of theſe, they would impoſe ſuch vnreaſonable taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which if the Cormorants had not their gorges crambed full, they would make prey of all, whether by right or wrong it mattered not. But my purpoſe being to auoid prolixitie, and to paſſe by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies and needleſſe repetitions, I will come to that I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In the yeare 1565, a match was concluded for the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the nuptials were ſolemnized at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> whither all the Nobilitie and Gentry of the Countrey were inuited, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyt, here met of them about foure hundred, who like faithfull <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> being grieued to ſee the daily oppreſſion of their brethren by the hard task-maſters of the Inquiſition, who not onely robbed them of
<pb facs="tcp:24672:18"/>
their goods, but alſo by inhumane crueltie, and vnnaturall butchery, depriued them of their liues, who daily led them as ſheepe vnto the ſlaughter: The conſideration hereof they ioyntly layd to heart, and hereupon (being met vpon this occaſion) they reſolued to preſent a petition to the Princeſſe of <hi>Parma,</hi> which they did the fifth of April next following. The Earle of Breedrod deliuering the petition, humbly requeſted a fauourable anſwer. Three dayes after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued this anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> they ſhould ſend two of their Noblemen to the king, by whom ſhe would write in their behalfe. The Lord of Barlaymont being preſent, after their departure ſaid (<hi>like a flattering Courtier</hi>) they were a company of Raſcals and Beggars.</p>
            <p>It was concluded that the Marqueſſe of Bargen, and the Lord of Mountigny ſhould goe into Spaine, who humbly preſented their ſuit to the King, but could get no anſwer in 16 Moneths after.</p>
            <p>The 26 of Auguſt <hi>anno</hi> 1566, the Princeſſe of <hi>Parma</hi> ſent for the Gentrie, telling them ſhe had receiued letters from the King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining promiſe that all ſhould be well, and that the Inquiſition ſhould ceaſe. And for the Proclamations they ſhould not be of force, but his Maieſtie would take ſuch order as they and the State ſhould well like of. The Princeſſe alſo gaue them toleration for their Religion, on condition, they ſhould not deface, nor breake downe the ornaments of the Churches: for, there had beene before this time vilde and lewde perſons that frequented the meetings of the Reformed; theſe went into the Papiſts Churches, ſtole their ſiluer and what was worth carrying away, and brake down their Images: but the Reformed ſuſpected that this was done by the appointment of the Princeſſe; neither was their ſuſpition without good ground, for it is to be ſeene in the Kings letters, <hi>Art.</hi> 7. that ſhe had order to hire this raskall company to doe this villany,<note place="margin">

               </note> which fact was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Proteſtants, to the end that they might not only be odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous there, but alſo ſeeme guilty, euen in the iudgement of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; howbeit the offenders were puniſhed with impriſonment, yea, with death, euen by the Reformed themſelues, who iointly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the action vnlawfull, and were ſo farre from hauing occaſion of offence in this nature, that Papiſt Burgers themſelues offered good ſecuritie that no ſuch thing ſhould be attempted by them. Who then can make any doubt that they were free from giuing any hand in thoſe outrages laid to them, the very oppoſites in Religion
<pb facs="tcp:24672:19"/>
being Iudges, who as appeares were willing to undertake for them; now as their faithfulneſſe brought ſo good effect for their perſons, ſo did the Lord worke that the truth of Religion found many friends likewiſe, the Lord wondrouſly proſpering the courſe of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſo much that in ſhort ſpace they had in <hi>Flanders</hi> 60 Aſſemblies, ſome Churches themſelues builded, but were by Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> ſoone caſt downe, who erected gallowſes of them, and hanged them vpon them.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſe of <hi>Parma</hi> alſo began to entertaine ſouldiers with pretence to apprehend the Church-robbers, but intended indeed to take away the ancient Liberties and Priuiledges of the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> wherefore ſending certaine companies to <hi>Valencyn,</hi> the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants denied them entertainment, who for that were proclaimed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels the 14 of December, ſoone after they were beſieged, ſacked, and many of them put to death.</p>
            <p>But before they of <hi>Valencyn</hi> denied entertainment to the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Let pretended it for religion, but his aime was to get their lands and goods.</hi>
               </note> the Nobility had receiued letters out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Bargen,</hi> ſhewing, that the King was exceedingly incenſed againſt the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> that he had in the preſence of many vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be fully reuenged of them, though it were with the hazard of all his Countries; that hee would make them an example to all the world, and would inuite the Pope and Emperour to aſſiſt him in this quarrell. Vpon the receit of the letters the Nobility aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Dortmond</hi> to conſult what were beſt to be done, but conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not any thing, ſome iudging it ſafeſt to ioyne, and make head to reſiſt his tyrannicall furie, other ſeeking rather to eſcape by flight.</p>
            <p>Now was the Inquiſition againe brought in contrary to the Lawes and Liberties of the Country, which the King was ſworne to maintaine, for execution whereof there were appointed 12.

Now as this tyrant was a deuourer and deſtroyer of the liues of men, ſo did hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to vſurpe further, not only vpon ciuill ordinances, but vpon the things of God; ſo that thoſe that were married in the reformed Church, he forced to be married againe: and if they were rich, hee tooke them from their husbands, and gaue them to his ſouldiers to make prize of them.

All the money that he did exact out of this land in 6. yeares, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to more then 50. millions of gold.

            <p>Such ſauage cruelty is ſcarcely to be found in any Hiſtory, what Chriſtian heart can heare it, and not be affected with deepe ſorrow, yet behold ſome monſters herein haue been found, that haue beene ſo farre from humanity herein, (for hee that hath humanity in him will commiſerate others calamities) that they haue applauded it, as if he had in all theſe outrages done God good ſeruice.

For they were purpoſed to haue gone for the Taſſel, and to haue taken ſome towne about that part; but when they came neere that part, they had the wind contrary that they could not come there, ſo they went for the Malſe, and came with their ſhips before the Brill, and there they went preſently and tooke it; yet the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> had his forces in the towne, neere ſo many as they were, whom they preſently killed and chaſed out of the towne, and out of the Iland.

And within one moneth after Duke <hi>Alua</hi> ſent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine companies to Vliſhing to keepe that place ſtrong for himſelfe, and many of the Commanders were come into the towne: So the Magiſtrates commanded the citizens to come preſently vpon the Statehouſe, ſo they told them they muſt lodge the Spaniards in their houſes, and they knowing how they had vſed the Citizens in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they came, they told the magiſtrates they would not haue the Spaniards in their towne.

            <p>At <hi>Riſell</hi> there was a Spaniard would force a rich woman to haue the vſe of her body, and the woman cried out for helpe, and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band came, and two of his neighbours to helpe his wife, and they thruſt the Spaniard away, and hee ranne into the ſtreet and cried <hi>Spaynea, Spaynea,</hi> and there came many Spaniſh Souldiers about him, and they ruſhed into the houſe, and tooke the man and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and carried them before the Magiſtrates on the Towne-houſe where they were aſſembled, and there before them he complained of them to be rebels, and ſtirrers vp of vp-ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Diuers things being manifeſted of the Spaniards cruelty, I wil adde one inſtance of their trechery, and that of a famous perſon to his nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt familiars; yea, when he pretended ſweeteſt familiarity &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6. a Spaniard by birth, inuited diuers No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles &amp; Cardinals to a banket, with a purpoſe to poyſon them all. The meeteſt inſtrument he made choyſe of to effect this, was a Spaniard, one <hi>Caeſar Burgia,</hi> his ſworn ſeruant. The Pope ſhewed himſelf won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull pleaſant to auoyd ſuſpition, and drank a carouſe to them all; willing that his truſty ſeruant to fill from ſuch a bottel he knew well: which hee did very effectually to the Pope himſelfe as well as to the reſt. After the company was departed, the Pope perceiuing by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in himſelfe, what was done, and that he muſt die now alſo, ſaid to <hi>Burgio, This is a right Spaniſh trick.</hi> It is written of them that they are ſo expert in theſe exploits, that if <hi>Iudas</hi> himſelfe were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, he might goe to them to Schoole.</p>
