            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How farre These few MOTTETS (which I here humbly present you) will contribute to the Ambition of my Designe; the Modesty of an Old Man, alwayes distrusting his owne Compositions, may make him suspect: Which yet cannot but find a Pardon, if not a Patronage from a Soule so Harmonious as Yours. However the Offer is Pious, and the Adventure Noble, that I should Dare to put a Spirit (for the Note is That by which they Breath) into the Words of Excellent <hi>Sandys:</hi> Words so Pure and Proper, as that <hi>David</hi> Himself would have sung them with Joy: I might without Prophanation have spoke higher. And had the Church of <hi>England</hi> but the Happiness to receive into Her Assemblies Those Psalms Thus Translated; Her Enemies long before this would have turn'd their Scorn into Envy, and Witty Atheists their Scoffs into Admiration. I am sure the Prudent Worshipper of God, in stead of Scandal, had receiv'd Delight. I complain not of all; Some I confess are Tolerable. In the mean time I am among Those, who Mourn to see, These transcendently Holy Raptures even in Publick Worship exposed to so much Scandal and Scorn. I could not say less to Advance the Subject of my Mottets: Nor can I speak too much to Excuse the Meanness of the Composition: yet, having followed the Grounds of an Art by me studied more then 50 years, something in These may prove not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Your Eye: though the Author has at present little else to bring him forth from Obscurity, then the Honour He hopes to receive of being acknowledged,</p>

               </hi> Must confess the most of these Mottets were composed for a great Lover of Musick, and my especial friend, Sir <hi>Edward Spencer,</hi> an Honorable <hi>Mecenas</hi> to all Virtuoso's known to him; a person indued with exemplary gifts and virtues, who I presum'd would have liv'd to have seen them published, but God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him, unto whose glorious Name I doubt not but he sings <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiahs</hi> in the Heavenly Quire: whose goodness, though he be missing, lives in his virtuous Lady, continuing favours and noble respect to all he lov'd and esteemed; giving them to understand, their friend is not dead to them, as long as she is living, for which may she find her reward in heaven. This worthy friend of mine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, weighing my deep ingagements to several friends, but disabled (being plung'd by these tempestuous times in many dangerous stormes of adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and growing calamities) to retaliate their many civilities and courtesies, yet willing, notwithstanding, to return some grateful acknowledgment, resolv'd to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these Mottets to them, not offering them for their worthiness or merit, but as a testimony and reall demonstration of my sincere and cordiall respect, not having, according to the blessed Apostle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> either Gold or Silver, but such as I have, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My aim in the Composing these Divine Hymnes, was at Good Ayre, Variety, and to marry the Words and Notes wel together, according to the saying of that famous Musician, Mr. <hi>Robert Johnson</hi>; I desire those to whom any of these things shall come, to have them well voic'd, humor'd, and sung right, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the rule of that excellent Musician, my worthy friend, Mr. <hi>Thomas Ford,</hi> who familiarly said, and knew it by experience, that no Song could be so well sung and humor'd, as that which was known to the Performers by practise: If you shall vouchsafe to follow his rule, and satisfie my request, I shall adventure to say with the <hi>Italian, Spero Che questa cosa non vuol dispiacere</hi>: I hope these things will not displease you. The Inducement of my Composing of Parts onely, was in regard of the scarcity of Voyces, it being both difficult and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to get two Voyces, much more three or foure together, to Sing Sure and Masterlike: And the Ignorant judge frequently by the Performance, not by the Composition; which caus'dthat unparalell'd Master of Musick, my good Friend and <hi>Maestro,</hi> to vindicate a good Composition ill performed, affirming that had he been <hi>Rector Chori,</hi> he would have made that Song before judg'd had, to have pass'd for good. So advantagious and necessary is the Iudicious ordering and management of Musick.
