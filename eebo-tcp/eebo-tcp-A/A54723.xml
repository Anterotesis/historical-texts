            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Having such a convenient Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by the Bearer hereof, my loving and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Friend: I could not but let you understand something of the present condition we now stand in; which at this time is very miserable and pittifull, and as far
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64378:3"/>
as I conceive is like to be worse, if the Parliament of England send not over speedy Aid. For the number of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels encrease daily, and are intrenched within our view in a great multitude; besides the Papists in the City do much afflict Us; for they daily plot and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive which way to bring us and this City to confusion. Whose wicked and malicious designs, by Gods speciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and providence over us, have been continually defeated, and brought to nought.</p>
            <p>Upon Saturday, the Twelfth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, about 11. of the clock at night, came an Irish-man, one of the Rebels: but by craft fled away from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; who knocked at the Gate, desiring of the Watch that hee might speak with Sir Charles Coot, Governor of our City: Saying, he had somewhat to tell him, which did concern the welfare of the City and Kingdome: which Sir Charles hearing of, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64378:3"/>
that they should strictly search whether he had any company with him, or any at hand: if not, to bring him unto him, which was performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and the man brought unto his Bed-chamber, chained with Fetters of Iron: who related how with much difficulty he fled from the Rebels, his Conscience not suffering him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal such a Bloody Design which they had intended on the morrow against the City: and to that purpose had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered 30000. men, that when that they were all at Church, they might surprize the City. Whereupon Sir Charles arose from his bed, sending to Sir Simon Harcott this sudden News; who with all speed came unto him, and they went to the Lords Justices together, to relate the Newes.</p>
            <p>Wherupon Command was given for every man to stand to his Armes, and the whole City to bee raised for their Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64378:4"/>About two and three of the clock in the morning, they marched from the City, being in number about sixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, with four Troops of horse, and two Field-pieces. About six of the clock in the morning, they approached near the Rebels Camp, and found them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided for such a strong design: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their number much increased, and their Camp strongly fortified, which did not a whit discourage our Men; For they were extream willing to give the On-set, and to fall upon them: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were altogether so unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; which they did, and by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our Field-pieces, the Rebels began to forsake their quarters: which our men seeing, with all earnestnesse pursued them. Some stayed behind to take their Armes, and such Carriage as they had.</p>
            <p>The number of Arms was five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand: and about nine and ten of the clock, being Sunday in the morning,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64378:4"/>
our Men retreated, with a Report of the slaughter of Eight hundred Men, on the Rebels part, on ours Fourscore.</p>
            <p>Our Intelligencer we kept fast, but we rewarded him well for his pains: which will perhaps bee an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for others hereafter, to do us the like faithfull service.</p>
            <p>Wee are much obliged to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England; and also to the Pious and Religious City of London: Of whose Bounty and Liberality, wee have, and do still pertake of in a large measure: The Lord of Heaven reward them three-fold into their Bosomes.</p>
            <p>Our Gallowsies are well adorned with Priests, Jesuits, and Fryers, the Complotters and Broachers of all our present Calamities: At which Newes, the Rebels swell with indignation, and vowes Revenge.</p>
            <p>Wee have nine Barkes laded with Corn, and other Provision for Drohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagh;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64378:5"/>
which poor City holds out va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, and thirsts for Relief. Which I hope by this time, have obtained their desires, and are relieved: but I cannot certainly assure you thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus am I prevented by the urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Bearer, to bid you farewell; desiring to bee remembred to all my Friends: and especially your self.</p>
