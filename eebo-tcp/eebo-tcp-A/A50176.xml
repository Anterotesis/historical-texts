            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not without our wonder, that any Party in our Nation, should propound unto themselves any <hi>profit,</hi> by Endeavouring our further Misery.

It is in these Churches that we have long seen the <hi>Goings of God our King,</hi> for the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Edification of multitudes, who after an Arrival to a pitch of <hi>Holiness</hi> equal to what any part of this Lower World af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, have gone to the <hi>Spirits of Iust Men made perfect</hi>; and though a <hi>Decay of Piety</hi> has accompanied an <hi>Inercase of People</hi> in the midst of us, yet even among <hi>Vs</hi> of the <hi>Third</hi> Generation, the God of our Fathers, hath such a Number of Serious, Gracious, Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Christians,</hi> as encourages our Hopes, that He still has <hi>Reserves of Mercy</hi> for us.

Interest among the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> in whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts we cannot but Rejoice, as we have most inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and affectionately mourned in their <hi>Sorrows</hi>; but we also expect the Friendship of all those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons who are <hi>well affected unto the stones of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and take pity on the Dust thereof.</hi> As 'tis a thing too observable to be denyed, or concealed, That tho' we are a very unworthy people, yet the Haters of <hi>New-England</hi> stil find themselves <hi>pushing hard against the Great Stone,</hi> so I believe none of those Noble Persons who have been sincerely concerned for our Wellfare, will ever see cause to Repent of it; but <hi>Goodness and Mercy shall follow them all their Days.</hi> Blessed be the <hi>God of our Fathers,</hi> that albeit we are as an <hi>Outcast,</hi> yet it may not be said, <hi>No man has cared for us!</hi> There were Three Knights among our first <hi>Patentees</hi>; it calls for our Extreamest Gratitude if there have been more of <hi>That,</hi> or <hi>Another</hi> Quality willing to be our <hi>Patrons.</hi>

And here we have the <hi>Text</hi> which we are now to descant upon. [<hi>In that Day ye shall say</hi>] But <hi>What</hi> day is <hi>That</hi> day? we must be beholden unto the foregoing Chapter, for an Answer thereunto. We there find, that there will a <hi>Day</hi> come, when the <hi>Lord will set His Hand again the second time, to recover the remnant of his People</hi>: which will be when the Tribes of lost <hi>Israel</hi> are converted unto the Faith of the Lord Jesus; when according to the Language of the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> All <hi>Israel shall be saved.</hi> There will a Day come, <hi>when the Root of Iesse shall stand for an Ensign for the People</hi>: which will be at the <hi>second coming</hi> of our Lord; when according to the phrase taken by our Saviour from this very place, <hi>the sign of the Son of man shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi> There will a Day come, <hi>when the Lord shall with the Breath of His Lips, slay the wicked</hi>; which will be when <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall perish by the fiery approach of the Lord Jesus, to take vengeance on His wickedest

Enemy: when according to the phrase taken by the Apostle also from this very place, <hi>The Lord shall consume that wicked one with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy him with the brightnesr of his coming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tis <hi>that day</hi> which the <hi>Song</hi> now before us, is peculiarly calculated for.

                  <p>In the Words to be now Handled, we have two Things</p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Doings</hi> of God are here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Duties</hi> of men are then spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified hereupon. Since excellent <hi>Things</hi> are done by <hi>God,</hi> there are two things to be done by us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:44381:7"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> We are to <hi>sing</hi> the Praises of God. It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>here said, <hi>Sing unto the Lord.</hi> And such is the expression in the Holy style, as to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, not only an <hi>exactness,</hi> but also an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument</hi> used in the <hi>Song.</hi> We are with a <hi>Sacred Musick</hi> to magnifie the God, who is <hi>worthy to be Praised.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to <hi>spread</hi> the Praises of God. It is here said, <hi>This is known in all the Earth</hi>; but the version which is by some chosen for it rather is, <hi>Let this be known in all the Earth:</hi> We should not only our selves do it,, but likewise provoke and excite <hi>all the Earth</hi> to take notice of what <hi>Wonders</hi> have been done by Him who is <hi>fearful in Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>

                  <p>Wherefore the Truth to be now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with us, is,
<q>That it should be our study to <hi>SING</hi> and <hi>SPREAD</hi> the Praises due to the Eternal God, for the <hi>EXCELLENT</hi> Things which are done by Him in the World.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is by the Propounding of two or three Conclusions that this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> will have its due Advantages.</p>

                     <head>PROPOSITION I.</head>
                     <p>There are multitudes of <hi>Praises</hi> due to the God of Heaven from us. To <hi>praise</hi> God, is to <hi>Acknowledge</hi> the persections that are in Him; 'tis to <hi>Acknowledge</hi> the infinite Power, Wisdom, Goodness, Justice and Holiness, which are His Attributes; and this we are to do, <hi>In all our ways.</hi> We have received our Being for this End; and our Grand, our Chief Errand into the World, is, That our God may have a Number of <hi>Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders</hi> to be sensible of His <hi>Excellencies.</hi> When Mankind came first out of His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Hand, He then said, as in Isa. 43.21. <hi>This people have I formed for my self, they shall shew forth my praise.</hi> In our Lower Little World, no Creatures can be found capable of Conceiving and Expressing those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of God, which are, <hi>The Glory due unto his Name,</hi> besides MAN; who is therefore not unfitly called, <hi>The High-priest of the Creation.</hi> The devout Psalmist once called upon all Creatures, with a Repeated Invitation, <hi>Praise ye the Lord</hi>; but they all reply that <hi>Man</hi> is to do it for them, and they all therefore conspire to offer the Notices of the Almighty God unto <hi>Mans</hi> affectionate Contemplation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:44381:8"/>To <hi>praise</hi> God, is to Acknowledge in Him something <hi>Excellent,</hi> as 'tis said in Psal. 148.13. <hi>Let them praise the name of the Lord, for His Name alone is Excellent</hi>; thus, when we Acknowledge an <hi>Excellency</hi> in all those Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations which God maketh of Himself; then 'tis that we <hi>praise</hi> Him. Now the <hi>Praises</hi> owing to the God of Heaven from us, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged not only by what He <hi>Is,</hi> but also by what <hi>He Does</hi>: indeed by what <hi>He Does</hi> it is that we come to Learn what <hi>He is.</hi> We ought to Acknowledge an <hi>Excellency</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of God; which is to Ascribe <hi>Glory</hi> to Him. The Language of our <hi>praises</hi> is to be that in Psal. 89.6. <hi>Who can be compared, who can be Likened, unto the Lord?</hi> God should be truly <hi>Transcendent</hi> with us. We should appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that as the Name of our God is, I AM, so all other Beings are as meer <hi>Non-Entities</hi> in comparison of Him; subscribing to that in Isa. 40.17. <hi>All are before Him as Nothing.</hi> We should apprehend the <hi>Being</hi> of God, so Independent, so Unchangeable, so Mysterious, as no other Being is; and with Dazzled Souls fall into such <hi>praises</hi> as to say, <hi>I cannot find out the Almighty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> The <hi>perfections</hi> that are in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> God should even Astonish our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings; and fetch the Exclamations of <hi>Moses</hi> from us, in Exod. 15.11. <hi>Who is like
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44381:9"/>
unto thee, O Lord, who is like unto thee?</hi> One while our <hi>praises</hi> are like <hi>Hannahs,</hi> to say. <hi>There is none Holy as the Lord!</hi> Another while our <hi>praises</hi> are like <hi>Ethans</hi> to say, <hi>Who is a Strong God like unto thee</hi>? Sometimes our <hi>Praises,</hi> like <hi>Pauls,</hi> are to say, <hi>God is only Wise</hi>; and sometimes again, <hi>God is True, but every man a Lyar</hi>; and then with <hi>David,</hi> we are to <hi>praise</hi> and say, <hi>O how great is thy Goodness</hi>! But the <hi>Excellency</hi> which is in the <hi>Works</hi> of God, is that which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the <hi>Glory</hi> of His Essence, most apparent unto us; and the <hi>praises</hi> which we are to bring unto Him, are in a great measure to spring from thence. We are told in Isa. 28.29. <hi>The Lord of Hosts is Excellent in Working.</hi> Our <hi>praises</hi> of God, are in This to find the <hi>Reasons</hi> of them, <hi>He has done Excellent Things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, We ought with many <hi>praises</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Excellent Things</hi> which God has done for our selves. As the Psalmist call'd upon himself, in Psal. 103.1. <hi>Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his Benefits</hi>; thus ought we to Reflect upon the many <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Kindnesses</hi> of the most High towards our selves, with <hi>praises</hi> too many to be Numbred, too Hearty to be ended. We ought to see something of God, in all our Circumstances, and upon all that happens to us, we are to say, <hi>The Lord be magnify'd!</hi> But there are some <hi>Excellent Things</hi> done for us,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44381:9"/>
by our God; Things which no Friend, no Hand, <hi>none else</hi> could have done for our Good; and <hi>These</hi> Things we should with suitable <hi>praises</hi> be particularly grateful for. It is the manner of the <hi>Iems,</hi> to receive the Comforts of their Lives, with a <hi>Baruk Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> or <hi>Blessed be the Lord.</hi> We that are <hi>Christians</hi> may not suffer our selves to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by any people, in <hi>Thankfulness</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. It is related concerning our Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d Jesus Christ, in John 6.11. that he would not <hi>Eat a Meals Meat,</hi> without a <hi>Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> over it. Much more ought the more <hi>Excellent Things</hi> that are done for us, to be so Acknowledged. When God had heard a <hi>Prayer,</hi> there was that <hi>praise</hi> returned for it, in John 11.41. <hi>Father, I thank thee for it.</hi> We ought seriously to think, What <hi>Answers</hi> of our <hi>Prayers,</hi> what <hi>Reliefs</hi> of our <hi>Wants</hi> and <hi>Woes,</hi> the great God has in an <hi>excellent</hi> manner favoured us withal; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of all should be, <hi>Lord, I thank thee for these Excellent Things.</hi> A good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> himself may smart by failing here. Those persons are worse than Pharisees, in whose mouths <hi>God be Thanked,</hi> is not a frequent but yet solemn interject on.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We ought with many <hi>praises</hi> to observe the <hi>Excellent Things</hi> which God has done for <hi>Others</hi> as well as for our selves. Our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44381:10"/>
                        <hi>praises</hi> must not be confined unto those <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of God, which we our selves have been the Subjects of. But all His <hi>Dispensations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the world, are to be the Occasion of our <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to Him. A Soul that is <hi>Fill'd with all the Fullness of</hi> God, will be <hi>Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> with <hi>praises</hi> to Him for <hi>all</hi> his Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. We should be like him that said, in Psal 139.14. <hi>I will praise thee, for marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are thy Works.</hi> Whatever our God is <hi>Doing,</hi> we should upon the sight thereof be <hi>praising</hi>; and we should Acknowledge Him, in all those <hi>Excellent Things,</hi> which we see done in any part of the Universe. It was said in Psal. 40.5. <hi>Many, O Lord, my God, are the Wonderful Works which thou hast done.</hi> God has done many <hi>Wonderful Works,</hi> and many <hi>Excellent Things,</hi> in which we our selves have not an <hi>Immediate,</hi> or at least not a <hi>peculiar</hi> share; but we should all render <hi>praises</hi> unto Him on the account thereof. It is mentioned as the priviledge of a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, in Psal. 112.9. <hi>His Horn shall be exalted.</hi> What if one thing intended in it should be This? That as the <hi>praises</hi> of God were sounded by His People, in <hi>Cornets</hi> of old, so there were <hi>Exalted Horns,</hi> or <hi>Exalted Notes,</hi> which He would have their <hi>praises</hi> to be Raised with. Thus we read in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.5. of, <hi>Words to Lift up the Horn</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44381:10"/>
accommodate the Allusion; The <hi>Praises</hi> of God are to <hi>Sound High,</hi> in our Devotions. When we <hi>praise</hi> God for being <hi>Excellently Good</hi> unto our selves, we do well; but we are to <hi>Raise</hi> our <hi>praises</hi> unto an Higher pitch than so; they are to Expatiate upon all those things, wherein our <hi>God</hi> has exhibited Himself as <hi>Excellently Great,</hi> throughout the world Such <hi>Abstracted Praises</hi> are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Inclinations of every Godly man; he argues at that Rate, <hi>Great is the Lord,</hi> and therefore <hi>Greatly to be praised.</hi>

                     <p>We ought both to <hi>Sing,</hi> and to <hi>Spread,</hi> the <hi>praises</hi> which we owe unto the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Behold, a double Office incumbent on us, with respect unto those <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> which we are to pay unto our God; beside and beyond the first <hi>Motions</hi> of them, in our own Souls. Indeed the <hi>Spring</hi> of all the <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> which we make unto God, must be in our Hearts, and the gracious <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> and <hi>Resentmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>s</hi> which are first formed there. We must <hi>first</hi> look to this, that God be <hi>praised</hi> by the Thoughts in our <hi>minds,</hi> and, as the Psalmist speaks, by, <hi>All that is within us Blessing his Holy Name.</hi> They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will <hi>praise</hi> God sufficiently or acceptably, who cannot say, as in Luke 1.46. <hi>My Soul
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44381:11"/>
does Magnify the Lord.</hi> As all <hi>worship</hi> of God, so particularly, all <hi>praising</hi> of God, must be performed in <hi>Spirit</hi>; otherwise it will not be in <hi>Truth.</hi> But the <hi>praises</hi> of God, being shaped in the Honourable Thoughts of our Souls, what are we then to do?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> We are to <hi>Sing</hi> the <hi>praises</hi> due to God for the <hi>Excellent Things</hi> that He hath done. And if we keep close to the Text, we shall see two things here demanded of us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> There should be an <hi>Exactness</hi> used, in our <hi>praising</hi> of God. There should be in our <hi>Praises</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as on one side an <hi>Amputation</hi> of all that is improper, so on the other side no <hi>Omission</hi> of any Article that calls for our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. The charge given to us is That in Psal. 103.2. <hi>Forget not all His Benefits.</hi> We should not <hi>Forget</hi> so much as <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Things,</hi> which we can Remember to be done by God. The skipping of <hi>One stroke</hi> in a Lesson, often spoils the grace of the Musick. So does the missing of <hi>One Thing,</hi> in a Commemoration of what God has done. We should be careful with an often, yea with a daily <hi>Examination,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our selves, about the Things for which God is to be <hi>praised.</hi> It is hardly convenient for a man to sleep at Night, until he have pondered, <hi>What New Excellent Thing has been done by God this Day, that</hi> I <hi>should particularly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44381:11"/>
praise Him for</hi>? And we should be careful that our <hi>Sorrows</hi> do not swallow up our <hi>prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> 'Tis often so, that as that worthy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of old could not eat of the <hi>Peace Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> which was a <hi>Thank-Offering,</hi> because <hi>She Wept</hi>; thus we can't <hi>praise</hi> God, because He <hi>Smites</hi> us. We cannot see <hi>Excellent Things</hi> done by God, because we feel <hi>Terrible Thins</hi> done to our selves. But this is our <hi>Folly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where we have <hi>One</hi> Trouble, we have a <hi>Thousand</hi> mercies of our own to be <hi>praising</hi> for. And if we were a million times more afflicted than we are, yet the Lord might challenge our <hi>Praises.</hi> It was a great Speech of the Renowned <hi>Gerson, Quiequid deme or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaverit Deus,</hi> said He, <hi>However God may dispose of me for ever, whether to Eternal Weal or Wo; yet This</hi> I <hi>know, that He is worthy of my praises, and He shall have them all. Indeed Praises</hi> are a Debt owing to Him, even from those woful Spirits that are <hi>broken in the place of Dragons, and covered with the shadow of Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There should also be an <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> used in our <hi>Praising</hi> of God. But of what kind? Far be it from us to plead for that which is properly <hi>instrumental Music</hi> in the Church of the Lord Jesus. Indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of our Lord, there was in the Church a Divine appointment for such a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and between the <hi>Neginoth</hi> and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44381:12"/>
                        <hi>Nehiloth,</hi> I find, if I miscount not, sixteen or more kinds of <hi>Instruments</hi> for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it. But upon the Abolition of the <hi>Mosaic Pedagogy,</hi> we have no order for the continuance of this <hi>Temple Worship,</hi> by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it into our <hi>Synagogues.</hi> The Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church had it not, as even a <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells you; the Ancients often &amp; loudly declaim against it, and <hi>Aquinas</hi> himself about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, notwithstanding all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Bigottry, yet bestows none of the kindest Remarks upon it. The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> themselves own, that <hi>Aliquid Fig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rabat,</hi> it was a <hi>Typical thing</hi>; and we having in the Tydings of the Gospel that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> which this was a figure of, ought not to <hi>Iudaize</hi> by upholding the shadow in the presence of the <hi>Substance</hi>; nor ought we to bring into the House of God, a Troop of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers which the Lord Jesus never instituted. What Instruments are we then to <hi>praise God</hi> withal? we are all furnished with <hi>two</hi> at least.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Our <hi>Lips</hi> are to be employed in the <hi>praises</hi> of God. The Psalmist called his Tongue <hi>my glory.</hi> Our <hi>Tongues</hi> are then our <hi>glory,</hi> when we <hi>glorifie</hi> God therewith all. 'Tis a proper service for them; Hence the Apostle sayes, <hi>Therewith we bless God.</hi> It is <hi>Desired</hi> for the Saints in <hi>Psal.</hi> 149 6. <hi>let
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44381:12"/>
the High Praises of God be in their mouthes.</hi> And it is Resolved by one of them, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.21. <hi>My mouth shall speak the praises of the Lord.</hi> Hence the Apostle urges it, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15 <hi>let us offer the Sacrifice of praises to God continually, that is the fruit of our lips.</hi> There were Offerings of many sorts, which God was <hi>praised</hi> withal of old; but <hi>our Lips</hi> are to be instead of the <hi>Calves</hi> and <hi>Lambs,</hi> and other <hi>Euchrristical</hi> Offerings that then were customary.</p>
                     <p>With our Lips we are to rehearse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the <hi>Excellent Things</hi> that have been done by God, especially when we are with bended <hi>Knees</hi> and listed <hi>Eyes,</hi> presenting our selves before him. With <hi>mentioning</hi> what God has done, we are to do as he said, in <hi>Psal</hi> 145.2. <hi>Every Day will I bless thee my God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there is one Exercise of our <hi>Lips</hi> which God is more peculiarly to be <hi>praised</hi> with; and that is <hi>the Singing of Psalms.</hi> In those <hi>Commands</hi> of God which require the <hi>praises</hi> of God, even in our Dayes, we have such clauses as those, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 95 1. <hi>O come, let us sing to the Lord, let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our Salvation.</hi> The New Testament sufficiently inculcates this way of <hi>praising</hi> the most High; and if you will be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Primitive Christians
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44381:13"/>
hardly ever had a <hi>Feast</hi> without it. There are savoury <hi>Hymns,</hi> of an Humane Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which no doubt we may <hi>praise</hi> God by singing of. But <hi>Scriptural</hi> and <hi>inspired</hi> Hymns are those which we should principally thus put Regards upon. <hi>The Psalms of David</hi> are those which God is to be <hi>Praised</hi> by a Reverent, and Attentive <hi>Singing</hi> of. <hi>These</hi> were those, no doubt which our Saviour Himself Sang, at the <hi>Passover,</hi> more than a score of Times. And the very <hi>Angels</hi> whose Melodies the <hi>Shepherds</hi> overheard of old, seem to sing out of the <hi>Eighty fifth Psalm.</hi> Hence when the Apostle says, in Eph. 5.19. <hi>Speak to your selves in Psalms and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs</hi>; he alludes to the well-known Division of the <hi>Psalter. q. d.</hi> Go sing all the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Till we can <hi>mend</hi> them, never let us leave them. He that shall <hi>sing</hi> those Blessed Psalms, and ordinarily spend at least one <hi>Observation,</hi> and one <hi>Ejaculation,</hi> upon every verse, as he goes along, will therein <hi>praise</hi> the great God, at no common rate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our <hi>Lives</hi> are likewise to be Employ'd in the <hi>Praises</hi> of God. We have <hi>Hands</hi> as well as <hi>Tongues</hi> for it; and some thing there is that <hi>our Hand finds to do.</hi> The best <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is <hi>Thanks-living.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:44381:13"/>We should sometimes put that Question to our selves, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.12. <hi>What shall I render to the Lord for all His benefits?</hi> As a return to God for the <hi>Excellent things</hi> that are done by Him, we are to order our <hi>lives</hi> in such a manner as may be pleasing to him. Hence in <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.23. He that <hi>offers praise,</hi> and he that <hi>orders his conversation aright,</hi> are equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                     <p>There is a <hi>general Return</hi> of Obedience, which we are to <hi>praise</hi> God by yielding of. It is said in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>uit's of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are unto the glory and praise of God.</hi> Where God had carried <hi>Israel</hi> over <hi>Iordan,</hi> there were <hi>Ston<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> erected for His praise; but what was inscribed on them? was it any History of what and been done by God? No, it was a <hi>Copy of the Law.</hi> Our keeping the Law is our <hi>praising</hi> of him that gave it. We <hi>praise</hi> God when we seen and blush to do any thing that he may be displeased at.</p>
                     <p>There is also a <hi>special Return</hi> of well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we should now and then <hi>praise</hi> God withal. As when <hi>David</hi> had seen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mighty things done by God, he became inquisitive, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2 <hi>What shall I now do for the House of God?</hi> so some signal act of <hi>Piety,</hi> or of <hi>Charity</hi> should be done by us, that God may not be without his <hi>praise.</hi> We <hi>praise</hi> God when we are labouring
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44381:14"/>
to do <hi>some singular thing,</hi> for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Truths and Wayes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi> VVe are to <hi>Spread</hi> the <hi>praises</hi> due to God for the <hi>excellent things</hi> that He has done. Yea, our outmost is to be done that they may be <hi>known in all the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A good man desires that he may not be <hi>Alone</hi> in the <hi>praising of God,</hi> he would have all men to joyn with him in it. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said by such a man, <hi>Come, I will declare what God has done f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r my Soul.</hi> We are to <hi>praise</hi> God as <hi>publickly</hi> and as <hi>openly</hi> as we can; and to say like him in <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.25. <hi>My praise shall be of thee, in the great Congregation.</hi> And we are to do what we fairly can, that the excellent <hi>things</hi> done by God, may not be <hi>concealed things,</hi> but that all men may be acquainted with them: so are we advised in <hi>Psal.</hi> 105.1, 2. <hi>Give thanks to the Lord, make known His Deeds among the people: sing unto Him, talk ye of all His wondrous Works.</hi> We should render them as <hi>Notorious</hi> as they are <hi>Notable</hi>; and <hi>publish them</hi> among all our Neighbours, as the happy <hi>partakers</hi> did the healing <hi>Miracles</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hence it was the wish of the Psalmist, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.7. <hi>That I may publish with the voice of Thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>It is an <hi>excellent thing</hi> indeed, that we may have <hi>a Day of Thanksgiving,</hi> while the World is in so much Confusion and Combustion, and every where <hi>Mens hearts are failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are doing upon the Earth.</hi> Let us be at some pains, that this Day be not lost, or that it may not evaporate in a few sensual satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                     <p>But as for <hi>Dayes of Thanksgiving</hi> observed in the Assemblies of good men, all men have seen the wonderful successes of them. <hi>New Englands</hi> Prosperity has more visibly followed upon its <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> than upon its <hi>Humiliations,</hi> as in times both of <hi>War</hi> and of <hi>Sickness,</hi> has been more than once percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. We have seen the fulfilment of that Word in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.22. <hi>When they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Enemies. Praises,</hi> thousands of high praises be to our God, that we may have a Day to celebrate His <hi>praises.</hi> But that our praises may be awakened, and that no man may make a <hi>Iar</hi> in our <hi>Harmony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Consider how <hi>Reasonable</hi> these <hi>praises</hi> are for us all.</p>
                     <p>O consider with our selves, <hi>Who is God?</hi> it is He that <hi>Humbles Himself to behold the things that are in Heaven.</hi> Consider, <hi>Who is Man</hi>? a poor <hi>Worm,</hi> yea, a cursed <hi>Viper.</hi> Now that this GOD should look upon this <hi>man!</hi> Lord, <hi>What is man that thou shouldest be mindful of him</hi>? Yet the Eternal God has been doing of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things,</hi> which <hi>we</hi> not only behold, but also <hi>enjoy.</hi> There is not one of us all, who has not <hi>excellent things</hi> to be this Day <hi>praising</hi> the Almighty for.

                        <hi>Day of Thanksgiving</hi> with us, in that it is no worse. The most miserable person in all this Congregation, may with an eye to his own condition, say like him in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.156. <hi>Many are thy mercies O Lord.</hi> If I could find out the most unhappy, and the most complaining person among you all, even to that person would <hi>I</hi> say, <hi>God has done Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things for thee, and some that never sinned so much, yet suffer more than you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Consider Likewise, how <hi>profitable</hi> these <hi>Praises</hi> will be to us all. Behold an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the obtaining of all the <hi>Blessings</hi> that can be wish'd for. It was said in Psal. 67.5, 6. <hi>Let the people praise thee; then our God shall bless us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Earth send <hi>Vapours</hi> up to Heaven, Heaven will make <hi>Showers</hi> to descend on the Earth. Let our <hi>praises</hi> be continually ascending from us, and they will soon issue in those things that are called, <hi>The Showers of Blessing.</hi> When we have a Jealousie of a Leaky Vessel, we try it by first putting of <hi>Water,</hi> before we trust <hi>Better Liquors</hi> in it; if we that have little more than <hi>Water</hi> to comfort us, will yet not permit it to Leak without <hi>Praises</hi> from us, then God has more <hi>Excellent Things</hi> to do for us.

Things,</hi> where of we may say, <hi>The finger of God is here</hi>! Indeed nothing in the World could more exactly imitate and resemble the late circumstances of our Mother <hi>England</hi> than the <hi>Revolutions</hi> here, in all the steps thereof; and this, though we understood not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This was from the <hi>Excellent</hi> operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that God who turns a <hi>Wheel</hi> in a <hi>wheel</hi>! And what shall we now say? The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God have been upon us heretofore; but <hi>this poor Land has cry'd unto the Lord, and the Lord has heard and sav'd.</hi> And the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>New-England</hi> have still perished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rebukes of that God who is <hi>our King, our Lord, our Lawgiver</hi>: It has been as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to seek the Hurt of this poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as ever it was to annoy the <hi>Piccardines</hi> of old; and they that have stretched out their <hi>long Arms</hi> to make us miserable, have brought upon their <hi>own Heads</hi> the <hi>vengeance of the Temple.</hi> But we were grown a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sensual, Factious People; and then our God fulfill'd unto us that Word of His, <hi>I will punish you yet seven times for your Iniquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Charters</hi> were taken from us, and <hi>our Land, Strangers devoured in our presence.</hi> You have seen cause to <hi>Declare,</hi> That there were deny'd unto us the <hi>Common Rights,</hi> which all <hi>English-men</hi> justly, reckon themselves born unto; and that all that was dear unto us,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44381:26"/>
was entirely given up to the <hi>Arbitrary disposals</hi> of four or five Men, that beyond all measure hated us, and made no stick to tell us, <hi>We were but Slaves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You have seen cause to Declare, that we were now given to understand, <hi>Our Lands were none of our own</hi>; and that a Storm of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Violence was every day falling upon the more Honest, and sober part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, while <hi>the wicked walked on every side, and the vilest Men were exalted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Churches</hi> also began to feel the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those, who had <hi>Sworn by the Living God, to ruine them</hi>; and all Debauchery was coming in among us like a mighty Flood. All this while we were in a <hi>Sea of fire,</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably scorched and scalded; and yet it was <hi>mingled with Ice</hi>; there were great cakes of Ice over our Heads; there was no getting out. That one person, who now hazarded his All to obtain us Relief, by carrying our <hi>Addresses</hi> for us, was made sensible of this.</p>
                     <p>Remember, O <hi>New-England,</hi> how often that cry then went up from thee to the Lord, <hi>Return we beseech thee, O God of Hosts! look down from Heaven and visit this Vine</hi>; And now, behold, He is <hi>Returned.</hi> Our Adversaries are <hi>what</hi> and <hi>where</hi> they are; and we see so far <hi>Our Iudges as at the first,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44381:27"/>
and our Councellors at the Beginning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And there are several <hi>Excellent Things</hi> that have been done for for us by our God, while He has been effecting of our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
                     <p>We have cause to <hi>Praise</hi> the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, That in the Tumult of our Action, there was not the loss of a Drop of <hi>Blood,</hi> nor such <hi>Plunder</hi> and <hi>Outrage</hi> as would have been a Disgrace to our Profession.</p>
                     <p>We have cause to <hi>Praise</hi> Him, that our Soveraign has Declared, <hi>He took very well what we had done for Him, and for our selves in the Revolution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have cause to <hi>Praise</hi> Him, that we have been so comfortably carried through the Difficulties of a whole <hi>Summer,</hi> while we could not say <hi>That any Law was of any Force with us.</hi> Every Week erected a new <hi>Ebenezer</hi> for us!</p>
                     <p>We have cause to <hi>praise</hi> Him, for putting it into the Heart of a Person, well known unto you all, to take a <hi>Voyage</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> just before the late Overturnings there: on purpose to be in the way of those Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, which his <hi>Faith</hi> was that he should have, to serve the Churches of the Lord Jesus here; by which means, (as our Friends there assure us) it is that we have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from being <hi>totally udome.</hi>

                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44381:27"/>We have cause to <hi>praise</hi> Him, for giving a check to those <hi>Indian Blood-Hounds,</hi> which have been worrying of us in the <hi>East</hi>; who having destroy'd several <hi>Plantations,</hi> met with no <hi>full stop,</hi> till they assaulted the first Place where a <hi>Gospel Ministry</hi> was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; but there they found such a Bar in their Carrier, that we now hear no more of them.</p>
                     <p>And may I not say it? We have cause to <hi>Praise</hi> the Glorious God, for some <hi>Excellent Things,</hi> which as yet we know not of. We gave <hi>Imperfect,</hi> but (with many) <hi>probable</hi> Accounts, of a Deliverance from a <hi>French</hi> Force, that the possession of this Territory, would have been a valuable Thing unto.</p>
                     <p>But this is indubitable. <hi>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our side, may</hi> New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>now say, they had swallowed us up quick: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their Teeth.</hi>

                  <head>A Postscript. Endeavouring the Satisfaction of them that are Inquisitive after the late Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Extasies and Prophesies in France.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Words</hi> of God are <hi>True,</hi> in the Notice which they have given us, <hi>That the Works of God are Great</hi>; and certainly no Age did ever afford In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of <hi>Greater</hi> than those which are <hi>Now</hi> the matters of Discourse and Wonder throughout the World.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Marvellous Things</hi> which at this Day strike the minds of Men with a just A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment, there are not many more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, than those of <hi>the late Extasies in France.</hi> Concerning which we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Information;</p>
                  <p>That about the beginning of the Year 1688: a young Shepardess in the Province of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> fell into unaccountable <hi>Trances,</hi> wherein tho' the standers by, pull'd her, struck her, cut her and burnt her, yet it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to awaken her. In this condition, her custome was to utter many Divine things;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44381:34"/>
and though she could neither write nor read, nor could speak any <hi>Language</hi> but that of her Countrey, which has nothing of pure <hi>French</hi> in it, yet she now <hi>Pray'd</hi> and <hi>Preach'd</hi> at a most prodigious rate, and Sang <hi>Psalms</hi> after the manner of the <hi>French</hi> Protestant Congregations: and when Auditors that could thereby be edified, were present, she expressed herself, not only in <hi>French</hi> of a Dialect most Exact and Correct, but also having occasion to speak <hi>Latin,</hi> in the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Romish Superstitions,</hi> she did it with a distinctness that fill'd all the Hearers with Admiration- And though when she came out of her sleep, she remembred not what had befallen her; yet she had her wits thereby made more Sparkling and Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Those new <hi>French</hi> Apostles, the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> quickly did their utmost, for the suppression of this <hi>Rare Thing</hi>; but behold the event! It was not long before other persons fell into the like <hi>Trances,</hi> with <hi>Symptoms</hi> not unlike to those which had attended her; and the Number encreased unto several Hundreds of these <hi>Prophets,</hi> if I may call them so? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of even the Kings own Guards afforded <hi>One.</hi> And at length some that were <hi>Awake</hi> were carried forth unto Rapturous Exercises with an <hi>Eloquence</hi> and <hi>Energy</hi> equal to that of those that were <hi>Asleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:44381:34"/>They are People of all Ages and Sexes; but the greatest part of them are <hi>Boyes</hi> and <hi>Girles,</hi> from six or seven to five and twenty years of age; and persons very old; all of them the meaner sort of People: but of Fami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lies Exemplary for their good living; the whole affair being indeed so prodigious, that the most obstinate <hi>Saddu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Ministry of these <hi>Extraordinary People,</hi> does chiefly consist of two things.</p>
                  <p>One part of it is, the <hi>Admonition</hi> of those unhappy persons that have provoked God by many notorious Miscarriages, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by <hi>Apostasie</hi> under the late Persecution. They deride the Follies of the <hi>Mass,</hi> with a surprizing ingenuity; and in a vast Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of perhaps two thousand People come together to hear these <hi>Preachers,</hi> if there be any that have abjured the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> they will call them before them, and address them in such powerful Terms, as usually make not not only the whole Congregation shed floods of Tears, but the <hi>Apostates</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to become <hi>Penitents</hi>: and there comes not one away, who does not positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <hi>That he had rather be torn to pieces with wild Horses than ever go to Mass again.</hi> No
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44381:35"/>
man is able to resist their Words! And they make the <hi>Penitents</hi> now and then confess o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular sins, which they convince them of, though the Transgressors had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined these Faults impossible to be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A whole Council assembled could not manage any matter with more Authority than <hi>They</hi> do the Conviction of those, who have gone to <hi>Mass,</hi> that they may shun the Severities of the <hi>French Dragoons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may not be unprofitable to recite a few of the Sentences, which fell from the mouths of these <hi>Extaticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Have a care</hi> (said one of them) <hi>that you come not hither out of Curiosity. Better it were for the Wicked that hot Coals of Fire should pass through their mouths, than that they should mock at the Word of God; they had better swallow a Serpent with all its Poison.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the Wicked</hi> (said one of them) <hi>had the same power over God, that they have over you, they would do the same to Him that they do to you: but God will pronounce the Sentence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction on them, and will say,</hi> Go into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> (said another of them) <hi>Pray hard; and then though we should meet an Army of Enemies at the Door, God will place a million of Angels for your Guard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> (said another of them) <hi>We
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44381:35"/>
have alwayes apprehended more the Threats of Men than those of God, else what happened to us, would not have happened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of them said, <hi>Your Riches have ruined you, and your Prayers must Relieve you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of them said, <hi>I am afraid the first Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution will make you return to Mass again; but O suffer your selves rather to be first cut in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es.</hi> Alas! <hi>Iesus Christ has poured out all his Blood for us, and we can't endure the prick of a pin for Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Apostates,</hi> they generally so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their Warnings; <hi>You have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Father, you have sinned against the Son, take heed of sinning against the Holy Ghost, for God will then pardon you no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when the Children are told, <hi>They shall be Hang'd,</hi> they are not at all afraid, but answer, <hi>That is but a little harm for a greater, good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the other part of their Ministry is, The <hi>Prediction</hi> of Things quickly to come to pass. They do indeed foretell many Things of a more private concern; they foretell a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Things that must happen to themselves and their Friends: and the issue confirms the Prophesie. One of them being thrown into a Dungeon, said, <hi>The man who sent her thither should within eight Dayes fetch her out,</hi> and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> strangely was accomplished.</p>

The Gentlemen, who give us the History, tell us, that they judge it not yet convenient to publish a large part of the Authentick and sufficient Collections which they have made of these Prophecies.

In general, The Subjects of this <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> all agree in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling, <hi>A Speedy Deliverance to the Church of God:</hi> and they declare, <hi>The Late Revolutions in England, to be the Beginning of that Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>

                  <p>They foretold a fresh Assault of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>France,</hi> and it had a very dreadful fulfilment; for after it Ensued a Terrible Storm of Outrage upon the Relicks of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The whole is a Thing very unaccountable: and when I consider the Fate of the famous <hi>German Prophets,</hi> which made such a Noise in the World: or, when I consider, that while the <hi>Iews</hi> were under their Infatuations about their false Messiah, <hi>Sabatai Saevi,</hi> some Hundreds of people fell into <hi>Extasies</hi> (as 'tis Reported) wherein they Prophesied, the speedy Deliverance of the Jews by that Impostor, and <hi>Little Children</hi> that could not stammer a word, yet repeated and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Name</hi> of this Deceiver, with Happy Omens of Him; but consider on the other side, That <hi>not to Regard the Works of the Lord,</hi> is a <hi>Destroying evil</hi>; I dare not make any Reflections on it.

                     <hi>THe Occasion which first produced the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermon, cannot be expressed in better Terms, than those which were used by the Worthy Gentlemen that were the</hi> Conservators of our peace, <hi>in their humble Address to Their Majesties, bearing Date, May</hi> 20<hi>th</hi> 1689. <hi>Wherein among other things they say,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>— Your three several Princely Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Encouraging the English Nation, to cast off the Yoke of a Tyrannical and Arbitrary Power, which at that time they were held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, have occurred unto the View and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the people in this Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves under alike (if not worse) evil and unhappy Circumstances with their Brethren in <hi>England</hi>; First by being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteously deprived of their Charter-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; Priviledges, without any Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Tryal, and under utter impossibilities of having Notice of any Writt served upon them; and then followed with the Exercise of an illegal and Arbitrary power over them, which had almost ruined a late flourishing Countrey, and was become very grievous &amp; intolerable; besides the growing miseries,
<pb facs="tcp:44381:39"/>
and daily fears of a total Subversion, by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at home, and invasion by forreign sorce; the people thereby excited, to imitate so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and heroic an Exemple, being strongly and unanimously spirited, to intend their own safeguard and Defence, resolved to sieze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and secure some of the principal persons concerned, and most active in the ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the illegal and arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, set over them by Commission. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly upon the eighteenth day of <hi>April</hi> last past, arose as one man, siezed upon Sr. <hi>E. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anos</hi> the late Governour, and other of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil instruments, and have secured them for what Justice, Order from your Majesties shall direct. — <hi>Thus that Address.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vpon the late Revolutions thus described, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued various debates about the further</hi> Steps <hi>that were needful to be taken for the service of Their Majesties and this afflicted Countrey; Which</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates <hi>quickly issued in the Return of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into the Hands of our Ancient Magistrates; who with the</hi> Representatives <hi>or</hi> Deputies <hi>of the several Towns in the Colony, made another Address unto Their Majesties, bearing date, Iune</hi> 6. 1689. <hi>in which Address there were these Words,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>— Finding an Absolute Necessity of Civil Government, the People generally manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Desires and Importunity once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb facs="tcp:44381:39"/>
That the Governour, Deputy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Assistants, chosen and sworn in May 1686. according to Charter &amp; Court as then formed, would assume the Government; —</p>
                  <p>— the said Governour, Deputy-Governour, and Assistents, then Resident in the Colony, did Consent to accept the present Care and Government of this people, according to the Rules of the Charter, for the preservation of the Peace and common safety, and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth further Acts of Authority, upon Emergencies: until by Direction from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there should be an orderly Settlement; which we hope will Restore us to the full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise thereof, as formerly; notwithstanding we have, for some time, been most unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, and injuriously deprived of it.</p>
                  <p>That Royal Charter being the sole Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Encouragement unto our Fathers and predecessors, to come over into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and to plant the same at their own Cost and Charge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In Answer to this Address, His Majesty in a most gracious Letter, bearing Date the</hi> 12<hi>th of August</hi> 1689. <hi>unto the Government here, uses these Expressions,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas you give Us to understand, that you have taken upon you the present care of the Government, until you should receive Our Order therein, We do hereby Authorize and
<pb facs="tcp:44381:40"/>
Empower you to Continue in Our Name, your Care in the Administration thereof, and Preservation of the Peace, until We shall have taken such Resolutions, and given such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the more orderly Settlement of the said Government, as shall most conduce to Our Service, and the Security and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Our Subjects within that Our Colony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was in the time of our greatest</hi> Heats <hi>and</hi> Straits, <hi>and at a time appointed for a</hi> General Assembly <hi>of this great Colony, that the ensueing Sermon was expected from me. Through the Grace of God, the Sermon</hi> Then <hi>was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unacceptable to some who desired the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it. But I gave not my full Consent unto their Desire, until now, they had an</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity <hi>(with their Renewed Importunity) to join it with another Discourse which they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from me; and tho' the little</hi> Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>which were among us, when the Sermon was preached, are now s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>I confess it is a very</hi> Bold <hi>thing, for one every way so</hi> mean <hi>as my self, to Address the whole Countrey in such a manner as here I do; but,</hi> Si crimen erit, crimen <hi>Amoris</hi> erit; <hi>and if the general Dispositions of the year will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse

a Breach of</hi> Order <hi>in me, I have but one thing more to offer by way of Satisfaction for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There was once a people in the world, with whom it was a Custome, That when men would Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate the Favour of the</hi> Ruler, <hi>they were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent his own</hi> Son <hi>before him, as a</hi> Sight <hi>which would speak more than any Advocate. Instead thereof, that I may not want the Favour of my</hi> Countrey, <hi>how blameable soever they may count my freedome with them, I shall only present them with my own</hi> Father; <hi>whose cheerful Encounter with an hazardous Voyage unto a strange Land, and with innumerable Difficulties and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there, for no other Cause, than that he might</hi> Speak FOR <hi>them, has at least merited a Pardon for</hi> Mee, <hi>with whom he has for near two years now left both his</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Family, <hi>if I have transgressed by taking a Liberty of</hi> Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing TO <hi>them at the same time, the things which may promote our Enjoyment of the</hi> Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence <hi>with us.

                  <p>IT is a <hi>Remarkable Occasion</hi> which has brought these Words to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our present Meditations; but it was much more a <hi>Remarkable Occasion</hi> which these Words were first uttered upon.

The Jews call God by the Name of <hi>Makom,</hi> or of <hi>Place,</hi> because all things are in Him; this is His Name in the Book of <hi>Esther,</hi> if I mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it not. Whether we may count it <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>physical</hi> to speak of an <hi>Imaginary, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite space,</hi> beyond the utmost Selvige of the world, replenished with our God alone; yet we are sure that <hi>the Heaven of Heavens</hi> gives no limits unto His Being; and the Ancients were not mistaken when they said, <hi>Deus Ipse Sibi, et Mundus et Locus et Omnia.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so well say, That God is in the <hi>World</hi> as we may say, The whole World is in <hi>God</hi>; &amp; we may say with the Psalmist, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Whither shall I flee from thy presence?</hi>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> God is <hi>Gloriously</hi> present with the Inhabitants of the Third Heaven. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens hath in it most intimate and marvellous manifestations of God. It is the <hi>Place,</hi> of which we may say, as tis said of that <hi>State,</hi> in Rev. 21.23. <hi>The glory of God doth lighten it.</hi> There the blessed ones have God <hi>with</hi> them, so that they <hi>Alwayes behold His face</hi>; and they are <hi>satisfied with His like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for ever. When we come to Heaven, then as in 1. Thes. 4.17. <hi>We shall ever be with the Lord.</hi> So the Lord will be <hi>with us</hi> for ever. Heaven is the <hi>Throne</hi> of the Most High; He is there as a Prince in his Throne; the Great KING is in a manner very ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble residing there. To be there, is called in 2. Cor. 5.4. A being <hi>present with the Lord.</hi> Hence unto the <hi>Heaven,</hi> and not unto a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> are we directed to make our <hi>Corporal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> in our <hi>Prayers,</hi> or our <hi>Oathes</hi> before the Lord.</p>
                     <p>But Thirdly, God is <hi>Graciously</hi> present with His people, by being <hi>Favourable</hi> unto them. And this <hi>Gracious presence</hi> of God is that which a people ought to be concerned for. It lies in The <hi>Engagement of Divine Providence for the Welfare of such a people.</hi> God is <hi>with</hi> us when God is <hi>for</hi> us.</p>
                     <p>To particularize,</p>
                     <p>First, God is <hi>with</hi> a people by <hi>Directing</hi>

of them. When <hi>Israel</hi> was to pass thro' the Wilderness, they had that encouragement in Exod. 22.15. <hi>The presence of God going</hi> with them. What was that? Why, They had a cloudy fiery <hi>Pillar</hi> miraculously Leading o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> wonderful Pillar which was a <hi>Cloud</hi> by day and a <hi>Fire</hi> by night; the <hi>Lower</hi> part of which rested on the Tabernacle, while the <hi>Vppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> part was to be seen by the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Motions of this being managed by the Ministry of Angels, now <hi>God</hi> was <hi>with them,</hi> and <hi>He led them forth by the right way.</hi> A people are often brought into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Difficulties and Emergencies: but if God be <hi>with</hi> them, He guides them to a good Issue of them all. The <hi>Presence</hi> of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in His Directing and Inclining of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to such Actions, as may be for <hi>His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>their Safety,</hi> and such <hi>Methods,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pon a <hi>

which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had deprived 'em of, they took a <hi>Right Way</hi> to dissappoint all that were desirous to interrupt them in it. We find in Neh. 4.13. That while those Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises continued, they <hi>waited</hi> in a posture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable thereunto; and when the danger was over, <hi>then they returned every one to his work.</hi> How came this to pass? 'Twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause GOD was <hi>with</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God is <hi>with</hi> a People, by <hi>Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them. 'Twas the promise of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His people, in Isa. 43.2. <hi>When thou passest thro' the Waters, I will be with thee, and thro' the Rivers, they shall not overflow thee.</hi> On which Text, blessed <hi>Bilney</hi> after his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation so sweetly paraphrased, that his Friends caused the whole Sentence to be fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written on their Tables. A people may be ready to be swallow'd up, by a stormy, gaping Ocean of Troubles, but if God be <hi>with</hi> them, they shall escape clear of all. The <hi>Presence</hi> of God is a Defence, a Refuge to the people that are partakers of it. It was said unto <hi>David</hi> in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.9. <hi>I was</hi> with <hi>thee, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight.</hi> When God is <hi>with</hi> a people, He distracts and confounds their enemies, and He troubles <hi>those</hi> who trouble <hi>them.</hi> A people who have God <hi>with</hi> them, are too strong for all the <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of their enemies; no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44381:45"/>
no Desolation, shall make such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple miserable; they are the <hi>Iacob,</hi> unto whom in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.15. <hi>Behold, I am</hi> with <hi>thee, and I will keep thee, saith the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God is <hi>with</hi> a people by His <hi>Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Succeeding</hi> of them. When <hi>Ioshua</hi> had a vast Undertaking in hand, it was said unto him in <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Be of good Courage, for the Lord thy God is</hi> with <hi>thee, whither soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou goest.</hi> q. d. <hi>God</hi> will <hi>Assist</hi> thee, and <hi>succeed</hi> thee, in thy undertakings. The <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of God will carry a people comfortably through all that they take in hand. If they have <hi>Canaanites</hi> to subdue; if they have <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments</hi> to obtain or preserve, the <hi>Presence</hi> of God will prosper them in doing all. It was said unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> in 1. Chron. 22.11. <hi>My son, the Lord be</hi> with <hi>thee, and prosper thou, and build the house of the Lord thy God.</hi> Thus, if the Lord be <hi>with</hi> a people, they shall <hi>prosper</hi> in all their Affairs; in every <hi>Expedition,</hi> they shall come off with Satisfaction; and they shall not miscarry in any of their <hi>Applications.</hi> This is the <hi>Presence</hi> of the Lord.</p>

observed by the great <hi>Owen,</hi> in a Discourse unto the Parliament, <hi>These two</hi> are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully distinguished. We must not reflect on the Stability of the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> for what Variety and Soveraignty we may see in <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Dispensations,</hi> toward this and that people in the world. This matter seems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by <hi>David,</hi> in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Tho' my house be not so with God, yet He has made with me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure. David</hi> had promises for the prosperity of his <hi>House</hi>; He had also the <hi>sure mercies</hi> of the Covenant made over to him in the promises of God.

                     <p>To bring these things into the case before us.</p>

you see tis otherwise. God is <hi>with</hi> a people for a while; and upon <hi>their</hi> misbehaviours and provocations, He changes the Tenour of His Dispensations to them.

                     <p>A People must be with <hi>God,</hi> or God will not be with <hi>them.</hi> And here also, to prevent Mistakes, Let that one Text be alwaies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in our Minds; <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Being merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, thou for sookest them not</hi>; there is <hi>Mercy</hi> in the Whole of this matter. Let it be noted, That tho' this Condition seems to be <hi>imposed</hi> upon us; yet it is <hi>Grace,</hi> pure <hi>Grace,</hi> rich <hi>Grace</hi> that helps us, when we are helped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the performance of it. When a people have so been <hi>with</hi> God, as that He has been <hi>with</hi> them, they are to shout, <hi>Grace, Grace!</hi> concerning all. It is also to be noted, that this <hi>Benefit</hi> dos not depend upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as an <hi>Effect</hi> upon the real and proper <hi>Cause</hi> of it. When a people has been <hi>with</hi> God, this does not <hi>merit,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> procure that God should be with <hi>them</hi>; but <hi>that</hi> is barely the <hi>Antecedent</hi> unto which, <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>

                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44381:47"/>Having praemsed this I must now affirm, <hi>God is</hi> with <hi>you, while you are</hi> with <hi>Him.</hi> We need only reflect on the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> for an Instance of it. That whole History, which almost fills the Bible, proclames nothing more than this; it loudly declares. That while a people are <hi>with</hi> God, God will be <hi>with</hi> them; but that He will be very Terrible in His <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Dispensations</hi> towards such a people as do <hi>for sake</hi> Him.</p>
                     <p>But, What is it for a people to be <hi>With God</hi>? In short,</p>
                     <p>Our being <hi>With God,</hi> implies the Whole of our <hi>Obedience</hi> to Him. Our <hi>Duty</hi> to God must be attended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may have the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of God. The Whloe of this Duty is comprised in that Expression of our being <hi>with the Lord.</hi> Particularly the Hebrew Particle [<hi>Gnim</hi>] in our Text, admits of three Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; it signifies, <hi>With,</hi> and <hi>For,</hi> &amp; <hi>Like,</hi> [which last Signification I make the more free withal, because a little <hi>Philology</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with many Exemples of it: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, When <hi>David</hi> saith in Psal. 120, 5. <hi>I dwell in</hi> (<hi>Gnim</hi> Hebr.) <hi>the tents of Kedar</hi>; a very great Interpreter translates it so, <hi>I dwell</hi> As <hi>the tents of Kedar.</hi> i. e. <hi>Like</hi> the inhabitants of the Stony Sun-burnt <hi>Arabia</hi>; whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I don't Remember <hi>David</hi> ever was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong.] Accordingly, a people have Three
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44381:47"/>
Things incumbent on them, if they would en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>joy the <hi>Presence</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>First, A People should be <hi>with</hi> God, by <hi>Communion [With] Him.</hi> This tis to be <hi>With</hi> Him; There are Certain meanes of <hi>Communion</hi> between God and us; and <hi>these</hi> we must be continually approaching to Him in. We are <hi>With</hi> God, while we are at <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> before Him; hence in our Context here, it immediately follows, <hi>If you</hi> seek <hi>the Lord, He will be found of you.</hi> While we do <hi>seek</hi> Him, we are <hi>with</hi> Him. The Psalmist was a man much in prayer, and therefore he could say as in Psal. 73.23. <hi>I am continually</hi> with <hi>thee.</hi> A people much in <hi>Prayer</hi> may say the same, <hi>We are continually</hi> with <hi>the Lord.</hi> A people that will <hi>pray</hi> upon all occasions, a people that will <hi>pray</hi> over all Businesses, a peo- that will retire into the Mount for <hi>Prayer</hi> (and <hi>Fasting</hi> too) at every turn; that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is <hi>with</hi> the Lord. And the whole <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of God must be, diligently, graciously, faithfully frequented by a people that would be <hi>with</hi> Him. We are <hi>with</hi> God, when we are at <hi>His House.</hi> A people should support &amp; esteem, and use all the <hi>Ordinances of God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. The <hi>Church</hi> of God hath His very special Presence in it; the Name of the Church is that in Ezek. 48.35. <hi>Iehovah Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> the Lord <hi>is there.</hi> We should all be <hi>there</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:44381:48"/>
too, and <hi>there</hi> give those Encouragements which are due to the Institutions of God; So shall we be <hi>with</hi> the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A people should be <hi>with God</hi> by <hi>Activity</hi> [For] <hi>Him.</hi> To be <hi>For</hi> God is to be <hi>with</hi> God. It was once the Summons giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in Exod. 32.26. <hi>Who is on the</hi> Lords side? <hi>And all the Sons of</hi> Levi <hi>gathered themselves</hi>; they were <hi>with</hi> God in doing so. Tis a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons given to the world in every Generation, <hi>Who is on the Lords side?</hi> They that obey the Summons are <hi>with</hi> the Lord. A people full of Contrivances for the Interest of God, are <hi>with</hi> Him. A people should set themselves to advance the <hi>Glory</hi> of God; they should own His <hi>Truths,</hi> and His <hi>Wayes</hi>; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw all about them into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the same. A people should propound the <hi>Glory</hi> of God as their cheef <hi>End</hi> and the main <hi>Scope</hi> of all that they do; and they should think much of no <hi>Cost,</hi> no <hi>Pains,</hi> nor (tho, as a Martyr once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed himself, <hi>tho' every</hi> hair <hi>on their heads were a life</hi>) should a Thousand <hi>Lives</hi> be dear unto them, in the promoting of it. Then are they <hi>with</hi> the Lord; they are <hi>so,</hi> when God can say of them, as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.10. <hi>Ye are my</hi> Witnesses, <hi>saith the Lord, and my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A people should be <hi>With God,</hi> by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44381:48"/>
                        <hi>Behaviour</hi> [Like] <hi>Him.</hi> To be <hi>Like</hi> God is to be <hi>with</hi> God. They that are <hi>with</hi> Him, do not <hi>walk contrary</hi> to Him. God and we should be <hi>One.</hi> A people should have the same <hi>Designs,</hi> the same <hi>Desires,</hi> which the Written Edicts of Heaven declare to be in the blessed God; and not only so, but the same <hi>Vertues</hi> too. Is God <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Let us Consider, First,</p>
                     <p>How <hi>Desirable,</hi> How <hi>Necessary</hi> a Thing it is, that we should have <hi>God with us.</hi> Truly, This is the <hi>Vnum Necessarium</hi> of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>!</p>
                     <p>Nothing is more <hi>Desireable,</hi> for us, than the <hi>Presence</hi> of our God. The Jews have a Fable of their <hi>Manna,</hi> That whatever any man had a mind to tast, he presently found in the Manna a Savour &amp; a Relish of it. It is very true of this Blessed <hi>Presence</hi>; all manner of <hi>Blessings</hi> are enwrapped in it. There is a multitude of Blessings which we are desireous of; but they are all contained in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive thing: It will give every honest man, all that he wants. <hi>This</hi> will extricate us out of all our <hi>Labyrinths</hi>; This will set all things to rights among us; This will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44381:49"/>
wonderfully carry on all the <hi>Salvations</hi> which have been begun for us, by the <hi>God of our Salvations.</hi> If Christ, if God be aboard, our little Vessel will not sink in the gaping, roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, formidable <hi>Waves</hi> now tossing of it. Well did the Apostle say, in Rom. 8.31. <hi>If God be</hi> for <hi>us, who can be</hi> against <hi>us?</hi> Thus, If God be <hi>with</hi> us, we have <hi>All</hi> for us. <hi>One GOD</hi> will weigh down more than <hi>ten Worlds.</hi> If we have the <hi>Presence</hi> of that God, Who <hi>made</hi> and <hi>moves</hi> the Universe by a <hi>Word</hi>; if we have the <hi>Presence</hi> of that God, Who can <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Create</hi> our Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, <hi>O most Happy We!</hi> We may then join in such Triumphant Acclamations as that in Psal. 118.6. <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>is on my side, I will not fear; what can man do unto me?</hi> We may then defie, even the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> it self, for, <hi>Cur metuat hominem homo in sinu</hi> Dei <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situs?</hi> and tho' abroad at this day, <hi>The earth is removing, and the Waters roar, and are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the mountains are shaking,</hi> splitting, tumbling, <hi>with the swelling thereof</hi>; Tho' the great and the terrible God be at this Day, <hi>coming out of His place,</hi> to make all <hi>Europe</hi> a stage of blood and fire, and make the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons everywhere drink deep of the <hi>Cup</hi> that shall make them giddy with all manner of Confusion &amp; Astonishment; Yet <hi>WE</hi> shall be <hi>helped right early,</hi> for <hi>God is in the midst of us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44381:50"/>Add to this; Nothing is more <hi>Necessary</hi> for us, than the <hi>Presence</hi> of God. We are undone, thrice, and four times <hi>Vndone,</hi> if we have it not. Methinks I hear the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD with a voice more awful than that of the loudest Thunder, saying over us, as in <hi>Hos.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Wo to them when I depart from them.</hi> And <hi>Wo</hi> to us indeed; we are in a most <hi>woful</hi> estate, if it come to <hi>that</hi>! How can we endure the mention of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our most importunate Deprecations, <hi>O our God, leave us not!</hi> We can have a prospect of nothing but horrible Disorders, Agonies and Vexations, if we lose the <hi>Presence</hi> of our Lord: We ly open to no less than a fearful Dissipation, and more than all our <hi>late Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors</hi> would rejoice to see brought upon us. We have lately been complaining of <hi>Burdens,</hi> that were grievous to us; but I may warn you of our danger to feel one Burden more, which will infinitely exceed them all; tis that in Jer. 23.33. <hi>What Burden? I will even</hi> forsake <hi>you, saith the Lord.</hi> Behold a <hi>Burden</hi> that will sink us into a bottomless <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biss</hi> of Calamities! The <hi>Presence</hi> of GOD, <hi>This</hi> is no less than the very <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>; We are <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>gone,</hi> if <hi>that</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. When <hi>Israel</hi> was nimbly enough possessing themselves of the promised Land, which God had given them such a CHARTER

for, they perished in the Attempt; for in Deut, 1.42. <hi>The Lord said, go not up, for I am not</hi> among <hi>you.</hi> Alas, if we don't in the first place look to this, That <hi>God be</hi> among <hi>us,</hi> we cannot avoid all manner of Dissap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, Desolations.</p>
                     <p>Let us Consider, Secondly:</p>
                     <p>What uncomfortable <hi>Symptomes</hi> we have had of <hi>God's not being with us.</hi> It seems as if God had fulfilled that sad Word on this poor Land, in Deut. 31.17. <hi>I will</hi> forsake <hi>them, and many evils shall befal them, so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because God is not</hi> among <hi>us</hi>? There is a vast number of Calamities, which have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us lamentable cause to fear, <hi>That God has forsaken us.</hi> Why have we suffered such a Blast, both on our <hi>Trade,</hi> and on our <hi>Corn,</hi> that the Husband-man complaines, <hi>I looked for much, and lo, it came to little!</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner complains, <hi>I went out full, &amp; came home empty!</hi> Tis <hi>Because our God is not among us.</hi> Why have we had <hi>Fire</hi> after <hi>Fire,</hi> laying our Treasures in Ashes? <hi>What means the hear of this Anger,</hi> that <hi>Boston,</hi> the most noble, and vital Bowel of the Territory, hath with a twice repeted <hi>Conflagration</hi> suffered such a Loss of <hi>that</hi> which in the <hi>Body politic</hi> answers to <hi>Blood</hi> in the <hi>Body natural?</hi> Tis <hi>Because

our God is not among us.</hi> Why have we had <hi>War</hi> after <hi>War,</hi> made upon us by a <hi>Foolish Nation?</hi> Why have the <hi>worst of the Heathen</hi> had renewed advantages to disturb our Peace? And why have so many of our <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Neighbours</hi> been made a prey to the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage <hi>Murderers</hi> in the world? It is <hi>Because our</hi> God <hi>is not among us.</hi> Give me leave to say, as in Judg. 6.12. <hi>If the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us?</hi> But we may find <hi>Humiliation</hi> enough to convince us of this deplorable thing, from what we have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the <hi>Loss of our Government.</hi> She of old said unto our Lord Jesus, in <hi>I-h.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not dyed.</hi> So, If the Lord had been <hi>here,</hi> tis possible we had not <hi>Died.</hi> If the Lord had been <hi>with</hi> us, would he have made our <hi>Wall</hi> so feeble, that (as they said of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) the <hi>going up of a poor</hi> FOX <hi>upon it, should break it down</hi>? If the Lord had been <hi>with</hi> us, had all the wild Creatures that passed by this <hi>Vineyard,</hi> found such Opportunities to be plucking at it? No, Our God would have kept us, as <hi>A vineyard of red Wine</hi>; and lest any should have hurt us, <hi>He, (the Lord) would have kept it, night and day.</hi> If the Lord had been <hi>with</hi> us, had you ever thought you had seen cause to <hi>Declare,</hi> as you have lately &amp; justly done, That <hi>a Company of abject strangers had made a meer</hi> Booty <hi>of us</hi>? Had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44381:51"/>
Had we ever felt the <hi>sore grievances of an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal &amp; arbitrary Government?</hi> No; The God of Heaven was not <hi>with</hi> that <hi>oppress'd people,</hi> to whom He said in <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Your Countrey is desolate; your land,</hi> Strangers <hi>devour it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What shall I say? It was an Appeal made in <hi>Ioel,</hi> 1.2. <hi>Hear this, ye</hi> old <hi>men,; hath this been in your dayes</hi>? Even so, I may say to the <hi>old</hi> men within the hearing of it; <hi>My Fathers,</hi> You Remember how we were, when God was <hi>with</hi> us; pray, was it so in <hi>your dayes,</hi> as it has been in <hi>ours?</hi> Were <hi>you</hi> visited with Plague after Plague, in a long <hi>Series</hi> of heavy Judgements, as <hi>We</hi> your poor Children are? Surely, They will tell us; <hi>God is not with us, as He was with them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all these matters, our Case may at least have some Correspondence with <hi>that</hi> in <hi>Luc.</hi> 23.28. <hi>He made as though He would have gone; but they constrained Him, saying, Abide with us!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us Consider Thirdly;</p>
                     <p>If we are not <hi>With God,</hi> we shall be guilty of an <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> under very shameful, very direful <hi>Aggravations</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>We shall be <hi>Apostates,</hi> and O let us not be so, lest our God say, <hi>My soul can have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them.</hi> But if we are <hi>so,</hi> we shall be of all Apostates the most <hi>inexcusable</hi> Let us Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what <hi>Fathers</hi> we have had; they were <hi>with God.</hi> I may say of'em as in <hi>hos.</hi> 9.8. They were <hi>with my God</hi>: &amp; they <hi>are gone to</hi> be so <hi>forever,</hi>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44381:52"/>
What an unaccountable thing will it be for us, to have that Character, which we have been so much cautioned against, <hi>There arose another generation which knew not the Lord</hi>? What? Shall the Grandchildren of <hi>Moses</hi> turn Idolaters? and shall the Children of <hi>Samuel</hi> become the Children of <hi>Belial?</hi> Shall we forget the <hi>Hope of our Fathers,</hi> or forsake our <hi>Fathers Friend</hi>? The very Graves of those blessed men, every <hi>Post,</hi> every <hi>Stone</hi> upon their Graves, is a Witness against us, if we <hi>do.</hi> With dismal Accents, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, their very Ghosts, will groan unto us, <hi>Alas, Is our posterity come to this!</hi> Nay, <hi>Abraham</hi> would be <hi>Ignorant</hi> of us, and <hi>Israel</hi> would not <hi>acknowledge</hi> us, if we should be so degenerate as to lose the <hi>Presence</hi> of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Let us also consider, what <hi>Warnings</hi> we have had. It may be said unto us, as in Jer. 25.4. <hi>The Lord hath sent unto you all His Servants the prophets.</hi> This Countrey has been blessed with a most faithful Ministry, by which, I suppose, every Assembly in this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, has been called upon, to <hi>Be with God, and to keep with Him.</hi> Especially the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which our ELECTIONS have put the Embassadours of God upon <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Printing</hi> of; these have been so many loud <hi>Warnings</hi> unto us, <hi>That we leave Him not.</hi>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44381:52"/>
In them we have been faithfully warned, That <hi>our true interest is Not to Lye unto God.</hi> We have been Warned, That <hi>the latter end of our Misbehaviours will be Destruction from the Lord.</hi> We have been Warned, That <hi>We must Repent and do our first Works, or have the Candlestick of the Lord Iesus removed from us.</hi> In a word, We have been warned from Heaven, That <hi>If we forsake our God, He will cast us off for ever.</hi> O miserable <hi>We,</hi> if we do it after all.</p>
                     <p>These Considerations, will not have their due Force, unless they expire in a Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Request,</hi> which I must now lay before you; and I may justly assert concerning the Things contained therein, They are not <hi>Vain Things,</hi> they are <hi>Our Life.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Hear ye me,</hi> Asa, <hi>and all</hi> Judah, <hi>&amp;</hi> Benjamin; Hear ye these things, all ye people of the <hi>Massachusetts</hi>!</p>
                     <p>First, Let us <hi>Return</hi> to the Lord. We must <hi>Come</hi> to Him, if we would <hi>Be</hi> with Him. We have marvellously backslide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> from our God, but He calls after us, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ye backsliding Children, and I will heal your Backslidings.</hi> O that we may all as one man Reply what is in Jer. 3.22. <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> If we ask that Question, in Mal. 2.7. <hi>Wherein
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44381:53"/>
shall we return?</hi> Methinks, t'were an harder Quaestion, <hi>Wherin should we not</hi>? But, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, We have had a <hi>great voice out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in answer thereunto. We have had the Elders and Messengers of our Churches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vend in a <hi>SYNOD,</hi> solemnly informing of us, <hi>Wherein we shall Return.</hi> God forbid the Advice of that <hi>Synod,</hi> should only serve to <hi>Convict</hi> us and <hi>Condemn</hi> us, in the Day when He shall take vengeance on us for our <hi>Contemning</hi> of it. <hi>That</hi> were dreadful indeed! But in <hi>Compliance</hi> with it, Let every man seriously now enquire of himself, <hi>What have I done</hi>? Mark what I say, That man who does not suspect himself, of having a share in the <hi>Sins</hi> which have driven away from us the <hi>Presence</hi> of our God; <hi>That man,</hi> I may safely affirm it, is one of the principal <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers</hi> of this <hi>Israel</hi>; I do without any Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple say it, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> Let us all then Examine our selves, and set upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> of our own Hearts and Lives, and the <hi>Renewing</hi> of our Covenants with the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, both the <hi>Objects</hi> in which, and the <hi>Authors</hi> from whom we have endured our Calamities, <hi>those</hi> are enough to indigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate what <hi>Sins</hi> they are that have exposed us thereunto. Let me in two or three instances use a plain dealing with you, agreeable to my
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44381:53"/>
station here this day.</p>
                     <p>What have been the <hi>Objects</hi> in which we have been afflicted? Our <hi>Fruits</hi> have been blasted; &amp; were <hi>they</hi> not abused in the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Sensuality? Our <hi>Lands</hi> have been threat'ned; and were not <hi>They</hi> the Idols, for the sake of which we have offended GOD, and almost Renounced all that was <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Good?</hi> The most happy and easy <hi>Government</hi> in the world, was changed with us, into what has by the most impartial men been confessed to have become <hi>Intolerable</hi>; Why, Did not men despise the <hi>Best</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and procure <hi>other things</hi> to be set over them, because they endeavoured to make <hi>Loggs</hi> of what they before enjoyed? To pass on, Were we not in the late unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Extortions of the <hi>Law,</hi> invited to consider, Whether our needless Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Litigious Contentious <hi>Law-Suits</hi> formerly amongst us, were not a <hi>Scandal</hi> thus chastised? Were we not in the late unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Injuries, Abuses, and Exactions of them, that under the pretence of the <hi>Excise</hi> carried on very outragious Villanies, put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Considering, Whether the <hi>Multitude</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> of <hi>Drinking-Houses,</hi> in the midst of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44381:54"/>Again, What have been the <hi>Authors</hi> from whom we have been afflicted? Our Molest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations have risen very much from <hi>Indian</hi> Hands. And Alas, have we not very much <hi>Injured</hi> the <hi>Indians?</hi> I do not mean, by taking from them <hi>Their Land</hi>; For it was Hardly possible they should be more fairly dealt withal than they have been in that particular; but by <hi>Teaching</hi> of them, <hi>Our Vice. We</hi> that should have learn'd them to <hi>Pray,</hi> have learn'd them to <hi>Sin.</hi> Endeavors for their Conversion have by many people been blown upon; but there have been wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>English,</hi> who have taught them to <hi>drink,</hi> yea, and to <hi>curse,</hi> and <hi>swear</hi>; things which they knew not the meaning of, till they came to <hi>School</hi> unto such <hi>White Pagans</hi> as some that wear the Christian-<hi>Livery</hi> among our selves. And have not we also <hi>Followed</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi>? The Indians are Infamous, especially for Three Scandalous Qualities: They are <hi>Lazy Drones,</hi> and love <hi>Idleness</hi> Exceedingly! <hi>They</hi> are also most impudent <hi>Lyars,</hi> and will invent Reports and Stories at a strange and monstrous rate; and they are out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>Indulgent</hi> unto their Children, there is no <hi>Family-Government</hi> among them. But, O how much do our people <hi>Indianize</hi> in every one of those <hi>Abominable things</hi>! We must repent of these our miscarriages, or else our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44381:54"/>
God will take up that Resolution concerning us, <hi>I will even forsake them, saith the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let not <hi>Sin</hi> be <hi>With</hi> us, and <hi>God</hi> will be so. Tis the purpose of our God, in Josh. 7.12. <hi>I will not be with you except ye destroy the Accursed Thing, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> Let us then <hi>Destroy</hi> that <hi>Accurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Especially, Let us take heed of the <hi>Sins,</hi> which at this Time, we have a peculiar Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to. It was complain'd in <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.1. <hi>When I would have healed Israel, the iniquity of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim was discovered.</hi> It has bin <hi>thus,</hi> but God will not be <hi>With</hi> us, if it still be <hi>thus</hi> among our selves. Our good God, the <hi>Lord our Healer,</hi> is now <hi>Healing of</hi> us: O let us not now be impatient patients, lest that our blessed <hi>Physitian</hi> deal hardly and roughly with us. <hi>Impatiens aegrotus</hi> crudelem <hi>facit Medicum.</hi> Let us now no more discover <hi>Revengefulness</hi> against them that have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ill</hi> of us. Let the <hi>Law,</hi> and not the <hi>Sword</hi> measure out their due unto them. No more discover an <hi>Unthankfulness</hi> unto them that have deserved <hi>Well</hi> of us. Requite them not with <hi>Censure</hi> and <hi>Haired</hi> for their unwearied pains to preserve our <hi>Peace.</hi> No more discover a Contempt of the <hi>Ministers,</hi> who set themselves faithfully to <hi>Declare the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44381:55"/>
whole Counsil of God,</hi> and to <hi>Lift up their voice like a Trumpet in shewing us our sins.</hi> They are all agreed (I hope) as one man to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> studying of your Well-fare; but if they are unjustly ill-treated with you, the great God, whose Messengers they are, will take notice of it, and say, <hi>Ye have despised Me!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And O let us no more Discover such a Spirit of <hi>Lying</hi> as we have made our selves worthy to be reproved for. We find menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> that said in 1. King. 22.22. <hi>I will go forth, and I will be a</hi> lying <hi>spirit in the mouth of all the prophets.</hi> Doubt-the-same Devil has been suing for a License to <hi>go forth and be a</hi> Lying Spirit <hi>in the mouth of near all the people here</hi>: I would to God, this Devil were in a <hi>Shorter Chain!</hi> I beseech you Let not this Land have that Character, <hi>A Countrey full of Lies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But of all our Errors, There is none of such dangerous and threatning Consequence as the <hi>Contention</hi> which we are too prone to break forth into. We are too much a <hi>Contentious,</hi> and that will soon render us a <hi>Wretched</hi> and a <hi>Ruin'd</hi> people. A Divided and Quarrelsome People, do even say to the Almighty, <hi>Depart from us</hi>; for He is the <hi>God of Peace.</hi> But O, What is our meaning then, to make <hi>a full submission &amp; entire resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

of our selues</hi> to the Tyranny of our own <hi>Passions,</hi> as we have too much done, while we have been debating about the Measures of another <hi>Submission</hi> and <hi>Resignation</hi> in our various <hi>Revolutions!</hi> I have read of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with whom it was a Law, That in a <hi>Fray,</hi> where Swords were drawn, If a <hi>Child</hi> did but cry PEACE, they must End the Quarrel, or else he dyed that strook the first blow after PEACE was named.

For my own part, I confess my self but a <hi>Child,</hi> and among the meanest, the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest of your <hi>Children</hi> too; but yet I am old enough to cry <hi>Peace!</hi> and in the Name of God I do it. <hi>Peace!</hi> my dear Countrey-men; Let there be <hi>Peace</hi> in all our <hi>Studies, Peace</hi> in all our <hi>Actions,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all our Differences.
