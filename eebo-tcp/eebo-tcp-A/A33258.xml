         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is now ſeven years ſince I publiſh'd a Treatiſe of this
Nature; it came forth then accompanied with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning Hoſpitality, and the Conſumption of
our Cattel; But the Age at preſent being not that way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd,
I have wholly omitted that part; and ſhall only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in this, that which concerns our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool, and the
Manufacture of it. For I find that a great many are very
buſie about this Commodity, and the Trade of it; But yet
I do not find any Propoſals offered, whereby the Price of
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool may be advanc'd; I ſhall therefore lay
down this Aſſertion; That the greateſt cauſe of the Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Rents, and low Value upon Lands at this day,
(which I ſuppoſe every man that hath any is ſenſible of,)
hath been the great fall, and low price of Wool for theſe
few years paſt. Then on the contrary, the only way to raiſe
our Rents, and to bring our Lands to their former worth
and value again, muſt be by advancing the price of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool. Now which way this is to be done, will
be the Subject of this following Treatiſe; which is deſired
may be accepted, as it is freely offered (to wit) as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
intention of a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, for the benefit of his
Native Country.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion of publiſhing this at this time, was meerly
accidental; for being at <hi>White-hall</hi> ſome few Months ſince,
I heard of great Complaints made, with a Petition to the
King and Council, ſetting forth the Tranſportation of our
Wool, to the great Prejudice of our Clothing Trade, and
the ruining of our Poor for want of Work; with many
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97740:3"/>
diſmal Apprehenſions of the evil Conſequences thereof: but
not one word offer'd which way either to advance the
Trade of this our Woollen Manufacture, or to raiſe the Price
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool; But the whole Deſign I perceived
was for the Clothiers Advantage to buy Wool cheap, and
for the Merchant and Drapers to have Cloth at a low price;
both very deſtructive, not only to the Kingdom in General,
but alſo to the Trade it ſelf; as ſhall hereof be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>The Complaint I confeſs was of great Concernment, that
our Wool, and other Materials for the making of Cloth, as
<hi>Fuller</hi>'s Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought not to be exported; the many
Acts of Parliament in all Ages ſince King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,
for preſerving this Trade and Manufacture to our ſelves,
and prohibiting under ſevere Penalties, the Tranſportation
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool, is ſufficient to convince us of what
abſolute Neceſſity the Manufacturing of our Wool was
look'd upon to be, as to the Wealth and Trade of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Nation; And what Advantage our Anceſtors in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages (even to the times of the late Rebellion) made
by this Trade of Cloth. The Account of the <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and
<hi>Turkey</hi> Company, but eſpecially the <hi>Hamborough</hi> Company,
which took off ſo many thouſand Cloths yearly, may ſerve
us only to bewail the preſent Decay of ſo great a Trade.
So that our Buſineſs now is not only to prohibit the Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Wool, but more chiefly to advance the Trade
and Sale of our Cloth; whereby the price of our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Wool may be raiſed again to what it was formerly worth.
For to what purpoſe is it to keep all our own Wool at
Home, and to admit all other Wool to come in <hi>Gratis;</hi> if
we have not vent enough for that of our own growth.
I confeſs it may ſometimes enrich the Clothier by buying
cheap, but I am ſure it will impoveriſh the Gentlemen and
Farmers, by ſelling at ſo low a price; therefore, if by the
following Diſcourſe our ancient Trade for this Commodity
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97740:3"/>
may be reſtored, and our Wool brought to a more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
price then it now bears, whereby the Rents and
Revenues of the Kingdom may be increas'd, and our Lands
brought to their former Worth and Value again; I hope
this ſmall Treatiſe may be accepted.</p>
            <p>Sir, You may pleaſe to remember upon the Diſcourſe
we had on this Subject, that it was your deſire I ſhould
give you the Heads and Subſtance thereof, againſt the next
meeting of the Parliament; that as you found a convenient
Opportunity and compliance with you herein, by ſome of
your Fellow-Members, with whom you did intend firſt to
adviſe, you would accordingly proceed in it for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good: but the Buſineſs of the Popiſh Plot then brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out, all things of this nature were then put off, and
this alſo was laid aſide. But meeting with this Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I thought it a very fit time to retrieve it; eſpecially
conſidering that neither our Wool, or our Clothing Trade
have ſince advanc'd, but on the contrary grown worſe and
worſe; even to ſo low an Ebb, that it is impoſſible to ſink
lower. And that it being at this time more particularly in
his Majeſties Royal hands, to diſpoſe and regulate the ſale
of Cloth at that great and chiefeſt Market in the Kingdom
for the ſame at <hi>Blackwel-hall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> by appointing
ſuch Officers, and ſuch Regulation of the ſale of Cloth there,
together with ſuch Rules and Orders to be obſerved, both
by the Clothier, Merchant, and Draper, according to the
ſeveral Laws and Statutes heretofore made, for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this great Trade, as in his Princely Wiſdom ſhall
be thought moſt fit and convenient. And although many
offers have been made of late years for <hi>England's</hi> Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which ſhews that we are ſufficiently ſenſible of our
decaying Condition, if we could but tell how to help our
ſelves; yet it is a very great Queſtion whether ſeveral of
thoſe Deſigns might in the end prove for the real Good and
Benefit of this Kingdom, as to endeavour the planting of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97740:4"/>
ſeveral Foreign Commodities, whereby to engroſs the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
of other Nations to our ſelves; for the ſaving, as
we alledge, many thouſands of pounds at home, which they
coſt us abroad; and the cutting of ſo many Rivers to
make them Navigable, through the very heart of moſt parts
of the Kingdom, to <hi>London;</hi> whereby all our Trade and
Carriage might paſs up and down without Waggons and
Horſes, at far cheaper rates than now they do by them;
with ſeveral other the like Projects, that carry with them
fair Pretences of Thrift and good Husbandry; while on the
other hand it might eaſily be made appear, that many of
thoſe Deſigns would prove ſo diſadvantagious to us, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the ſpecious ſhew of Profit. That our Lands
which are already fallen a fourth part of their ancient Worth
and Value, would not then, in moſt parts of the Kingdom,
yield the one half, eſpecially the Paſture and Meadow
Grounds. For it is not the having all things of our own
growth on the one hand, and the ſaving of our Money on the
other can make us Rich; neither can our Increaſe and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in ſome ſence be ſaid to be our Wealth, if we have not
a ſuitable Vend and Conſumption thereof. Beſides, Nature
hath otherwiſe provided, and ſo furniſh'd each particular
part of the World with ſomething which the reſt want,
whereby to preſerve a Friendſhip and Commerce together.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have hinted at this, that the following Diſcourſe
might meet with the leſs Prejudice, when the Deſign of it
ſhall appear, that it is not for the prohibiting any Foreign
Commodity, or for the engroſſing all within our own growth;
but that which we call our own growth and Manufacture,
may be ſpent, if not by others abroad, yet among our ſelves
at home: And this I think is ſo reaſonable, that no Nation
in the World, but will allow us that Liberty.</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to that which is intended in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Diſcourſe; and in the firſt place, to ſhew how much
our Eſtates and Rents are fallen from their former Value
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97740:4"/>
within theſe few years, and what may probably be the
Cauſes thereof, with ſome ways and means that may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
neceſſary to reſtore them to that value and eſteem
again.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, that our Rents are abated, and that the Value
of our Lands are fallen, moſt mens particular experience
will juſtifie me in the truth hereof; For from twenty years
purchaſe, the uſual rate not many years ſince, they are now
ſunk to eighteen at the higheſt; and in ſome places ſixteen
or ſeventeen years purchaſe is the ſelling rate, and theſe
very ſame Eſtates at a low under value; ſo that if we ſum
up what an hundred pounds a year, the Rent well paid,
was worth thirty or forty years ſince, in the beginning of
the late Rebellious Wars, we ſhall find, that the real value
of our Eſtates are a third part leſs than they were then;
and but two parts of three, of what Money they would have
yielded then, can now be raiſed where any man hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſell. For Example, Let an hundred pound a year
be the ſtandard, the juſt value then that this hundred pound
a year would have yielded at twenty years purchaſe, is two
thouſand pound. Now there is twenty pound a year with
the leaſt, and in many places thirty pound a year Abatement
in Rent out of this hundred. We will touch the Sore as eaſie
as poſſible, and allow but twenty <hi>per Annum</hi> abatement in
Rent, ſo there remains but eighty pound, which at eighteen
years purchaſe comes to 1440 pound; ſo that at this rate,
here is near a third part loſt of the real Value what the
Lands and Eſtates of the Kingdom were formerly worth.
And this we may believe, that that Parliament about ſeven
years ſince were very ſenſible of: Witneſs their many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
in their ſeveral Seſſions about raiſing Money for his
Majeſties ſupplies, and the great care the Houſes then took
in all thoſe Debates, that none of thoſe Supplies ſhould be
provided for by a Land Tax, whilſt there could any other
way poſſibly be found out, or thought upon; and thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97740:5"/>
ſmall helps, as the Exciſe on the Law &amp;c. which were ſo
long a raiſing but a very inconſiderable Sum, at laſt cannot
be look'd upon to ſtand the King and Kingdom in any
ſtead, ſhould there be any extraordinary occaſion for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
If we ſhould expect any ſupply from the Merchant, and
from Trade, they will tell you that there is as much Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
and Exciſe laid upon all ſorts of Commodities as the
Trade is able to bear; This ſhall be the general Anſwer of
the whole Body of Merchants, and the Whole-ſale-dealers
throughout the Kingdom, eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> ſo that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
help is to be expected from them. Have we not reaſon
then to endeavour the Reſtoring our Lands and Rents to
their former value and eſteem, when we have hardly any
other way left for the Preſervation of our Lives, Eſtates,
yea, and our Trade too: for ſhould there be any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Occaſion for a ſpeedy ſupply of Money, when all Heads
and Wits are puzl'd which way to raiſe it; there can be no
ſpeedier way poſſibly found out, then by a Land Tax (or
Subſidy) which is much the ſame, provided our Lands and
Rents may be raiſed to their former value and eſteem.</p>
            <p>This being then the true ſtate of the Caſe, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
we are fallen into, ſince the beginning of the late
Wars; let us now proceed to examine the Cauſes of this
great Miſchief, to make way for remedying the ſame; and
theſe may be ſum'd up into theſe two grand ones (to wit)
Our Wool, and Cattel, the latter of which was endeavour'd
to be provided for, by that <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act which utterly prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the bringing in of any ſort of Cattel out of <hi>Ireland</hi>
into this Kingdom, upon forfeiture thereof; when there was
the ſame Reaſon, at the very ſame time, againſt the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their Wool, (to wit) to prevent the beating down
the Rents of that part of the Kingdom which depended
moſt upon breeding.</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed, and enquire into the Reaſons
of the low Rates and Prices of our Wool, and we ſhall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97740:5"/>
find that we may bring them under theſe few chief
Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, The great quantity of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool ſold here
at very low Rates, and that made into Cloth, and the moſt
part of it (to our ſhame) worn by our Selves; is a very
great Cauſe of the Abatement and low Price of ours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The not wearing, and other ways uſing the Cloth
made of our own Wool, both by our ſelves at Home, and
by our People in our ſeveral Plantations abroad, may be
look'd upon as another Cauſe of the great Abatement of the
Price of Wool.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The decaying Condition of the Merchant-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers,
and <hi>Hamborough</hi> Company, who did formerly
ſend away ſo many of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloths into <hi>Germany,</hi> and
all thoſe Eaſtern Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> more than now they do,
may be reckon'd another Cauſe of the low Price of Wool.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The not making our Cloth of that Size and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
as it ought to be, as by ſeveral Statutes to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
it may appear, and for which the Alnage Office was
at firſt Eſtabliſh'd.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, The great Abuſes and Cheats of late years
put upon our Clothiers, by the Brokers and Factors at
<hi>Blackwell-Hall,</hi> to the breaking and undoing of many of
our young Clothiers, eſpecially if their ſtocks be ſmall;
Theſe may be accounted ſome of the chief Cauſes of the
great Abatement and low Price of our Wool.</p>
            <p>We will Examine them in their Order. And firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool. If we look no farther back than
1660, the Year of his Majeſties happy Reſtauration, We ſhall
find that the Superfine <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool (as they term it) was
ſold for four ſhillings, and four ſhillings and four pence the
pound, and the other ſorts at three ſhillings, and three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and ſix pence the pound, according as it was in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
And our Wool at that time was ſold for ſixteen pence
and eighteen pence the pound. Now this preſent year
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97740:6"/>
1684, and ſeven or eight years ſince, the Superſine <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Wool, is not worth above two ſhillings, or two ſhillings
and two pence the pound, and the other ſorts at twenty
pence and two and twenty pence the pound; and our
Wool will not yield above ſeven pence or eight pence a
pound; ſo that in leſs than twenty years time our Wool is
fallen the one half and more; and ſo long as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Wool is ſold at this low Rate, it is not likely that our own
can Advance in price: And if ſo, then our Rents, eſpecially
thoſe Farms that depend moſt upon Corn and Sheep, muſt
continue at this low Ebb they are now at, if they fall no
lower. The removal then of this great Miſchief, is the next
thing we are to Conſider; and herein I muſt content my
ſelf to receive the Cenſures of ſeveral Perſons of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Party, I mean thoſe Perſons whoſe Fortunes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
lye principally in the Buying, not growing of
this Commodity; but they are not ſo many.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool muſt of neceſſity Advance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
towards the price it was formerly at, when our Wool
yielded ſixteen pence and eighteen pence the pound: For
that being ſo much finer than ours, and bearing but a low
Price, we cannot expect ours ſhould Riſe; and if this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool is not to be expected from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
then we muſt endeavour what can be done at home.</p>
            <p>If ſome Duty or Cuſtom were laid upon it (I ſhall not
preſume to propoſe the Sum) ſo as to bring it to bear a
conſiderable Rate, his Majeſty by this means would receive
a good Addition to his Revenue, and our Wool would be
brought to a conſiderable Price. As for the Prohibiting
this or moſt other Foreign Commodities, we may find up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Examination, and by Experience too, that that way
will not ſo well anſwer our Deſign, as the laying a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Duty upon them more or leſs according to the quality
of the Commodity. I will Inſtance only in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act;
if ten or twenty ſhillings, more or leſs, upon a Bullock,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97740:6"/>
and five ſhillings upon a Sheep, or thereabouts, had been laid
as a Duty upon them, inſtead of Prohibiting them; we
had not only continued ſtill our Trade and Commerce
with them, but his Majeſty had received e're this many a
Thouſand pound for his Cuſtom. For, as the Caſe now ſtands,
the King receives no Advantage by them; his Officers in
all Ports where they are landed (being not obliged by their
Office, take no notice of them) do rather help the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, than any way endeavour a ſeizure: Which if
otherwiſe, they were then all bound by their Offices to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Majeſties Duty; and then each Bullock and Sheep
paying ſo much Cuſtom, they could not under-ſell us, which
was the great Deſign of that Act. <hi>viz.</hi> The keeping up the
price of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cattel, ſo that an Impoſt upon Wool,
as well as all other Commodities, will better Anſwer our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
and Deſigns againſt them than a Prohibition: for here
can be no other ſhift, if the Officers be honeſt and careful,
but the paying their Money.</p>
            <p>But here will ariſe an Objection.</p>
            <p>If this ſhould be ſo, that a Duty ſhould be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, then would the <hi>Dutch</hi> and other
Nations get away our Trade, by under-ſelling us in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloth is a Commodity: for if we muſt
pay dearer for our Wooll than they, we cannot expect to
have any Trade (with them) where this Commodity is
vended: for neither will our Clothiers make it, or our
Merchants buy it, if they cannot ſee ſome probability of
Profit and Advantage.</p>
            <p>To this Objection; We muſt believe that the <hi>Dutch</hi> are
a People that will loſe no Opportunity of Profit where
they can get it; and if they could vend more <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloth
than they do, we muſt alſo believe they would make more
if they could; they having the ſame liberty to buy the
Wool as well as we, but there is little danger of their getting
this Trade from us this way. For they have their hands as full
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97740:7"/>
already, and do make as much Cloth as they have People
to imploy about it, with reſpect to their other Buſineſs and
Manufactures.</p>
            <p>As to the other part of the Objection, that concerns the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> that if we give more for <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool than they,
then we muſt of courſe be under-ſold by them, and ſo by
conſequence loſe our Trade.</p>
            <p>We muſt firſt be inform'd what ſort of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloth it
is they chiefly make, and where it is vended, to do us this
hurt. As for the ſorts of Cloth they make, they are moſt
blacks, and many of them ſold here, and worn by our ſelves;
and this I hope may be remedied; but for the <hi>Medlies,</hi> I
ſuppoſe they make but few, for the <hi>French</hi> and others with
whom we trade for them, cannot be furniſh'd by any other
Nation in the World but by us: ſo that if we raiſe the
price of them among our ſelves, we ſhall not be in danger
to be under-ſold by the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is all this to that which we have to ſay for our
ſelves? Here is a fourth part of the real Value at leaſt of our
Kingdom within theſe few years loſt, and that principally
by the fall in price of this one Commodity; and we have
no way poſſibly left to raiſe Money upon any urgent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
but by our Eſtates. And have we not reaſon then
(as I ſaid before) to endeavour our utmoſt to reſtore them
to their former value and eſteem again. Which way had it
been poſſible for the Nation, in the late War, to have
maintained ſo many vaſt Armies in all Parts and Corners
thereof, had not that War begun upon us in the very height
of our Wealth and Plenty, when our Wool at that time
was worth three times the price it now yields, with a full
Trade for our Cloth both at home and abroad; eſpecially
into <hi>Germany, Sweden,</hi> and all thoſe Eaſtern Countries;
and our Cattel then paid ſufficient profit, both to the
Breeder and Graſier, and Gold was as plenty with us then,
as it was in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Solomon;</hi> there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97740:7"/>
was no throwing of Farms into the Landlords hands, no
Complaining of hard Rents, every Commodity of ours then
yielded a Profit, for we had a Conſumption for them, and
the Poor could not want Victuals, when the Kitchin was
accounted the beſt Room in the Houſe. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe of this great Abatement of the price of
our Wool, may be this, <hi>viz.</hi> The wearing and uſing of ſo
much <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloth our ſelves, both at home and in our
ſeveral Plantations abroad; whereas if we were but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
to wear, and otherwiſe to uſe no Cloth but what
is made of our own <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool, we ſhould find ſome
alteration in the price of it in few years; and I doubt not
but our Clothiers could pick out enough of the fineſt ſort
of it to make Cloth very little inferiour to the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
And it is eaſie to be made appear, that we ſpend as much
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloth in our own Kingdoms and Plantations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> (and a great part of
that too not manufactur'd by our own People, as <hi>Dutch</hi>
black) as is worn in all the Kingdoms of the World beſides,
and more. So that if any ſhall object againſt the laying
a Duty upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, I hope they will give us
leave to enjoyn our own People to wear no Cloth but
what is manufactured by our ſelves, and made of our own
Wool; and if this Conſumption of our Cloth at home be
added but to that Trade we have yet left abroad for it, we
ſhould ſoon find an Increaſe in the price of our Wool.
And I know no reaſon why any ſhould be offended with
us for endeavouring our own Intereſt and Advantage, the
general deſign of all Nations: neither can this ſpending of
our own Cloth among our ſelves hinder any thing of our
Trade abroad.</p>
            <p>And that this may appear to be no new or upſtart Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Statutes of 2 <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. Cap. 1, 2, 3.
may ſufficiently ſatisfie us; in which Kings Reign it was,
that the Manufacture of our Wool began to be our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97740:8"/>
Employment. For among all our Staple Commodities,
Wool had at that time the Precedency, as being the moſt
principal and ancient Commodity of the Kingdom, wherein
the generality of the People were deeply concern'd; and
the Manufacture of it, though of long uſe among our ſelves,
yet it received but little Encouragement for a Trade into
Foreign Parts, till theſe times; the <hi>Flemmings</hi> having the
principal Manufacture then by the continual ſupply of Wool
that they received from hence.</p>
            <p>But the Wiſdom of this great Prince ſoon diſcern'd of
what unſpeakable value the Manufacture of our own Wool
would be to the Trade of this Kingdom; who, like a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
and careful Father, look'd farther than his preſent
time; and who, beingwell acquainted with the <hi>Flemmings</hi>
Affairs, by a joynt Engagement with them in the War with
<hi>France,</hi> had therein gain'd ſo good an Opinion amongſt
them, that he might adventure to change a Complement for
a Courteſie; the Staples where our Wool was ſold being
now taken clean away, and by the Statute of 2. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.
Cap. 1. made Felony to carry any Wool out of the Realm:
He now proſecutes his Deſign for the ſetling of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
at home, and repreſents to thoſe <hi>Flemmings</hi> the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
they were in by the bordering Wars with <hi>France,</hi>
and the peacable Condition of <hi>England,</hi> and freedom of
the People that are Subjects here; Propounds an Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for them to come over hither, wherein he promiſes them
the ſame Priviledges and Immunities with his own Subjects:
which they accepted, and came over, and brought their
Manufacture with them, which could never after be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
hence. So as now the Manufacture and our Wool were
joyned together; and ſo long as they agree together, both
will thrive; but if they once part, (as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool at this
time puts fair at it) they will both be loſers in the Concluſion.</p>
            <p>The Manufacture of our Wool being brought to this
Settlement at home, this Heroick King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97740:8"/>
makes this other Statue in the ſame 11th year of his Reign,
That no Merchant, Foreign or <hi>Denizon,</hi> nor any other, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> ſhall cauſe to be brought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
or apertly by himſelf, nor by any other into the
ſaid Lands of <hi>England, Ireland, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> within
the Kings Power, any Cloths made in any other Places
than in the ſame, upon forfeiture of the ſaid Cloth, and
further to be puniſhed at the Kings Will, as is aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this Nation formerly had been, and ſtill is too
much wedded to the wearing of Foreign Manufactures, the
importing of which did hinder the uſing of our own home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made
Manufactures; (for too much of them make our
own a Drug, our Nation Poor, and our People to want
Work) As a Cure for this Diſeaſe, our own <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth
is enjoyn'd by a Law to be worn by all Perſons under the
Degree of a Lord; and then the Wiſdom of the times
thought fit to provide for the true and perfect making of
Cloth; ſeveral Statutes were made in this Kings time,
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and were alſo confirm'd by Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James;</hi> but eſpecially in the fifth year
of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th Cap. 6. For the Length, Bredth, Weight,
and Goodneſs of all ſorts of Cloth; with ſeveral Proviſo's
to prevent Frauds and Abuſes both in the making and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thereof: ſuch care our Anceſtors have had in all former
and latter Ages, for the improvement of this our Woollen
Manufacture, by which we may plainly ſee, of what abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Neceſſity it is to be encouraged and advanced: Shall
it now by us (after ſo much Care and Induſtry uſed by
them to ſettle and bring it to our Doors, and into our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Houſes) be neglected, and ſcarce thought worth the
Entertainment, for fear of I know not what Jealouſies of
diſobliging ſome Foreign Nation, by putting a Duty on
their Wool. Shall their Wiſdom and Prudence that judg'd
this Manufacture and Trade for it, the great Support and
and Glory of our Nation, be call'd in queſtion by our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97740:9"/>
and ſhall we ſuffer our ſelves to be thus cheated
of it, when we are as well able to maintain and defend it as
they; and by Exprience find, that it is our chiefeſt, if not
only Manufacture and Support of the Strength, Honour, and
Wealth of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. For which way can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a Trade long, that have no Money of our own growth,
but only what is brought unto us for Commodities; and
if we can find nothing of our own to barter and exchange
for, we muſt in ſhort time ſink our trade abroad, if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to keep our Money at home; our Staple Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
muſt therefore of Neceſſity be advanc'd and encourag'd,
to enable us by the return thereof, to hold a Commerce
with thoſe Parts of the World that muſt ſupply us: for if
Trade be maintained barely out of the main Stock, the
Kingdom in time muſt needs be decay'd, and ſo brought
to Penury; it being our Magazin.</p>
            <p>A third Cauſe of the great Abatement and low Price of
our Wool may be this, <hi>viz.</hi> The decaying Condition of the
Merchant-Adventure, and <hi>Hamborough</hi> Company within
theſe few years; a Company that vended many thouſands
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloths yearly; for after that our Staples for
Wool were taken away, and the Manufacture of our Cloth
ſetled among us, this Company alſo had their Motion from
<hi>Flanders</hi> through <hi>Holland,</hi> untill at laſt it came to be
fixed, for the conveniency of thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries, at
<hi>Hamborough</hi> And it would not be needleſs if the diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of them were adviſed with, to know the Reaſons they
can give of this loſs or decay, at leaſt, of their Trade in
<hi>Germany,</hi> and all thoſe adjoyning Kingdoms. For a Trade
of ſo large extent, and vaſt covernment to us, ought not
thus eaſily to be parted with. And there may poſſibly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch an enquiry, ſomething appear, that a great cauſe of
this decay of that Trade proceeds from our ſelves; which
if ſo, there may then be ſome way found out to recover
that Ancient Company of the Merchant-Adventurers, their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97740:9"/>
Trade, Credit, and Eſteem again; the only Company that
tranſported moſt part of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth. And we may more
then probably gueſs, that the two following and remaining
Cauſes of the low Price of our Wool, which I propos'd, to
wit, the not making of our Cloth of that ſize and ſubſtance
as it ought to be, and as it was order'd in former times to be
made, as by the ſeveral Statutes before recited may appear;
and the Cheats and Abuſes of the Brokers and Factors at
<hi>Blackwell-hall</hi> (a ſort of People never heard of there, before
the beginning of the late Rebellion; and in thoſe times there
ſetled, that their Maſters, who firſt granted them their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and made them a Corporation, might have the more
time and leiſure to attend their other Imployments of more
weightier and publick Concernment) might be a great means
to help ruin this our Trade. But for the regulating a Buſineſs
of ſo great a concern, I ſhall not preſume to propoſe the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod;
there will be Application ſufficient from all parts of the
Kingdom, were there a Committee appointed purpoſely for
this Buſineſs; whereby we might have ſome Hopes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth may be a Commodity
again. And upon their Arraignment, there will be Bills plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
enough brought in for their Conviction: For, from Men
not worth much when the device began, they are now many
of them worth 5, and 10000<hi>l.</hi> and ſome of them 40 and 50000<hi>l.</hi>
a Man; while many of the lower Rank of our Clothiers daily
break and run away; thoſe men by their Wiles and Tricks
creeping into their Eſtates: for they have brought the Trade
to that paſs, there ſhall not now be a Cloth ſold in a Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
at <hi>Blackwell-hall,</hi> by many of our Clothiers, if theſe men
have not the ſelling of it; and it would grieve a mans Heart
to ſee how harmleſly the poor Clothier waits at the heels of
his Factor all the day long whither he pleaſes to lead him; and
when he puts into a Drapers Shop, he hears of nothing but of
bad Trading, uncomfortable News, and no Mony ſtirring:
for they are both agreed to ſend the poor man out of Town
without ſelling a Cloth himſelf; neither ſhall he perhaps,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97740:10"/>
hear in a long time what is become of his Cloth, whether ſold
or not, untill it be for the Factor's Convenience to give him
an account, or untill a Draper or a Cloth-Merchant or two
break, and then 'tis ten to one but he may have an account,
that ſome of his Cloth is gon that way: So that as the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
of our Cloth is now managed wholly by private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
and Deſigns, were our Trade abroad for it never ſo
good, it is not probable (lying in ſuch hands) it ſhould ever
be reſtored to its ancient Credit and Eſteem. It therefore begs,
and that earneſtly, if we value the Strength, Honour and
Wealth of our Nation, that we ſhould uſe our utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to advance it to its juſt Worth and Reputation again,
by freeing it from this great Monopoly, and to ſet it at that
Liberty, that the laborious and careful Clothier, who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpends his time, but hazards his Stock, and that ſmall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
he began with, for his own Maintenance, and thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he doth imploy in his Trade, may have ſo much Favour
as to ſell his own Cloth himſelf; that what honeſt Profit can
be made thereof, he who only deſerves and takes pains for it,
may receive it, to the Encouragement of that Manufacture,
which muſt help the Price of our Wool, which muſt help the
Advancement of our Rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And not the lazy Factor,
whoſe only Labour is between <hi>Blackwell-hall</hi> and his Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe,
and who ſuck the Gains from the honeſt Clothier,
through the very Heart of himſelf, his Family, and all the Poor
therein imploy'd, and thereby ruines our Trade, the great
cauſe of the Abatement of Rents, and the Improveriſhment of
our Kingdom. And as theſe Factors are the greateſt Enemies
to this Trade in general, that either Malice or Envy could
poſſibly ſet up, ſo if they be but narrowly look'd into, they
will appear, for the moſt and Richeſt part of them, as to their
Principals to the preſent Government, the ſame with thoſe who
firſt brought them thither, and who, by the Influence they have
upon the Buyers, and the Command they have upon the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers,
are able to draw more People into Faction and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
than any other ſort of men in the Kingdom beſides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:97740:10"/>
There would ſuch another Generation of Men be brought
to the Bar from <hi>Smith-field</hi> too, who put as great Injuries
and Abuſes upon our young Graſiers eſpecially, by buying
and ſelling of Cattel there, and yet Butchers by their Trade,
who can either dull or raiſe the Markets at their Pleaſure;
ſo that we may ſee into what hands the two great Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of our Kingdom of late years are got; but this latter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the by. We will go on with our Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
which being once more retriev'd, let the Alnage-Office
have a whet, and be ſtrictly look into, that they ſhould not
only receive their Fees, but perform their Duty, that we may
rightly know how far ſhort our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth will come to
the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> when well and truly made; that by this means
we may recover it that Credit and Eſteem it once had, both
at home and abroad. For methinks we are all aſleep; we ſee
a Trade ſnatch'd from us to our Ruine, and yet ſeem to be
unconcern'd; Nay, which is worſe, we help forward with it
our ſelves; and though we are taken notice of ſufficiently,
and jeer'd for the <hi>French</hi> Apes, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man pictur'd with
a piece of Cloth under his Arm, to chuſe his Faſhion, yet I
thought it had been always underſtood to be Cloth made of
his own Wool.</p>
            <p>Having now given ſome particulars that may be great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the low Price of our Wool, with ſome ways and means
for the reſtoring of it to its former value and uſe again, which
each particular carries along with it; I ſhall wind up all with
that Act of Parliament made ſome years ſince, for the burying
in Woollen: and he that will but read that Act, may very
well ſatisfie himſelf, that the Parliament were ſufficiently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the great loſs we were like to be at, if ſome way or
other were not found out to conſume our Wool; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they were worthy Patriots for their Country, that firſt
moved for, and afterwards purſu'd it to an Act, however it
hath not been received or obeyed as it worthily deſerv'd;
we will therefore examine, and give ſome Gueſs how much
Wool might have been buried, ſince that Act of Parliament
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97740:11"/>
was firſt made, without any Diſparagement to the Dead, or
to the ſurviving Friends of the Deceaſed; and we ſhall find
that a very great part of the Wool now in the Kingdom, I
ſpeak as to the quantity, out of Cloth, had been at this day
under Ground.</p>
            <p>In <hi>London</hi> is buried one year with another (when no Plague
or other Epidemical Diſtemper Reigns) about twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
which, by Obſervation of ſome, bears a ſeventh part with
the Kingdom; ſo there dayes in <hi>England</hi> an hundred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand yearly, with the leaſt; and we will allow two
pounds of Wool for a Shrowd, one with another, which amounts
to two hundred and eighty thouſand pound of Wool yearly
buried; ſo that in every ten years we ſhall ſpend this way
about twenty hundred thouſand Ponds, a good proportion
of one years Growth; but with this Advantage to our Poor,
that it is firſt made into Cloth. So that had that Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
been duely obſerved, as it was our Intereſt ſo to do, we
may plainly perceive what quantity of Wool we had by this
buryed in our own Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> (for I have not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
either <hi>Scotland, Ireland,</hi> or any of our Plantations into
this account) but if all could be brought within the compaſs
of this Act, and the charge of ſeeing it punctually performed,
carefully obſerved, we ſhould not only ſpend in all theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Iſlands belonging to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> a moſt
incredible quantity of our own Wool manufactured by our
ſelves, but ſave above threeſcore thouſand Pounds Sterling a
year of our Money, which we lay out for Linnen-Cloth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
for that uſe, as may appear by examining this Charge
by the former Rule; Equivalent to a Story we have of one of
our Kings, who finding a great glut of Cloth in the Kingdom,
beyond their Vent and Trade for it, bought it, and cauſed it
all to be burnt. And the <hi>Dutch,</hi> thoſe ſubtil Traders, as it is
generally reported of them, when their Ships are fraighted
with their Spices in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> for that years Proviſion
into <hi>Europe,</hi> they return the reſt in Smoak, by cauſing the
overplus of that years growth to be burnt at their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97740:11"/>
So that the Conſumption of every growth of our
Wool is of abſolute Neceſſity towards the Improvement of our
Rents, and for recovering that third or fourth part of the
real Value of our Kingdom, now loſt ſince the fall and low
price thereof.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude wholly with this Cloth-trade, the
chief and only Manufacture of this Kingdom, I ſhall premiſe
ſomething by way of Quere, as a Remedy to this great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
and whether it may prove of advantage to the growth,
and Manufacture, and Trade of this Commodity, I ſhall leave
it to far better Judgments to determine.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe there were a Company of Merchants of this Staple,
ſetled by Patent or Charter, as ſuch Companies there are; the
<hi>Eaſt-India, Turkey,</hi> &amp;c. that ſhould buy up in <hi>Spain</hi> every
years growth of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool themſelves, and thence
tranſport it, or as much as they ſhould judge convenient for our
Trade, hither, to be manufactur'd by us; where a Duty ſhould
be impos'd upon it, according as it ſhould be judg'd the Trade
would bear, in order to the Advancement of our own; for there
lies the bottom ſtill of the Deſign. I ask the Queſtion, Where
would the Inconveniencies ariſe? For the Truth is, a Buſineſs
of this Nature is more fit to be diſcours'd of by a Committee,
than medled with by any private Perſon; I ſay, if ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were ſet up, what would be the Objections againſt it?</p>
            <p>For, firſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> can receive no Prejudice by it; we
ſhall by this means rather advance ſomething the Price, than
any way abate it.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> I ſuppoſe we ſhould
make no ſcruple of getting the Trade from them, for this Cloth
Trade is our Ancient Right, and did alwayes belong to our
Nation, and no other People in the World could in reaſon
pretend to the Manufacture of it, the Staple growing upon
our own Soil. And ſince there is now another ſort of Wool
ſtarted up within theſe few years, which proves to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of ours; I ſee no Reaſon againſt me, if we can compaſs
to make both our own and that too, but that we may juſtly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97740:12"/>
ingroſs it if we can, without offering any Injuſtice to our
Neighbouring Nation; and then, what is their Growth and
Manufacture, as Linnen-cloth, and the like, if they will qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
deſiſt, and yield up this to us, as it is our Right, we may,
I preſume, be perſwaded (I ſpeak only for my ſelf) to do
the like by theirs.</p>
            <p>But if we examine this Buſineſs a little farther, we ſhall
find, that there may be a neceſſity for the laying a Duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool; and that it will be impoſſible while
the Trade is free, and that every man may buy and make what
he pleaſe of this ſort of Cloth, that ever our Wool ſhould
advance in price; for as the Rates now go, unleſs the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
raiſe the Price, our Merchants will not, and our Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers
drive the old Deſign in buying as cheap as they can;
ſo that between them they will keep down the price of ours;
for one man in a Fair or Market may beat down the Price
of what he deals in, by under-ſelling his own Commodity,
but where is all this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloth made that doth us this
harm? Were it the Manufacture of the whole Nation that
kept all the Poor at work, there might be ſomething ſaid for
it; but it is all made (I mean the Medlies) in the Corners
of Two Shires, (to wit) <hi>Somerſet</hi> and <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and that
within the compaſs of twenty or thirty miles at moſt; and
not an hundred (I ſpeak with the moſt) Principal Clothiers
concern'd in the making of this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloth; what dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
can the Engroſſing then of this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, or putting
a Duty or Cuſtom upon it do the Nation? It is very true,
there are many that call for the Liberty of the People, that
every Man may Buy and Sell as he pleaſe. And it were well
if theſe Men would conſider themſelves as well in the Relative
as in their own Perſonal Concerns: For if every Man were Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant,
his Liberty were ſo too; but ſo long as any Man is
a Member of a Kingdom, his Liberty muſt likewiſe depend
upon the good of the ſame Kingdom. And if it be not good
for a Nation that every man ſhould buy and ſell, and wear
what he paid for, as he pleaſe, he muſt not think himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97740:12"/>
if his Liberty, as an Engliſh-man, be confin'd, ſo long
as his Country hath an Intereſt in his Commodity and Trade,
for its Safety and Welfare as well as himſelf. So if the Trade
for <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, which is now at Liberty, were in the hands of
one particular Company, it would not then lye in the power of
any private Perſons to ſink the Trade and Manufacture of our
Wool, as now they can: For certainly, a Liberty for a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Trade, in ſome caſes, may bring that Miſchief upon the
<hi>Publick Concern</hi> of a Nation, not eaſily to be removed again.
I will only inſtance one Paſſage, which may be freſh in every
man's memory, that had then any <hi>Concern</hi> in <hi>Wool,</hi> to ſhew
what command the great Clothiers, Factors, and others have of
that Commodity and the Trade for it.</p>
            <p>When the Peace was laſt made with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> about ten
years ſince, by the Mediation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, and
the <hi>French</hi> left wholly out in that Agreement, the price of
our Wool, in leſs than a Months time, did riſe from 18 <hi>s.</hi>
and 19 <hi>s,</hi> to 25 <hi>s.</hi> and 26 <hi>s.</hi> the weight, that is a quarter part
more than it would yield a Week before the News of that
Agreement with <hi>Holland.</hi> But the Scene quickly ſhifted, for
the Parliament being ſoon after Prorogued, our Wool did
not ſo faſt advance before, but now it came tumbling down;
ſo that it return'd not only in a Week or Fortnights time to
its former price, but paſs'd by without any ſtay or ſtop, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it was almoſt impoſſible to run lower, even to 12, and 13 <hi>s.</hi>
the weight.</p>
            <p>What ſhould be the reaſon of this? was there more Wool
now diſcover'd, or was there like to be leſs Trade? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there was as much Wool in the Kingdom of our own
growth an hundred years ago as now; We have no increaſe
of Sheep; for all thoſe Lands that now feed, (to wit) our
Downs and Sheep-Paſtures, could never be employ'd to other
Uſe. Then it muſt be in the Trade. And if ſo, then we may
ſee where the Command of that lyes; as thoſe Dealers like the
Motions of the Times, they ſhall either advance or ſink it at
their pleaſure, for the Trade lies ſullen, and muſt be rows'd;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97740:13"/>
it hath been ſo long manag'd by ſome particular Perſons, that
they now look upon it, not ſo much the Staple Manufacture,
and chief Commodity we have to ſupport the Wealth and
Honour of our Nation, as a Buſineſs only for ſome few men
to gain Wealth and Eſtates by. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>Now what quantity of this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool is brought yearly
into this Kingdom, and here made into Cloth, and how much
of it is tranſported when made, is worth our Enquiry. And
upon this Enquiry, I doubt it will appear, that there is as
much <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloth ſpent and worn among our own People,
as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool will make that is imported; for in lieu
of thoſe few Medlies we ſend abroad in Trade, we have a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of Blacks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brought out of <hi>Holland</hi> to us, and here
ſold at double the rate of that made in our own Kingdom of
the ſame goodneſs: For at this day the very Servants and
Mechanicks, eſpecially in Towns and Cities, will ſcorn to wear
any Cloth but <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> if their Purſes can but reach the price.
It is not many years ſince that <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloth of the ſame good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
they now make, was ſold for 23 <hi>s.</hi> and 24 <hi>s.</hi> the yard by
the Clothier, which he now ſells for 15 <hi>s.</hi> and 16 <hi>s.</hi> the yard:
and ſo long as it can be bought at this low price, there is
ſcarce a Cobler but will have his beſt Suit of it. In a word,
all the Ruine that hath happen'd to our Clothing Trade by
the low price of our Wool, cannot be imputed to the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool, but to the Importation of the
<hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and other Foreign Wool, without paying any Duty
or Cuſtom for the ſame. And this, among other Grievances
attending the Clothing Trade, the Grand Jury of the County
of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> at their General Quarter Seſſions, preſented as
the <hi>Grievance</hi> and <hi>Complaint</hi> of the whole <hi>County:</hi> the which
I have here ſet down <hi>verbatim,</hi> as it was to have been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the late Kings moſt Excellent <hi>Majeſty,</hi> in <hi>Council.</hi>

            <head>Somerſet. At the General Quarter Seſſions of
the Peace held at Brewton, in and
for the Country aforeſaid, on the
Thirteenth day of January in the
Thirty Sixth Year of the Reign of
our Sovereign Lord Charles the
Second, by the Grace of God of
England, Scotland, France, and
Ireland, King, &amp;c. The Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Grand Jury there was
as followeth; viz.</head>
            <p>HEARING the daily ſad and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Complaint of the greateſt part
of the Clothiers of this Country, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the great Decay of their Trade,
whereby many of them with in few years
laſt paſt have been ruin'd and undone; And
finding by ſad experience the great fall that
is happened of late on the price of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97740:14"/>
Wool, that Commodity now yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but little more than the one half the
Value of what it was wont to be ſold
for at the beginning of the late unhappy
Rebellion in this Kingdom; And having
ſeriouſly conſidered theſe things, do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive the Cauſes of theſe great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
to be the Importation of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and
other Foreign Wools, without paying
any Cuſtom or Impoſt for the ſame;
And the great Abuſes that have been put
upon the Clothiers at the Principal Mart
for Cloth in this Kingdom, by a ſort of
People called Factors; Men firſt ſet up
in the late Times of Diſtraction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
ever ſince in Number and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
till now at length they have gotten
the ſole Command and Sale of moſt mens
Cloth brought thither to be ſold; And
have thereby advanc'd themſelves from
little or nothing to be Men of great
Eſtates, and as much impoveriſhed their
Maſters, who ſadly complain of theſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97740:14"/>
Abuſes, and are left without proſpect
of a Remedy: The Conſideration of
which Miſchiefs growing more and more
upon us, and, if not timely prevented,
being likely in the end to prove the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of this ancient Staple Commodity
and Manufacture of our Kingdom, hath
cauſed us at this time to make this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Preſentment.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Wool of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in particular, as well as of the whole
Kingdom in general, is the greateſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
we have; And that which adds more
to the Rents and Improvement of the
Real Value of the Lands and Revenues
thereof, than any one Commodity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
And that it is as much our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
(if not more) to improve the
Rents and Revenues of the Lands and
Eſtates of this Kingdom, as to Maintain
the Trade, without which Improvement
we ſhall in no caſe be able to raiſe any
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97740:15"/>
conſiderable Sum of Money by a Land-Tax,
if any ſudden or extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſhould require it.</p>
            <p>We Preſent therefore, That the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Spaniſh, and other Foreign
Wools, without paying any Duty or
Cuſtom for the ſame, is a very great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the price of Engliſh Wool;
and ſo conſequently contributes much to
the Abatements of the Rents and Profits
iſſuing from Lands.</p>
            <p>We Preſent, That the making of
Woollen Cloth is the greateſt Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of this Kingdom, and that wherein
many thouſands of poor People are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
and ſet to work, and thereby Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and Maintained; and that ſince the
time that the Art of Clothing was firſt
known amongſt us, it has continued free,
untill the beginning of the late Rebellion,
there ſprung up a ſort of People, who,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97740:15"/>
under the name of Factors of <hi>Blackwell-Hall,</hi>
have gotten into their Power the
Management and Diſpoſal of moſt of the
Cloth that is ſold there: And beſides, are
grown to be the greateſt Merchants of Oyl
and Dying-ſtuffs, but chiefly of Spaniſh
Wool; all goods belonging to the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Trade, of whom the Clothier is
forced to buy, the Factor having his
Stock both of Cloth and Money in his
own hands; And therefore We preſent,
that theſe Factors of <hi>Blackwell-Hall</hi> are a
Publick Nuſance and Prejudice to the
Clothing Trade; and to have been the
Ruine of many poor Clothiers, and the
Cauſes of many other Miſchiefs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
that now lye heavy upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> We farther Preſent, that this
Honourable Bench will be pleaſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the Royal Power and Prerogative
of His Sacred Majeſty, for convenient
Remedies to theſe great Abuſes; And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97740:16"/>
that this Preſentment may be with all
Submiſſion preſented to His Majeſty as
the Grievance and Complaint of the whole
Country.</p>
