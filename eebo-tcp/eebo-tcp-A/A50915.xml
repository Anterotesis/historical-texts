            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>PYSCOPACY, as it is taken for an Order in the <hi>Church</hi> above a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi> or as wee commonly name him, the Minister of a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is either of Divine constitution, or of humane. If onely of humane, we have the same humane priviledge, that all men have ever had since <hi>Adam,</hi> being borne free, and in the Mistresse Iland of all the <hi>British,</hi> to retaine this <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> or to remove it, consulting with our owne occasions, and conveniences, and for the prevention of our owne dangers, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, in what best manner we can devise, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out running at a losse, as wee must needs in those stale, and uselesse records of either uncertaine, or unsound antiquity, which if we hold fast to the
<pb facs="tcp:93535:3"/>
grounds of the reformed <hi>Church,</hi> can neither skill of us, nor we of it, (so oft as it would lead us to the broken reed of <hi>tradition.</hi> If it bee of <hi>Divine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, to satisfie us fully in that, the Scripture onely is able, it being the onely Book left us of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> authority, not in any thing more Divine then in the all-sufficiency it hath to furnish us, as with all other spirituall knowledge, so with this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, setting out to us a perfect man of <hi>God</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish't to all the good workes of his charge. Through all which Booke can be no where, either by plaine Text, or solid reasoning found any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a Bishop, and a Presbyter, save that they be two names to signify the same order. Notwithstanding this clearnesse, and that by all evidence of argument, <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (whom our Prelates claim to imitate onely in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling part of their office) had rather the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerency of an Apostleship committed to them, then the ordinary charge of a Bishoprick, as being <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.</note> men of an extraordinary calling, yet to verify that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> foretold of succeeding times, when men began to have itching eares, then not contented with the plentifull and wholsom foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Gospell, they began after their owne lusts to heap to themselvs teachers, and as if the divine Scripture wanted a supplement, and were to be eek't out, they cannot think any doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd, and any doctrine confirm'd, unlesse they run to that indigested heap, and frie of Authors, which they call Antiquity. Whatsoever time, or the heedlesse hand of blind chance, hath drawne down from of old to this present, in her huge dragnet, whether Fish, or Sea-weed, Shells, or Shrubbs,
<pb facs="tcp:93535:3"/>
unpickt, unchosen, those are the Fathers. Seeing therefore some men, deeply conversant in Bookes, have had so little care of late to give the world a better account of their reading, then by divulging needlesse tractats stuff't with specious names of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> with fragments of old <hi>Martyrologies,</hi> and <hi>legends,</hi> to distract, and stagger the multitude of credulous readers, &amp; mislead them from their strong guards, and places of safety un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tuition of holy writ, it came into my thoughts to perswade my selfe, setting all distances, and nice respects aside, that I could do Religion, and my Country no better service for the time then doing my utmost endeavour to recall the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD from this vaine forraging after straw, and to reduce them to their firme stations under the standard of the Gospell: by making appeare to them, first the insufficiency, next the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and lastly the impiety of these gay testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that their great Doctors would bring them to dote on. And in performing this I shall not strive to be more exact in Methode, then as their citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lead mee.</p>
            <p>First therefore concerning <hi>Ignatius</hi> shall be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> fully, when the Author shall come to insist upon some places in his Epistles. Next to prove a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of 27. <hi>Bishops</hi> from <hi>Timothy,</hi> he cites one <hi>Leontius Bishop</hi> of <hi>Magnesia,</hi> out of the 11. act of the <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> Councell: this is but an obscure, and single witnesse, and for his faithfull dealing who shall commend him to us, with this his Catalogue of <hi>Bishops?</hi> what know wee further of him, but that he might be as factious, and false a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> that was a hunderd yeares his
<pb facs="tcp:93535:4"/>
predecessor? for neither the praise of his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or his vertue hath left him memorable to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, but onely this doubtfull relation, which wee must take at his word; and how shall this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony receive credit from his word, whose very name had scarse been thought on, but for this bare Testimony? But they will say hee was a member of the Councell, and that may deserve to gaine him credit with us. I will not stand to argue, as yet with faire allowance I might, that wee may as justly suspect, there were some bad and slippery men in that councell, as we know there are wont to be in our Convocations. Nor shall I neede to plead at this time, that nothing hath been more attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor with more subtilty brought about, both anciently by other <hi>Heretiks,</hi> and modernly by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, then to falsifie the Editions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, of which wee have none but from our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries hands, whence Canons, Acts, and whole spurious Councels are thrust upon us, and hard it would be to prove in all, which are legitimat against the lawfull rejection of an urgent, and free disputer, but this I purpose not to take advantage of, for what availes it to wrangle about the corrupt editions of Councells, when as we know that many yeares ere this time which was almost 500. years after <hi>Christ,</hi> the Councels themselves were fouly corrupted with ungodly Prelatisme, and so farre plung'd into worldly ambition, as that it stood them upon long ere this to uphold their now well-tasted Hierarchy by what faire pretext soever they could, in like manner as they had now learnt to defend many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grosse corruptions by as ancient, and suppos'd authentick tradition as Episcopacie. And what
<pb facs="tcp:93535:4"/>
hope can we have of this whole Councell to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us a matter 400. years at least above their time concerning the distinction of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> whenas we find them such blind Judges of things before their eyes in their decrees of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie between <hi>Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Bishop,</hi> acknowledging <hi>Rome</hi> for the Apostolick throne, and <hi>Peter</hi> in that See for the rock, the basis, and the foundation of the Catholick Church, and Faith, contrary to the interpretation of more ancient Fathers; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from a mistaken text did they give to <hi>Leo</hi> as <hi>Peters</hi> successor a kind of preheminence above the whole Councel, as <hi>Euagrius</hi> expresses (for now the Pope was come to that height, as to arrogate to himselfe by his Vicars incompetible honours) and yet having thus yeilded to <hi>Rome</hi> the universall Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie for spirituall reasons, as they thought, they conclude their sitting with a carnall, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous decree to give the second place of dignity to <hi>Constantinople</hi> from reason of State, because it was new <hi>ROME,</hi> and by like consequence doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of earthly priviledges annext to each other City, wasthe BISHOP therof to take his place.</p>
            <p>I may say againe therfore, what hope can we have of such a Councell, as beginning in the Spirit, ended thus in the flesh. Much rather should we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to what <hi>Eusebius</hi> the ancientest writer extant of Church-history, notwithstanding all the helps he had above these, confesses in the 4. chap. of his 3. Book, that it was no easie matter to tell who were those that were left Bishops of the Churches by the Apostles, more then by what a man might gather from the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb facs="tcp:93535:5"/>
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in which number he reckons <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> for Bishop of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> So as may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that this tradition of Bishoping <hi>Timothy</hi> over <hi>Ephesus</hi> was but taken for granted out of that place in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which was only an intreating him to tarry at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to do somthing left him in charge. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 3.</note> Now if <hi>Eusebius</hi> a famous writer thought it so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to tell who were appointed Bishops by the Apostles, much more may we think it difficult to <hi>Leontius</hi> an obscure Bishop speaking beyond his own Diocesse: and certainly much more hard was it for either of them to determine what kind of Bishops those were, if they had so little means to know who they were; and much lesse reason have we to stand to their definitive sentence, seeing they have bin so rash to raise up such lofty Bishops and Bishopricks out of places in Scripture meerly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood. Thus while we leave the Bible to gadde after these traditions of the ancients, we heare the ancients themselvs confessing, that what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they had in this point was such as they had gather'd from the Bible.</p>
            <p>Since therfore Antiquity it selfe hath turn'd over the controversie to that sovran Book which we had fondly straggl'd from, we shall doe better not to detain this venerable apparition of <hi>Leontius</hi> any longer, but dismisse him with his List of seven and twenty, to sleep unmolested in his former obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Now for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is more likely that <hi>Timothy</hi> never knew the word in that sense: it was the vanity of those next succeeding times not to content themselves with the simplicity of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phrase, but must make a new Lexicon to name
<pb facs="tcp:93535:5"/>
themselves by, one will be call'd <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <hi>Antistes,</hi> a word of precedence, another would be term'd a Gnostick as <hi>Clemens,</hi> a third Sacerdos, or Priest, and talks of Altars; which was a plaine signe that their doctrine began to change, for which they must change their expressions: But that place of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> serves rather to convince the Author, then to make for him, where the name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the president, or Pastor of the Brethren (for to what end is he their President but to teach them) cannot be limited to signifie a Prelaticall Bishop, but rather communicates that Greek appellation to every ordinary <hi>Presbyter:</hi> for there he tells what the Christians had wont to doe in their severall Congregations, to read, and expound, to pray and administer, all which he saies the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi> did. Are these the Offices only of a Bishop, or shall we think that every Congregation where these things were done, which he attributes to this <hi>Antistes,</hi> had a <hi>Bishop</hi> present among them? unlesse they had as many <hi>Antistites</hi> as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which this place rather seems to imply, and so we may inferre even from their own alledg'd authority, <hi>that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes was nothing else but Presbyter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for that namelesse Treatise of <hi>Timothy's</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, only cited by <hi>Photius</hi> that liv'd almost <note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> 900. yeares after <hi>Christ,</hi> it hansomely follows in that author, the Martyrdome of the seven Sleepers, that slept (I tell you but what mine Author sayes) three hundred seaventy, and two years, for so long they had bin shut up in a Cave without meat, and were found living.

Now come the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to shew us first, that <hi>Onesimus</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> next to assert the difference of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> wherin I wonder that men teachers of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, make no more difficulty of imposing upon our belief a supposititious ofspring of some dozen Epistles, whereof five are rejected as spurious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in them Herefies and trifles, which cannot agree in Chronologie with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> entitling him Arch-Bishop of <hi>Antioch Theopolis,</hi> which name of <hi>Theopolis</hi> that City had not till <hi>Iustinians</hi> time long after, as <hi>Cedrenus</hi> mentions, which argues both the barbarous time, and the unskilfull fraud of him that foisted this Epistle upon <hi>Ignatius.</hi> In the Epistle to those of <hi>Tarsus</hi> he condemns them for Ministers of Satan, that say <hi>Christ is God above all.</hi> To the <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> them that kept their Easter, as the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> did, and them that fasted upon any Saturday, or Sunday, except one he counts as those that had slain the <hi>Lord.</hi> To those of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> he salutes the Sub-Deacons, Chaunters, Porters, and Exorcists, as if these had bin Orders of the Church in his time: those other Epistles lesse que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd are yet so interlarded with Corruptions, as may justly indue us with a wholsome suspition of the rest. As to the <hi>Trallians</hi> he writes that <hi>a Bishop hath power over all beyond all government, and autority whatsoever.</hi> Surely then no Pope can desire more then <hi>Ignatius</hi> attributes to every Bishop, but what will become then of the Archbishops and Primates if every Bishop in <hi>Ignatius</hi> judgement be as supreme as a Pope? To the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> neare the very place from whence they fetch their proof for Episcopacy, there stands a line that casts an ill hue upon all the

Epistle, <hi>Let no man erre,</hi> saith he, unlesse a man be within the rays, or enclosure of the Altar, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the bread of life. I say not but this may be stretch'd to a figurative construction, but yet it has an ill look, especially being follow'd beneath with the mention of I know not what sacrifices.

What can our Church make of these phrases but scandalous: and but a little further he plainly falls to contradict the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Salomon,</hi> Judge by the words themselvs. My Son, saith he, honour <hi>God</hi> &amp; the King; but I say, honour <hi>God</hi> and the Bishop as High-priest, bearing the image of <hi>God</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ruling, and of <hi>Christ,</hi> according to his Priesting, and after him honour the King. Excellent <hi>Ignatius!</hi> can ye blame the <hi>Prelates</hi> for making much of this Epistle? Certainly if this Epistle can serve you to set a Bishop above a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> it may serve you next to set him above a King. These, and other like places in abundance through all those short E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles must either be adulterat, or else <hi>Ignatius</hi> was not <hi>Ignatius,</hi> nor a Martyr, but most adulterate, and corrupt himselfe.

and interrupted as it is, except they think that where they meet with any thing found, and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxal, there they find <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him not for his own authority, but for a truths sake, which they derive from els where: to what end then should they cite him as authentick for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie, when they cannot know what is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick in him, but by the judgement which they brought with them, &amp; not by any <hi>judgement</hi> which they might safely learne from him. How can they bring satisfaction fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such an Author, to whose very essence the Reader must be fain to contribute his own understanding.

               <hi>Ignatius,</hi> doubtles he would not have so ill provided for our knowledge, as to send him to our hands in this broken and disjoynted plight; and if he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no such thing, we doe injuriously in thinking to tast better the pure Euangelick Manna by season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our mouths with the tainted scraps, and frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an unknown table; and searching among the verminous, and polluted rags dropt overworn from the toyling shoulders of Time, with these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formedly to quilt, and interlace the intire, the spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and undecaying robe of Truth, the daughter not of Time, but of Heaven, only bred up heer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in Christian hearts, between two grave &amp; holy nurses the Doctrine, and Discipline of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Next follows <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lions,</hi> who is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">page 8,</note> to affirm <hi>that Polycarpus was made Bishop of Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na by the Apostles:</hi> and this it may seem, none could better tell then he who had both seen and heard <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarpus:</hi> but when did he heare him? himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to <hi>Florinus,</hi> when he was a Boy. Whether

that age in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> may not be liable to many mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; and whether a Boy may be trusted to take an exact account of the manner of a Church constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and upon what terms, and within what limits, and with what kind of Commission <hi>Polycarpus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd his charge, let a man consider, ere he be <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. It will not be deny'd that he might have seen <hi>Polycarpus</hi> in his youth a man of great eminence in the Church, to whom the other <hi>Presbyters</hi> might give way for his <hi>vertue, wisdome,</hi> and the reverence of his age and so did <hi>Amcetus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> even in his own City, give him a kind of priority inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Sacrament; as may be read in <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> but that we should hence conclude a distinct, and superior order from the young observation of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> nothing yet alledg'd can warrant us, unlesse we shall beleeve such as would face us down, that <hi>Calvin,</hi> and after him <hi>Beza</hi> were Bishops of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> because that in the unsetl'd state of the Church, while things were not fully compos'd, their worth, and learning cast a greater share of businesse upon them, and directed mens eyes principally towards them, and yet these men were the dissolvers of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie. We see the same necessity in state affaires <hi>Brutns</hi> that expell'd the Kings out of <hi>Rome,</hi> was for the time forc't to be as it were a King himself, till matters were set in order, as in a free Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. He that had seen <hi>Pericles</hi> lead the Athenians which way he listed, haply would have said he had bin their Prince, and yet he was but a powerfull and eloquent man in a Democratie, and had no more at any time then a Temporary, and elective sway, which was in the will of the people when to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93535:8"/>
And it is most likely that in the Church they which came after these Apostolick men being lesse in merit, but bigger in ambition, strove to invade those priviledges by intrusion and plea of right, which <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and others like him possest from the voluntary surrender of men subdu'd by the excellencie of their heavenly gifts, which because their Successors had not, and so could neither have that autority, it was their policy to divulge that the eminence which <hi>Polycarpus</hi> and his equalls enjoy'd, was by right of constitution, not by free wil of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discending. And yet thus farre <hi>Irenaeus</hi> makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them as in that very place to call <hi>Polycarpus</hi> an Apostolicall <hi>Presbyter.</hi> But what fidelity his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had in generall, we cannot sooner learn then by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who neer the end of his third Book, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Papias</hi> a very ancient writer, one that had heard St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and was known to many that had seen, and bin acquainted with others of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but being of a shallow wit, and not understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those traditions which he receiv'd, fill'd his writings with many new doctrines, and fabulous conceits, he tells us there, that divers Ecclesiasticall men, and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> among the rest, while they lookt at his antiquity, became infected with his errors. Now if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> were so rash as to take unexamin'd opinions from an Author of so small capacity, when he was a man, we should be more rash our selves to rely upon those observations which he made when he was a Boy. And this may be a sufficient reason to us why we need no longer muse at the spreading of many idle traditions so soon after the Apostles, whilst such as this <hi>Papias</hi> had the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them about, and the inconsiderate zeal of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93535:9"/>
next age, that heeded more the person, then the Doctrine, had the gathering them up. Where ever a man, who had bin any away conversant with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> was to be found, thether slew all the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive eares, the exercise of right instructing was chang'd into the curiosity of impertinent fabling: where the mind was to be edified with solid <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> there the fancy was sooth'd with solemne stories: with lesse fervency was studied what Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had written then was listen'd to one that could say here hee taught, here he stood, this was his stature, and thus he went habited, and O happy this house that harbour'd him, and that cold stone whereon he rested, this Village where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he wrought such a miracle, and that pavement bedew'd with the warme effusion of his last blood, that sprouted up into eternall Roses to crowne his Martyrdome. Thus while all their thoughts were powr'd out upon circumstances, and the gazing after such men as had sate at table with the <hi>Apostles</hi> (many of which <hi>Christ</hi> hath profest, yea thoughthey had cast out Divells in his name, he will not know at the last day) by this meanes they lost their time, and truanted in the fundamentall grounds of saving knowledge, as was seene shortly by their writings. Lastly for <hi>Ireneus,</hi> wee have cause to thinke him lesse judicious in his reports from hand to hand of what the <hi>Apostles</hi> did, when we find him so neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in keeping the <hi>faith</hi> which they writ, as to say in his third Booke against Heresies, that the obedience of <hi>Mary</hi> was the cause of salvation to her selfe, and all mankind, and in his fift Booke, that as <hi>Eve</hi> was seduc't to fly <hi>God,</hi> so the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was perswaded to obey <hi>God,</hi> that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93535:9"/>
               <hi>Mary</hi> might be made the Advocate of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Eve.</hi> Thus if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> for his neerenesse to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> must be the Patron of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to us, it is no marvell though he be the Patron of Idolatry to the Papist, for the same cause. To the Epistle of those brethren of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> that write the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and stile him an Apostolicall, and propheticall Doctor, and Bishop of the Church in <hi>Smirna,</hi> I could be content to give some credit for the great honour, and affection which I see those brethren beare him, and not undeservedly if it be true which they there say that he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and had a voyce from Heaven to comfort him at his death, which they could heare, but the rest could not for the noise, and tumult that was in the place, and besides if his body were so preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Christians, that hee was never wont to pull off his shooes for one or other that still strove to have the office, that they might come to touch his feet, yet a light scruple or two I would gladly be resolv'd in; if <hi>Polycarpus</hi> (who, as they say, was a <hi>Prophet</hi> that never faild in what he foretold) had declar'd to his friends, that he knew by vision, hee should die no other death then burning, how it came to passe that the fire when it came to proofe, would not doe his worke, but starting off like a full saile from the mast, did but reflect a golden light upon his unviolated limbes exhaling such a sweet odour, as if all the incense of <hi>Arabia</hi> had bin burning, in so much that when the bill-men saw that the fire was overaw'd, and could not doe the deed, one of them steps to him, and stabs him with a sword, at which wound such abundance of bloud gusht forth as quencht the fire. By all this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93535:10"/>
it appeares not, how the fire was guilty of his death, and then how can his prophesie bee fulfill'd? Next how the standers by could be so soone weary of such a glorious sight, and such a fragrant smell, as to hasten the executioner to put out the fire with the Martyrs blood, unlesse perhaps they thought, as in all perfumes, that the Smoake would bee more odorous then the flame? Yet these good brethren say he was Bishop of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> No man questions it, if Bishop, and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were anciently all one, and how does it appeare by any thing in this testimony that they were not? If among his other high titles of propheticall, Apostolicall, and most admired of those times, he bee also stil'd Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the Church of <hi>Smirna</hi> in a kind of speech, which the Rhetoricians call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence sake, as being the most famous of all the <hi>Smyrnian Presbyters,</hi> it cannot bee prov'd neither from this nor that other place of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that hee was therefore in distinct, and monarchicall order above the other <hi>Presbyters,</hi> it is more probable, that if the whole <hi>Presbytery</hi> had beene as renowned as he, they would have term'd every one of them severally Bishop of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Hence it is that wee read sometimes of two Bishops in one place, and had all the <hi>Presbyters</hi> there beene of like worth, we might perhaps have read of twenty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> accosts us next (for <hi>Polycrates</hi> hath had his answer) whose testimony, state but the question right, is of no more force to deduce <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> then the two former. He saies that the Church of <hi>Smirna</hi> had <hi>Polycarpus</hi> plac't there by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome Clement</hi> ordain'd by <hi>Peter,</hi> and so the rest of the Churches did shew, what Bishops they had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93535:10"/>
receiv'd by the appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> None of this will be contradicted, for we have it out of the Scripture that Bishops or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which were the same, were left by the <hi>Apostles</hi> in every Church, and they might perhaps give some speciall charge to <hi>Clement,</hi> or <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> or <hi>Linus,</hi> and put some speciall trust in them for the experience they had of their faith, and constancy; it remaines yet to be evinc't out of this and the like places, which will never be, that the word Bishop is otherwise taken, then in the language of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Acts,</hi> for an order above <hi>Presbyters.</hi> We grant them Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, we grant them worthy men, we grant them plac't in severall Churches by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> we grant that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Tertul:</hi> affirme this, but that they were plac't in a superiour Order above the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> shew from all these words why we should grant. 'Tis not enough to say the <hi>Ap:</hi> left this man Bishop in <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; that other in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but to shew when they alterd their owne decree set downe by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and made all the <hi>Presbyters</hi> underlings to one Bishop. But suppose <hi>Tertullian</hi> had made an impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity where none was originally, should hee move us, that goes about to prove an imparity betweene <hi>God</hi> the Father, and <hi>God</hi> the Sonne, as these words import in his Booke against <hi>Praxeas.</hi> The Father is the whole substance, but the Son a derivation, and portion of the whole, as he himselfe professes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Father is greater then me. Beleeve him now for a faithfull relater of tradition, whom you see such an unfaithfull expounder of the Scripture. besides in his time all allowable tradition was now lost. For this same Author whom you bring to testifie the ordination of <hi>Clement</hi> to the Bishoprick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93535:11"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Peter,</hi> test fies also in the beginning of his treatise concerning Chastity, that the Bishop of Rome did then use to send forth his edicts by the name of <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Episcopus Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum</hi> chief Priest, and Bishop of Bishops. For shame then doe not urge that authority to keepe up a Bishop, that will necessarily ingage you to set up a <hi>Pope.</hi> As little can your advantage bee from <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesippus</hi> an Historian of the same time not extant, but cited by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> his words are, that in every City all things so stood in his time as the Law, and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and our Lord did preach. If they stood so, then stood not Bishops above <hi>Presbyters,</hi> for what our Lord, and his Disciples taught, <hi>God</hi> be thanked, we have no need to goe learne of him: and you may as well hope to perswade us out of the same Author, that <hi>James</hi> the brother of our Lord was a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> and that to him only it was lawfull to enter into the holy of Holies, that his food was not upon any thing that had life, fish, or flesh, that he us'd no wollen garments, but onely linnen, and so as he trifles on.</p>
            <p>If therefore the tradition of the Church were now grown so ridiculous, &amp; disconsenting from the Doctrine of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> even in those points which were of lest moment to mens particular ends, how well may we be assur'd it was much more degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in point of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and precedency, things which could affor'd such plausible pretenses, such commodious traverses for ambition, and Avarice to lvrke behind.</p>
            <p>As for those <hi>Brittaine</hi> Bishops which you cite, <note place="margin">p. 13.</note> take heed what you doe, for our <hi>Brittaine</hi> Bishops lesse ancient then these, were remarkable for nothing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93535:11"/>
more then their poverty, as <hi>Sulp Severus,</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> can remember you of examples good store.</p>
            <p>Lastly (for the fabulous <hi>Metaphrastes</hi> is not <note place="margin">p. 16.</note> worth an answer) that authority of <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi> is not to be found in all his workes, and wherever it be extant, it is in controversie, whether it be <hi>Clements</hi> or no; or if it were it sayes onely that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in some places constituted Bishops: questionlesse he did, but where does <hi>Clement</hi> say he set them above <hi>Presbyters?</hi> no man will gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say the constitution of <hi>Bishops,</hi> but the raising them to a superiour, and distinct order above <hi>Presbyters,</hi> seeing the Gospell makes them one and the same thing, a thousand such allegations as these will not give Prelaticall <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> one Chapell of ease above a Parish Church. And thus much for this cloud I cannot say rather then petty-fog of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, with which Episcopall men would cast a mist before us, to deduce their exalted <hi>Episcopacy</hi> from Apostolick times. Now although, as all men well know, it be the wonted shift of errour, and fond Opinion, when they find themselves outlaw'd by the Bible, and forsaken of sound reason, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them with all speed to their old starting hole of tradition, and that wild, and overgrowne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of antiquity thinking to farme there at large roome, and find good stabling, yet thus much their owne dêify'de antiquity betrayes them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme us that Tradition hath had very seldome or never the gift of perswasion; as that which Church Histories report of those <hi>East,</hi> and <hi>Western Paschalists</hi> formerly spoken of will declare, who would have thought that <hi>Polycarpus</hi> on the one side could have err'd in what he saw Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doe,

So when those pious Greek <hi>Emperours</hi> began, as <hi>Cedrenus</hi> relates, to put downe Monks, and abolish Images, the old Idolaters finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves blasted, and driven back by the prevailing light of the Scripture, sent out their sturdy <hi>Monks</hi> call'd the <hi>Abramites,</hi> to alledge for images the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and this our objected <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naus,</hi> nay they were so high flowne in their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that they undertooke to bring the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> yea <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, from certaine records that were then current, to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize their Idolatry, yet for all this the worthy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Theophilus,</hi> even in those darke times chose rather to nourish himselfe, and his people with the sincere milke of the Gospell, then to drinke from the mixt confluence of so many corrupt, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous waters, as tradition would have perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to by most ancient seeming authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: In like manner all the reformed Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad

unthroning <hi>Episcopacy</hi> doubtlesse were not ignorant of these testimonies alledg'd to draw it in a line from the <hi>Apostles</hi> dayes, for surely the Author will not thinke he hath brought us now any new authorities, or considerations into the world, which the Reformers in other places were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd of, and yet we see, the intercession of all these Apostolick Fathers could not prevaile with them to alter their resolved decree of reducing into Order their usurping, and over provender'd <hi>Episcopants:</hi> and <hi>God</hi> hath blest their worke this hunder'd yeares, with a prosperous and stedfast, and still happy successe. And this may serve to prove the insufficiency of these present <hi>Episcopall</hi> Testimonies not only in themselves, but in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of those ever that have beene the followers of truth. It will next behoove us to consider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience we fall into, by using our selves to bee guided by these kind of Testimonies. He that thinks it the part of a well learned man, to have read dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the ancient stories of the Church, and to be no stranger in the volumes of the Fathers shall have all judicious men consenting with him; not hereby to controule, and new fangle the Scripture, <hi>God</hi> forbid, but to marke how corruption, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy</hi> crept in by degrees, and to gather up, where ever wee find the remaining sparks of Originall truth, wherewith to stop the mouthes of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, and to bridle them with their own curb, who willingly passe by that which is Orthodoxall in them, and studiously cull out that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious, and best for their turnes, not weighing the Fathers in the ballance of Scripture, but Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the ballance of the Fathers, if wee therefore
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93535:13"/>
making first the Gospell our rule, and Oracle shall take the good which wee light on in the Fathers, and set it to oppose the evill which other men seek from them, in this way of Skirmish wee shall easily master all superstition, and false doctrine; but if we turne this our discreet, and wary usage of them into a blind devotion towards them, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we find written by them, wee both forsake our owne grounds, and reasons which led us at first to part from <hi>Rome,</hi> that is to hold to the Scriptures against all antiquity; wee remove our cause into our adversaries owne Court, and take up there those cast principles which will soone cause us to soder up with them againe, in as much as beleeving antiquity for it self in any one point, we bring an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement upon our selves of assenting to all that it charges upon us. For suppose we should now negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that which is cleare in Scripture, that a Bishop and <hi>Presbyter</hi> is all one both in name, and office, and that what was done by <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> executing an extraordinary place, as fellow labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and of a universall charge in planting Christianity through divers regions, cannot be drawne into particular, and dayly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, suppose that neglecting this cleerenesse of the text, we should by the uncertaine, and corrupted writings of succeeding times, determine that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are different, because we dare not deny what <hi>Ignatius</hi> or rather the <hi>Perkin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi> sayes, then must we bee constrain'd to take upon our selves a thousand superstitions, and falsities which the Papist will prove us downe in from as good authorities, and as ancient, as these that set a Bishop above a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> And the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93535:13"/>
plaine truth is that when any of our men of those that are wedded to antiquity come to dispute with a Papist, and leaving the Scriptures put themselves without appeale to the sentence of <hi>Synods,</hi> and Councells, using in the cause of <hi>Sion</hi> the hir'd sould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jary of revolted <hi>Israel,</hi> where they give the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi> one buff<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, they receive two counterbuffs. Were it therefore but in this regard, every true Bishop should be afraid to conquer in his cause by such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities as these, which if we admit for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities sake, we open a broad passage for a multitude of Doctrines that have no ground in Scripture, to break in upon us.</p>
            <p>Lastly I doe not know, it being undeniable that there are but two Ecclesiasticall Orders, Bishops, and Deacons mention'd in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> how it can be lesse then impiery to make a demurre at that, which is there so perspicuous, confronting, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelling the sacred verity of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> with the offalls, and sweepings of antiquity that met as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally and absurdly, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> his atoms to patch up a Leucippean <hi>Ignatius,</hi> enclining ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make this phantasme an expounder, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a depraver of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> an examiner, and discoverer of this impostorship, nor caring how slightly they put off the verdit of holy Text unsalv'd, that sayes plainely there bee but two orders, so they maintaine the reputation of their imaginary Doctor that proclaimes three: certainly if <hi>Christs</hi> Apostle have set downe but two, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne words, though hee himselfe should unsay it, and not onely the Angell of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> but an Angell from Heaven should beare us downe that there bee three, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> has doom'd him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93535:14"/>
twise, let him be accur'st, for <hi>Christ</hi> hath pronounc't that no tittle of his word shall fall to the ground, and if one jot be alterable it is as possible that all should perish; And this shall bee our <hi>righteousnes,</hi> our ample warrant, and strong assurance both now, and at the last day never to be asham'd of, against all the heaped names of Angells, and Martyrs, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and Fathers urg'd upon us, if we have given our selves up to be taught by the pure, and living precept of <hi>Gods</hi> word onely, which without more additions, nay with a forbidding of them hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it selfe the promise of eternall life, the end of all our wearisome labours, and all our sustaining hopes. But if any shall strive to set up his <hi>Ephod,</hi> and <hi>Teraphim</hi> of Antiquity against the brightnesse, and perfection of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> let him feare lest he and his <hi>Baal</hi> be turn'd into <hi>Bosheth.</hi> And thus much may suffice to shew that the pretended <hi>Episcopacy</hi> cannot be deduc't from the <hi>Apostolicall</hi> TIMES.</p>
