            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THe decree of Election, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination unto salvation is the effectuall will of God, by which according to his good pleasure, for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10635:4"/>
demonstration of his mercy, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the salvation of man being fallen; and prepared for him such meanes, by which he would effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and vnfallibly bring the Elect to the selfe same end.</p>
               </argument>
               <head>THE EXPOSITION AND CONFIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATION OF THE POSITION.</head>
               <p>WE call this Decree of Election an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall will of God, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects not meerely and onely a way set downe and leading to life, leaving man so ordained in the power of his owne free will, (after such manner as <hi>Adam</hi> was ordained to happinesse) but it doth respect and fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the very issue of this Ordinance. For this will is conjoyned with the power of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Esa.</hi> 14.24. <hi>The Lord of hosts hath sworne, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to passe, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand. Psal.</hi> 113. <hi>Whatsoever the Lord would, that did hee in heaven and in earth:</hi> (upon which place see St. <hi>Austin, Enchirid. c.</hi> 75.) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom hee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10635:4"/>
hath predestinated, those he glorified. Iohn</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the Fathers will that sent mee, that of all, which he hath given me, I should lose nothing.</hi> And vers. 37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me shall come unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We acknowledge no other moving cause of this will, besides the meere good pleasure of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy. Ephes.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Being predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the purpose of him, who worketh all things according to the counsell of his owne will. Rom.</hi> 9.11 <hi>Before the children were borne, when they had done neither good nor evill; that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God according to Election might stand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But God doth deale with certaine men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this especiall manner for manifestation of his owne mercy. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. <hi>That God might make knowne the riches of his glory toward the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of mercy.</hi> Yea and to them considered in the state of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, namely for the freeing them out of the masse of perdition. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>In him</hi> [to with Christ] <hi>he hath chosen vs.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Christ came to save sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, lest Gods working in time should vary from his eternall purpose, hee who did
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10635:5"/>
effectually destinate the elect unto salvation, doth also afford them meanes agreeable to this foresaid intention; that is to say, those meanes, which God knew would without faile bring them to salvation. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Hee hath saved us with an holy calling.</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God hath chosen you unto salvation in the sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and beleefe of the truth, to which he hath also called you by our Gospell.

               </p>
               <p>Out of which testimonies of Scripture it is evident, that God by his foregoing decree of Election hath subordained all these things (to wit, the knowledge of the Gospell, Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Faith, Iustification, Sanctification, and Perseverance) for the obtaining of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined salvation.</p>

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:10635:8"/>TRue indeed, this is Gods decree declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of salvation to be proclaimed to all equally and without difference; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so prescribing the manner by which the elect are to be brought to salvation.

                  <argument>
                     <p>THat the peremptory Election of particular persons is made upon the fore sight and consideration of their faith in Christ, and of their perseverance in the same faith, as upon a Condition fore-required in electing.</p>

                  <p>FAith foreseene, and perseverance in faith doe follow the decree of vocation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods good purpose.

                  <p n="1">1. God foresees no man as persevering in faith and holinesse unto the last gasp, but him, whom he decreed by his foregoing will so to keepe, but him, whom he really guideth and directeth through his whole course of life, and preserveth in the way of salvation by an

                  <p>Since therefore perseverance in faith is grounded upon the Election of God, Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot proceed from the fore-required condition of persevering faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Furthermore, the decree of giving glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and salvation vnto stedfast beleevers in the end of this life, as the reward of faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience performed, is an act of Iustice, or at least of faithfulnesse and truth.

that is to say, God may be sayd as well to haue elected holy men for the condition of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as beleeuers for the condition of faith.

                  <argument>
                     <p>THat Election to salvation is not one and the same, but that there is one indefinite, another definite; and this either incomplete, revocable, changeable: Or complete, irrevocable unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALthough there are divers acts of Gods Election, which may bee assigned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to divers objects, namely, of the end, and of the meanes; yet the Scripture no where makes mention either of the divers degrees or kindes of Election.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For Election is a certaine infallible or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of severall persons to salvation, in the minde and will of God. Therefore this inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Election (here supposed) is no true elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because it ordaines no singular person to salvation, but it onely shewes and prescribes the manner of comming to salvation promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously to all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Besides, seeing Election is perfited with one act, and <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it selfe, is as the Schoolemen speake, in the number of those things which doe not grow and increase by degrees, (as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10635:12"/>
sanctification, mortification, and such like) but which doe consist <hi>in indivisibili,</hi> without latitude, (such as justification or absolution from sinnes) surely it cannot bee imagined to be capable of intention or remission, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by no meanes doth it admit a graduall perfection, that it may be thought to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete, or unfinished to day, and complete or fully finished to morrow: Much lesse can this maimed halfe-election be accompted ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which doth not ordaine to salvation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly, but disposes onely by some qualitie or contingent act, which in the judgement of the very devisers thereof, hath no necessarie connexion with eternall life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Lastly, that which is said to bee revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and changeable, cannot be true election, because election signifies the constant purpose and unchangeable counsell of God ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the elect unto blisse. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>FIliall adoption is the proper, naturall, and unseparable fruit of Election, and is to be perceived by the Elect in this life, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption revealing it to their hearts. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Because ye are sonnes, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts, crying Abba Father. If a son, then an heire of God. Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16 <hi>Ye have received the spirit of adoption, wherby we cry Abba Father. The Spirit it selfe beareth witnes with our spirit that we are the children of God.

the earnest of our inheritance, which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible signe, that we shall never be dis-inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, but shall at length obtaine our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. <hi>We glory in the hope of the glory of God.</hi> And v. 5. <hi>This hope maketh us not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> Neither is there any falshood in this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid peace of conscience, in the glorying of the godly, or in this infused hope, because these gifts are both sent by God to the elect; and to this end are they fastened in their mindes, that they may be certaine arguments of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable election.</p>
                  <p>We confesse, our election is not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us <hi>à priori,</hi> by the causes: but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effects of it may be knowne.

                  <p>We likewise grant that the assurance of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the children of God themselves, is not alwayes so constant and continuall, but that oftentimes it is shaken with temptations, and for a time suppressed, so that not onely the degree of assurance is lessened, but even elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it selfe, in respect of the sense and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the Elect, seemes uncertaine, and ready to vanish.</p>

That there is no election of Infants, that is to say, of infants one before another, as if al were promiscuously saved; neither truely hath that supposition any good ground; nor this being granted, will the foresaid position follow.

               </argument>
               <p>IN this oblation of Christ we consider two things: the manner of calling of men to the actuall participation of this sacrifice, and the benefit divers wayes redounding unto men by the same sacrifice.</p>
               <p>As for the manner, there is no mortall man, who cannot truly and seriously bee called by the Ministers of the Gospell to the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of remission of sinnes, and eternall life by this death of Christ. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33.39. <hi>Bee it knowne unto you that remission of sinnes is preached by Christ.

               <p>Now it pleaseth God even after the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this sacrifice, no otherwise to bestow actually upon any man remission of sinnes and eternall life, then by faith in the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. And here that same eternall and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret decree of Election shewes it selfe, in as much as that price was paid for all, and will certainly promote all beleevers unto eternall life, yet is not beneficiall unto all; because all have not the gift of fulfilling this condition of the gracious covenant. Christ therefore so dyed for all, that all and every one by the meanes of faith might obtaine remission of sins, and eternall life by vertue of that ransome paid once for all mankinde. But Christ so dyed for the elect, that by the merit of his death in speciall manner destinated unto them

               <head>THE FIFTH POSITION.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>IN the Church, wherein accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promise of the Gospel salvation is offered to all, there is such an administration of grace, as is sufficient to convince all impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and unbeleevers, that by their owne voluntary default, either through neglect or contempt of the Gospell, they perish, and come short of the benefit offered unto them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>CHrist by his death not onely established the euangelicall covenant, but moreover obtained of his Father, that wheresoever this Covenant should bee published, there also, together with it, ordinarily such a measure of supernaturall grace should bee dispensed, as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10635:28"/>
may suffice to convince all impenitents and unbeleevers of contempt, or at least of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, in that the condition was not fulfilled by them.</p>
               <p>Here two things are briefly to bee explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Whereof the first we put downe for a supposition: That some measure of grace is ordinarily offered by the Ministerie of the Gospell.</p>
               <p>The second for a position: That that grace is sufficient to convince all impenitents and incredulous persons, either of contempt, or at least of neglect.</p>
               <p>The first is plaine out of the Scriptures. <hi>Esay</hi> 59. and the last verse. <hi>This is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: My Spirit that is upon thee, and my word, which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth from henceforth, and for ever.</hi> Hence it is evident that the word and the Spirit are inseparably joyned together by the promise of God in the Ministery of the word.</p>
               <p>Hence the Ministers of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are called the Ministers, <hi>not of the letter, but of the spirit,</hi> not of the <hi>killing letter; but of the

                  </gap>, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>The word of reconciliation.</hi> And our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.9.11. when he sent the 70. Disciples to preach the Gospell, commanded them, that they should say to the people, to whom they preached it, <hi>The kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is come neare unto them.</hi> Because that some supernaturall grace is offered unto them, to whom the Gospell is preached.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not well said,</hi>

                  <hi>that all those are not called to grace, to all whom the Gospell is preached, although there may be some, who obey not the Gospell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is proved out of the 15 of <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. <hi>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sinne, but now have they no cloake for their sinne.</hi> Out of this place it is certaine, that Christ in propounding the Gospell, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dispence that internall grace, which so far forth sufficed, that in that they accepted not, or rejected the Gospell, they might bee justly taxed of positive infidelity. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10635:29"/>
condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darknesse rather then light.</hi> So are men justly damned, because they turne away from the light of the Gospell. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?</hi> For the neglect of salvation offered in the Gospell, we are subject to just punishment: therefore sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is offered in the Gospell.</p>
               <p>Heb. 4.12. <hi>The Word of God is quicke and powerfull, and sharper then any two edged sword, piercing even to dividing asunder of soule and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> Hence it comes to be manifest that there is such power and efficacie of the word, that it insinuates it selfe even into the secretest closets of the soule, and as it doth without faile quicken those which truely beleeve; so it doth truely inflict a deadly wound upon the stubborne.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Scripture threatneth most bitter punishments to those, who doe not receive; who neglect, who despise, the preaching of the Gospell. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Whosoever shall not heare your words, It shall be easier for Sodom. Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>It is impossible for those, who were once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened

And so by this stopping or delaying of the Gospel, many were so foreslowen, or hindred, that they dyed without the knowledge of the truth, and without sanctifying regeneration. Let the Scripture speak what was done. But passing through Phrygia, and the Region of Galatia, they are forbidden by the holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, but after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to goe into Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, but the spirit suffered them not</hi>; Thus farre <hi>Prosper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Moreover, it is plainly evident (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10635:30"/>
this universal Covenant, which was of force even in the old Testament) that God revealed not the knowledge hereof unto the Gentiles, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.8.19.20. <hi>Hee sheweth his word unto Iacob, he hath not dealt so with any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore they knew not these lawes. Acts</hi> 14.16. <hi>God in times past suffered all Nations to walke in their owne wayes.</hi> Yea and in our daies scarce the sixt part of the habitable world have given their names to Christ. But if in fact and event God hath never vouchsafed the preaching of the Gospel to all and every one, certainly then hee is not bound so to afford it. For he doth, whatsoever he hath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to doe.</p>
               <p>The same also is to be said of saving grace. We no where in the Scriptures meet with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mention of any promise, by which God hath bound himselfe to impart this grace to all and every one. Nay rather the Scripture makes mention of Gods liberty in commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>God hath mercy on whom hee will have mercy,</hi> notwithstanding this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant grounded in the blood of Christ.

                  <p>THE grace of God is not wont to bring men to the state of justification (in which we have peace with God through our Lord Iesus Christ) by a sudden Enthusiasme, or rapture, but by divers degrees of foregoing actions taming and preparing them through the Ministery of the word.</p>

                  <p>BY the nature of the benefit offered, and by the evident word of God we must judge of those helpes of grace, which are bestowed upon men, and not by the abuse, or the event. Therefore when the Gospell of its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls men to repentance, and salvation, when the incitements of divine grace tend the

same way, we must not suppose any thing is done fainedly by God. This is proved by those earnest and patheticall intreaties, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>We pray you in Christs stead be ye reconciled vnto God.</hi> Those exhortations, 2 Cor. 6.1. <hi>Wee beseech you that you receive not the grace of God in vaine:</hi> those expostulations, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>I marvell that you are so soone removed from him, that called you to the grace of Christ:</hi> those promises, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold I stand at the doore and knocke; if any man heare my voice and open the doore, I will come in to him.</hi>

                  <p>But if God should not seriously invite all, whom he vouchsafes this gift of his word and Spirit, to a serious conversion, surely both God should deceive many, whom he calls in his Sonnes name, and the messengers of the Euangelicall promises might bee accused of false witnesse, and those, who being called to conversion doe neglect to obey, might bee more excusable.

So the Scripture speaketh in divers places. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.66. <hi>The Father giveth us power to come unto the Sonne,</hi> that is, to beleeve. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>To you it is given to beleeve,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But if God by infusing some strength into us should only give us a possibility or power of beleeving, a possibility or power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, and so leave the act to the free will of men; surely we should all doe as our first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, by our free will we should fall from God, neither should we ever bring this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility into act. This therefore is that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent special grace granted to the elect in Christ, wherby they not only can beleeve if they will, but also will beleeve then when they can. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God worketh in us the will and the deed.</hi> This working grace the Fathers of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church have maintained against the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians. <hi>God commands a man to wil,</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>THat the will is not capable of spirituall gifts; and that therefore there never were any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts in the will of man before his fall; that these graces were never severed from the will of man upon his fall, and that such graces are never infused in regeneration into the wills of men.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe holy Scripture, in placing Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts in the heart, acknowledgeth also them to be in the will. As namely
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10635:49"/>
uprightnesse or truth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.12. <hi>Rejoyce all yee that are true in heart:</hi> puritie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart:</hi> goodnes, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. <hi>They are those, which with an honest and good heart heare the word of God and keepe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 But if any man shall referre these graces to the affections, and place them without the will, he shall (which were a foule enormity) settle the chiefest gifts of divine grace in the unreasonable part of the soule. Moreover, the very habituall conversio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the will unto God the Creator, &amp; the aversion or turning away thereof from the inordinate desire it had to commit fornication with the creature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt is to be counted a chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal gift. And that the will was capable of this gift, it doth hence plainly appeare, because it was created with such uprightnesse. For God in the beginning made man righteous. But that this righteousnes is lost, it is over manifest by the effects, seeing that now the will being carnall, cannot choose but injoy and rest in those things which it ought onely to make use of, and use the things which it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to injoy: forasmuch as a whole trope of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10635:49"/>
sinfull dispositions have rushed and broke in upon the will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Furthermore, as the will of a meere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, is said to be vicious fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a certaine inbred &amp; inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wickednes, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in a wicked man even the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he doth nothing, is habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, so againe we must acknowledge that in the will of the regenerate there is a certaine righteousnesse, infused and given from God, which is presupposed in their religious actions</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But lest any man should dreame that this goodnesse of the will is not an inward gift infused into that very faculty, but onely a bare denomination fetched from the act of the will;<note place="margin">

                  <head>THE SECOND ERRONEOVS OPINION.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>THat that grace, by which wee are converted is onely a gentle and moral swasion or induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WEE deny not, but in the worke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, whether in fitting us for that future grace, or in confirming us therein, as already performed, God useth the perswasive force of his threats, promises &amp; exhortations, by which he allureth, stirreth, and ploweth up the fallowes of mens hearts. But moreover, for adding without faile the last close to this operation, hee works more powerfully and unconquerably, <hi>according to the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his power, and the working of his might, Ephes.</hi> 1.19. Neither is swasion sufficient, which no more then contingently affecteth and inviteth the will.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For morall swasion, moveth onely by way of object, and so farre forth as the end propounded can allure. But the Philosophers rightly determine, that, as the inclination of any one is, accordingly hee apprehends the end; So long therefore as a man is carnall and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10635:50"/>
unregenerate, his will cannot so bee affected with supernaturall benefits proposed unto it, that by the desire of them hee should bee throughly enflamed to beleeve and convert. But the will must be overcome and changed by a powerfull operation exceeding all swasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that so it may effectually embrace the good represented unto it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 If men should be converted unto God onely by a morall swasion, then this question, why, upon profer of equall grace, one man beleeves, another doth not, might be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the free wils owne power of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or nilling, neither should we have herein any cause to admire the unsearchable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and justice of our God. But this sound doctrine hath alwaies beene defended against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 If men were converted onely by morall swasion, he which receives this swasive grace might truly say, <hi>I have separated my selfe</hi>: For I have received this gentle and swasive grace,

which hath solicited me to faith and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but no more then it solicited others: they, by the liberty of their free-will, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this morall swasion, and therefore they still remaine unconverted; but I, by the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of my free-will, have given way and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the same swasion, and therefore I am converted.

                  <head>THE THIRD ERRONEOVS OPINION.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>THat, presupposing all the operations of grace, which God useth for the effecting of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, yet the will of man is still left in an equall ballance, either to beleeve, or not to beleeve, to convert, or not to convert it selfe to God.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1 IF after all the workings of grace the will of man be left in eaven point, it will necessarily follow, that, not God by his grace, but man by his free-will, is the chiefe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10635:51"/>
cause and author of the very act of beleeving and converting. For he, who by the utmost dint and straine of his grace prevailed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to raise up a mans will to an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, or estate of equall ballance, doth not concur, as a principall and predominant, or over-ruler, but onely as an associate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently, that is, upon this condition, if so be that the will, by its owne naturall power, first shall have removed it selfe from that equalitie. That therefore which is of lesse moment, the will receives from God, namely, that it should be placed in a certaine middle estate, equally inclined to beleeve, or not to beleeve, but that, which is of greater moment, as specifying the very event, that is, actually to beleeve, this the will by its owne power hath performed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It would else follow, that God affordeth no more grace to the Elect, then to those, who are not elected, and that those owe no more thanke to God, then the other: in as much as the hand of God hath wrought in both nothing else, but an eaven stand of the will: which equally consists in a point, and is not capable of any latitude, or degree.</p>

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:10635:52"/>3 The grace of conversion is given with that intention, that it shall become effectuall, and shall not onely set a man forward on his way, but also bring him to performe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of faith, whither although such grace might perchance sometime reach by the sway of mans will, equally poised to embrace and follow the motions of grace, yet no lesse often should such grace be frustrated by reason of the same free will, likewise placed at eaven ballance, and freely thence setling it selfe to refuse grace, and to resist it. For in levell coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise there is alwaies presupposed an equal hazard of setling to either side.</p>

                  <head>THE FOVRTH ERRONEOVS OPINION.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>THat a man cannot doe any more good, then he doth, nor omit any more evill then, he doth omit.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:10635:52"/>THis is most false and absurd, whether it be spoken of an unregenerate and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, or of one that is regenerate, and supported by sanctifying grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, concerning the state of a naturall man, although hee cannot put off his inbred corruption, nor shake off the dominion of sinne in generall, yet can he represse many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, in which he lets loose the reines to his owne concupiscences. Corrupt concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence enclines a wicked man to all kinde of evill, yet it doth not determine or confine him unavoydably to commit this or that sinne in particular, as to act this murder, that robbery, that adultery.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This is manifest also in that the very lewdest men attempt their wickednesse not without some precedent deliberation, and most free contriving of the meanes tending thereto, and being ready to commit the act, they have power to hold in and restraine themselves, being awed by the reverence of some other man, or through some present feare of danger.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Lastly, punishments by the Lawes of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10635:53"/>
men should be without cause menaced, if no man could omit those crimes which he doth commit.</p>
                  <p>But as for actions which are in themselves good, certaine it is that unregenerate men doe omit many outward morall acts, which for the substance of the worke they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and for the voluntary neglect of such actions they are justly condemned. <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 42. <hi>I was an hungry, and ye gave me no meat: I was athirst, and ye gave me no drinke, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise the same is to bee avowed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those that are regenerated and truly sanctified; to wit, that although they are freed from the dominion of sinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.18. <hi>Being made the servants of righteousnesse. Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit</hi>: They can notwithstanding, and that voluntarily, step out of the strait path of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, even then also, when they doe not transgresse: In like manner then, when they fell or slipped, they were able by the helpe and power of grace, through their free (that is, freed) will, to have resisted their owne concupiscence, and to have avoided those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10635:53"/>
workes of the flesh recounted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Fornication, uncleannesse, debate, contentions, &amp;c.</hi> What man of sound judgement will say that <hi>David</hi> could not but commit adulterie, and, that being committed, that hee could not choose but by a leud and deliberate plot take away the life of him, to whom hee had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that extreame wrong? But (that we goe not far for examples) we appeale unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of all godly men. Who is hee, that daily praying unto God, <hi>Forgive us our trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> doth not also acknowledge that through the grace of God it was in his power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme divers good workes which yet hee hath omitted, and likewise to overcome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers temptations, to which he notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath yeelded. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who will not suffer you to bee tempted above that you be able, but will even give the issue with the tentation, that you may be able to beare it.</hi>

               <p>Which is of the perseverance of the Saints.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN this Article when question is made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perseverance of the Saints, it is to be understood, that wee treat of those Saints onely, which are come to the use of reason, and are justified by the Act of faith formed in them by the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; and who are supposed by the act of their owne wills to persevere in the same faith, or else to faile in their perseverance.</p>

            <p n="2">2 It is also proved by the connexion of the Articles. For in the fourth article the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi> labour to prove, that God worketh faith in men by such a power and grace, as man may resist; and consequently that God
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10635:54"/>
by a resistible power, doth keepe and preserve faith already wrought in the hearts of the faithfull; whereupon they inferre, that, that man, who once had faith, may lose the same, as further appeareth in the state of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie set downe by the <hi>Remonstrants.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Collat. ibidem. pag.</hi> 150.</note> But God doth effect and preserve faith in that manner in those onely, who are growne to ripe yeares: For as much as they onely have power freely to withstand grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> affirme, that perseverance, of which we treat here, to bee a gift offered equally to all the faithfull with this condition, namely, if they shall not bee want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themselves in the entertainment of this sufficient grace: which assertion plainly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, that this Article ought to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood concerning the perseverance of them, who are come unto ripe yeares, onely they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able through the use of their freewill, to be wanting to this sufficient grace, as those, in whose power the use of this liberty is.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> had more diligently weighed these things, they might have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne their argument taken from infants

            <p>Because in this Article two things there are which are usually questioned, the one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, who are not Elect, may ever come to the state of sanctification and justification, wherby they may be reckoned among the number of the Saints, the other, whether the Elect, who are justified and sanctified, doe at any time wholly fall off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this estate.

                  <head>THE FIRST POSITION.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>THere is a certaine supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall enlightening granted to some of them, who are not elect, by the power whereof they understand
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10635:55"/>
those things to be true, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Word of God, and yeeld an unfaigned assent unto them.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe truth of the position concerning the first part, namely the enlightening of their minds, is plainely collected out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. Where the Apostle maketh mention of such as sinned against the holy Ghost, affirming that they <hi>were enlightened,</hi> and in the 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> and 26. <hi>Vers.</hi> hee intimateth that they might wilfully sinne <hi>after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the truth.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> also, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. makes mention of some, who, when they knew the way of righteousness, neverthelesse <hi>turned from the holy commandement which was given unto them. Iudas</hi> was <hi>the sonne of perdition, Ioh.</hi> 17.12. yet he was furnished with the knowledge of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; and thereupon was sent by Christ with the other Apostles to <hi>preach the Gospell to the house of Israel, Mat.</hi> 10.7. And Christ threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the like punishments to them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the preaching of <hi>Iudas,</hi> as of <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> 9.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10635:56"/>
All those were enlightened with a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge of the truth of the Gospell. Which illumination proceeding from the holy Ghost did beget a true knowledge in the mindes of these men: out of which knowledge they, as occasion required, brought forth actions sutable to the same. Yea it may come to passe, that an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philosopher may apprehend more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and distinctly the mysteries of Christs Incarnation, and in his understanding more subtilly discern the unity of the person and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of natures, then an unlearned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the unfained assent which may be, and often is, yeelded to the Gospel by some, who are not elected, there is the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. The seed which fell upon the stony ground noteth to us such hearers, as <hi>for a while beleeve,</hi> that is, those which give as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to things revealed from above;<note place="margin">See <hi>Calvin</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place.</note> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the covenant of the Gospell. And thereby it is plaine, that this their assent was no way fained, because they received the word with joy. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.30. Even <hi>Symon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:10635:56"/>

For it is not to be imputed for a fault to any man, that hee is falne from an hypocriticall faith, neither can shipwracke be made of a fained faith, but onely a detection and manifestation of it. Nor indeed can hee suffer shipwracke who never was in the ship, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. Some are said to have <hi>escaped from the filthines of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord, whose latter end is worse then their beginning.</hi> This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth intimate, not a bare apprehension, but withall an assent yeelded unto the things knowne, whence came that escape from the filthinesse of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.42.

                     <p>THey, who are not elect (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they thus far proceed) yet they never attaine unto the state of adoption and justification: and therefore by the Apostasie of these men, the Apostasie of the Saints is very erroneously concluded.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALthough they, who are not elect, being brought up &amp; cherished in the Churches bosome, are in their minds, will, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons disposed by the aforesaid preparatives ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10635:59"/>
in some sort to justification, yet are they not thereupon placed in the state of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or adoption. For they still retain through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly setled in their hearts the strings and roots of their leud desires, to which they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over, still they remaine wedded to the love of earthly things, and the hardnesse lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the secret corners of their hearts is not taken away: so that either persecution or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation arising, they retire from grace, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either intangled with the love of pleasures, and enticements of the flesh, or caried away with some other vicious affections, at length they shew that they are lovers of themselves, and lovers of pleasures, rather then lovers of God, and that they enjoy nothing lesse then God, howsoever they may flatter themselves, but indeed that <hi>they would make use of God,</hi>

                     <hi>that they may enjoy the world,</hi> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speakes. Whence it is manifest that they never really and truly attaine that change and renovation of the minde and affections, which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth justification, nay nor that which doth immediately prepare and dispose unto justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For they never seriously repent, they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10635:60"/>
are never affected with hearty sorrow, for this cause, they have offended God by sinning, nor doe they come to any humble contrition of heart, nor conceive a firme resolution not to offend any more; unto them is not given <hi>repentance unto life,</hi> which is mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.18. nor that <hi>godly sorrow which worketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to salvation never to be repented of,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. they are not <hi>poore in spirit, for theirs is the kingdome of God,</hi>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.13. To this purpose is that of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> who speaking of the reprobate, saith, <hi>God bringeth none of them to that wholesome and spirituall repentance, by which a man is reconciled to God in Christ.</hi> Adde also that such doe never feele in themselves an earnest desire of reconciliation: <hi>They doe not hunger and thirst after righteousnesse. For such shall be filled, Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>And to them shall be given of the fountaine of living water, which shall be in them a well of water springing up to eternall life. Iohn</hi> 4.14. Also they doe neither denie themselves, nor seriously bid defiance to their owne lusts, nor doe they once feele in their hearts any such <hi>accounting of all things but losse that they may winne Christ,</hi> as the Apostle did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. And to conclude,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10635:60"/>
they never attaine to that unfained lively faith which justifieth a sinner, <hi>and worketh through love,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. For this faith is the peculiar <hi>of the Elect,</hi> and is not afforded to the not elected.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, that onely the Elect are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it is plaine by that golden chaine of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called them he also justified.</hi>

                  <p>It is plaine also out of the Scriptures, that they, who are not elect, never come unto the estate of adoption; For first the estate of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is grounded upon predestination;<note place="margin">

                  <argument>
                     <p>IN the foresaid space the right to the Kingdome of God is not taken away, universall justification is not defeated, the state of adoption re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth undissolved, and by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody of the holy Spirit, the seed of regeneration, with all those funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall graces, without which the state of a regenerate man cannot stand, is preserved whole and sound.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>OVr right to the Kingdome of Heaven is not founded on our actions, but on the free gift of adoption, and on our union with Christ. And consequently the right to the Kingdome of Heaven, is not taken away, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that be first taken away, upon which it is founded:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> 
                     <hi>If Children, then heires, heires of God,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10635:68"/>
and coheires with Christ.</hi> Therefore adoption remaining, and the engrafture into Christ, the faithfull may wander out of the way, which leadeth to the Kingdome of heaven, but hee cannot be said to lose his right of inheritance to that Kingdome. For as he, which fell into a leprosie, was debarred from his own house untill hee was clensed, and yet in the meane space lost not his right to his owne house: So the adopted sonne of God taken with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie of adultery or murder, or any other grievous sinne, cannot indeed enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, unlesse he first be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from this contagion, by renewed faith and repentance; yet all this while his heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary right is not quite lost.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, that universall and most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called justification (which the Apostle so lively sets forth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25.) is not frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the enterposed guilt of a particular sinne, though heynous and grievously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the conscience. For against this justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is directly opposed, not every guilt of every sinne, but the universall unremitted guilt of all sinnes, nor the guilt of every person
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10635:68"/>
whatsoever, but the guilt of unbeleevers, not yet washed in the blood of Christ, nor the guilt of any, whatsoever degree, but such a guilt, as for which the hostile anger and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God lieth heavily upon the guiltie person. Whosoever is justified by a true faith can never afterward bee guiltie after this manner.</p>
                  <p>We may therefore say, that the effect of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is for a time suspended by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse of such a particular sin: because the person, by reason of this new guilt, needeth a particular absolution. But wee cannot say, that the state of justification is dissolved: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the same person doth not fall from the generall pardon of his forecommitted sins, nor is deprived of that speciall intercession, which our Saviour hath promised to all the faithfull, nor of the free love of God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The same case holds in adoption. For God never adopted to himselfe a Sonne in Christ, whom afterwards he either must or would dis-inherit, and cast out of his familie. The children of God may indeed sinne, and that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10635:69"/>
very grievously; but the providence and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God will not suffer them so farre to sin, as that they should thereby be bereft of their heavenly home and Father.<note place="margin">

                  <p>To conclude, the seed of regeneration, with those fundamentall gifts (without which the spirituall life cannot subsist) are preserved in safetie.

                        <hi>In respon. ad Walach. pag.</hi> 75.</note> that it may persevere, the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi> easily grant, that it is the onely grace of GOD which doth arme a man with this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10635:71"/>
strength to persevere.</p>
                  <p>Touching the stability and firmenesse, which is considered as the manner or adjunct of true faith, this also is to bee numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the gifts of God. For he which doth give the thing it selfe, to wit, faith, doth also give the manner of the thing, to wit, the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and firmenesse of the same faith, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.3. <hi>The Lord is faithfull, who shall establish you.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7.8. <hi>Yee come behinde in no gift, waiting for the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ, who shall confirme you unto the end, that ye may be blamelesse.</hi> Out of which words it is manifest, that faith is the gift of God, as well in the increase, and stability, as in the entrance, and beginning thereof.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if we desire to take out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the true formes of speaking, wee ought to call the very act of perseverance the gift of God. For if the Scripture doth not only call the quality it selfe of faith the gift of God, but doth declare,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19.</note> that <hi>to beleeve</hi> is given freely to men, then also ought we to acknowledge, as Gods gift, not onely perseverance, but also the act it selfe of persevering. This is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10635:72"/>
taught in the place alleaged, where the Apostle saith, that <hi>it was given</hi> to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not onely to beleeve in Christ, but to suffer for his sake.</hi> Which, what other thing is it, then to persevere in the faith of Christ under the Crosse of persecution.</p>

                  <p>It remaines now, that we prove this gift of perseverance to spring from the fountaine of Election; to the confirming of which we will produce one argument onely.</p>
                  <p>That, which is given out of an effectuall intention to save without faile that person, to whom it is given, that, without question, doth flow from the decree of election. For what is it else to elect one, then to ordaine him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine salvation without faile? But now such is the force and nature of this gift, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10635:72"/>
conceive, that perseverance is ordeined, or given unto any, except upon a former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention both to order and bring the same man infallibly unto salvation. For whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver benefit doth accrue unto any by any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, that wholly without doubt the Author of that grace decreed to conferre upon him, to whom hee vouchsafed to impart the same grace. But by the immoveable purpose of God whosoever shall persevere, shall bee saved. Therefore to whomsoever God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to give perseverance it is a manifest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the same man was destinated to salvation by the foregoing decree of God. To this purpose is that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. Where the <hi>impossibility of being seduced</hi> in respect of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine persons knowne to God, is grounded upon this foregoing <hi>Election of them:</hi> and that of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11.5. where the remnant of those few, which fell not from God, is said to be caused <hi>according to the election of grace:</hi> But of this see more in Saint <hi>Austine de bon. persev. cap.</hi> 16.</p>

                  <p>WEE treated before of Perseverance, in respect of the certainty of the object or thing it selfe; Now are wee to treat of it in respect of the certainty of the subject, to wit, in as much as, that thing, which is certaine in it selfe, is also by us, in whom it is brought to passe, apprehended as certaine and infallible.</p>
                  <p>We, admitting every one of the faithfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the partnership of this benefit, doe avow it to be not a priviledge afforded to a few of the faithfull, but a gift bestowed on all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as they are faithfull, without distinction.</p>
                  <p>Moreover wee say rather, that the faithfull
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10635:73"/>
may, or can have within themselves this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, then that they are alwaies actually so perswaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because this certaine perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, although it proceeds from the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith, yet doth it not alwaies, as it might and ought, put forth into action, but is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times suppressed, as wee will hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse here wee affirme, that every true faithfull man hath in readinesse at home within himselfe alwaies, and upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, such a foundation sure enough, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, if he rightly weigh his owne conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Gods promise and custody, hee may build up this actuall confidence of his owne preservation in faith unto eternall life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, it is not enough unto God, in regard of his owne glory, that he preserve us, unlesse he also ascertaine us of this his preservation. <hi>Blessed be God by whose power wee are preserved through faith unto salvation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. Now we doe not particularly blesse God for those things which wee know not to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To Christ our Saviour it was not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10635:74"/>
to pray that <hi>Peters</hi> faith might not faile, (from which prayer that gift was made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in it selfe) unlesse Saint <hi>Peter</hi> also should know it, and thereupon enjoy in himselfe the full perswasion thereof, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>I have prayed for thee Peter that thy faith faile not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is not enough for us for our comfort, that we, being wafted in the ship of the Church, goe on towards the haven of salvation, except also we be fully perswaded, that we cannot by any tempest be defeated of our wished harbor. It was not enough for <hi>Noah</hi> to bee shut up safe in the Arke, but hee was by the promise of God secured against shipwracke for the confirmation of his confidence. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.18. <hi>With thee will I establish my covenant, and thou shalt come into the Arke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 This assurance of perswasion doth flow from the very nature of speciall faith, which not onely is directly caried unto that which is promised, but also doth reflect upon it selfe, and its owne apprehension. Of the former act are meant those speeches in the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being justified by faith wee have peace with God. Iohn</hi> 10.28. <hi>My sheepe shall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:10635:74"/>
Of the latter those, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.3. <hi>Wee doe know, that we know him.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that beleeveth on the Sonne of God, hath the witnesse in himselfe.</hi> Also, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We have received the Spirit, which is of God, that wee might know the things which are given us of God.</hi> Therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie faithfull man through the inmost opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne faith beleeves the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same faith in himselfe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The same is confirmed out of the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of this faith. Spirituall joy is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest evidence. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Beleeving ye rejoyce with joy unspeakeable and full of glory.</hi> And this joy will not vanish. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.22. <hi>Your joy no man shall take away from you.</hi> Also spirituall glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. <hi>We have accesse by faith into this grace, wherein we stand and boast, in hope of the glory of God.</hi> And this glorie is caried upon its object, as present, and alreadie attained, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed it bee but future. So <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> upon this place: <hi>Every man glories of those things, which hee hath already. Now because our hope of future things is as certaine and evident, as of things already received, the Apostle saith, wee also glory of these.</hi>

                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:10635:75"/>6 Lastly the certainty, not onely of perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but also of the perseverer, is warranted by the mutuall pledges laid downe betweene God and the faithfull: on that side our pledge kept in the hand of God on this side Gods earnest pennie laid up in our hearts: A double pledge is given for the securing not both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but one onely, to wit, us. And this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pledge, although it be possessed on both sides, yet is surely kept by the fidelitie of one part onely, to wit, of God.</p>
                  <p>Of the former, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> treateth in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have beleeved, and I am perswaded, that he is able to keepe that, which I have committed unto him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the last day.</hi> That which <hi>I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> there is the pledge of salvation: <hi>Able to keepe,</hi> there is a sure preserver: <hi>I know and am perswaded,</hi> there is faith: <hi>I am not ashamed,</hi> there is confidence.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the latter pledge left with us, the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Yee were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance</hi>: and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Who hath given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:10635:75"/>
But if God, having once given this earnest, should not also give the rest of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>hee should undergoe the losse of his earnest</hi>: as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> most elegantly and foundly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth in his third Sermon upon the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. And likewise in his second Sermon upon the <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. <hi>They, that truely partake of the spirit, know that it is the earnest of our inheritance.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>THis perswasion of faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come into the act and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, without the endeavor of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and use of the meanes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe firme perswasion of Gods bestowing the gift of perseverance, and of our attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of life everlasting, we attribute to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God alone; and the intercession of Christ, as to the originall cause: but so, as we withall referre it to sanctification, as an unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable companion, and a most sure signe. This is laid downe, as an evidence of a solid faith, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.3. <hi>Hereby we are sure, that wee know him, if we keepe his commandements.</hi> This is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10635:76"/>
set forth as the proper passion of justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them, that are in Christ Iesus, who walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we measure this holinesse, not by the degrees of it, but by the endeavor, and setled purpose of him, that hath it: and withall we professe, that this holinesse and perswasion of faith may and ought to bee forwarded and confirmed by watching, fasting, prayer, and mortifying the flesh, and other meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to appointed by God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 38. <hi>Watch, and pray, lest ye enter into temptation,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. <hi>I beat downe my body, and bring it into subjection, lest I my selfe should be reproved.</hi> Notwithstanding in the meane while let us so reckon this our diligence, and pious use of these meanes; in the number of the exercises of our freed will, that withall wee account that very diligence and endeavour amongst the helpes of assisting grace and motions of the holy Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us.</p>
                  <p>Now it is certaine that this firme perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, of which we speake, cannot put forth it selfe without these holy endeavors.</p>

                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:10635:76"/>1 Because sanctification (the companion of justification) cannot consist without the intent of obedience: An habituall purpose whereof (although interrupted by many slips) is sufficient to the Elect for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the state of justification entire in it selfe. But for the present comfort of this confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is necessarily required an actuall purpose of such obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; neither can any man out of the testimony of the spirit speaking to his heart, say, I doe now confidently beleeve, that I shall remaine in the state of grace to the end, unless he also adde, out of the sincere intent of his minde, I doe now most constantly purpose with my selfe to walke in the wayes of Gods holy Commandements.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Much lesse can it be imagined, that this lively act of our confidence can stand with an actuall and direct purpose of sinning.

                  <argument>
                     <p>THis perswasion hath not that degree of certitude, that can alwayes shut out all feare of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but is sometimes lively, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times languishing, sometimes, (as in great temptations) none at all.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN spiritual gifts, with w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we are furnished in this life, sincerity is required, perfection of degrees is not to be expected; Even that gift which is the hand, by which wee lay hold on all the rest, hath its diseases, and weaknesses; so that the perswasion of the faithfull concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their owne salvation and perseverance, cannot alwayes enjoy the highest degree of certitude.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The first infirmity ariseth out of the ground it selfe, whereupon this personall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10635:77"/>
is built, which seemes to be of lower degree, then the certitude of dogmaticall faith. For the Articles of the Catholique Faith doe worke upon our assent, as immediate and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall principles: but the truth of this speciall faith is not enforced thence, as a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, but is added therto by way of assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore there can be no greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of that conclusion, which frameth this perswasion, then such as is in the weaker of the premisses. But that assumption is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon experimentall arguments, weighed and applied by a mans private conscience; which arguments or markes, since they are sometimes questioned whether or no they be true and concluding evidences, nay often times are hid under the cloud of temptation, so that they the while cannot shine forth to our present comfort, what wonder, if so bethe faithfull have not alwaies at hand a lively and firme perswasion concerning their eternall salvation.</p>
                  <p>Nay, which is more, the very principles of the Catholique faith, howsoever they are, by the light of revelation, cleare in themselves,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10635:78"/>
yet for as much as they are knowne to us, by the certainty, not of <hi>evidence,</hi> but onely of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion,</hi> they doe not procure in us an assent of such uniforme stabilitie, as is yeelded unto <hi>Mathematicall demonstrations,</hi> and inbred <hi>noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> admitted by all men. But in our contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating these revealed principles, our of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of our carnall diffidence, sometime there arise, (as wee may so say) certaine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, or mists, through which the light of divine truth (in it selfe immutable) to our weake eyes seemeth to tremble, and suffer a kinde of refraction. How much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and more lasting is that mistake, which may betide any of the faithfull in the viewing his own personal confidence? Their eyes truly would alwayes waver, except both this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon revelation of the Catholique Faith, and also that personall application, made by the conscience, were confirmed and sealed unto our hearts by the holy Ghost, <hi>bearing witnesse to our spirit, that we are the sonnes of God.</hi> And this very testimony of the Spirit, although the seed thereof be never utterly extinguished, yet in regard of the fruit and sense thereof, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10635:78"/>
it either withdrawes it selfe, so that our owne infirmity may be evident to us, or else for a time it is, as it were, raked up under the ashes by our rebellion and ingratitude.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Therefore that other weaknesse doth arise from temptations, by which this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion is assaulted.

But the maine skirmish consists in the mutuall wrastling and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the flesh and spirit. Whilest this wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lasts, our faith is weake: but if so be the spirit overcomes the flesh, then our spirit cheeres up, and triumpheth in this manner: <hi>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</hi> But if (which often falls out) the spirit, thus wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and weakned, receive the foile for a time, being either overborne with the load of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, or tainted with the spots of hainous sinnes, then there remaines no such actuall

                  <argument>
                     <p>THat the perseverance of those, who are truly faithfull, is not an effect of Election, but a benefit offered equally to all, upon this condition, namely, if they shall not be wanting unto suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grace.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have confuted the first part hereof at the first Article in our third Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the third Erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and also in this fifth Article, in the eighth Position, Of the certainty of perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in it selfe.</p>
                  <p>The second part of this Opinion containes many incongruities.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is not true that perseverance is a gift onely offered, and not given also. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures witnesse, that God doth not onely offer unto his the grace of perseverance, but also that he gives it them, and puts it into their hearts. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my feare into their hearts,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10635:82"/>
that they shall not depart from me. Iohn</hi> 4.14. <hi>The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto eternall life.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13 <hi>But will with the tentation make a way to escape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is false, that it is offered equally to all, as appeares out of our Positions set downe before in the first Article: Where wee have proved that perseverance in faith doth belong to the Elect alone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is false that perseverance is a grace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon condition: for it is a gift promised absolutely by God without any respect at all of condition. The reason is this: Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God are touching the end, others tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the meanes which conduce to the end. The promises, concerning the end, that is to say, Salvation, are conditionall. <hi>Beleeve and thou shalt be saved. Bee faithfull unto the death,</hi> (that is, persever) <hi>and I will give thee the Crowne of life.</hi> But for as much as no man is able to performe the conditions, God also hath made most free and absolute promises to give the very conditions, which he workes in us, that so by them, as by meanes, we may attaine the end. <hi>Deut.</hi> 36.6. <hi>And the Lord thy God will cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10635:82"/>
thy heart, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soule, that thou maist live.</hi> The end here promised is life, which the Israelites could never attaine without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the condition, namely, their love of God. But here God promiseth absolutely, that hee will give unto them this condition. Since therefore the promises of Faith, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in Faith, are promises concerning the meanes, they are expresly to bee reckoned among those absolute gifts, by which God, (considering mans disability both to attaine the end without the meanes, and also to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the meanes or conditions of himselfe,) doth promise that he will make them able to performe the conditions. God promiseth life to those that constantly feare him: the promise of life is conditionall: but of constant feare, it is absolute. <hi>I will put my feare in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Be it so that this gift were conditionall, yet it is not offered upon this condition, if men will not be wanting to themselves in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of this sufficient grace. Against this condition those reasons are of force,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:10635:83"/>
which we brought before against the strength of free wil in mans conversion: to which we adde also these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First it will follow out of this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that wee doe in vaine intreat God in the behalfe of any men, that he would give unto them the gift of perseverance, because of course he offers them universall and sufficient grace, to which, if they themselves will not be wanting, they shall persevere.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This is an idle condition. For it makes perseverance to be the condition of perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For to persevere is nothing else, but not to be wanting unto this sufficient grace. If therefore God offers perseverance upon this condition, he offers the same upon condition of it selfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Lastly, the second part of this opinion is soundly confuted by Saint <hi>Austine, de corrept. &amp; grat. cap.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. of which disputation this is the summe, <hi>It was given to Adam that hee might, if he would, persevere in good: but it was not granted to him to will to persevere. But such grace is given to us, who are truly engrafted into Christ, that not onely we may, if we will, but also that wee
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10635:83"/>
shall will to persevere in Christ.</hi> Againe in his booke <hi>de unitate Ecclesiae, cap.</hi> 9. the same <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> doth contemne this very opinion main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the <hi>Donatists,</hi> namely, that <hi>Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, if they will; if they will, they persevere in that which they beleeve; if they will not, they persevere not.</hi>

                     <p>THat no true beleever, or regenerate person, can be assured in this life of his perseverance and salvation, without speciall revelation.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>OF the first part of this position, we hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before in this Article.

Was <hi>Paul</hi> alone the Elect of God? Doth God justifie <hi>Paul</hi> onely? Or doth Christ make intercession for <hi>Paul</hi> alone? Since therefore out of these premises common to the whole Church of the Elect, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that place inferres that confident conclusion, <hi>Who shall separate us</hi>? and, <hi>I am perswaded, &amp;c.</hi> certaine it is, that other beleevers also, who have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to the same meanes of salvation, may hence deduce and apply unto themselves this full perswasion of their salvation and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>The same conclusion every faithfull soule is able to make out of other ordinary premises.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 From the testimony of the conscience, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.21. <hi>If our hearts condemne us not, then have we confidence toward God.</hi>

                  <p>AGainst this opinion these arguments, besides others, are of force.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Man cannot by any sinne make void any act of Gods.

In vaine in this case some oppose against us <hi>the defect of the subject,</hi> or failing on mans part: Whereas God doth continually repaire the

                  <argument>
                     <p>THat the doctrine of the certainty of perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and salvation, is of its owne nature both hurtfull unto true piety, and pernicious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way to Religion.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BOth Gods truth, and mans experience ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily wipe off this aspersion. For this Christian perswasion of perseverance, and salvation, not onely in respect of its own nature, But also according to the very event in the Church, doth, by Gods blessing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a quite contrary effect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First in respect of the thing it selfe, the certainty of the end doth not take away, but establish the use of the meanes. And the same holy men, who upon sure grounds promise unto themselves both constancy in the way of this pilgrimage, and fruition of God in their everlasting home, know also that these
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:10635:87"/>
are not obtained without performance of the duties of holinesse, and the avoidance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vices: and therefore they turne not their backes from these meanes, but industriously embrace and prosecute them. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man that hath this hope in himselfe, purifieth himselfe, even as he is pure. Esay</hi> 38.5. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had received that promise of God of an addition of fifteene yeares to his life, he did not therefore neglect the use of medicines or meats, but, that this promised event might be brought into act, he applied, for the cure of his body, the plaister, which was prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto him by the Prophet. The Apostle doth altogether reject this consequence of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall security imputed to this doctrine, and that with a kinde of indignation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Shall we continue in sinne, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, which are dead to sinne, live any longer therein?</hi> As if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate unto us, not onely the incongruity, but also impossibility of such a sequell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As touching the event, true it is, that any the most wholesome truth of God may bee perverted by the abuse of men. But upon

this doctrine wee cannot acknowledge that there groweth any such inconvenience, no not <hi>de facto,</hi> that is, in the event it selfe. Let us take a view of the Reformed Churches, in which this confidence of perseverance and inviolable adoption is beleeved and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Doe we finde that thereupon the bridle is let loose unto riot? That piety is trampled downe? We give thankes unto God through our Lord Iesus Christ, that among ours (who enjoy this full perswasion of spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and are confident, that there is an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, which cannot bee lost, laid up for them in heaven) there is not found lesse care of godlinesse, nor lesse endevor (so far forth as mans infirmity will suffer) to live an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable life than is to be found among any sort of those, who pinne their perseverance on their owne free will, and will not grant it to flow from any foregoing Election of GOD.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus have wee set downe our joynt Suffrage concerning these five controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Articles; which our judgement wee beleeve to be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word of God, and sutable to the Confessions of so many reformed Churches. From which, that this one of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> should be separated, it neither will seeme safe, nor pious unto those, who have any graine of wisedome, or sparke of true piety.</p>
            <p>And this our most Gracious and Mightie King of <hi>Great Britaine Defendor of the Christian Faith,</hi> and the most earnest maintainer of it, (out of his hearty wishes, that in these flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Provinces, the faith might remaine sincere, and the peace of the Church and Common-Weale be entirely preserved) hath
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:10635:89"/>
especially aymed at, when he gave in charge to us, appointed to bee sent hither, that wee should as much as in us lyeth, by our mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate advises set forward the publike peace of your Church; and that we should exhort our Reverend Brethren assembled in this celebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Synode, that they should not determine any thing in their Synodicall Suffrages, which might thwart the received Doctrine, which hath beene established in so many publike Confessions of the Churches.</p>
            <p>This received doctrine hath not long since seemed distastfull to the palate of some ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to Innovation, which doctrine though they have by all meanes and helps indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to disgrace and suppresse, yet neverthelesse, like a kinde of heavenly fire, it hath sent forth the clearer rayes by the very motion and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. We truely with from our hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our brethren, called <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> that the eyes of their understanding may be enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that their minds may not be estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the study of peace: as also unto the rest of our reverend brethren, such charitable affection toward them, that they may not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10635:89"/>
cease, to wish well unto the persons of those men, whose errors they oppugne.</p>
            <p>And here wee crave leave a little to turne our speech to the most illustrious and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>States,</hi> and to their most judicious <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,</hi> and finally to all the rest, that sit at the sterne of the Common-weale in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. It is your parts (most noble Lords) no lesse to take care lest the Orthodox Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the Common-weale, committed to your trust, should receive any damage. <hi>For Magistrates serve God in this, when for his service they doe those things, which none can doe, but Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</hi> In this case therefore there needs, not onely your pietie and good example, but also your power and commands: Let your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer restraine that, which here goeth by the name of <hi>libertie of prophecying.</hi> Vpon presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof some are wont, first lightly to nibble at, then openly to impugne, and at last to cry downe the most established grounds of our faith. If it shall bee lawfull for every one to impeach the Orthodox doctrine, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the common consent of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches; it is to be feared, that they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10635:90"/>
who through the connivence of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, have begun to innovate in the Church, will afterward, against his prohibition, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion may serve, attempt the like in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom-wealth.</p>
            <p>But they little need our exhortation, who to their great paines and cost have already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the best course, that could be wished, for the renovation and consummation of peace and truth in these Churches. Therefore we thinke it unlawfull to doubt of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, of whose singular prudence, piety and care we have had experience: And will pray unto God, that those things, which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from them with a pious intention, may be finished with happy successe.</p>
            <p>And now beloved brethren and fellow Ministers, wee will also in a few words ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse our selves to you, from whose wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes it cannot bee hid, that among these principall Controversies so much discussed, there bee sometime sleight questions inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled, which neither have the same certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of beliefe, nor are of any great moment to true piety. But as for those which are of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:10635:90"/>
that nature, that, unlesse they be maintained, the free grace of God, in the provision for mans salvation, is infirmed, and the free will of man set up in Gods Throne, for those you ought constantly to stand, as for the free-hold of Religion; neither by any meanes ought you to endure, that the certainty of our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should bee revoked from the stability of Gods purpose to the inconstancy of mans freewill. But if among these any questions come in, which being not yet determined by the Reformed Churches, are probably disputed by godly and learned men either way without any damage to the rule of faith, it becomes not grave and moderate Divines to thrust upon other mens consciences, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of Faith, their owne private opinions herein. In such <hi>Tenets</hi> there is no danger, so long as you take heed, that diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of opinion doe not either among the Ministers dissolve the bond of peace, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people sow the seeds of faction.</p>
            <p>Moreover (that wee may give no further caution) among those things, which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and soundly grounded upon the word
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:10635:91"/>
of God, some there be, which are not to bee inculcated to every auditory without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but onely to be touched warilie in due time and place. Among these is that high mystery of <hi>Predestination,</hi> a most sweet doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and full of comfort, but to those onely, who are rooted in faith, and exercised in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to which kinde of men, in great conflict of conscience, it may bee instead of a strong tower of defence. But when they, who have not yet well learned the first foundations of Religion, and whose mindes are wholly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by their carnall affections, are by the indiscretion of some Preachers, called on to dive into this depth, this commeth of it, that, while they brabble about the secret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Predestination,</hi> they neglect the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of the Gospell, and, while they dreame of nothing else but Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto life, they never care to set foot in that way, in which they must walke, who are Predestinated unto life.</p>
            <p>And concerning the mystery of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, greater care is to be had, that it be not only handled sparingly and prudently, but also in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10635:91"/>
the explication thereof those fearefull opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and such as have no ground in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, bee carefully avoyded, which tend rather unto desperation, then edification, and doe bring upon some of the Reformed Churches a grievous scandall.</p>
            <p>Lastly, wee are so to determine of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious merit of Christs death, that we neither sleight the judgement of the Primitive Church, nor yet the Confessions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, nor (which is the most principall point of all the rest) weaken the promises of the Gospel, which are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded universally in the Church.</p>
            <p>These briefe admonitions are here given by us, rather that wee might testifie our love toward our Venerable brethren, then that we thought they needed this our advise.</p>
            <p>There remaines nothing now, but that wee humbly beseech Almighty God, that the counsailes of the <hi>States,</hi> the endeavors of the Ministers, the assistance of foraine Divines, and the endeavors of all may ayme at this, and obtaine this end, that the Church of the Low Countries, all errors being roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10635:92"/>
out, and dissensions composed, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Orthodox Faith, and a setled peace for ever, through him, who is the Advocate of our peace, our Lord and Savior IESVS CHRIST. <hi>Amen.</hi>
