            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LAST WORDS OF LEWIS du MOULIN:</head>
            <head type="sub">BEING His Retractation of all the Personal Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions he had made on the Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AMong all the News that is daily pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and cried about the Streets, none can be so welcome to truly good men, as to hear of any sinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>For that is the thing, which alone can mend all that is amiss among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though it be but a late repentance, and not so compleat and entire, as it might have been; yet it is of great use, and does much service: because it gives glory to God, does honour to Religion, checks those that go
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41654:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on fearlesly in their evil waies: and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes them-to persist in that course, which, if they have any conscience, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn at last; but to take up betime, amend their lives, and make their repentance as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, as their Crimes.</p>
            <p>That still adds much to the sincerity, and the usefulness of it; when he that gives a <hi>publick offence,</hi> takes away the scandal, as much as in him lies; by making a <hi>publick acknowledgement</hi> of his fault, and declaring openly he will offend so no more.</p>
            <p>Such, in part, was the penitent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of this person: the true relation whereof follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LEWIS du MOULIN</hi> Dr. of Physick (a person so well known by his writings, that it is needless to give any other character of him, than is publickly read there) was taken very ill in the end of last <hi>September:</hi> and being in the Seventy seventh year of his Age, did not expect he should recover; but set himself seriously to prepare for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he thought he was shortly to give to God.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>fourth</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> he desired a visit
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41654:3"/>
from Dr. <hi>Burnet:</hi> who very kindly came to visit him, and was as kindly received by him. After the discourses fit to be used to a dying man, the <hi>Doctour</hi> spake to him of his Books: And told him though he would not trouble him (in the condition wherein he then was) with any discourse about his Opinions, yet he must admonish him of his falling foul in those Books, upon so many worthy men, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> Dean of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> Dr. <hi>Durell</hi> Dean of <hi>Windsor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> Dean of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> and several others: of whom he ought to ask forgiveness, and to make them all the reparation, that was in his power to doe.</p>
            <p>He was soon convinced, that he had been carried too much from his duty, by the heat of his temper and passion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to ask their pardon in his Name. And when he spake of the Dean of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> he expressed much sorrow and shed some tears.</p>
            <p>After Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> had prayed with him (in which he joyned with great devotion) he left him, and went and acquainted the Dean of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> herewith: who very freely sent by him, a very kind remembrance; with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41654:4"/>
assurance that the said Dr. <hi>du Moulin</hi> should have both his Forgiveness and his Prayers. The Dean of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> also was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the same person, (but the Dean of <hi>Windsor</hi> was not in Town) that Dr. <hi>du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> desired a visit from him, being in his Parish, and having a mind to ask his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for what he had wrote against him. Who going to him immediately, the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the same day <hi>(Octob. 4.)</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with many expressions of great affection to him, and such high esteem of him, upon several accounts, that the <hi>Dean</hi> doth not think fit to have them here set down particularly; lest they should be thought to be as extravagantly said on the other side, as those things were which he wrote to defame him.</p>
            <p>But he confessed he had been much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusted at some passages about Faith, in a Book of the Dean's, called the <hi>Parable of the Pilgrim:</hi> which he could not reade without indignation.</p>
            <p>To which the Dean replied, that it should not have transported him, so far, and so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily, as it did. But he ought, before he had so much as written against him, to have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41654:4"/>
gone to his house, (as he had done upon some other occasions) and made his excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and given him leave to explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: which if he had done, he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Doctour would not have thought his Notion to be Popish; much less have put him down among the Corrupt party, which he fansied was advancing towards <hi>Rome.</hi> For he would have shown him, in the best Reformed Divines, as zealous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as he uses, against an Idle, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Faith: and besides would have turned him to a Chapter in that very Book (the last but one) where he would have found that he was far from taking men off <hi>from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on Christ, and upon Christ alone for Salvation:</hi> for he directs them there how to doe it safely; and onely told them, they must do something else, before they can come to this high act of Faith, <hi>to trust that by Christ's merits and God's mercy, they shall be justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he told him he should have read; and not thrown away the Book, when he met with one passage which offended him. To which Dr. <hi>du Moulin</hi> assented; and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly begg'd his pardon, praying him also
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41654:5"/>
to beg of God pardon for him, which the Dean promised he would doe; but said that he must first put him in mind, that this offence against him (which he easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave, because he knew his cholerick temper, disposed him to be incensed upon small oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions) was very inconsiderable; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with that against the Church of <hi>England</hi> in general; which he had wrong'd intolerably, to the great gratification of its Enemies, at such a time when all sober men should be its Friends; and that without any real cause for such imputations, as he had endeavoured to fasten on it.</p>
            <p>Here Dr. <hi>du Moulin</hi> laboured to make some defence for himself; and said, that he thought there was a cause, and that greater men than he had thought so too: from whom he had long agoe imbibed this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of a corrupt party in the Church (as he expresses it in his Writings) leaning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Popery, nay making several advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards <hi>Rome.</hi> And then mentioned the Names of some of them, Sir <hi>Benjamin Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyer,</hi> the then Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> &amp;c. who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the long Parliament laid the same things to the charge of the great Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that he did now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41654:5"/>To this the Dean of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> replying, that as some of those persons lived to see how they were abused; so he could not but have observed how effectually this calumny had been confuted by those whom he called <hi>Bishop Laud's faction;</hi> who remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to our Religion in the late confusions, and could not be moved to turn Papists, when they were turned out of all they had by pretended Protestants, and had no hope of seeing the Church restored; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he ought not to have renewed this ungrounded charge against so manifest a demonstration of its falsity: Dr. <hi>du Moulin</hi> made no answer at all, but yielded thus far, as to say, <hi>Well Doctour, pray to God to pardon me all my sins, especially my want of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly the <hi>Dean,</hi> kneeling down by his Bed-side, began with the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> and so proceeded to the other Prayers, which are appointed by the Order in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book for the Visitation of the Sick.</hi> In all which the Sick man joined with lifting up his hands often, and other expressions of devotion: especially at that passage (in the Prayer, when there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41654:6"/>
appears small hopes of recovery) <hi>give him unfeigned repentance for all the errours of his life past,</hi> &amp;c. he gave more then ordinary signs of his fervent desire. And when the <hi>Dean</hi> had done, gave him most hearty thanks, and renewed his expressions of extraordinary affection to him, and esteem of him.</p>
            <p>The next day Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> made him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther visit; and having given him an account what the <hi>Dean of S. Pauls</hi> said concerning him (which he received with great sense of his kindness, and return of thanks to him for it) told him it was fit he should do something for the repairing the injuries he had done, in as publick a manner as they were committed. To which he readily assented; and as he promised never to be guilty of the like again if he should recover, so he said he would subscribe a Paper that should give publick satisfaction to all he had offended, and desired Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to put him in mind of it. Who wrote a Paper, and left it with Dr. <hi>du Moulin</hi>'s Wife: who carrying it to her Husband, he said before Witnesses, after he had considered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, that he was ready <hi>to sign it with his</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41654:6"/>
               <hi>Blood;</hi> and presently subscribed the same. A true Copy whereof followeth.</p>

            <p>And accordingly, the Dean of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> coming a little while after, to see him again, he was so affected with his kindness in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him a new visit, that he said, <hi>Are you come again Sir? O how charitable are you! This is indeed to return me good for evil.</hi> And after some discourse with him, desired him to pray with him again; <hi>for your Prayers,</hi> said he, <hi>were very comfortable to me the last time.</hi> And accordingly he did, in the same form of words he had used before: with which he was so much affected, that when the <hi>Dean</hi> had solemnly commended him to God's blessing, in that excellent form; <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's gracious Mercy and Protection we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thee. The Lord bless thee and keep thee,</hi> &amp;c. he laid hold upon his hand (which he held up over him) and kissed it with an unusual passion.</p>
            <p>At the same time, having repeated his thanks to him, he told him of the Paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

mentioned, and desired his Wife to show it him, promising a Copy of it should be sent him, signed with his own hand. It must be confessed that when the <hi>Dean</hi> had read it, he wished it had been more full; and so ordered as to have given satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the whole Church, as well as to particular persons: But this being the form he had already signed, it was not easy to alter it.</p>
            <p>And he often called upon his Wife to get three or four Copies of it transcribed, for him to sign according to the first draught: which when she had done, and brought them to him, and askt him whether he had well considered it, and was well satisfied to sign these: he answered, he was ready to doe it, with all his heart, if they were the same with that he had already signed. Then he heard them examined, and corrected with his own hand, where there was a fault; signing three Copies with his own hand, in these words. <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>advances towards Popery,</hi> without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Wife and other Relations, would be pleased to consider this Narrative, and lay it to heart, before they be arrested by Death; that grave, that wise and faithfull Counseller, which deceives no man, but sets a Glass before their eyes which flatters not; and represents the truth so plainly and sincerely to their minds, that did they but take frequent advice of this Counseller, and before they venture upon any action, would but consider how it would appear, were they going to answer for it to God Almighty, they would find themselves ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistably restrained in the pursuit of their fiercest passions and desires.</p>
            <p>For even they, who can be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other way, are moved by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death to alter their resolutions. The obstinately inflexible, who could not be turned out of their way (in which they ran with a violent heat) by any obstacle, have in a moment been cooled, and made to yield, when they saw death coming to call them before the Judgment-seat of God. Upon which account there cannot be more profitable counsel then that of the Son of

IT IS HE THAT PUTS INTO MAN ALL THE WISEDOM OF THE WORLD, WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD,</hi> &amp;c. Death which hateth and destroyeth man, is believed; God, which hath made him, and loves him, is always deferred. <hi>I have considered</hi> (saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, all the works that are under the Sun, and behold all is vanity and vexation of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> but who believes it till Death tells it us?

are but abjects, and humbles them at the instant; makes them cry, complain, and repent; yea, even to hate their forepast happiness. He takes account of the rich, and proves him a Beggar, a naked Beggar, which hath interest in nothing, but in the gravel that fills his mouth.
