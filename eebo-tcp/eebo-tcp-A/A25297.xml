            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THings are not for words, but words for things: if therefore we understand things aright &amp; as they ought, by words, it must be by such as are fit to imprint the things themselves in those to whom they should occur, and then it were enough (to make known our thoughts to others as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them) only to make use of such <hi>Words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But forasmuch as we find the matter in this case far otherwise, and that two men speaking or writing the same words,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>If words are too gross to express the refined thoughts of mortal men, how much less then can they be in truth said to be the</hi> ineffable <hi>Word of the eternal God</hi>?</note> may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless have different, yea sometimes contrary thoughts, the disability of performing this fitly by words or discourse, is clearly inferred. Nor may we at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it, seeing we know to what a perpetual change Languages are subject, even such that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words may be changed from their pristine signification. And the imperfection is so great, that whosoever should have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, such as now they are in use, we should certainly believe that he had little or no knowledge of those things that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intended to be signified. So that if we would better express things unto another by words and speeches, we had need find new words, and consequently a whole new Language: But that would be a toyle and labour indeed.</p>
            <p>In the mean while we see what a Sea of Confusion flows from hence upon all mankind: For although there should be none who sometimes through ignorance, and sometimes by subtilty or wickedness might rest or pervert words contrary to the mind

the Work, upon whom they may cast the whole burthen? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no: for he that sees but a little clearly, sees, that there's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways contention behind, and no end till a man grows weary of it: Nor is the Conquest just his that hath Truth, but that can best handle his Tongue. A miserable thing if it were thus to be sought and found! But it is not so with the true Religion.</p>
            <p>Go to then, O man, who ever thou art, we wil not draw thee off from one heap of men, to carry thee over unto another, 'tis somewhat else we invite thee too. Lend us but a little audience: Surely thou knowest thus much, That as it is an extremity to receive all things without distinction, that present themselves to us, so 'tis no less to reject all things without judgement. We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite thee to something which may be means to attain to thy own salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and well-being:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>'Tis little worth that is not worth the trial: The loss is little the gain may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable.</hi>
               </note> Be as distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or rather prudent or foresighted as thou wilt, thou canst not in reason refuse us thy ear in this thing: All the damage thou canst possibly have by doing that which we exhort thee to, is only to have taken a little pains in vain, if that which is promised should not ensue: Whereas on the contrary, should it follow, thou mightest come to the enjoyment of a matter of so great a worth, that would not be exchanged for all that's esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great in the earth. Moreover, 'tis not far to seek, but at hand, 'tis <hi>nigh</hi> thee, yea and in thy self. And there thou <hi>mayest</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the trial of that which we declare, which is the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and sure that can be desired.</p>
            <p>We direct thee then to within thy self, that is, that thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to turn into, to mind and have regard unto that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, to wit, <hi>The Light of Truth, the true Light which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> Here 'tis that thou must be, and not without thee. Here thou shalt find a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple certain and infallible, and whereby encreasing and going on therein, thou mayest at length arrive unto a happy condition:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>'Tis hard helping him that durst not try,</hi>
               </note> Of this thou mayest highly adventure the tryal. But if thou durst not do so much, 'tis hard to help thee. And if thou happenest to be one of

the enjoyment can be but single and transient, and the causes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant.</p>
            <p>Now where this operateth in us after this manner by educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and example in manners and customs which are regulated by Opinion, and not by the <hi>true Light,</hi> that men live altogether therein, is it any wonder that here (in these men) there is so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or no operation of the <hi>Light</hi>? Not at all.</p>
            <p>We are so involved into the desire of that which is high in the World, so overwhelmed in pleasures, that its almost impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the <hi>Light</hi> to cause one desire after <hi>Good</hi> to spring or bubble up.</p>
            <p>Where then these so contrary operations to the <hi>Light</hi> are, there it can never break through.</p>
            <p>According to the nature and kind of every thing, is the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof: Where they are opposite, the one must give way unto the other, and that which is most powerful prevails: from whence also the effects thereof becom most visible. The LIGHT notwithstanding, abides always the same, &amp; therefore although man by sin, through his love and union to corruptible things, comes to perish, be damned, and miss of his everlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the <hi>Light</hi> nevertheless which is in every man that comes into the World, abides for ever unchangeable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Light is also the first Principle of Religion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>No knowledge of God without this Light.</hi>
               </note> For, seeing there can be no true Religion without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and no knowledge of God without this <hi>Light,</hi> Religion must necessarily have this <hi>Light</hi> for its first Principle.</p>
            <p>God being then known by this <hi>Light</hi> according to the measure of knowledg which the finite &amp; circumscribed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can have of the Infinite and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumscriptible Creator,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Light being found, and God thereby known, a sure foundation is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi>
               </note> man hath obtained a <hi>firm Foundation,</hi> upon which he may build all firm and lasting things: A Principle whereby he may without ever erring, guide the whole course of his life, how he is to carry himself towards God, his Neighbor, and himself, and all things else, whereby he may happily attain unto his chiefest salvation, which consisteth only in <hi>Union with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48390:5"/>
God.</hi> And thus this <hi>Light</hi> is therefore the first Principle of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Without this Light there is no power or ability at all in man to do any good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This must first raise him and quicken him out of the death of sin.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Where there is nothing to work, there nothing can be wrought.</hi>
               </note> 'Tis folly to expect any thing, where nothing is; there's no effect without a cause: There must be something then which must cause a man to act, if he does any thing.</p>
            <p>And this cause must have in it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the effect produced hath in it: As for example <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Where any see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there must needs be</hi> LIGHT.</note>, if the effects of <hi>Light</hi> be produced, <hi>Light</hi> must do it, and nothing else.</p>
            <p>And therefore, is it not a silly thing that all men would have people do this or that as good, and leave this or that as evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they tell them so, without any more ado, or at best assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the accustomary motives wherefore, &amp; think they have reason too, just as if this were enough? Who can see such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as are hereby required, included in this Cause? Not I, for my part.</p>
            <p>Experience also teacheth us the same; else how could it all pass away in a train and custom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fruit?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>'Tis folly to expect ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects from unsuitable Means.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>These are therefore not the right means</hi>: But such we must endeavour to furnish people with, Means from whence Power may issue forth to do that which they are exhorted to. Such is the nature of man, that he is forced to chuse that which he judgeth to be best, before the worst, and is always willing to change for the best.</p>
            <p>Now if it so happens (as for the most part it doth) that a man chuseth the worst before the best,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>No man wittingly chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his own harm, but being blinded.</hi>
               </note> 'tis for want of knowledge, and contrary to his aim, and so he erreth, not being led by the <hi>true Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48390:6"/>Here then it should be begun, 'tis easie leading of a man to that which of himself he is desirous of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Therefore to undeceive the judgement is the first step.</hi>
               </note> If those now who make it their Work to teach others, <hi>were but lead themselves by the true Light,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better things then those to which the multitude are link't so fast with love, they would be able to hold them forth clearly to others: And so making it their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual work, 'twere impossible their labour should be fruitless, for people knowing better, would better do. Who remembers not the play of our youth, how much we were in love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and yet how ridiculous is it new unto us but to think upon it? And why? Because we now know that which we judge better: <hi>Herehence,</hi> not by force, but very lightly, and of it self, they came from time to time to be worn out, and pass away, that there's now no desire nor motion moving thereunto. How may we think then it would be, if the Spirit came but once to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend those things aright which infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely transcend all bodily things in worth?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Iudgement being amended, the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections must follow.</hi>
               </note> which are durable and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible. So far as these toyes then should come to be esteemed more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then all bodily things, so much the more powerful would be the annihilation of those things in which all men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>If you know the truth, the truth shall make you free, saith Christ.</hi>
               </note> even to old age, yea, death it self, do take so much delight; and then we might hope and expect that those things which are (indeed) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone worthy to be known, would gain entrance, &amp; being brought forth in the <hi>Light,</hi> would be also owned and received by every one, according to the measure in which they should stand in the same <hi>Light.</hi>

            <p>Hence, from within, the amendment and conversion is to be waited for, from within it must begin, if with foundation, the outward then 'wil follow of it self: The weakest must give way to the strongest <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>No man will part with what he judges best, till be sees something better, and then he need not be forced</hi>
               </note>, all depends but upon the knowledge of something
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48390:6"/>
better, to make a true and lasting change. Therefore to hold this forth to men, is the best thing we can give them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Light is the inward ear, by which alone, and by no other, the voice of God, that is the Truth, can be heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this alone must the sence and mind of him that would sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any thing by words or any outward sign, be comprehended and understood. <hi>So that if the Truth of God</hi> be presented to a man who stands not in the <hi>Light of Truth,</hi> 'tis impossible he should understand it, although he hears and comprehends the words after his manner, yet he is still fenced off ftom the true sence and meaning thereof.</p>
            <p>Hence, therefore, it is, that amongst so many hearers there are so few that have ears to hear.</p>
            <p>He that hears <hi>Truth</hi> aright, that is, understands it wel, must not stand out of, but in the <hi>Truth</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>Therefore neither is it any wonder that all men do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and conceive those things that are brought forth by the <hi>Light.</hi> Those only that stand in it, are alone (and no other) capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof.</p>
            <p>The case being thus, we see of how great concernment it is continually to exhort and excite men to turn in to the <hi>Light</hi> that is in them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>This the one and first thing necessary.</hi>
               </note> that so they may go on to such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and measure therein, as to be fit to understand aright <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ord,</hi> that is, the <hi>Truth of God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause out of this there can be nothing understood and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the words and writings given forth from the <hi>Light,</hi> but meer opinion, &amp; consequently errors. <hi>This Light Christ,</hi> &amp;c. is the <hi>truth &amp; word of God,</hi> as hath been already said, and every way appears by what we have hitherto laid down: <hi>For this is a living Word, and transmitteth man from death to life, is powerful, and enableth a man to bear witness of it self every where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is also the true Rule according unto which all our actions are to be squared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hath the preheminence before any Writing, Scripture, Doctrine, or any thing else that we meet with from without. <hi>We are born into the world,</hi> and brought up as every body knows. From the very first we hear differences, every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48390:7"/>
that he knows the matter, and hath truth: One holds sorth this, another that to us: <hi>If now the Light which is in every man that comes into the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is but one thing which is uncorruptible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which cannot be corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which must be the Judge of all things that offer themselves to our tryal, which are liable to be corrupted, as are all things without us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore this one Iudg is undeniably within man,</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> shall not be Judge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall we rowle? To believe all, is impossible; to reject all, no less: Who shall be Judg here? Who else can be but the <hi>Light</hi> within us? For whatsoever comes from without, is the thing to be judged of: Who then fitter? seeing this is infallible.</p>
            <p>Again, Is not this (the <hi>Light</hi>) that by which we must see and know God, and so consequently that by which we must judge all things Divine? Certainly 'tis: then it follows also, That we can judge of no Doctrine, of no Book that is Divine, but by this <hi>Light</hi>: and judging it thereby to be Divine, it cannot but be truly so. As for example, If we experience that the Book called the BIBLE, in regard of the Divine Doctrine therein comprised, hath such an <hi>harmony with that in which God</hi> is known, that he must needs have been the Author of it, there cannot rationally any more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful demonstration be demanded.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>No man farther knows the Scriptures, then he is what the Scripture speaks</hi>
               </note> With them that are thus, <hi>the Scripture may become living and powerful, and not a dead letter,</hi> as it must needs be to those men who have no feeling of this thing. And from hence then it's apparent, seeing this <hi>Light</hi> must stand before all things whatsoever that we meet with from without, that then <hi>man must first of all be directed to this</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>No other sure Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be laid,</hi>
               </note> for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it what profit is there (I pray) to be reaped any where by any external sign but by it. Lay the Book of the Scripture freely before any man, let him also have all the fitness (the Universities can give him) to look into it in its proper Language in which it may have been first written, what will all be without <hi>the Light</hi>? Nothing.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48390:7"/>
               <hi>The letters, the words are not the Scriptures,</hi> but the mind alone is the Scripture, and this meaning can never be truly and justly hit, but by those alone that stand in the same <hi>Light,</hi> out of which the Scriptures proceeded.</p>
            <p>These are they then to whom the Scripture is a <hi>Co-witness,</hi> and as a seal of their being Sons of God: while by experience they find themselves, every one according to his measure, in the <hi>same condition in which the Saints formerly were,</hi> who spake &amp; writ all those things comprehended in the Book of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>these then have the true understanding and meaning of the Scriptures,</hi> not those that <hi>imagine unto themselves a meaning</hi> by opinion and guess, thorough a thousand imaginations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least assurance of not erring: which becomes the very ground of all jangling and contention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In fine, and lastly, This Light in every man is the means to come to the knowledge of God.</hi> And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all external signes must needs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose this knowledge:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Where the knowledge of God is not, there all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things are of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. Therefore this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge must needs first be immediate, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther independent to all externals.</hi>
               </note> therefore its self must needs be immediate, without any external sign: that signs must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose such a knowledge, is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for these signs must either be <hi>words or effects, works or miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Words,</hi> we see at first an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in in the thing it self: for <hi>Words are created and finite,</hi> and God who should make known himself by them, <hi>uncreated and infinite</hi>: and therefore here is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite a difference,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Words too weak to give the knowledge of God.</hi>
               </note> that there is no <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of agreement, nor <hi>any thing</hi> in the world by which they might be capable to do it. But again, if you flye to the <hi>meaning</hi> of the words, as being fit for such a thing, then that which we say will more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appear: As put case for example sake, that GOD about to make known himself by words, should say, I AM GOD, and that this should be the sign by which he would make himself known, we see clearly, that it would be impossible for a man at first to know God by this: For if he should comprehend any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48390:8"/>
thing out of the sence of the words, he must needs formerly have had the signification of the word GOD, and what he is to understand by it: In like manner if God maketh his will known to man, <hi>the Knowledge of God</hi> (which hath its original from the <hi>true Light) must precede and convince him,</hi> that that (Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) can be from none but God alone, whereupon he's then sufficiently assured.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>Effects,</hi> (or <hi>outward miraculous Works</hi>) 'tis the same thing; for these are no less <hi>created,</hi> no less <hi>terminated</hi>: And though we might observe somthing in the nature of a thing, which might be too difficult for the power of any creature, which we know, to effect: Yet this at the utmost would be but a demonstration taken from our <hi>impotency,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Many things may seem Divine Miracles, which are produced by a hidden concurrence of many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural causes: Therefore without the knowledge of God precedes, no man can d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Or who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it?</p>
            <p>Add to this, <hi>That the knowledge of God in all things must first be, before the knowledge of any creature</hi> or particular thing, so no particular thing without this, can be well known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so consequently altogether uncapable to come to know God by, or certainly to make known himself to man by.</p>
            <p>Go to then, <hi>Without</hi> thy self, O man, thou hast no means to look for, by which thou maist know God. <hi>Thou must abide within thy sel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
