            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y VERIE GOOD LORD, It hath bene (and yet I thinke is) an vſe allowable, to preſent thoſe whom we honour or loue, with ſuch things as either for their value be profitable, or for their noueltie pleaſing. Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power to performe the one, I make bold to do the other: and according to my promiſe) ſend you this old Hiſtorie newly tranſlated. Which albeit your L. hath heretofore read in the Italian toong, yet may it be, that (for varieties ſake) you will againe vouchſafe to peruſe it in our Engliſh: written by him that is all yours. Sure I am (and by reading hereof, your L. ſhall be aſſured) that neither I haue fully expreſſed the Authours conceit, nor the writer well performed his dutie. Notwithſtanding, ſith both thoſe wants may be ſupplied by your iudgement, I aduenture the Booke into your L. hand, whom I dare truſt with any pardonable error. For as I haue taken in hand this labour, more to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine my ſelfe, (not otherwiſe occupied) then thereby to merit your thanks, or the commendation of others: ſo doo I recommend the ſame to your L. rather to be looked on at leiſure, then as a thing of perfection worthie to be ſtudied. Yet do I thinke (and ſo do others of more iudgement) that this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie doth equall or excell the moſt part that haue bin written: not ſo much for the order and argument of the matter, as the iuditiall diſcourſes and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations of the Authour. Wherein be diſcouered the cauſes of forraine and domeſticall diſcords, the commodities and diſcommodities of treaties, and the ſecret humours of Princes: with diuerſe other things verie conſiderable, chiefly of ſuch as be called to conſultation of publike affaires &amp; gouernment. And as the end of all Hiſtories ought be to mooue men vnto vertue, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them from vice, ſo do I thinke, there is not any that conteineth more examples to that purpoſe, then this writer: who leauing aſide all partialitie,
<pb facs="tcp:14349:3"/>
and the cuſtome of thoſe that ſtudie to flatter whom they fauour, and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port whom they loue not, doth ſeeme greatly to follow the truth, and ſetteth forth rather the cauſes and effects of euerie action, then ouer-much extoll or diſgrace the perſons of whome the ſtorie entreateth. But (as of all other things) ſo hereof your L. can beſt iudge. Wherefore moſt humbly reaccommending to your good fauour, this poore Preſent, and my faithfull ſeruice, I take leaue.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y meaning was, at ſuch time as I determined to write the Actions of the <hi>Florentine</hi> people, both within and without the Citie, to begin my Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the yeare of the Christian Religion, <hi>1444.</hi> at which time the houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> through the merits of <hi>Coſimo</hi> and <hi>Giouanni</hi> his father, aſpired to more reputation then any other in <hi>Florence.</hi> For I thought that <hi>Leonardo</hi> of <hi>Arezzo</hi> and <hi>Poggio</hi> (two excellent Historiographers) had particulerly ſet downe all things that till thoſe dayes had hapned. But hauing afterwards diligently read their writings, to ſee with what order and meanes they proceeded (to the end that following the ſame, our Historie might be by the Readers better allowed) I found that in their deſcription of the warres made by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> both againſt Princes and other forraine States, they had vſed exceeding great diligence: but of the ciuill diſcords and inward enimities, &amp; of the effects by them brought forth, they had vtterly omitted one part, &amp; ſo brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deſcribed the other, as the Readers could not thereby gather any profit or pleaſure at all: which I thinke they did either becauſe they iudged thoſe matters ſo meane as were not worthie the writing, or elſe, feared to offend the poſteritie of ſome perſons who ſhould thereby haue bene euill reported. VVhich two reſpects (be it ſpoken without offence) ſeeme to me, vtterly vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie men of great reputation. For if there be any thing in Histories that delighteth or teacheth, it is that, which maketh particuler deſcription. Or if any reading be profitable for men that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne in Common-weales, it is that, which ſheweth the occaſions of hate and faction: to the end that being warned by harme of others, they may become wiſe, and continue themſelues vnited. Alſo if euery example of Common-weales do moue the mind, thoſe we read of our Country doo moue most, and be moſt profitable. Moreouer, if the diuiſions of any Common-weale haue euer bene notable, the diuiſions of <hi>Florence</hi> are of all others moſt notable. For the most part of other Common-weales (to vs knowne) were content with one onely diuiſion, ond thereby, according to the accidents ſometimes encreaſed, and ſometimes ruined their Cities. But <hi>Florence</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with one, had many diuiſions. In <hi>Rome</hi> (as euery man knoweth) after the Kings were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, diuiſion grew betweene the nobilitie and the multitude: which continued till the ruine thereof: the like hapned in <hi>Athens,</hi> and all other Common-weales which in thoſe dayes flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. But in <hi>Florence,</hi> first the noble men became diuided among themſelues. Then the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and the people. And at last the people and the multitude. Yea many times it hapned, that one of theſe being victorious, diuided it ſelfe into two. Of which diuiſions, followed ſo many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo many banishments, and ſo many ſubuerſions of Families, as neuer chaunced within any Citie, that can be remembred. And ſurely it ſeemeth to mee, there is nothing that witneſſeth ſo well the greatnes of our Citie, as that which dependeth vpon theſe diuiſions, being of force ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſubuert any Citie of what greatnes or power ſo euer. Notwithſtanding our ſtate ſtill encreaſed. For ſo great was the vertue of thoſe Citizens, by their wiſedome and courage to work the aduancement of themſelues and their country, as they that hapned to eſcape ſo manifold miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, could by their vertue procure more encreaſe to the Citie, then the diſpleaſure of thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which wrought the decaie, could decreaſe it. And withouc all doubc, if <hi>Florence</hi> had bin ſo happie, as it might vpon the deliuery thereof from the Empire, haue taken ſome forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, which would haue holden the ſtate vnited, I know not what Common-weale either
<pb facs="tcp:14349:4"/>
auncient or moderne, that for vertue of Armes and induſtrie, before it could haue bene prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For moſt true it is, that after the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> were banished in ſo great numbers that all <hi>Toſcana</hi> and <hi>Lombardy</hi> was full of them, the <hi>Guelfi</hi> with the reſt that remayned at the warre againſt <hi>Arezzo</hi> one yeare before the iourney of <hi>Compaldino,</hi> drew out of their owne Cittie of Cittizens onely <hi>1200.</hi> men of Armes, and <hi>12000.</hi> footmen. After that time, in the warre againſt <hi>Filippo Viſconti</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> hauing rather to proue induſtrie, then their owne proper Armes (for at that time they were decayed) we ſee in fiue yeares, which that warre continued, the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſpent three Milions and fiue hundreth thouſand Florins. And that warre being ended (as not pleaſed with peace) to shew more of their greatneſſe, they beſieged the Cittie of <hi>Lucca.</hi> I cannot therefore conceiue any cauſe why theſe diuiſions should not be particulerly written. And if thoſe notable writers before named, were withholden by feare, to offend the poſteritie of ſuch as they should haue made mention of, they greatly deceiued themſelues, and ſeeme to know little the ambition of men, with the deſire they haue to make the names of their Anceſtors and themſelues to continue perpetuall. Neyther do they remember, that many men wanting occaſion to win themſelues fame, by ſome laudable deede, by ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious acte, haue laboured to aſpire thereunto. And they conſidered not, that the actions of men which haue in them greatneſſe, as gouernments and authorities, howſoeuer they be handled, or what end ſoeuer they haue, do ſeeme alwayes to giue men more honor then blame. VVhich I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thought vpon, did determine to change my meaning, and reſolued to begin my Hiſtorie at the beginning of our Cittie. And ſith my intent is not to vſurp the place of others, I will parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly ſet downe what chanced onely within the Cittie till the yeare <hi>1334.</hi> and of ſuch things as hapned without, I will not ſay more then that, which for the vnderſtanding of the other shall be neceſſarie. The yeare <hi>1434.</hi> being paſſed, I will particulerly write the one and the other. Moreouer, to the end this Hiſtorie may be the better vnderſtood, before I intreate of <hi>Florence,</hi> I shall diſcourſe by what meanes <hi>Italy</hi> became ſubiect to ſuch Potentates as in thoſe dayes there gouerned. The firſt Booke shall briefly recite all accidents hapned in <hi>Italy</hi> from the declination of the <hi>Romayne</hi> Empire, till the yeare <hi>1434.</hi> The ſecond will shew what things hapned from the beginning of <hi>Florence,</hi> till the warre which the <hi>Florentines</hi> made againſt the Pope, after expulcion of the Duke of <hi>Athene.</hi> The third doth end with the death of King <hi>Ladiſlao</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> Anno <hi>1434.</hi> In the fourth Booke we wil intreate what other things chanced till the yeare aboueſaid. And from thencefoorth diſcourſe particulerly of ſuch accidents as befell within <hi>Florence,</hi> till this our time.</p>

Howſoeuer that be, in this Booke (being a meere relation of the <hi>Florentines</hi> fortune, when they were gouerned Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticallie) appeareth not any thing vnfit to be knowne, or that may receiue euill conſtruction.</p>
            <p>The firſt part, ſheweth the occaſions of ruyne in the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire;<note place="margin">The ſubiect of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> and how the Prouinces of <hi>Italy</hi> became diuided into diuerſe gouernments: with their often variations. Secondly, by what meanes the Pope, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> poſſeſſed the greateſt parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> Laſtly, how that the <hi>Florentines,</hi> abandoning obedience to the Emperour, liued (almoſt continually) in faction and ciuill partialitie, vntill the houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> by the great vertue of <hi>Giouanni, Coſimo, Piero,</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> atteyned to a ſinguler reputation in that State; where now (and ſome yeares paſt) they gouerne as Princes, with great honor, iuſtice, and integritie: which happineſſe they could not finde in their Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall pollicie. Yet diuerſe notable Polititians and wiſe law-makers, haue not onely allowed, but alſo highlie commended it aboue others: Affirming,<note place="margin">Mediocritie the ſcope of Ariſtocracie.</note> that as medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie is in all things moſt praiſeable, and extremities reproueable, ſo the Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie (being the meane betweene the multitude and one Prince) is ſpeciallie to be preferred. Alſo for that the authoritie to commaund, is due to the moſt worthie, and worthineſſe conſiſteth either in honor, in vertue, in riches, or in them altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſtate Ariſtocraticall muſt needs be moſt allowed, bicauſe the noble, the riche, and vertuous men are in all places the feweſt number, and they onely in that kinde of gouernment haue authoritie. They alleage alſo how the rich men onely, as they that haue moſt intereſt in the State, do beſtowe moſt in publike ſeruices, and therefore to them the Gouernment ought be allotted: ſo was it in <hi>Rome</hi> after the Kings were depoſed, likewiſe in <hi>Athens,</hi> in <hi>Carthage,</hi> and at this day in <hi>Venice, Genoua,</hi> and <hi>Lucca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwere of theſe reaſons in fauour of Ariſtocracie,<note place="margin">Gouernment Ariſtocracie imperfit.</note> wherein mediocritie ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be ſpeciallie ſought for, who ſo ſhall duely examine thereof, may finde,
<pb facs="tcp:14349:5"/>
that to diuide things in the midſt, and thereby to marke out the vertue (which conſiſteth in reaſon) were impoſsible, as all Philoſophers haue determined. True it is, that the meane betweene all, and one is perfit, yet no where to be found: ſith in ſome Cities there are not one thouſand Citizens, and in ſome other more then an hundreth thouſand: which maketh the Ariſtocracie alwayes incertaine by the incertaintie of the numbers. And where the Gouernors be many, there are alſo factions many, the reſolutions ſlowe, and the ſecrets of State often diſcouered. For by experience is ſeene, how thoſe Ariſtocracies which haue in them feweſt Gouernors, are moſt durable: As that of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> gouerned by thirtie perſons, and that of the <hi>Pharſalians</hi> by twentie. It is not therefore the meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one and all, which cauſeth mediocritie.</p>
            <p>Now for beſtowing Soueraigntie vpon the moſt worthie, true it is, ſo it ought be, yet that argument maketh more for the Monarchie. For among the noble, rich, and wiſe, ſome one doth euer excell the reſt, and to him (by that reaſon) the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ought be giuen, ſeeing it is not poſsible to find all thoſe things equally in all men. If it be alleaged, that among the greateſt number are found moſt vertuous and good men, that reaſon ſerueth not, either in that ſtate or the Democracie: ſeeing in them both (as in all Corporations) the moſt voices are preferred before the wiſe and better. To conclude, I ſay that in all States, wherein are moſt Gouernors, there are feweſt reſolutions, and moſt diſputations. The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore (to meete with thoſe inconuenients) do commit the mannaging of their ordinarie affaires to the <hi>Senate,</hi> which conſiſteth of ſeuen perſons onely, as knowing that the fewer be made priuie, the more ſecretly they ſhall be handled: and no Ariſtocracie haue had ſo long continuance. Thus much touching Ariſtocraticall gouernment, of which kinde, was that whereof this Hiſtorie largely diſcourſeth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Equalitie the ſcope of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie.</note>The State Populer, do likewiſe boaſt of the excellencie thereof, as that which obſerueth equalitie without exception of perſons, and reduceth the conſtitutions ciuill vnto the lawe of nature: For as nature hath not giuen riches, offices, or honor to one man more then to another, ſo the Gouernment Populer, tendeth to haue all men equall, without priuiledge or prerogatiue whatſoeuer. For by ſuch meane (they ſay) that auarice in thoſe that be riche, and inſolencie in them that be great, ſhall be taken away, which are the moſt perilous inconuenients that can happen to any Common-weale; and conſequently all thefts, oppreſsions, partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and factions, are remoued: adding, that humaine ſocietie cannot be nouriſhed without amitie, and the nouriſher of amitie is equalitie, and no equalitie can be found but onely in States Populer: it followeth therefore, that is the beſt and moſt commendable gouernment, bicauſe each man enioyeth libertie, naturall and equall iuſtice, without feare of tyrannie or oppreſsion. Theſe, and ſome other reaſons are framed in commendation of Gouernment Populer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Democracie imperfit.</note>Whereunto I ſay, that this order of commanding, which chiefly reſpecteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, is not, nor hath bene in any Common-weale, bicauſe no ſuch equalitie of goods and honors could be obſerued. And he who taketh vpon him to beſtow them equally, ſhall proceed contrarie to nature. For as ſhe hath made ſome men more wiſe and aduiſed then others, ſo hath ſhe framed them to commaund, and others to obey. Some haue wiſedome and aptneſſe to direct, others haue ſtrength of bodie, and fitneſſe to execute what is commaunded. And touching libertie natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall (whereof Populer States do glory much) were that ſuch as is ſuppoſed, how could there be either Magiſtrate, lawe, or forme of gouernment: for where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie is, there can be no generall equalitie. Beſides that, all wiſe and learned
<pb facs="tcp:14349:5"/>
writers haue miſliked that kinde of gouernment. <hi>Plato</hi> calleth it a market, where all things are to be ſould. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alloweth not thereof, nor of the Ariſtocracie. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, it is impoſsible for any man to pleaſe the people, that taketh pleaſure in vertue. And how can a multitude (as a monſter of many heads) void of reaſon and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, determine any thing good or profitable? Alſo to aske counſell of the people, as was anciently vſed in States Populer, is (as it were) that wiſe men ſhould ſeeke to be informed by mad folks. Which moued <hi>Anacarſis</hi> to ſay (ſeeing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to propound matters, and the people to reſolue) that in <hi>Athens</hi> wiſe men moued queſtions, and fooles determined what ſhould be done. If any man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Populer Gouernment of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> continued more then three hundreth yeares: Thereunto may be anſwered, that the nature of that people is apt to be ſo gouerned. Beſides that, the moſt mutenous ſort of them are commonly from home in ſeruice of the warre vnder forraine Princes, and the reſt more tractable, do not care much how the State is handled. And among themſelues there is no diffidence, by reaſon the Nobilitie of thoſe Countreys were ſlaine, firſt at the battell of <hi>Sampac,</hi> and after at <hi>Baſil,</hi> the reſt willinglie baniſhed themſelues.</p>
            <p>By this which hath bene briefly ſaid,<note place="margin">Monarchie, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> appeareth how both the optimacie and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puler gouernments are ſubiect to mutation, diſorder and vtter ruine, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently how fortunate thoſe people are, whom God hath deſtined to liue in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of a ſucceſsiue royall Monarchie: where the Prince ſubmitteth himſelfe no leſſe to the lawes of nature, then he deſireth the ſubiects ſhould be obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto him, leauing to euery one libertie of life, and propertie in that he poſſeſſeth. Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion argueth Gods prouidence, and gouernment naturall, planteth a certaine reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proke loue betweene the Prince and the people. One other reaſon of nature appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, in that the Monarke is alone in ſoueraigntie: for as God onely ruleth the whole world, and as the ſunne alone giueth light to all creatures, ſo the people of one land do moſt naturally yeeld obedience to one head and commander. Yea, all nations were firſt ſo gouerned, as the <hi>Aſsirians, Perſians, Egiptians, Iewes, Grecians, Scithians, Turks, Tartars, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Spanyards, Polonians, Danes, &amp;c.</hi> and in the <hi>Indias</hi> were found no other gouernment. Neither do the ſacred Hiſtories make mention of other Rulers then Kings onely. And to confirme what hath bene ſaid of royall gouernment, reade the opinions of <hi>Plato, Homer, Herodotus, Xenophon, S. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, S. Ierome,</hi> with other as well diuine, as philoſophicall writers. Finally, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that Soueraigntie in one onely perſon is more honorable and magnificent, then if the ſame were diuided among a fewe Lords (as is vſed in the Ariſtocracie) or among the whole multitude, as in Populer Gouernments. And experience hath proued, that for direction and commandment in the warre, pluralitie of Gouernors haue almoſt euer receiued preiudice and diſhonor. Which moued the <hi>Romanes</hi> (at ſuch occations) to make a <hi>Dictator.</hi> The like was done by the <hi>Lacedemonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> and is (at this time) vſed of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whome they call <hi>gran Proueditore.</hi> By theſe reaſons and examples (omitting many other) appeareth, that the Monarchie royall, is a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment moſt reaſonable, moſt naturall, moſt honorable, and moſt neceſſary. And ſuch is the happineſſe of our fortune, that by diuine prouidence, there liueth not in any land a more perfit paterne of an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Prince, then is our preſent Soueraigne, who feareth God rightlie, and gouerneth her ſubiects iuſtlie: prudent in counſell, and valorous in execution. In proſperitie modeſt, in aduerſitie conſtant; faithfull to friends, and feared of enemies; affable to the good, and effroyable to the euill: vnder whoſe ſacred protection, our peace, our plentie, and our ſecuritie, hath many yeares proſpered.</p>

Theſe people were thoſe which deſtroyed the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; whereunto the Emperours themſelues gaue ſome occaſion by forſaking <hi>Rome,</hi> the antient Emperiall ſeate, and ſetling themſelues at <hi>Constantinople</hi>: For thereby the Weſt part of the Empire became weake, leſſe regarded, &amp; more eaſie to be harmed both of their owne miniſters, and others their enemies. Surely the deſtruction of ſo great an Empire builded vpon the blood of ſo many vertuous men, could not be loſt without the ſloath of Princes, infidelitie of miniſters, great forces, and much obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie in them, who aſſaulted the ſame: for not onely, one ſort of people, but many multitudes in that action conſpired. The firſt enemies, which came to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Roman Empire after the <hi>Cimbri</hi> (vanquiſhed by <hi>Marius</hi> the Romane) were the <hi>Viſigotti,</hi> which name in our language, may bee called <hi>Gotti</hi> of the Weſt. Theſe people, after ſome conflicts in the Empire, and through the ſufferance of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, long time continued their dwellings vpon the Riuer of <hi>Danubio.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at ſundrie occaſions, and ſundrie times, they aſſaulted the prouinces belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Empire, yet were they by the power of the Emperours from time to time impeached: and at laſt by <hi>Theodotio</hi> gloriouſly vanquiſhed. So that thereby being brought vnder his obedience, they could not againe make any King ouer them, but contented with the Emperours paie, vnder his gouernment and enſigne, they liued and ſerued. But <hi>Theodotio</hi> being dead, and leauing <hi>Arcadio</hi> and <hi>Honorio</hi> his ſonnes, heires of the Empire, (but not of his vertue and fortune) the time, with the Prince clearly altered and chaunged. <hi>Theodotio</hi> authorized vnto three parts of the Empire,<note place="margin">The Empire diuided into three gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> three gouernours. In the Eaſt, <hi>Ruffino,</hi> in the Weſt <hi>Stillicone,</hi> and in Affrica <hi>Gildo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio.</hi> Euerie one of theſe, determined after the death of their Prince, not to gouerne

as miniſters, but to poſſeſſe the countries as Princes. Of theſe three, <hi>Gildonio</hi> and <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fino,</hi> were at their beginnings oppreſſed: but <hi>Stillicone</hi> better diſſembling his intent, ſought to winne himſelfe credit with the new Emperours, &amp; neuertheleſſe diſturbe the quietneſſe of their ſtate.

by <hi>Attila</hi> their king, who not long before, to gouerne alone in his kingdome, had ſlaine <hi>Bleda</hi> his brother. Thus <hi>Attila</hi> became mightie, <hi>Andarico</hi> king of <hi>Zebedi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Attila his comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Italy.</note> and <hi>Velamer</hi> king of the <hi>Ostrogotti,</hi> were made as it were, his ſubiects. <hi>Attila</hi> being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Italy,</hi> beſieged <hi>Aquilegia,</hi> where without reſiſtance, hee continued two yeares, and during the ſiege, ſpoyled the country thereabouts, and diſperſed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſame: which (as hereafter ſhalbe declared) was the beginning of the citie of <hi>Vinegia.</hi> After the taking &amp; ruine of <hi>Aquilegia,</hi> and many other cities, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards <hi>Rome:</hi> from the ſpoyle whereof, at the requeſt of the Biſhop, he refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The reuerence &amp; reſpect which <hi>Attila</hi> did bear towards this Biſhop, was ſuch, as perſwaded him to leaue <hi>Italy,</hi> and retire himſelfe to <hi>Austria,</hi> where he died.

And the Romanes otherwhiles,<note place="margin">The cauſe of the election of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the VVeſt.</note> ſeeing themſelues aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, without leaue created an other Emperour or ſome deputie, to performe that office, (as did <hi>Maſsimo</hi> the Romane) after the death of <hi>Valentiniano,</hi> who conſtrained <hi>Eudoſſa</hi> lately wife to the Emperour, to take him to her husband.

Hee alſo tooke and ſpoyled di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe other Townes in <hi>Italy:</hi> and fraughting himſelfe and his Army with ſpoyle, returned into <hi>Affrica.</hi> The Romanes came home to <hi>Rome,</hi> and finding <hi>Maſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> dead, elected <hi>Auito</hi> a Romane, for Emperour. After the death of diuerſe other Emperours, the Empire of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> came to the hands of <hi>Zenone:</hi> and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Oreste</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Augustolo,</hi> who through ſubtiltie had vſurped that Empyre.

Thus we ſee, that in thoſe dayes the ancient Romane Empire was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the gouernment of theſe Princes. <hi>Zenone</hi> remaining in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded all the Empire in the Eaſt.<note place="margin">How the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Empyre became di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided.</note> The <hi>Ostrogotti</hi> gouerned <hi>Meſia</hi> and <hi>Pannonia.</hi> The <hi>Viſigotti, Sueui,</hi> and <hi>Alani,</hi> poſſeſſed <hi>Guaſcognia</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi> The <hi>Vandoli</hi> ruled <hi>Affrica.</hi> The <hi>Franchi</hi> and <hi>Burgundi</hi> liued in <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Eruli</hi> and <hi>Turingi</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in <hi>Italy.</hi> The kingdome of <hi>Ostrogotti</hi> came to the handes of <hi>Theodorico,</hi> Nephewe of <hi>Velamer,</hi> beeing in league with <hi>Zenone</hi> Emperour in the Eaſt, wrote vnto him, that it ſeemed a thing vniuſt to his people the <hi>Ostrogotti,</hi> that they beeing in vertue ſuperiours to all others, ſhould be inferiours in Empyre: And therfore he could not by any meanes hold them within the conſines of <hi>Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> It ſeemed therefore neceſſarie to ſuffer them to take armes, and ſeeke new Countries: But firſt hee thought good to let him vnderſtand thereof, to the intent hee might graunt them ſome country, where with his good fauour and their greater commoditie, they might inhabite. The Emperour <hi>Zenone,</hi> partly for feare, and partly for the deſire hee had to haue <hi>Odoacre</hi> driuen out of <hi>Italy,</hi> graunted that <hi>Theodorico</hi> might come againſt <hi>Odoacre,</hi> and take the poſſeſsion thereof. Then <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorico</hi> departed from <hi>Pannonia,</hi> leauing there the <hi>Zepedi</hi> his friends: and being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſlew <hi>Odoacre,</hi> and his ſonne; by whoſe example, hee tooke vnto him the title of King of <hi>Italy,</hi> making <hi>Rauenna</hi> his royall ſeate, moued by the ſame reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that induced <hi>Valentiniano</hi> there to dwell. <hi>Theodorico</hi> was a man both for warre and peace moſte excellent:<note place="margin">Theodorico king of Oſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotti a moſt vertuous Prince.</note> for in the one, hee was alwaies victorious, and in the other generally profited the cities and people to him ſubiect. Hee diuided the <hi>Ostrogotti</hi> with their Captaines into ſundry townes, to the end that in the warre hee might commaund them, and in the peace correct them: hee enlarged the Citie of <hi>Rauenna</hi> and reſtored <hi>Rome</hi> in all thinges (the diſcipline of warre except) giuing to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes euerie other honour: &amp; with his only authoritie kept in awe all the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Kings vſurpers of the Empyre. Hee built townes and ſortreſſes betweene the Alpes, and the point of the ſea <hi>Adriatico,</hi> the rather to empeach the paſſage of other barbarous people that ſhould aſſaile <hi>Italy.</hi> And had not his great vertue bene in the end of his life blotted with ſome cruelties; committed vppon ſuſpition of his kingdome (as the death of <hi>Simmaco</hi> and <hi>Boetio,</hi> men of moſt godly life) he had bene in all reſpects worthy of honour and memorie. For the vertue and bountie of him, did not only repaire <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> of the afliction committed by the barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but alſo reduced them into an order and gouernment moſte fortunate. And ſurely, if any times were euer in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the other Prouinces there-abouts by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of barbarous oppreſsion miſerable, they were thoſe which happened from the time of <hi>Arcadio</hi> and <hi>Onorio,</hi> till his dayes. For who ſo ſhall conſider the great miſchiefs which happen to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales by the variatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gouernment, or change of the Prince, without any diſſention and diuiſion, ſhall finde the ſame alone of force inough to ruine any ſtate or kingdome, how mightie ſoeuer. It may therefore be imagined how great miſeries the Romane Prouinces endured: for they did not only alter their gouernment, but alſo their lawes, their cuſtomes, their maner of life, their religion, their tounge, their apparrell, and their names. All which things (nay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of them conſidered vnſeene) would moue the hardeſt heart to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſsion. At that time many cities were ouerthrowen, many begun, &amp; many enlarged. Among thoſe that were ruined, were <hi>Aquilegia, Luni, Chiuſi, Popolonia, Fieſole,</hi> and others. Of thoſe which were buylt new, were <hi>Vinegia, Siena, Ferrara, Aquila,</hi> and other townes and caſtels, which for breuitie I omit. Thoſe which of ſmall Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came great, were <hi>Fiorenza, Genoua, Piſa, Milan, Napoli,</hi> and <hi>Bologna,</hi> to the which may be ioyned the ruine and repaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> with diuerſe others Citties in like

ſort defaced and after amended. Among theſe ruines, and theſe new people, there grewe vp new languages, ſince that time vſed in <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which mixed with the ancient tongues of thoſe Countries, and the Romane ſpeech, haue framed languages neuer before time knowen. The names alſo of thoſe Prouinces, riuers, lakes, ſeas, and men, were vtterly changed. For <hi>France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spayne,</hi> be full of new names, from the olde farre differing: as appeareth (omitting many others). The riuers of <hi>Po, Garda</hi> and the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> which are names diuers from thoſe of auncient time vſed. Men likewiſe commonly in thoſe dayes called <hi>Caeſari, Pompei,</hi> and ſuch like: are new baptized, <hi>Peter, Mathew,</hi> and ſo forth. But among ſo many variations, the chaunge of Religion was not the leaſt, for thoſe of the ancient faith, contending with the miracles of the new, wrought among men occaſion of great diſcord: but had the chriſtian Religion bene vnited, the diſorders had not bene ſo great. For the <hi>Greeke</hi> church, the <hi>Romane</hi> church, and the church of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> contended one againſt the other. Beſides them, many other differents aroſe among the chriſtian people, &amp; into many opinions diuided the world. An example whereof was <hi>Affrica,</hi> which ſuffered more affliction by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the opinion of <hi>Arius</hi> (which the <hi>Vandoli</hi> beleeued) then by any other cauſe either of their couetouſnes or naturall crueltie. During the multitudes of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, euerie man beare (as it were) in his face, the markes of his diſcontented mind. For beſides the manifold miſchiefes by them endured, the greater number wanted the knowledge of God, by whome all creatures hope to be comforted. For the moſt of thoſe people being ignorant of the true God, wanting helpe and hope, moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably dyed. Thus it appeareth, that <hi>Theodorico</hi> deſerued no ſmall commendation, being the firſt that appeaſed ſo many troubles. For within theſe 28. yeares which he reigned in <hi>Italy,</hi> he reduced it to ſo great order and honour, as the markes of miſerie were ſcantly perceiued. But he being dead,<note place="margin">The death of Theodorico.</note> and leauing <hi>Atalarico</hi> for king (who was the ſonne of <hi>Amalaſciunta</hi> his daughter) <hi>Italy</hi> in ſhort ſpace returned to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſorders. For <hi>Attalarico</hi> ſhortly after his graundfather died, left the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his mother, and ſhe making <hi>Theodato</hi> her miniſter in the gouernment, was by him betraied. <hi>Theodato</hi> by this meane made King, became odious to the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strogotti,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtiniano</hi> the Emperour hoped the rather to driue him from <hi>Italy.</hi> To performe that enterpriſe, he deputed <hi>Belliſario</hi> to be his Lieftenaunt, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie conquered <hi>Affrica,</hi> and chaſing from thence the <hi>Vandoli,</hi> reduced the ſame to obedience of the Empyre. <hi>Belliſario</hi> alſo conquered <hi>Sicilia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The acts of Belliſario.</note> &amp; from thence paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he ſurprized <hi>Napoli,</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Gotti</hi> receiuing theſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes, killed their king <hi>Theodato</hi> as the cheife occaſion of their miſaduenture. In his place was choſen <hi>Vitigete,</hi> who after a few conflicts, was by <hi>Belliſario</hi> beſieged, and in <hi>Rauenna</hi> take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then was <hi>Belliſario</hi> before he had performed the whole victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by <hi>Iustiniano</hi> reuoked, &amp; to his charge, were appointed <hi>Giouanni</hi> and <hi>Vitale,</hi> men both for vertue and conuerſation farre inferiour: wherfore the <hi>Gotti</hi> tooke heart, and created a king called <hi>Ildouado,</hi> who was at that time Gouernour of <hi>Verona.</hi>

Wherfore <hi>Iustiniano</hi> thought good to ſend him again into <hi>Italy,</hi> who being come thither with ſmal forces, rather loſt the reputation he had gotten before, then encreaſed the ſame. For <hi>Totila,</hi> as it were before the face of <hi>Belliſario</hi> (who was then with his armie at <hi>Hostia</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Rome</hi> and tooke it. Then conſidering with him ſelfe that he could neither hold it, nor leaue it without daunger, he razed the greateſt part of the Citie, driuing the people from thence, and leading away the Senatours as priſoners, which <hi>Belliſario</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:14349:10"/>
little regarding, marched with his armie vnto <hi>Calauria,</hi> to meete there with ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſent in his aide from <hi>Greece.</hi> Thus <hi>Belliſario</hi> ſeeing <hi>Rome</hi> abandoned, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him ſelfe an honourable enterpriſe: and entering into the ruines of <hi>Rome,</hi> (with what ſpeed he poſsibly could) repaired the walles of the citie, &amp; called home the inhabitants. But fortune (as it ſeemeth) enemie to ſo laudable an atempt, appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelfe. For <hi>Iustiniano</hi> the Emperour at the ſame time happened to be aſſaulted by the <hi>Parthi,</hi> and for that cauſe called home <hi>Belliſario</hi>: hee to obey his maſter, leſt <hi>Italy</hi> at the diſcretion of <hi>Tottila,</hi> who anew poſſeſſed <hi>Rome,</hi> but not with ſo great crueltie as he had before time there vſed. For being entreated by <hi>S. Benedetto,</hi> (of whome in thoſe daies there was holden a great opinion of holines) he endeuoured him ſelfe rather to amend, then marre that citie. In this meane while, <hi>Iustiniano</hi> had concluded a peace with the <hi>Parthi,</hi> &amp; intending to ſend a new ſupply into <hi>Italy,</hi> was empeached to performe that intent by a new people of the North called <hi>Sclaui,</hi> who hauing paſſed <hi>Danubio,</hi> aſſailed <hi>Illiria</hi> and <hi>Thracia</hi>: ſo as by that meanes <hi>Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila</hi> got into his hands all <hi>Italy.</hi> But ſo ſoone as <hi>Iustiniano</hi> had ſuppreſſed the <hi>Sclaui,</hi> he ſent thither his armie conducted by <hi>Narſete</hi> an Eunuch, who diſtreſſed the forces of <hi>Tottila,</hi>

By meane of which victorie, the name of <hi>Gotti,</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> was clearely extirped, hauing there remained from the reigne of <hi>Theodorico,</hi> vnto <hi>Teia</hi> their Kings, threeſcore and ten yeares. But ſo ſoone as <hi>Italy</hi> was deliuered from the <hi>Gotti, Iustiniano</hi> died, leauing <hi>Iustino</hi> his ſonne to ſucceed him, who through counſell of <hi>Sophia</hi> his mother,<note place="margin">The acts of Longino.</note> reuoked <hi>Narſete</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; in his place, ſent <hi>Longino</hi> his ſonne thither.

In which diuiſion, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted no more honour to <hi>Rome,</hi> then to other townes, becauſe he tooke from thence the Conſuls and Senate, (which names till that day had bene euer there mainteined) reducing all vnder one Duke, who was yearely ſent thither from <hi>Rauenna,</hi> and his gouernment called the Romane <hi>Dukedome</hi>: but the generall Gouernour, who continually remained at <hi>Rauenna</hi> by the Emperours commaundement, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned all <hi>Italy</hi> vnder him, was called <hi>Eſarco.</hi> This diuiſion, made the ruine of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to be more eaſie, and gaue opportunitie to the <hi>Longobardi</hi> to vſurpe the ſame.

               <hi>Vuni,</hi> who after the death of <hi>Attila</hi> (as is aforeſaid) were returned into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Then he came againe into <hi>Italy,</hi> where finding the ſame into many partes diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſodenly wan <hi>Pania, Millan, Verona, Vicenza,</hi> all <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and the more part of <hi>Flamminia,</hi> now called <hi>Romagna.</hi> So that perſwading himſelfe through ſo many and ſo ſpeedie ſucceſſes, to haue already (as it were) gotten the victorie of all <hi>Italy,</hi> hee celebrated a ſolemne feaſt in <hi>Verona,</hi> whereat, being by drinking much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very merry, and ſeeing the skull of <hi>Comundo</hi> full of wine, hee cauſed the ſame to be preſented to the Queene <hi>Roſmunda,</hi> who ſat ouer againſt him at the table (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto her, with ſo loude a voice that euerie one might heare him) that ſhe ſhould now at this feaſt drinke with her father: which ſpeech pearced the Lady to the heart, and ſhe forthwith determined to reuenge the ſame. Then knowing that <hi>Almachilde</hi> (a valiant young gentleman of <hi>Lombardi</hi>) loued a maiden of hers, of whome hee obtained to lie with her, and the Queene beeing priuy to that conſent, did her ſelfe tarry in the place of their meeting, which beeing without light, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machilde</hi> came thither, and ſuppoſing to haue lien with the mayden, enioyed the Queene her miſtreſſe, which done, the Queene diſcouered her ſelfe and ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that it was in his power to kill <hi>Alboino,</hi> and poſſeſſe her with her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome foreuer: but if hee refuſed ſo to do, ſhee would procure that <hi>Alboino</hi> ſhould kill him, as one that had abuſed his wife.

During theſe troubles, <hi>Iustiniano</hi> the Emperour died, and in his place was elected <hi>Tiberio,</hi> who beeing occupied in the warres againſt the <hi>Parthi,</hi> could not go to the reliefe of <hi>Italy.</hi> Whereby <hi>Longino</hi> hoped that time would well ſerue him, with the countenance of <hi>Roſmunda</hi> and helpe of her treaſure, to become King of <hi>Lombardy</hi> and all <hi>Italy.</hi> And conferring his intent with the Queene, perſwaded her to kill <hi>Almachilde,</hi> and take him for her husband: ſhee accepted and agreed vnto that which hee perſwaded, preparing a cup of wine poiſoned, and with her owne hand ſhee offered the ſame to <hi>Almachilde,</hi> comming from a bath hote and thriftie: hee hauing drunke halfe the wine, and finding his bodie thereby greatly moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, miſtruſting the poiſon, enforced <hi>Roſmunda</hi> to drinke the reſt, whereof both the one and the other within fewe houres died, and <hi>Longino</hi> bereft of his expectation to become King.<note place="margin">The acts of Clefi.</note> The <hi>Longobardi</hi> in the meane while aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelues in <hi>Pauia,</hi> (which was the chiefe Cittie of their kingdome) elected there <hi>Clefi</hi> their King, who reedified <hi>Imola,</hi> which had bene ruinated by <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſete,</hi> hee wan <hi>Rimino,</hi> and almoſt euerie place from thence to <hi>Rome</hi>: but in the midſt of theſe his victories, hee died. This <hi>Clefi</hi> was ſo cruell, not onely to ſtrangers, but alſo to his owne ſubiects the <hi>Longobardi,</hi> as they were ſo terrified with his kingly authoritie, that after his daies, they determined no more to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie King, but elected amongſt them ſelues thirtie perſons,<note place="margin">The Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di refuſed to be gouerned by Kings.</note> whome they called Dukes, giuing them iuriſdiction ouer the reſt: which was the cauſe that the <hi>Longobardi</hi> did not proceed in the conqueſt of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and that their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did not extend further then <hi>Beneuento,</hi> and that <hi>Rome, Rauenna, Cremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Mantoua, Padoua, Monſelice, Parma, Bologna, Faenza, Furli,</hi> and <hi>Ceſena,</hi> ſome of them defended them ſelues a time, and ſome other were neuer taken.

victorie, and in the end draue them out of <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Longobardi</hi> being come to this eſtate, the <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Longino</hi> made with them an agreement. The effect thereof was, that euerie one of them ſhould lay downe their armes, and enioy ſo much as they poſſeſſed.<note place="margin">At what time the Biſhops of Rome, aſpired to authoritie.</note> In that time the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> began to aſpire vnto more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then they had in times paſt: for by meane of the holy life of <hi>S.

At which time beganne the order of Knighthood of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The originall of knights of Ieruſalem.</note> which to this day continueth, and is the chiefe obſtacle to the Turkes. About that time alſo grew the order of the Knights, <hi>Templarii:</hi> which for their euil life was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after ſuppreſſed. In diuerſe times following, diuerſe accidents happened: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many nations and many particuler men were aduaunced. For the furniſhing of this enterpriſe, the Kinges of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Piſani, Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> paſſed the ſea, and gained great reputation, fighting in fortune variable, till the time of <hi>Saladino</hi> the <hi>Saraſine:</hi> whoſe vertue (the rather through diſcord of the Chriſtians) did in the ende recouer all, that before had bene got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. So were the Chriſtians after foure ſcorce and tenne yeares driuen out of thoſe Countries, which with great honour and happineſſe they had wonne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. After the death of <hi>Vrbano, Paſcale ſecundo</hi> was created Pope:<note place="margin">Pope Paſcale 2.</note> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico</hi> the fourth became Emperour, who went to <hi>Rome,</hi> pretending friendſhip to the Pope, but beeing arriued there, by force hee tooke the Pope priſoner, and put him with all his Clergie in priſon: from whence they could not bee diſcharged, till the Pope had graunted, that the Emperour might diſpoſe of the Churches in <hi>Germany</hi> as himſelfe thought good. Then died the Counteſſe <hi>Matilda,</hi> and made the Church heire of all her Countrey. After the death of <hi>Paſcale</hi> and <hi>Enrico</hi> the fourth ſucceeded diuerſe Popes, and diuerſe Emperours, till at length, to the Papacie was elected <hi>Aliſſandro tertio,</hi> and to the Empire,<note place="margin">Pope Aleſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Federigo Sueuo</hi> called <hi>Barbaroſſa.</hi> The popes in that time had manie quarrelles with the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Emperours: which were encreaſed in the raigne of <hi>Barbaroſſa.

This anſwere diſpleaſed <hi>Aliſſandro,</hi> who conceauing thereby, that the Emperour was inclined to fauour the Antipope, did excommunicate him, and fled to <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Fraunce. Federigo</hi> in the meane while, proceeding in the Warres of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> tooke <hi>Millan,</hi> and razed it: which was the cauſe, that <hi>Verona, Padoua,</hi> and <hi>Vicenza</hi> (by common conſent) determined to reſiſt him. Then died the Antipope, in whoſe place <hi>Federigo</hi> created <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Cremona.</hi> The <hi>Romanes</hi> by meanes of the Popes abſence, and the buſines of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> had recouered a little authoritie in <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; began to command ſome Townes vnder them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe the <hi>Tuſculani</hi> would not yeeld to their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, they went popularly to aſſaile them; who being aided by <hi>Federigo,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> were ouerthrowne with ſo great ſlaughter, as after that Ouerthrow <hi>Rome</hi> was neuer well peopled, nor rich. In this meane ſpace, Pope <hi>Aliſſandro</hi> was returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> perſwading himſelfe that through the enmitie of the <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Federigo,</hi> he might there ſafely remaine: and the rather, by reaſon of the Enemies which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> Neuertheles, <hi>Federigo</hi> (ſetting aſide all reſpectes) beſieged <hi>Rome:</hi> where <hi>Aliſſandro</hi> tarried not his comming, but fled to <hi>Gulielmo</hi> King of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia,</hi> who after the death of <hi>Ruggiero</hi> remained Heire of that Kingdome. <hi>Federigo</hi> dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thence by the Plague, left the Siege, and returned into <hi>Germany.</hi> The Townes of <hi>Lombardy</hi> which were rebelled, to the end they might the rather recouer <hi>Pauia</hi> &amp; <hi>Tortona,</hi> (which ſtood for the Emperor) built a new Cittie, to be the refuge of that Warre, calling the ſame <hi>Aliſſandria,</hi> in honour of the Pope <hi>Aliſſandro,</hi> and in deſpite of the Emperour <hi>Federigo.</hi> Then died <hi>Guidone</hi> Antipope: in whoſe place <hi>Giouanni</hi> of <hi>Fermo</hi> was created. He, through the fauour of the Emperours Faction in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefiaſcone,</hi> there dwelled: Pope <hi>Aliſſandro</hi> in the meane time was gone into <hi>Tuſcolo,</hi> called thether by that People; hoping that with his authoritie he might defend them from the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Thither came Embaſſadors from <hi>Enrico</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto the Pope, that their King was not culpable in the murther of <hi>Thomas</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as he had bene publiquely ſlandered. For triall whereof, the Pope ſent two Cardinals into <hi>England,</hi> to examine the truth of that matter: who found the King not guiltie.

Then died alſo <hi>Gulielmo</hi> king of <hi>Napoli,</hi> who hauing one onely ſonne called <hi>Tancredi,</hi> the pope determined to take that kingdome from him, but the nobilitie thereof would not conſent to the pope, reſoluing to yeelde their obedience to <hi>Tancredi.</hi> At that time <hi>Celestino tertio</hi> was pope,<note place="margin">Pope Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 3.</note> who deſirous to take the kingdome from <hi>Tancredi,</hi> ſought meanes that <hi>Enrico</hi> ſonne of <hi>Federigo</hi> ſhould be made Emperour, and promiſed him the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he ſhould reſtore vnto the church all thoſe townes thereunto belonging.

out by the ſame misfortune, did alſo flie thither. Thus conſtrained by neceſsitie, they abandoned faire and fertile countries, to inhabit theſe ſteril and paludious places void of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie. And yet, becauſe great numbers of people were at one inſtant come thither, they made that place not onely habitable, but alſo pleaſant: ordeining among themſelues lawes and orders, which amidſt ſo great ruines of <hi>Italy,</hi> they obſerued; and within ſhort ſpace encreaſed in force and reputation. For beſides the inhabitants aforeſaid, many of the cities of <hi>Lombardy</hi> (chiefly thoſe that feared the cruelty of their king <hi>Clefi</hi>) fled thither, which was no ſmall encreaſe to that citie. So that in the time of <hi>Pipino</hi> king of <hi>France,</hi> when at the requeſt of the Pope, he came to driue the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardi</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was agreed in Capitulations, betwixt him and the Emperour of <hi>Grecia,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Beneuento</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſhould be ſubiects neither to the one nor the other, but among themſelues enioy libertie.

The <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> ſometimes in libertie, and ſometime in ſeruitude to the houſe of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Viſconti,</hi> were without reputation, and among the meaner Potentates accounted. For all the principall Lords and Potentates, were at that time of their owne ſubiectes vtterly diſarmed. The Duke <hi>Philippo</hi> liuing at home, and not ſuffering himſelfe to be ſeene, his warres were altogither directed by miniſters. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſo ſoone as they began to make warres by land, loſt all that glorie which before vpon the ſea they had gotten. And (following the cuſtome of other <hi>Italians</hi>) by the direction of ſtrangers gouerned their warres. The Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of religion, and the Queene <hi>Giouanna</hi> a woman, did laie by their Armes: doing that for neceſsitie which others had done by election. The <hi>Florentines</hi> alſo, to like neceſsitie yeelded: for their ſundry ciuil diuiſions among themſelues, had clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extirped the Nobilitie, and left the Common weale to be gouerned by thoſe that had bene brought vp in marchandiſe, and were therby enforced to abide the fortune of others. The diſcipline of warre then remained, only in the poore Princes, &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that wanted liuing; and they not moued by any deſire of glorie, but rather to become rich and aſſured, armed themſelues. They then being wel practiſed in the warres (not hauing any other trade to liue) ſought by the wars to make themſelues ſtrong and honourable. Among this number for their value, moſt renowned, were <hi>Carmignuola, Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſco Sforza, Nicholo Piccinino,</hi> brought vp by <hi>Braccio, Agnolo della Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gola, Lorenzo,</hi> and <hi>Michelletto Attenduly: Tartaglia, Giacopaccio Cecolino da Parugia, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholo di Tolentino, Guido Torello, Antonio dal Ponte ad Hera,</hi> and others. Beſides them were thoſe great Lordes of whom I haue alreadie ſpoken. And with them, may be numbred the <hi>Orſini,</hi> and <hi>Calonneſi,</hi> Barrons of <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſome other Gentlemen of the kingdome, and of <hi>Lombardy:</hi> who making a miſterie or art of the warre, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues a ſecret league and intelligence, whereby they protracted the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice for their profit. And ſo, the Princes for whom they ſerued, were on both ſides looſers.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG other great and maruellous orders of the auncient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales, &amp; principallities (at this time decaied) was that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by new Townes and Citties were from time to time builded. For there is nothing more worthie an excellent Prince, or well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued common weale, nor more profitable to any Country, then the building vp of new Townes, where men may with commoditie, for defence and tilladge, aſſemble themſelues: which thing thoſe people might eaſily do, hauing in cuſtome to ſend dwellers into ſuch Countries as were either vnpeopled, or conquered; which people, were in thoſe dayes called <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</hi> For beſides, that this order occaſioned new Townes to be built, the ſame alſo did make the Country conquered, to be more aſſured to the Conquerers thereof. It alſo repleniſhed the voyd places, and mainteined the people in ſuch orders as they were planted: which wrought this effect, that men moſt commodiouſly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, did moſt multiply. They were alſo in the offence of others the more readie, and in defence of themſelues more aſſured. That cuſtome (being through negligence of common weales and Princes of this time, diſcontinued) doth occaſion the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ruine of their Countries, becauſe that only maketh euery gouernment aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and euery Country (as is beforeſaid) plentifully inhabited. The aſſurance grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, becauſe <hi>Collonies</hi> planted in any prouince newly conquered, is (as it were) a caſtle and gard, to hold the ſame in obedience. Beſides that, no country wel inhabited, can maintaine the inhabitants thereof, nor continue them as they be planted, without that rule and order: for all places are not plentifull or wholeſome, which is the cauſe that the people in the one do abound, and want in the other. So as if no meane be, to take away where is abundance, &amp; ſupply where want is, that Country in ſhort ſpace muſt of force be ruined; becauſe the one part thereof, through the ſmall number of inhabitants becommeth deſolate, and the other being ouercharged, oppreſſed with pouertie. And for that nature could not reforme this diſorder, it is neceſſarie, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry ſhould do it. For vnwholeſome Countries planted full of people, comming thither all togither, do make the ſame healthful, by reaſon that the tilling of the earth doth alter the ſoyle; and the fiers, do greatly purge the aire; which things nature by her ſelfe could not. The experience thereof is ſeene by the Cittie of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſeated in a place paludious, and vnwholeſome. Notwithſtanding, the aſſemblie of many inhabitants come thither at one inſtant, did make the ſame healthy inough. <hi>Piſa</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, through the contagion of the aire, was neuer repleniſhed, but when <hi>Genoua,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:14349:21"/>
and the riuers thereto belonging, were by the <hi>Saraſins</hi> deſtroyed, it enforced the people (driuen from their natiue countrey) to flye thither, and make that place well inhabited, and ſtrong. This cuſtome of ſending <hi>Collonies</hi> being diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the occaſion that countreyes conquered, are holden with more difficultie; thoſe that be emptie are not ſupplied, and countreyes ouer full are not disburthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whereby, manie parts of the world, and chiefly <hi>Italy,</hi> in reſpect of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times, are become deſarts. The reaſon thereof is, that there hath not bene, nor is not in Princes, anie deſire of true glorie, nor in Common-weales anie ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that meriteth commendation. In the old time we ſee, that through vertue of theſe <hi>Collonies,</hi> Citties were often made new, and ſome others (alreadie begun) encreaſed: of which number was the Cittie of <hi>Florence,</hi> begunne by the people of <hi>Fieſole,</hi> and inlarged by <hi>Collonies.</hi> A thing moſt true it is (as <hi>Dante</hi> and <hi>Iohn Villano</hi> haue written) that the Cittie of <hi>Fieſole</hi> being ſet on the top of a mountaine, to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion their markets to bee the more frequented, and giue commoditie to thoſe that with their merchandize would reſort thither, did giue order that they ſhould not clime vp the hill, but ſtay in the plaine, betwixt the foote of the mountaine, &amp; the riuer <hi>Arno.</hi> Theſe markets (as I iudge) were occaſion of the firſt building in that place. The merchants alſo being deſirous to haue ſtorehouſes commodious for the receiuing of wares, made buildings there, which in time became houſes of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Afterwards, when the <hi>Romanes</hi> (hauing vanquiſhed the <hi>Carthagineſi)</hi> had made <hi>Italy</hi> from forreine warres ſecure, in great numbers there they multiplied; for me<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

The ſecuritie which grew in <hi>Italy</hi> by reputation of the <hi>Roman</hi> common-weale, might occaſion the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the inhabitants to bee ſo great, as made this place to become (as it were) in forme of a Towne, and was at the beginning called <hi>Arnina.</hi> After that time, ciuill warres happened in <hi>Rome,</hi> firſt betweene <hi>Mario</hi> and <hi>Silla,</hi> then betwixt <hi>Ceſare</hi> and <hi>Pompeio,</hi> and at laſt betweene the murtherers of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and thoſe which ſought to reuenge his death. It ſeemeth therefore, that firſt by <hi>Silla,</hi> and next by thoſe three Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> (that after the reuenge made for <hi>Caeſar</hi>) diuided the Empire, <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies</hi> were ſent to <hi>Fieſole,</hi> who either all, or part, did plant their dwellings in the plaine neare vnto the Towne alreadie begun: inſomuch, as the ſame was much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and ſo well repleniſhed with buildings, men, and other things neceſſarie for ciuill life, as it became to be numbred among the Citties of <hi>Italy.</hi> Yet whence this name <hi>Firenze</hi> ſhould be deriued,<note place="margin">VVhereof the name of Flo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> diuers men do diuerſly hold opinion. Some ſuppoſe it ſo called of <hi>Florino,</hi> one of the chiefe of the <hi>Colloni.</hi> Others would not conſent that it was called <hi>Florentia</hi> at the beginning, but <hi>Fluentia,</hi> becauſe it was neare the riuer of <hi>Arno,</hi> which floweth. And they alledge the authoritie of <hi>Plinny,</hi> where he ſaith, that the people <hi>Fluentini</hi> be neare vnto <hi>Arno:</hi> which may be falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Plinny</hi> maketh demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration where the <hi>Florentines</hi> were ſeated, not how they were called. And that word <hi>Fluentini</hi> muſt needes be corrupted, becauſe <hi>Frontino</hi> and <hi>Cornelio Tacito</hi> (who wrote almoſt in the time of <hi>Plinny</hi>) do call the Towne <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia,</hi> and the people <hi>Florentini</hi>; for that long ſince in the time of <hi>Tiberio,</hi> they were gouerned according to the cuſtome of other Cities in <hi>Italy. Cornelio</hi> reporteth alſo, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> had ſent Embaſſadors to the Emperor, praying, that the waters of <hi>Chiane</hi> might not diſcend vppon their Countrie; neither is it reaſonable, that the Citie ſhould haue in one time two names. I beleeue therefore it was alwaies called <hi>Florentia.</hi> For what cauſe ſoeuer it was ſo named, or for what cauſe ſoeuer it had the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14349:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beginning, moſt ſure it is, that vnder the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> it had the foundation, &amp; in the reigne of the firſt Emperours, Writers did make mention thereof. Moreouer, at ſuch time as the barbarous people did perſecute the Empire, <hi>Florence</hi> was by <hi>Tottila</hi> King of the <hi>Ostragotti</hi> defaced, and after 250. yeares by <hi>Carlo Magno</hi> reedified: from which time, till the yeares after Chriſt 1215. it continued vnder that fortune which others did, who then commanded in <hi>Italy.</hi> In which time, firſt gouerned there the poſteritie of <hi>Carlo,</hi> then <hi>Barengarii,</hi> and laſt of all the Emperours of <hi>Germanie,</hi> as hath bene in our vniuerſall diſcourſe before declared. The <hi>Florentines</hi> could not in thoſe times increaſe or do anie thing worthie memorie, for the authoritie of them, vnto whom it was ſubiect: notwithſtanding, in the yeare 1010. and the day of <hi>S. Romolo,</hi> (a ſolemne Feaſt with the <hi>Fieſolane)</hi> they ſurprized <hi>Fieſole,</hi> and demoliſhed the ſame; which they did, either with conſent of the Emperours, or elſe at ſuch times as one Emperor being dead, the other was not elected, whereby euerie man (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) remained at libertie. But ſince the Popes tooke vnto themſelues more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Germane</hi> Emperours grew weake, euerie Towne in that Prouince with leſſe reuerence to their Prince, was gouerned. Inſomuch, as in the yere 1080. in the time of <hi>Arrigo</hi> the third, <hi>Italy</hi> was openly diuided into faction betwixt him and the Church: notwithſtanding the <hi>Florentines</hi> maintained themſelues vnited, all the yere 1215. yelding to the victorious, without aſpiring farther tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſaue themſelues. But as to the bodies of men, the longer they bee healthie, the more dangerous and mortall are the ſickneſſes, when they happen: ſo <hi>Florence</hi> the more ſlowlie it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the factions, the more ſpeedily and greeuouſly it was by them afterwards afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The firſt occaſion of diuiſion in that Citie, is moſt publiquely knowen, becauſe it hath bene written by <hi>Dante</hi> and diuers others: neuertheles I thinke good briefely to ſpeake thereof. There was in <hi>Fiorence</hi> (among others) of the mightie Families,<note place="margin">The firſt deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> 
               <hi>Buondelmonti,</hi> and <hi>Vberti</hi>; next vnto them were the <hi>Amidei</hi> and <hi>Donati.</hi> In the houſe of <hi>Donati</hi> was a Gentlewoman, a widow and rich, who hauing one onely daughter, a maiden of much beautie, whom within her ſelfe, ſhee determined to marrie vnto <hi>Buondelmonti</hi> a yong Gentleman, and the chiefe of his houſe. This her intent, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through negligence or delay of time (none beeing made priuie thereof) was deferred ſo long, that <hi>Buondelmonti</hi> was contracted to the daughter of <hi>Amidei:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe greatly diſcontented, &amp; ſuppoſing it were poſsible with the beautie of her daughter to ſtay the marriage, before the ſame ſhould be ſolemnized: one day, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Buondelmonti</hi> comming towards her houſe, came downe, her daughter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and meeting him at the gate, ſaid, I am very glad that you are now become ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, yet was it my meaning you ſhould haue had this my daughter, and with thoſe words (ſhe opened the gate) and ſhewed her vnto him. The Gentleman beholding the beautie of the maiden (which indeed was rare) and therewith conſidering that her parentage and portion was not inferiour to hers, whom he had alreadie taken, became exceedingly deſirous to haue her. Then, not reſpecting his faith alreadie giuen, nor the iniurie he did in breaking the ſame, nor yet the inconuenience that might enſue thereof, ſaid: Sith it hath pleaſed you to reſerue your daughter for me, I ſhould bee vnthankfull (beeing yet all in time) to refuſe her. After the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of theſe words (without farther delay) hee married her. This marriage beeing knowen, highly offended all the Familie of <hi>Amidei,</hi> and <hi>Vbarti:</hi> who were by his firſt marriage, allied. Then aſſembling themſelues, and conſulting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the ende concluded, that ſuch an iniurie might not bee borne without ſhame; nor the reuenge thereunto due, could bee other than the death of <hi>Buondelmonti.</hi> And albeit ſome did fore-caſt the inconueniences that might followe ſuch an Action: yet <hi>Moſcha Lamberti</hi> ſayde, that who ſo euer caſteth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14349:22"/>
all doubts, ſhould neuer reſolue anie thing; alleadging the auncient Prouerbe, <hi>A thing once done, is past remedie.</hi> Then gaue they the charge of this murther to bee performed by <hi>Moſcha, Stiatta, Vberti, Lambertuccio, Amidei, Odorigo Fifanti.</hi> Theſe men in the morning of Eaſter day, at the houre of Reſurrection, aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the houſes of the <hi>Amidei</hi>; by which ſtreete, <hi>Buondelmonti</hi> paſſed the bridge vpon a white horſe: and ſuppoſing (as it ſeemeth) that it had bene a thing as eaſie to forget an iniurie, as renounce a marriage, was at the foote of the bridge vnder an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Mars</hi> (which there is ſtanding) aſſaulted, and ſlaine. This murther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the whole Citie, the one halfe tooke part with <hi>Buondelmonti,</hi> the other with <hi>Vberti.</hi> Theſe Families, by reaſon they were ſtrong in houſes, towers, and men, fought manie yeares, before the one could chaſe the other out of the Cittie: till at length (without anie firme peace made) a truce was taken, which according vnto occaſion, was ſometimes kept, and ſometimes broken. <hi>Florence</hi> continued in theſe troubles, till the time of <hi>Federigo</hi> the ſecond: who being alſo King of <hi>Napoli,</hi> was perſwaded hee might encreaſe his dominion againſt the Church. And to make his authoritie more aſſured in <hi>Toſcana,</hi> he fauoured the <hi>Vberti</hi> and their followers, who thereby draue out the <hi>Buondelmonti:</hi>

Thoſe that followed the faction of <hi>Guelfi,</hi> were <hi>Buondelmonti, Narli, Roſsi, Freſcobaldi, Mozzi, Baldi, Pulci, Gherardini, Faraboſchi, Bagneſi, Guidalotti, Sachetti, Manieri, Lucardeſi, Chiaramonti, Compiobbeſi, Caualcanti, Giandonati, Gianfigliazzi, Scali, Gualerotti, Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Bostichi, Tornaquinci, Vecchietti, Toſinghi, Arregucci, Agli, Sitii, Adimari, Viſdomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Donati, Pazzi, della Bella, Ardinghi, Tebaldi, Cherchi.</hi> For the <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> were <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berti, Mannelli, Vbriachi, Fifanti, Amidei, Infanganti, Maleſpini, Scolari, Guidi, Galli, Capardi, Lamberti, Soldanieri, Capriani, Toſchi, Ameri, Palermini, Migliorelli, Pigli, Baruchi, Cattani, Agollanti, Brunelleſchi, Caponſachi, Eliſei, Abbati, Tedaldini, Giuochi, Caligai.</hi> Beſides theſe noble houſes, manie popular families ioyned in that action: ſo that welneare all the Cittie became corrupted with this diuiſion. But the <hi>Guelfi</hi> being driuen out, retyred themſelues into Townes of the Vale of <hi>Arno,</hi> where their chiefe places of ſtrength were, and (the beſt they could) againſt the furie of their enemies defended themſelues. <hi>Federigo</hi> then dying, ſuch as remained in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and were men neuterall, hauing alſo credite with the people, thought better to reunite the Cittie, than holding it in diuiſion, vtterly to ouerthrow it. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore found meanes, that the <hi>Guelfi</hi> (ſetting all iniurie aſide) ſhould returne, and the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> (without ſuſpition) receaue them. They thus vnited, it ſeemed to them, that the time would well ſerue to frame an order for the libertie of the Cittie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the new Emperour ſhould grow ſtrong. For which purpoſe, they diuided the Cittie into ſixe parts, and choſe twelue Cittizens for euerie part to gouerne the ſame,<note place="margin">An vnion and policie, ſetled in Florence.</note> whom they called <hi>Antiani,</hi> and were changed euerie yeare. Alſo to remoue all offences, that might ariſe by Iudges, they elected two Straungers to that office, calling the one Captaine of the people, and the other <hi>Podesta:</hi> who were authoriſed to iudge all cauſes that happened in the Cittie, either ciuill or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall. Alſo, becauſe no order is aſſured without defenders thereof, they appointed in the Citie twentie Enſignes, and threeſcore and ſixteene in the Countrey; vnder which all the youth was muſtred, and commanded they ſhould bee readie armed, euerie man vnder the enſigne whereto he belonged, whenſoeuer he were either by the Captain or the <hi>Antiani</hi> called. And as the enſignes which thoſe ſoldiers were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto were diuers, ſo were the weapons diuerſly diuided: for the crosbowes had their priuate enſigne, &amp; the holberdiers theirs. Alſo at euerie feaſt of Penticoſt,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14349:22"/>
with great pompe they erected new enſignes, and appointed new Captaines, &amp; trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſouldiers to ſuch perfection, as euerie man knew in what order hee ſhould march, retire, and charge the enemy. Then they cauſed a great chariot couered with redde, and drawne by two Oxen, to carry their chiefe enſigne, of colour white and redde. Whenſoeuer they intended to aſſemble all their forces, they commanded this Chariot to be brought into the market place, and with great ceremony giue charge thereof to the chiefe Captaines of the people. They had alſo for the magnificence of their enterpriſe, a greatbell called <hi>Martinella,</hi> which was rung continually one whole moneth before their Army was brought into the field: to the end that the enemie might prepare for his defence. So great was the vertue of men in thoſe dayes, and ſo honourably they proceeded in their actions: where at this preſent to aſſaile the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſodeinly and without warning, is thought to be a wiſe and honourable thing, in thoſe dayes the ſame was holden cowardly, and diſhonourably. This Bell was alſo carried with the Army, and by the ſound thereof the watches and other orders of the Campe were commanded. Vpon theſe martiall ordinances and ciuill rules, the <hi>Florentines</hi> laide the foundation of their libertie. Neither can it bee imagined how great authoritie and force that Cittie in ſhort ſpace atteined vnto. So that it became not onely chiefe of <hi>Toſcana,</hi> but alſo was accounted amongſt the beſt Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſhould haue ſo continued, had not the often and new diuiſions diſturbed the ſame: vnder this gouernment the <hi>Florentines</hi> liued tenne yeares, within which time they enforced the <hi>Pistoieſi, Aretini,</hi> and <hi>Seneſi,</hi> to make league with them. Returning from <hi>Sienna</hi> with their Army, they ſurprized <hi>Volterra,</hi> and demoliſhed ſome caſtles, leading the inhabitants of them to <hi>Florence.</hi> All which enterpriſes were performed by counſell of the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> who could do much more then the <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> becauſe they for their inſolencie during the raigne of <hi>Federigo</hi> were hated of the people. The fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church alſo much more loued, then the faction of the Emperour: becauſe the <hi>Florentines</hi> hoped thereby to preſerue their libertie, but beeing vnder the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour they feared to looſe it. The <hi>Ghibilini</hi> then ſeeing themſelues bereft of authoritie, could not liue contented, but ſtill aſpecting occaſion to recouer the gouernment, and ſeeing <hi>Manfredi</hi> ſonne of <hi>Federigo,</hi> poſſeſſed of the kingdome of <hi>Napoli,</hi> who had alſo diſcomforted the forces of the church, thought the time come to ſerue their purpoſe. Secretly then they practiſed with him to take their authoritie vppon him, but their practiſe was not ſo cunningly handled, but that the ſame was diſcouered to the <hi>Antiani,</hi> who preſently ſent for the <hi>Vbarti.</hi> They not onely refuſed to appeare, but alſo tooke Armes, and fortified themſelues in their houſes: wherwith the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple offended, likewiſe tooke Armes, and ayding the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> enforced them and all the reſt of the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> to abandon <hi>Florence,</hi> and go vnto <hi>Siena.</hi>

Which iniurie with ſmall wiſdom committed, was generally of the people taken in great diſdaine, and of friends to the <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> they became mortal enemies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with time, grew their vtter ruine.

In which enterpriſe, the <hi>Guelfi</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> happening to be preſent, their faction gained reputation, and the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> became the weaker. Whereupon, thoſe that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned with the Earle <hi>Guido</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> thought it meere by ſome benefit to winne the loue of the people, which with many iniuries had before that time bene loſt. For thoſe remedies which before this time of neceſsitie would haue preuailed, vſing them now without order, and out of time, did not onely hurt, but alſo haſten their ruine. They then thought good to make the people friends and partakers of ſuch honours and authoritie, as had bene taken from them: and elected thirtie ſixe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens Commoners, who with two Gentlemen (called from <hi>Bologna</hi>) ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſtate of the Citie. They thus aſſembled, preſently diuided the Citie into Arts or Miſteries:<note place="margin">New ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> ouer euery one of which Miſteries, they appointed one Magiſtrate to do iuſtice to all thoſe within his gouernment. They ordeined alſo an Enſigne to euerie Miſterie: to the end, that all men might repaire therunto armed, whenſoeuer occaſion did ſerue. Theſe Miſteries, were in the beginning twelue, ſeuen great, and fiueleſſe. Afterwards, the leſſe Miſteries encreaſed to fourteene, ſo then the number was, (as at this preſent it is) twenty one. The thirtie ſix men appointed for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, practiſed many things for the benefit of the people. The Earle <hi>Guido</hi> for the paying of the ſouldiers impoſed a Subſidie vppon the Citizens: whom hee found ſo vnwilling therewith. as hee durſt not enforce them to paie thoſe ſummes that were impoſed. And ſuppoſing to haue loſt the ſtate, he ioyned himſelfe with the chiefe of the <hi>Ghibilini</hi>; which done, determined to take that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people by force, which they for want of iudgement had graunted. For that purpoſe aſſembling the ſouldiers Armed, and accompanied with the thirtie ſixe Reformers, hee made an Alarum, and foorthwith the Reformers retired themſelues to their houſes, and the Enſignes of the Miſteries came foorth, followed by many Armed men, who vnderſtanding that the Earle <hi>Cuido</hi> with his followers, were at Saint <hi>Giouan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> they made head at Saint <hi>Trinita,</hi> and there elected <hi>Giouanni Sodarini,</hi> theyr Captaine. The Earle on the other ſide, hearing where the people were, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towardes them, who fled not, but aſſoone as the Earle drew neare, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him neare vnto the place called <hi>Loggio delli Tornaquinci.</hi> There they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14349:23"/>
forced the Earle to retire with the ſlaughter, and loſſe of many his ſouldiers. The Earle fearing that his enemy (ſeeing his ſouldiers maimed and weary) would aſſault him, and in the night kill him: determined forthwith to flie, and ſo ſaue himſelfe. So as contrarie to the counſell of the gouernours and others of his faction, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fled with his men to the Citie of <hi>Prato.</hi> So ſoone as hee came thither, finding himſelfe out of feare, being in a place of ſecuritie, remembred how great an errour he had committed: and deſirous to amend the ſame, the next morning earely, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with his men towards <hi>Florence:</hi> offering to enter the Citie by force, which by cowardiſe hee had abandoned, but that attempt tooke no ſucceſſe, for the people which with difficultie might haue driuen him away, with facilitie could hold him out. So that with great ſorow and ſhame, he went vnto <hi>Caſentino,</hi> and the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> to their vilages. Thus the people remained with victorie, and for the comfort of thoſe which loued the common wealth, determined to reunite the citie, and call home all citizens as well <hi>Ghibilini</hi> as <hi>Guelfi:</hi> by meanes whereof, the <hi>Guelfi</hi> after ſixe yeares ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the citie were returned. And the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> (notwithſtanding the memorie of their late iniurie) were pardoned and put in their country: yet much hated both of the people and the <hi>Guelfi</hi>; for theſe could not forget their exile, and thoſe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred too much the tyrannie which was vſed during their authoritie: which things, cauſed that neither the one nor the other were contented. While in this forme the <hi>Florentines</hi> liued, it was reported, that <hi>Corradino</hi> nephew to <hi>Manfredi,</hi> ſhould come with forces from <hi>Germany</hi> to the conqueſt of <hi>Napoli.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> tooke heart and hope, thereby to recouer their authoritie. And the <hi>Guelfi</hi> began to thinke how they might aſſure themſelues of their enemies: for which purpoſe, they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed king <hi>Carlo</hi> to defend them in the time of <hi>Corradino</hi> his paſſage. The ſouldiers of <hi>Carlo</hi> being in march, made the <hi>Guelfi</hi> inſolent, and amazed the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> ſo much, that two dayes before they arriued (without any violence offered) they fled. The <hi>Ghibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini</hi> thus departed, the <hi>Florentines</hi> reordeined the ſtate of their citie, &amp; elected twelue chiefe men to be magiſtrates, and gouerne their citie for two moneths,<note place="margin">New ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the Guelfi.</note> whom they called not <hi>Antiani,</hi> but <hi>Buoni Homini.</hi> Next vnto them, they appointed a Councell of foureſcore Citizens, which they called <hi>La Credenza.</hi> After them, were an hundreth and foureſcore Commoners, who with the <hi>Credenza</hi> and the twelue <hi>Buoni Homini,</hi> were called the Councell generall. They ordeined moreouer one other Councell of a hundreth and twentie Citizens, of the Comonaltie and Nobilitie mixed, which ſhould giue perfection, &amp; confirmation to al things determined in the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. This gouernment thus ſetled, the faction of the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> togither with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates fortified the citie, to the end they might the better defend themſelues from the <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> whoſe goods they diuided into three parts: the one, they imployed to publike vſes: the ſecond was giuen to the Captaines; the third diuided amongſt the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> in recompence of their loſſes. The pope alſo to maintain the <hi>Guelfi</hi> in <hi>Toſcana,</hi> ordeined the King <hi>Carlo</hi> to bee Lieftenant Emperiall of that countrey. The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> thus holding themſelues in reputation, by vertue of theſe new orders, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all things well, with their lawes at home, and with their armes abroad. Then died the Pope, and after long diſputation, in the end of two yeares, <hi>Gregorio decimo</hi> was elected: who hauing bene long time in <hi>Soria</hi> (and was at the time of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) did not make ſo great account of the factions, as his predeceſſors had done. But returning home towards <hi>France,</hi> being arriued at <hi>Florence,</hi> to performe the office of a good Paſtor, ſought to vnite that citie: wherein he preuailed ſo farre with the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> as they were content that Commiſsioners for the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> might be receiued into <hi>Florence,</hi> to ſolicit the return of their faction, which was concluded. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> were ſo terrified, as they durſt not come home. The Pope laid

                  </gap>orence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunicate.</note> and being offended, did excommunicate the ſame. In which diſpleaſure, the <hi>Florentines</hi> continued all the life of that Pope: but after his death the citie was abſolued by Pope <hi>Innocentio quinto</hi>; to whom ſucceeded <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lao tertio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pope euer ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> deſcended of the houſe of <hi>Orſini.</hi> And becauſe the Popes had alwaies in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition thoſe that aſpired to greatnes in <hi>Italy,</hi> (although by the fauour of the church they were thereunto atteined) ſought alwaies to put them backe. Therof grew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tumults and often variations, for the feare of him that was become ſtrong, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the aduancement of an other that was weake, who beeing likewiſe growne vp, was forthwith feared, and being feared, caſt downe. This was the cauſe, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the kingdome to be taken from <hi>Manfredi,</hi> and giuen to <hi>Carlo.</hi> This was alſo that which cauſed the Pope to miſtruſt <hi>Carlo,</hi> and ſeek his diſtruction. <hi>Nicholao tertio</hi> then, for the reaſons beforeſaid, ſound meanes through the helpe of the Emperour, that the gouernment of <hi>Toſcana</hi> was taken from <hi>Carlo:</hi> and in his place hee ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Latino</hi> his Legate. At that time <hi>Florence</hi> remained in verie hard eſtate; becauſe the Nobilitie of the <hi>Guelfi</hi> were become inſolent, and feared not the Magiſtrates: ſo as euerie of them committed murthers, and other violences without any iuſtice or puniſhment of thoſe that committed the ſame; becauſe they were alwaies by one or other great perſon fauoured. To bridle this great inſolencie, it was by the chiefe of the people thought good to reuoke ſuch as were baniſhed: which gaue oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to the Legate,<note place="margin">New ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> to reunite the citie; and the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> returned home. In the place of twelue gouernours, there were foureteene made, for euerie part ſeuen, to gouerne the cittie during one yeare: and they to be elected by the Pope. <hi>Florence</hi> continued in this order of gouernment two yeares. Then Pope <hi>Martino</hi> aſpired to the Papacie, who being a French man, reſtored vnto king <hi>Carlo,</hi> all that authoritie which the Pope <hi>Nicholao</hi> had taken from him: wherby the factions in <hi>Toſcana</hi> were ſuddeinly reuiued. For the <hi>Florentines</hi> tooke Armes againſt the Emperours Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to depriue the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> of the gouernment: therewith alſo to hold the great men in awe, they ordeined a new forme of gouernment. The yeare 1282. beeing come, the companies of the Miſteries hauing receiued their Magiſtrates &amp; Enſigns, became greatly eſteemed.<note place="margin">Florence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> They among themſelues, elected in the place of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, three Citizens to remaine two moneths gouernours of the common-weale, and called them <hi>Priori:</hi> who might be either Commoners or Gentlemen, ſo that they were Merchants of ſome Miſterie. Afterwards the chiefe Magiſtracie was reduced to ſixe men, ſo as in euery part of the citie there might be one: which order conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the yeare 1342. At which time the cittie was diuided into quarters, and the number of <hi>Priori</hi> encreaſed to nine, and diuerſe times in that meane while (by reaſon of ſome accident) they were in number twelue. This Office was the meane (as ſhall hereafter appeare) that the Nobilitie was ruined; for then by many occaſions they were excluded, and afterwards without reſpect oppreſſed; whereunto the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie at the beginning conſented: for they vnwilling to bee vnited with the people, and deſiring to haue all the ſtate into their hands, and the people hauing like deſire, became both looſers. Then they appointed a pallace for their office, where by aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtome, the Magiſtrates and Counſellours aſſembled, who were in honourable fort by Serieants and other Miniſters there attended, albeit at the erection of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,<note place="margin">Priori.</note> the officers were called <hi>Priori:</hi> yet afterwards (for more magnificence) was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therunto the name of <hi>Signory.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> for a ſpace, among themſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained quiet, during which time they made warre vppon the <hi>Aretini,</hi> becauſe they had baniſhed the <hi>Guelfi:</hi> and in <hi>Campaldino</hi> moſt fortunately wonne the victory. The cittie then encreaſing in men and riches, thought good to encreaſe alſo the wals ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and therefore inlarged the circuit of the ſame to that compaſſe, which now wee
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14349:24"/>
ſee: for before that time the <hi>Diametre</hi> thereof, was onely that ſpace which is from the old bridge, to S. <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> The wars abroad, and peace at home,<note place="margin">Diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and the people.</note> had (as it were) worne out of <hi>Florence</hi> the factions of <hi>Guelfi</hi> and <hi>Ghibilini.</hi> Then remained only thoſe humors (which naturally were wont to be in euerie cittie) betwixt the Nobilitie and the people. For the people deſirous to liue according to law, and the great men ſtudying to command them, becommeth a thing impoſsible they ſhould accord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. This humour, ſo long as the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> held the citie in awe, was not diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but ſo ſoone as they were vanquiſhed, it ſhewed the force thereof: for euerie day ſome popular man was iniured, and Magiſtrates knew not by what meanes to puniſh the ſame, becauſe euerie Gentleman with the force of his friends defended himſelfe. The Magiſtrates of the miſterie, ſtudying to remedie ſo great a miſchiefe, prouided that euerie <hi>Senate</hi> in the beginning of their authoritie ſhould create one <hi>Gonfaloniere di Giustitia,</hi> a man elected in the number of Commoners, vnto whom was appointed one thouſand men, vnder twentie Enſignes readie at all occaſions to maintaine iuſtice, whenſoeuer they were by their <hi>Gonfalone</hi> or their Captaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The firſt choſen was <hi>Vbaldo Ruffoli,</hi> he drew forth the <hi>Gonfalone,</hi> and razed the houſes of the <hi>Galetti:</hi> becauſe one of that Family had in <hi>France</hi> ſlaine a popular man. It was an eaſie thing for the miſteries to make this order, by reaſon of the great hatred among the Nobilitie, who conſidered not of any prouiſion againſt them, till ſuch time as they felt the bitter execution thereof; which, at the firſt gaue them great terror: neuertheleſſe afterwards, they returned to their wonted inſolencie. For alwaies ſome one of the Nobilitie being an Officer, had therby meanes to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> in execution of his office. Moreouer, for that euerie accuſer muſt produce his witneſſe to proue the offence offered, and no man for feare of the Nobilitie durſt giue witneſſe, the citie in ſhort ſpace returned to the former diſcord: and the people iniured in the ſame ſort as they were wont to bee; becauſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſlow, and execution thereof wanted. The populer ſort then not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what courſe to take, <hi>Giano della Bella,</hi> a Gentleman of auncient race (yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with one that loued the libertie of his Country) encouraged the chiefe of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries to reforme the diſorders of the citie.<note place="margin">New ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in fauour of the people.</note> By this Councell it was ordeined that the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> ſhould remaine with the <hi>Priori,</hi> and haue foure thouſand men at his commandement. They likewiſe made all the Nobilitie vncapable of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and euery man that was acceſſarie in anie offence, to be as ſubiect to puniſhment as the principall. They decreed moreouer, that publique fame ſhould ſuffice to receiue condemnation by the lawes, which they called <hi>Ordinamenti della Giustitia.</hi> By this mean the people gained great reputation, and <hi>Giano della Bella</hi> much hated: becauſe thereby he became euill thought of by the Nobilitie, and reputed one that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their authoritie. The rich Commoners did alſo enuie him, for that they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his credit ouermuch, which at the firſt occaſion was ſo proued. For it ſhortly after happened, that in a fraie, one of the people chanced to be ſlaine; at which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict diuerſe Gentlemen were preſent; and among the reſt, <hi>Corſo Donati:</hi> vnto whom (as the moſt quarrelſome of the companie) the fault was laid, and by the Captaine of the people apprehended. Howſoeuer it were, either that <hi>Corſo</hi> had not offended, or that the Captaine feared to commit him, he was preſently ſet at libertie. Which deliuerie ſo greatly offended the people, that they tooke Armes and ranne to the houſe of <hi>Giano della Bella,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Giano della Bella.</note> deſiring him to be a meane that thoſe lawes might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, whereof he had bene the inuentor. <hi>Giano</hi> willing that <hi>Corſo</hi> ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, did not (as many thought he would do) cauſe the people to laie down their Armes, but perſwaded them to go vnto the <hi>Senate,</hi> and praie them to looke vnto the matter. The people, in the meane while much moued, and ſuppoſing the Captaine
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14349:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to haue offered iniurie, and alſo that <hi>Giano</hi> had forſaken them; went not to the <hi>Senat,</hi> but vnto the Captaines pallace, which they tooke and ſacked. That fact greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed all the Citizens, and thoſe that deſired the fall of <hi>Giano</hi> accuſed him, laying all the fault to his charge. Amongſt the Lords of the <hi>Senate,</hi> one of his enemies hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be: who accuſed him to the Captaine, for hauing ſtirred the people to ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. During the time that this cauſe was in debating, the people armed, went againe to the houſe of <hi>Giano,</hi> and offered him defence againſt the <hi>Senators</hi> his enemies. But <hi>Giano</hi> would neither make proofe of this populer fauour, nor yet commit his life to the Magiſtrates, becauſe he feared the lewdneſſe of theſe, and the inconſtancie of thoſe, ſo as to take occaſion from his foes to offend him, and from his friendes to harme their countrey, he determined to depart, and ſo giuing place to enuie, and to deliuer the Citizens from that feare they had of him, went into voluntarie exile: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had with his great perill, deliuered the citie from ſeruitude of the Nobilitie. After his departure, the Nobilitie hoped greatly to recouer their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and iudging that all their euill was by his mean procured, they aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues togither, and ſent two of them to the <hi>Senate</hi> (which they thought did fauour them much) to entreate that by the ſame, the ſeuere lawes made to their preiudice, might in ſomething be quallified: which requeſt being knowne, troubled much the people,<note place="margin">Diuiſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and people.</note> fearing that the <hi>Senators</hi> would grant the ſame: Inſomuch as the deſire of the Nobilitie, &amp; the ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people, drew them to the ſword. The Nobilitie made head in three places, at S. <hi>Giouanni,</hi> in the new market place, and in the <hi>Piazza di Mozzi.</hi> Their Captaines were, <hi>Foreſe Adimari, Vanni di Mozzi,</hi> and <hi>Geri Spini.</hi> The people on the other ſide, with their Enſigne, in great numbers aſſembled at the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators</hi> pallace, who at that time dwelt neare vnto S. <hi>Bruocolo:</hi> and becauſe the people had that <hi>Senate</hi> in ſuſpition, they ioyned with them ſix Citizens for the gouernment. While the one and the other part prepared themſelues to fight, ſome of the people, and ſome of the Nobilitie,<note place="margin">Perſwaſions to the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to laie downe armes.</note> togither with certaine religious men of good fame, came betweene them and perſwaded a peace: Letting the Nobilitie vnderſtand, that the cauſe why the honours from them was taken, and the lawes againſt them made, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded of their owne pride and euil gouernment. And becauſe they had before that time, taken Armes to recouer that which through their owne diuiſion and euil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour had bene taken from them, it would not do other then occaſion the ruine of their country, and hinder themſelues. It was moreouer ſaid vnto them, that the people, in number, riches and mallice, was much their ſuperiour: and that theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men by whom they thought to oppreſſe others, would not fight, but went their waies, ſo ſoone as the fight began. It was therefore a folly for them, againſt ſo great a multitude to contend.<note place="margin">Perſwaſions vſed to the people.</note> They perſwaded the people on the other ſide, that it was no wiſedome to ſeeke their will by way of extremitie, and that it was no part of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to driue men into deſperation: for whoſoeuer hopeth of no good, feareth no euill. They ought alſo to remember, that the Noble men were thoſe, which in the warres had honored the citie: therfore it was no reaſon nor iuſt occaſion, why they ſhould be ſo greatly hated. And moreouer, although the Nobilitie could be content not to poſſeſſe the ſupreame offices, yet would they not endure to be driuen out of their Country. It were therefore well done to laie Armes aſide and grow to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not truſting to the multitude of the people: for it hath bene often ſeene, that the greater number haue by the leſſe bene vanquiſhed. Vpon theſe ſpeeches grew diuers opinions among the people: many wold haue fought, as a thing that of force at one time or other muſt be; and therefore was better to do the ſame now, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when their enemies were become ſtronger. And though it were beleeued that by mittigation of the lawes, the Nobilitie wold become contented, yet the pride
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14349:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of them was ſuch, as without enforcement would neuer reſt. Others of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wiſer, better aduiſed, and of more quiet diſpoſition, thought that the mitigation of the lawes was no great matter: but to fight one part againſt the other, was a thing of great importance. So in the end, this opinion preuailed, and it was prouided, that no accuſation againſt any of the Nobilitie, ſhould bee receiued without witneſſes. The Armes of the one and the other ſide, thus laide aſide, either of them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full of ſuſpition: fortifying themſelues in their houſes, and preparing weapons anew. Then the people reordeined the gouernment, reſtraining the ſame into a ſmal number, mooued thereto, becauſe that <hi>Signoria</hi> had bene fauoured of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: of whom, the chiefe were, <hi>Mancini, Magalotti, Altouiti, Peruzzi,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rettani.</hi> The ſtate thus ſetled, for more magnificence, and ſecuritie of the <hi>Senate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">New refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence 1298.</note> in the yeare 1298. they builded their Pallace, and made a Court before it, of that place where the houſes of the <hi>Vberti</hi> ſometimes were. At this verie time were alſo the common priſons begunne, and within few yeares after, finiſhed. For in thoſe daies, our cittie was in as great and happie eſtate, as at anie time it hath bene: being full of men and reputation. The number of Cittizens fit for the warres, were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred at thirtie thouſand: and the people of the Countrey able for that purpoſe, amounted to threeſcore and tenne thouſand. All <hi>Toſcana,</hi> either as ſubiects or friends obeyed vs. And albeit betwixt the Nobilitie and people, ſome indignation and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were, yet no euil effect thereof followed, but euery man neighborly &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably liued. And had not this peace bene by new enimitie within the cittie diſturbed, no forreine diſorder could haue moleſted the ſtate: becauſe the cittie ſtood in ſuch tearmes that it neither feared the Empire, nor thoſe that were baniſhed. And againſt all the ſtates of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was of force ſufficient to defend it ſelfe. That iniury therfore,<note place="margin">New diuiſion of the Bianchi</note> which external forces could not do, by inward diſcord was performed. There were in <hi>Florence</hi> two families, one called <hi>Circhi,</hi> the other <hi>Donati</hi>; in riches, Nobilitie, and men mightie. Betweene them (being both in <hi>Florence,</hi> and the Country neare neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors) there grew diſpleaſure, yet not ſo great, as to occaſion the vſe of armes: neither would there perhaps thereof haue growne any great matter, had not the ſame bene by ſome new occaſions encreaſed. Among the chiefe houſes of <hi>Piſtoia,</hi> is that of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellieri.</hi> It happened that <hi>Lore</hi> ſonne of <hi>Guglielmo,</hi> and <hi>Geri</hi> ſonne of <hi>Bertaccio</hi> (both of that familie) playing togither, fell into quarrell, and <hi>Geri</hi> of <hi>Lore</hi> was lightly hurt. This chance greeued <hi>Guglielmo</hi> much: and thinking with curteſie to amend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, made the ſame much worſe. For he commanded his ſonne to go vnto the houſe, where the father of the hurt man dwelled, and there aske pardon. The yoong man obeyed his father. Notwithſtanding, that humble act, did no whit decreaſe the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſition of <hi>Bertaccio,</hi> who cauſed <hi>Lore</hi> to be taken and holden by his ſeruants, till his hand were cut off; ſaying vnto him, return home vnto thy father, and tel him that wounds be cured with ſteele, and not with words. The crueltie of this fact ſo greatly offended <hi>Guglielmo,</hi> that he armed his friends to reuenge it. <hi>Bertaccio</hi> on the other ſide armed, to defend himſelfe. Whereby, not onely theſe families, but all the cittie of <hi>Pistoia</hi> was diuided. And becauſe theſe <hi>Cancellieri,</hi> were deſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of that name, who had two wiues: the one named <hi>Biancha,</hi> the one party being deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of that woman, called their faction <hi>Biancha:</hi> the other partie to take a name contrarie) was called <hi>Nera.</hi> Betwixt them, at diuerſe times diuerſe conflicts and ſlaughters of men followed. At length both parties growing wearie, and yet not knowing how to be reconciled, did deſire, either to make an end of their diſcord, or elſe to draw others into quarrels with them, and ſo encreaſe their faction. For which purpoſe they come to <hi>Florence.</hi> And the <hi>Neri</hi> hauing familiar acquaintance with the <hi>Donati,</hi> were by <hi>Corſo</hi> (chiefe of that houſe) fauoured: which the <hi>Bianchi</hi> vnderſtanding, to make
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14349:26"/>
themſelues ſtrong and able to reſiſt the <hi>Donati,</hi> reſorted to <hi>Veri dei Circhi:</hi> a man in euerie condition no whit inferiour to <hi>Corſo.</hi> This humour come from <hi>Pistoia,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the olde hate betweene the <hi>Circhi</hi> and <hi>Donati:</hi> and was alreadie ſo apparant, that the <hi>Priori</hi> and other good Cittizens feared euerie houre, leaſt ſome ſlaughter would therof enſue: and the whole citie be diuided. For preuenting whereof, they reſorted vnto the Pope, deſiring him, that with his authoritie he would take order for theſe quarrels, which they themſelues could not. The Pope ſent for <hi>Veri,</hi> and preſſed him to make peace with the <hi>Donati,</hi> whereat <hi>Veri</hi> ſeemed to maruell, &amp; ſaid, he had no quarrell vnto them, &amp; becauſe euerie peace preſuppoſeth war, ſith no war was betweene them, he knew not why any peace ſhould be required. Then <hi>Veri</hi> returned from <hi>Rome</hi> without other concluſion. Theſe humours ſo encreaſed, that euery ſmall accident (as often it happeneth) was like to bring great diſturbance. In the moneth of May, (at which time the youth of <hi>Florence</hi> on feaſtiuall dayes doo diſport themſelues publiquely in the ſtreetes) it happened certaine yoong men of the <hi>Donati,</hi> with their friends, to come on horſebacke to behold the women daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, neare vnto S. <hi>Trinita,</hi> where ſtaying awhile, thither chanced to come certaine Gentlemen of the houſe of <hi>Circhi:</hi> they alſo bringing with them ſome of their friends. They not knowing that the <hi>Donati</hi> were there (who ſtood before them) deſirous to ſee the daunce, preſſed forward with their horſes, and ſhouldred them. Wherewith the <hi>Donati</hi> finding themſelues offended, drew their ſwordes: and the <hi>Circhi</hi> as brauely prepared themſelues to anſwere the aſſault. After many hurts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and taken, euerie man departed his way. This diſorder happened in a very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie houre, becauſe the whole Citie vpon that occaſion was diuided: as well the people, as the great men, and the parties tooke name of <hi>Bianchi</hi> and <hi>Neri.</hi> The chiefe of the faction <hi>Bianchi,</hi> were the <hi>Circhi,</hi> and with them ioyned <hi>Adimari Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bati,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Toſinghi, Bardi, Roſsi, Freſcobaldi, Nerli, Mannelli,</hi> all the <hi>Mozzi, Scali, Gherardini, Caualcanti, Maleſpini, Bostechi, Giandonati, Vecchietti,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guzzi.</hi> They were alſo followed by many populer families, and all the <hi>Ghibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini</hi> that were in <hi>Florence.</hi> So that through the great number that tooke part with them, they had welneare all the ſway of the Cittie. The <hi>Donati</hi> on the other ſide, were chiefe of the partie <hi>Nera,</hi> and with them the reſt of thoſe families before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that ioyned not with the <hi>Bianchi:</hi> and beſides them, all the <hi>Pazzi, Spini, Buon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmonti, Gianfiliazzi,</hi> and <hi>Brunelleſchi.</hi> This humour did not only infect the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but alſo diuided the whole countrey. Whereupon the Captaines of miſteries, with euerie other of the <hi>Guelfi</hi> that loued the Common weale, did feare, leaſt the diuiſion ſhould with time, ruine the cittie, and reuiue the <hi>Ghibilini.</hi> Wherefore they ſent againe to Pope <hi>Bonifacio,</hi> to the end hee ſhould deuiſe meane to ſaue that cittie, which had bene alwaies a ſhield of the church: and now likely either to be deſtroyed, or become ſubiect to the <hi>Ghibilini.</hi> The Pope ſent then vnto <hi>Florence</hi> a Legate called <hi>Mattheo de Acqua Sparta,</hi> a Cardinall of <hi>Portugall,</hi> who finding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie in the <hi>Bianchi</hi> (which part as hee thought was the greater) feared the leſſe, and departing from <hi>Florence</hi> offended, did excommunicate the cittie: whereby it became in worſe eſtate then before his comming. Then the mindes of all men being full of offence, it happened that manie of the <hi>Circhi</hi> and <hi>Donati,</hi> meeting at a buriall, fell to words, and from words, to ſwordes. Whereof for that time followed nothing but tumult and diſorder, and ſo euerie man returned home. The <hi>Circhi</hi> then determined to aſſault the <hi>Donati,</hi> with great numbers of people went to ſeeke them. But by the vertue of <hi>Corſo</hi> they were put backe, and manie of them alſo verie ſore wounded. All the Cittie was vp in Armes, the <hi>Signori,</hi> and the Lawes were trodden downe with furie of greate men.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14349:26"/>
The wiſeſt and beſt Cittizens liued full of ſuſpition. The <hi>Donati</hi> and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers feared moſte, becauſe they could doo leaſt. Thereuppon <hi>Corſo,</hi> and the other heades of the <hi>Neri,</hi> togither with the Captaines of the miſteries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to entreate the Pope, to ſende vnto <hi>Florence</hi> ſome one of the blood roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, hoping by his meanes to oppreſſe the <hi>Bianchi.</hi> This aſſembly and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was notified to the <hi>Priori,</hi> and of the aduerſe part complained vpon, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie againſt the libertie of the Cittie. Both the factions being at that time in Armes, the <hi>Senators</hi> (of whome <hi>Dante</hi> happened to bee one) by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile and wiſedome, tooke courage and Armed the people, with whome alſo ioyned manie of the Countrey. And ſo inforcing the heades of the factions to laie downe their Armes, baniſhed <hi>Corſo Donati,</hi> with the others of the part <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> Moreouer, the <hi>Senators</hi> ſeeming to be indifferent in this iudgement, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome of the <hi>Bianchi:</hi> who ſhortly after vnder colour of honeſt occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home. <hi>Corſo</hi> and his friends imagining themſelues fauoured by the Pope, went vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and with their preſence perſwaded the Pope vnto that, which before they had written.<note place="margin">Carlo di val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loys, made Gouernor of Horence.</note> It happened at the ſame time that <hi>Carlo de Vallois</hi> the French Kings brother was in the Popes Court, called into <hi>Italy</hi> by the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli,</hi> to go into <hi>Sicilia.</hi> The Pope thought good (being deſired thereunto by the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed men of <hi>Florence)</hi> to ſende him to remaine at <hi>Florence,</hi> till ſuch time as the ſeaſon of the yeare better ſerued to paſſe the ſeas. Then went <hi>Carlo</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> and although the <hi>Bianchi</hi> who then gouerned, had him in ſuſpition, yet becauſe hee was chiefe of the <hi>Guelfi</hi> and ſent by the Pope, they durſt not gainſay his comming, but to make him their friend, they gaue him authoritie to diſpoſe of the Cittie according to his owne diſcretion. <hi>Carlo</hi> hauing receiued this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, armed all his friends and followers: which gaue the people great ſuſpition that hee intended to vſurpe the libertie. For preuenting of which miſchiefe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was giuen, that euerie Cittizen ſhould arme himſelfe, and ſtand with weapon at his owne doore, to be readie, if <hi>Carlo</hi> ſhould at his entrie happen to enterpriſe any thing. The <hi>Circhi</hi> and other heads of the faction <hi>Biancha</hi> (hauing bene a while chiefe of the Common weale, and borne themſelues in their offices proudly) were come into vniuerſall hatred, which encouraged <hi>Corſo</hi> and others, baniſhed men of the faction <hi>Nera,</hi> to come to <hi>Florence</hi>; knowing that <hi>Carlo</hi> with the Captaines of companies would fauour them. When the Citie through the miſtruſt of <hi>Carlo</hi> was armed, <hi>Corſo</hi> with the baniſhed men and many others that followed him, came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Florence:</hi> and without let, entered the Citie. And though <hi>Veri de Circhi,</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to haue encountred him, yet would he not, ſaying that the people of <hi>Florence</hi> (againſt whom he came) and not he ſhould puniſh him. But the contrary came to paſſe, for he was by the people receiued, and not puniſhed. And it behoued <hi>Veri</hi> for his owne ſafetie to flie. For <hi>Corſo</hi> hauing entered the gate called <hi>Pinti,</hi> made head at S. <hi>Pietro Maggiore,</hi> neare to his owne houſe, whither many friends and many people deſirous of noueltie, came. And firſt deliuered all the priſoners that had bene either for publique or priuate cauſe committed. Then they enforced the <hi>Senators</hi> to returne to their houſes as priuate perſons: and elected in their places populer men of the faction <hi>Nera.</hi> For fiue dayes alſo they ſacked thoſe that were the chiefe of the part of <hi>Biancha.</hi> The <hi>Circhi</hi> and other Princes of that faction were gone out of the Citie, and retired to their places of force. And not ſeeing <hi>Carlo</hi> to entermedle, the greater part of the people became their enemies. Wherupon though they would not before follow the Councell of the Pope, now they were inforced to pray his aide, letting him vnderſtand, that <hi>Carlo</hi> was come to diſunite, and not to vnite the Citie. Then the Pope ſent againe his Legate, <hi>Mattheo d'Acqua Sparta,</hi> who perſwaded a peace
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14349:27"/>
betweene the <hi>Circhi</hi> and the <hi>Donati,</hi> confirming the ſame with new alliances and marriages. Hee alſo laboured that the <hi>Bianchi</hi> might bee partakers of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in gouernment: whereto the <hi>Neri</hi> (miſtruſting the ſtate ſhould receiue thereby ſome hinderance) would not conſent. The Legate thereuppon grew offended, and departed from thence as diſcontented, as hee had bene the time before, leauing the Cittie diſobedient and curſed. Thus remained the one and the other part euill ſatisfied. The <hi>Neri</hi> ſeeing their aduerſaries at hand, feared leaſt with their ruine, they ſhould recouer the authoritie by them loſt. And the <hi>Bianchi</hi> ſeeing themſelues depriued of authoritie and honour, therewith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had in diſdaine and ſuſpition, were offered new iniuries. <hi>Nicholo de Circhi,</hi> accompanied with diuerſe his friendes, and going towards his poſſeſsions, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the bridge <hi>Affrico,</hi> was there aſſaulted by <hi>Simone</hi> ſonne of <hi>Corſo Donati.</hi> This conflict was great, and of either ſide verie bloodie: for <hi>Nicholo</hi> was ſlaine, and <hi>Simone</hi> ſo hurt, as the next night hee died. This chaunce troubled all the Cittie anew, and albeit the part <hi>Nera</hi> was therein moſt culpable, yet by thoſe that gouerned, they were defended. Alſo, before iudgement giuen, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, that the <hi>Bianchi</hi> had entered a conſpiracie with <hi>Pietro Feranti,</hi> a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron belonging to <hi>Carlo.</hi> In which treaſon, they practiſed to place themſelues againe in the gouernment. This matter came to light, by Letters which the <hi>Circhi</hi> had written to the Barron: yet ſome men held opinion that thoſe Letters were not true, but forged by the <hi>Donati,</hi> to ſhadowe the infamie, that by the death of <hi>Nicholo</hi> they had incurred. Thereuppon all the <hi>Circhi</hi> were confined, with all their followers of the parte <hi>Biancha</hi>: amongeſt whome was <hi>Dante</hi> the Poet. Their goods were ſolde, and their houſes razed. Theſe baniſhed men, ioyned with many <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> diſpoſed them ſelues into manie places, and hoping with new trauailes and troubles to finde new fortune, and <hi>Carlo</hi> hauing done that in <hi>Florence</hi> for which hee came, departed and returned to the Pope, to go on his enterpriſe of <hi>Sicilia:</hi> wherein hee ſhewed himſelfe no wiſer, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then hee was in <hi>Florence.</hi> So that with the loſſe of many of his, hee returned into <hi>Fraunce</hi> diſhonoured. After the departure of <hi>Carlo,</hi> the Cittie continued quiet.<note place="margin">New troubles by Corſo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati.</note> 
               <hi>Corſo</hi> onely was enclined to trouble, becauſe hee thought himſelfe not in that authoritie that hee ought to bee, but ſawe the gouernment in the hands of populer men, farre his inferiours. Hee then mooued with theſe paſsions, thought to performe a diſhoneſt intent, by an honeſt occaſion, ſlaundering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Cittizens, who had the cuſtodie of the publique treaſure: ſaying that they had imployed the ſame to their priuate commodities, and therefore it were well done to examine their dooings and puniſh them for the ſame. This his euill opinion was allowed by manie that were men of the like diſpoſition: with whome alſo manie others, through ignorance ioyned: becauſe they thought <hi>Corſo</hi> had beene indeede mooued thereunto with the loue of his Country. On the other ſide the Cittizens ſlaundered, hauing loue borne them of the people, defended themſelues. In ſo much, as this diuerſitie of opinions, after ciuill diſputation brought them to Armes. On the one part was <hi>Corſo Donati</hi> and <hi>Lottieri,</hi> Biſhoppe of <hi>Florence</hi>: with manie great men, and ſome Commoners. On the other part, was the <hi>Senate,</hi> with the greater number of the people: ſo that the moſte part of the Cittizens did fight. The <hi>Senators</hi> ſeeing the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherein they were to bee great, prayed aide of the <hi>Luccheſi,</hi> and ſuddeinly all the people of <hi>Lucca</hi> were in <hi>Florence:</hi> by whoſe authoritie, for that time, all thinges were compoſed. Theſe tumultes appeaſed and aſſwaged, the people continued in their authoritie, and the libertie preſerued, without any other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14349:27"/>
of him that mooued the ſlaunder. The Pope vnderſtanding the troubles of <hi>Florence,</hi> to pacifie the ſame, ſent thither his Legate called <hi>Nicholao de Prato,</hi> who beeing a man for degree, learning, and good behauiour, greatlie repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, obteyned eaſily ſo much fauour, as to haue authoritie to diſpoſe of the ſtate as himſelfe thought good; and for that hee was in faction a <hi>Ghibilin,</hi> hee intended to call home thoſe that were baniſhed: yet firſt thought good to win fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the people. To that end he renued the auncient companies, which greatly ſtrengthened him, and weakened the Nobilitie. The Legate then (perſwaded that the people were become all his) practiſed to call home thoſe that had bene bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For the compaſsing whereof he proued many meanes, which did not onely take euill ſucceſſe, but alſo made himſelfe thereby ſo much ſuſpected among thoſe that gouerned, as he was therby enforced to depart, and returne home to the Pope, leauing <hi>Florence</hi> full of confuſion, and excommunicate. In the citie at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained not only one humour, but many, to the diſturbance thereof: being there in the diſpleaſure betwixt the people and the Nobilitie, the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> and the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> the <hi>Bianchi</hi> and <hi>Neri.</hi> All the citie tooke Armes, becauſe many Cittizens who deſired the returne of the baniſhed men, were euill content with the Legates departure. The chiefe of thoſe that moued the quarrell, were the <hi>Medici</hi> and <hi>Guigni,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Medici and Guini.</note> who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with the Legate were diſcouered to fauour the Rebels: In ſundrie parts of the citie the people fought. To which diſorder, there happened a fire, firſt in <hi>Orto Sante Michele,</hi> at the houſes of the <hi>Abati:</hi> from whence it paſſed to the houſes of the <hi>Caponſacci</hi> and burnt them; with the houſes of <hi>Mazzi, Amieri, Toſchi, Cipriani, Lamberti,</hi> and <hi>Caualcanti,</hi> and all the new market. From thence it paſſed to the gate of S. <hi>Maria,</hi> and burnt all that, returning about <hi>Ponte Vecchio,</hi> and conſumed the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Gherardini, Pulci, Amidei,</hi> and <hi>Luccardeſi,</hi> with many others, that the number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to 1700. or more. Some were of opinion that this fire happened by chance in the fury of the conflict. Others affirme, that one <hi>Neri Abbati Prior</hi> of S. <hi>Pietro Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragio,</hi> a man diſſolute and deſirous of miſchiefe, kindled the ſame. For ſeeing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man occupied in the conflict, knew he might do that diſpleaſure, which no other could remedie. And to the end it might the rather haue ſucceſſe, hee ſet fire in the houſes of his owne companions. It was the yeare 1304. in the moneth of Iuly, when the citie of <hi>Florence</hi> was with fire and ſword in this ſort afflicted. <hi>Corſo Donati</hi> was hee, that of all others in theſe tumults armed not himſelfe, becauſe hee hoped the rather to be Iudge and Vmpire betwixt the parties: when being weary of fight, they ſhould be content to be perſwaded. Notwithſtanding, weapons were laide downe rather for very wearineſſe and neceſsitie, then through any pacification or perſwaſion of peace. For this onely followed thereof, that the Rebels ſhould not returne, and the faction that fauoured them remained with diſaduantage. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> and hearing the troubles that were begunne in <hi>Florence,</hi> perſwaded the Pope, that for the vniting of that Cittie, it was neceſſarie for him to ſend thither for twelue principall Cittizens, whereby the roote of the miſchiefe remoued, it ſhould be the more eaſie to quench the ſame. This Councell was by the Pope allowed, and the Citizens ſent for, appeared. Amongſt whom was <hi>Corſo Donati.</hi> When theſe Cittizens were abſent, the Legate wrote vnto the Rebels, that the chiefe of the Cittizens were from home, and therefore the time ſerued well for them to returne vnto <hi>Florence.</hi> Which encouragement being receiued, they aſſembled their forces and came to the Cittie, entering where the walles were not fully finiſhed: and paſſed forward, till they came to the <hi>Piazza di</hi> Saint <hi>Giouan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</hi> It was a thing notable, to ſee how thoſe cittizens, who had lately fought for the Rebelles, ſo long as diſarmed they deſired reuocation, beeing now armed,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14349:28"/>
and forcing the citie, became their enemies, and tooke armes againſt them. So much the common good was by thoſe Cittizens eſteemed and preferred before priuate friendſhip. Wherefore they vniting themſelues with all the people, enforced the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to depart and returne from whence they came. This enterpriſe had no ſucceſſe, both becauſe the baniſhed men had left part of their forces at <hi>Lastria:</hi> and for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing tarried the comming of <hi>Toloſetto Vbarti,</hi> who ſhould haue come from <hi>Pistoia</hi> with three hundreth men. But they imagined, that expedition ſhould haue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more then force (as often in like caſes it ſo happeneth) that delaies do hinder oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: and haſte wanteth force. The Rebels being gone back, <hi>Florence</hi> returned to the wonted diuiſions. Then to take authoritie from the houſe of <hi>Caualcanti,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by force remoued them from poſſeſsion of the Caſtle called <hi>Le Stinche,</hi> ſeated in the vale of <hi>Greue</hi> aunciently belonging thereto. And becauſe the ſouldiers therein ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, were the firſt that were put into that priſon newly builded, that priſon euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was called <hi>Le Stinche,</hi> by the name of the Caſtle from whence the priſoners came. Alſo thoſe that were chiefe of the Common-weale,<note place="margin">New refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> renewed the companies of the people, and gaue them Enſignes as had bene before ordered: making <hi>Gonfalonieri</hi> of the miſteries, calling them <hi>Colleggio di Signori.</hi> They ordeined alſo, that the Senate ſhould reforme all diſorders, in time of warre, by Armes, and in time of peace, by Counſell. They ioyned vnto the two old <hi>Rettori</hi> one <hi>Eſſecutore,</hi> who, togither with the <hi>Gonfalonieri,</hi> ſhould reforme the inſolencie of the great men. In the meane time died the Pope, and <hi>Corſo</hi> with other Cittizens was returned from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Cittie ſhould then haue continued quiet, had it not bene with the vnquietneſſe of <hi>Corſo</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new diſturbed. He, to gaine himſelfe reputation, euer vſed to hold opinion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to men of moſt authoritie: and wherunto he found the people enclined (to gaine their fauour) that way he directed his authoritie. Whereby he made himſelfe head of all new opinions, and to him reſorted all thoſe who ſought to obteine any thing by extraordinary meane. For that cauſe many great Citizens did hate him, which hatred encreaſed ſo much,<note place="margin">Corſo Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</note> as the faction of <hi>Neri</hi> came to open diuiſion, becauſe <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> imployed priuate forces, and ſuch as were enemies to the ſtate. Notwithſtanding, ſo great was the authoritie of his perſon and preſence, that euerie man feared him: yet to winne from him the populer fauour (as by ſuch kinde of meanes might eaſily be done) a brute was put foorth, that he went about to tyrannize the citie: which was eaſily beleeued, becauſe his maner of liuing did in troth ſurpaſſe the charge of ciuil expence. That opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was encreaſed greatly, after he tooke to wife the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Vguccione della Faggiola,</hi> chiefe of the faction <hi>Ghibilini</hi> &amp; <hi>Bianca,</hi> in <hi>Toſcana</hi> moſt mightie. This alliance come to knowledge, the aduerſe part tooke Armes; and the people for the ſame occaſion refuſed to defend him: the chiefeſt of them ioyning with his enemies. The greateſt of his aduerſaries were <hi>Roſſo della Toſa, Pazzino de Pazzi, Geri Spini,</hi> and <hi>Berto Brunelleſchi:</hi> they with their followers, and the greater part of the people, aſſembled themſelues armed at the foote of the Pallace, of the <hi>Signori.</hi> By whoſe order an accuſation was preferred to <hi>Piero Brancha</hi> (Captain of the people) againſt <hi>Corſo Donati,</hi> for that he, with the aide of <hi>Vguccione,</hi> ſought to make himſelfe a tyrant.<note place="margin">Corſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> Then was he cited to appeare, and after for contumacie iudged a Rebell. Betwixt his accuſation &amp; the iudgement pronounced, was not longer time then two houres. This ſentence giuen, the companies of the people vnder their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, marched towards him. <hi>Corſo</hi> on the other ſide was not diſmaied, (though he were abandoned by many his friends) nor for the ſentence pronounced, nor yet with the authoritie of the <hi>Senators,</hi> nor the multitude of his enemies: but fortified his houſe, hoping there to defend himſelfe, till he were reſcued by <hi>Vguccione,</hi> for whom he had ſent. All his houſes, &amp; all the waies vnto them, were fortified &amp; made cloſe:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14349:28"/>
and within, many of his faction to defend them. So that, the people (though in great numbers come thither) could not enter. The conflict was great, many ſlaine, and many hurt of either ſide. And the people ſeeing that by thoſe wayes they could not preuaile, brake the houſes of his neighbours, and by that deuiſe not miſtruſted, did enter. <hi>Corſo</hi> then ſeeing himſelfe beſet with enemies, and no longer truſting to the helpe of <hi>Vguccione,</hi> reſolued to ſee what meane he could finde to ſaue himſelfe, ſith of victorie hee vtterly diſpaired. Then with <hi>Gherardo Bondini,</hi> and many others his moſt valiant and faithfull friends, he charged his enemies with ſo great furie, as he brake them, and made way to paſſe through to the gate of the Citie, where they got out. Yet were they ſtill purſued, <hi>Gherardo</hi> vpon the bridge <hi>Affrico,</hi> was by <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caccio Cauicciuoli</hi> ſlaine. <hi>Corſo</hi> alſo was taken at <hi>Bouezano,</hi> by certaine horſemen belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the <hi>Senate.</hi> Notwithſtanding beeing brought towardes <hi>Florence,</hi> hating the ſight of his enemies, and the glorie of their victorie, he fell from his horſe,<note place="margin">The death of Corſo Donati 1308.</note> and was by one of them which ledde him, there murthered. The bodie was after taken vp by the Monkes of S. <hi>Salui,</hi> and (without any honor) by them buried. This was the end of <hi>Corſo Donati,</hi> vnto whom, his country, &amp; the faction of <hi>Neri,</hi> for many deeds both good and bad, muſt acknowledge it ſelfe beholding. But had his diſpoſition &amp; mind bene more quiet, the memorie of him had deſerued great honour. For indeed he was a Citizen ſo rare, as had at any time before bene ſeene in our citie. Yet true it is, that his factious mind bereft him of that honour which by his country and confederates was due: and in the end, procured his owne death, with many other miſaduentures. <hi>Vguccione</hi> comming to the reſcue of his ſonne in law, &amp; arriued at <hi>Remoli,</hi> heard there that <hi>Corſo</hi> was by the people taken. Wherupon, knowing that he could by no means then helpe him, for not hurting himſelfe, returned backe. <hi>Corſo</hi> thus ending his life (which happened in the yeare 1308. was the cauſe that all tumults ceaſed, and the citie continued quiet, till ſuch time as intelligence was giuen,<note place="margin">The Emperor Arrigo called into Italy. 1312.</note> that <hi>Arrigo</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (who fauoured by the <hi>Florentine</hi> Rebelles) was come into <hi>Italy,</hi> followed by them, and intending to put them againe in poſſeſsion of their country. For preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which miſchiefe, the Magiſtrates of the citie thought good to call home all thoſe that had not bene by ſpeciall name baniſhed: whereby the number of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſhould be the leſſe. The greater number that remained in exile were <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> and ſome fewe of the faction <hi>Bianca,</hi> among whom were <hi>Dante Alighieri,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Veri de Cerchi,</hi> and <hi>Giano della Bella.</hi> They ſent alſo for aide to <hi>Roberto</hi> King of <hi>Napo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> which not obteined at his hand as their friend: they were enforced to giue him the citie for fiue yeares; to the end, he might defend them as his ſubiects. Then the Emperour paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> and by the way of <hi>Piſa,</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in the yeare 1312. Afterwards, determining to reforme <hi>Florence,</hi> hee returned thither by <hi>Perugia</hi> and <hi>Arezzo:</hi> and lodged his Campe at the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Salui,</hi> diſtant one myle from the citie; where he remained fiftie dayes, without any good done, and therfore as deſperate of ſucceſſe, remoued to <hi>Piſa</hi>; where he agreed with <hi>Federigo</hi> King of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> to aſſault the kingdom of <hi>Napoli.</hi> Being with his Army there arriued, in great hope of victorie, and the King <hi>Roberto</hi> in great feare of his diſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at <hi>Buouconuento</hi> he died.

diſturbe the whole countrey. Then aſſembling a great Army, they paſſed into the vale <hi>Nieuole,</hi> where they fought with <hi>Vguccione,</hi> and in the end of their battaile, two thouſand or more of their men were ſlaine, with <hi>Piero</hi> the Kings brother their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; whoſe bodie afterwards was neuer found: neither was this victorie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſſe to <hi>Vguccione,</hi> whoſe ſonne was alſo killed, with many Captaines and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Armie. The <hi>Florentines</hi> after this ouerthrow, fortified the townes about them,<note place="margin">New diuition, in Florence.</note> and the King <hi>Roberto</hi> ſent them a new Generall called <hi>Andrea</hi> Earle <hi>Nouello.</hi> By whoſe gouernment, (or rather by the naturall inclination of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with euerie ſtate, and diuided by euerie accident) notwithſtanding the warres they lately had with <hi>Vguccione,</hi> fell to faction. The one part whereof, called themſelues the Kings friends, the other the Kings enemies. The chiefe of the Kings enemies, were <hi>Simon della Toſa,</hi> the houſe of <hi>Magalotti,</hi> with certaine other populer men, in whom reſted the chiefe of the gouernment. Theſe men found meanes to ſend into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to leauie Captaines and ſouldiers to remoue the Earle <hi>Andrea</hi> Gouernour for the King. But their fortune was ſuch, as could not bring to paſſe that they deſired: yet did they not abandon the enterpriſe, but beeing diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed both by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> they found out a Gouernour in <hi>Agobio,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his comming,<note place="margin">Lando de Agebio, made Gouernor of Florence.</note> remoued <hi>Andrea. Lando de Agobio</hi> being come, was made their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, or rather their hangman, hauing receiued abſolute authoritie ouerall the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. He, being a man couetous and cruell, accompanied with his ſouldiers (all armed) viſited euerie ſtreete, murthering euerie man, whom thoſe that elected him, would require. Yea, (ſuch was his inſolencie) that he cauſed falſe mony to be quoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ſtampe of <hi>Florence,</hi> and no man durſt gainſay the doing therof: ſo great was the authoritie whereunto the diſcord of the citie had brought him. Great and lamentable was the eſtate of this towne, which neither the memorie of paſſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, neither the feare of <hi>Vguccione,</hi> nor the authoritie of the King could reforme. In moſt miſerable plight it then remained, when the country abroad was ſpoyled by <hi>Vguccione,</hi> and the citie within by <hi>Lando</hi> of <hi>Agobio</hi> ſacked. The Kings friends were all contrary to <hi>Lando</hi> and his followers. Likewiſe all Noble houſes, the chiefe of the people, &amp; al the <hi>Guelfi.</hi> Notwithſtanding, becauſe the aduerſe party had the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they could not without perill to themſelues be diſcouered. Yet reſoluing to be deliuered from ſo diſhoneſt a tyrannie, they wrote ſecretly vnto the King <hi>Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> to make the Earle <hi>Guido Buttifolle</hi> his Lieftenant in <hi>Florence:</hi> which the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently did, and the aduerſe part (notwithſtanding that the <hi>Senators</hi> were contrarie to the King) durſt not for the reſpect they bare to the Earle, finde fault. But the Earle had not therby much authoritie, becauſe the <hi>Senators</hi> &amp; the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> were by <hi>Lando</hi> and his partie fauoured. During the continuance of theſe troubles in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> the daughter of King <hi>Alberto</hi> comming from <hi>Germany,</hi> paſſed that way in her iourny towards <hi>Carlo,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Roberto</hi> her husband. She was greatly honoured by the Kings friends, and they imparted vnto her the ſtate of the citie, and the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Lando</hi> with his followers. In ſo much as by the fauour of her, before her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture the citie was pacified, <hi>Lando</hi> remoued from his authoritie, and with riches, blood, and ſpoile, ſent home to <hi>Agobio.</hi> The gouernment alſo of the King ouer the citie, for three yeares was continued. And whereas there had bene before ſeuen <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators</hi> elected by <hi>Lando,</hi> ſix more were choſen for the King, ſo the Magiſtrates were for a time thirteene. After, they were reduced to the auncient number of ſeuen. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time <hi>Vguccione</hi> was depriued of his authoritie in <hi>Lucca</hi> &amp; <hi>Piſa</hi>; and <hi>Caſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio Castracani,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſtruccio caſtracani.</note> from a priuate Cittizen, aſpired to be Lord of <hi>Lucca:</hi> for hee being a yoong man of great courage, &amp; in euerie enterpriſe fortunate, became in ſhort ſpace the principall Leader of all the <hi>Chibilini</hi> in <hi>Toſcana.</hi> For which reſpect, the <hi>Florentines</hi>

ſetting aſide priuate diſcord, deuiſed with themſelues by what meanes <hi>Castruccio</hi> might be kept downe: and how his forces alreadie growne might be reſiſted. And to the end that the <hi>Senators</hi> might with better counſell be aduiſed, &amp; with more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie execute the ſame, they elected twelue Cittizens, whome they called <hi>Boni Homini:</hi> without whoſe conſent and counſell, the <hi>Senators</hi> might not do any thing of importance. In this mean while, the gouernment of king <hi>Roberto</hi> was expired, &amp; the citie became Prince ouer it ſelfe, with the auncient Magiſtrates and gouernors ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Alſo the great feare they had of <hi>Castruccio,</hi> did hold the ſame vnited, hee hauing done many things againſt the Lords of <hi>Lunigiana,</hi> and aſſembled <hi>Prato.</hi> The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> hearing thoſe newes, reſolued: and determining to reſcue that towne, ſhut vp their ſhops and went confuſedly togither, to the number of twentie thouſand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and fifteene hundreth horſe. Alſo to diminiſh the ſtrength of <hi>Castruccio,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their owne, the <hi>Senators</hi> by proclamation gaue notice, that whatſoeuer Rebell of the faction of <hi>Guelfi,</hi> would come to the reſcue of <hi>Prato,</hi> ſhould be after the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe reſtored to his country. Vpon this proclamation more then foure thouſand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels came preſently thither. This great Army in haſte conducted to <hi>Prato,</hi> ſo much terrified <hi>Castruccio,</hi> that without triall of his fortune by fight, he retired to <hi>Lucca.</hi> Then grew great controuerſie within the Campe of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> betwixt the Nobilitie and the people: for theſe would haue followed the enemie, hoping by fight to haue ouerthrowne him; and thoſe would returne backe, ſaying, it ſufficed that they had hazarded <hi>Florence</hi> to ſuccour <hi>Prato.</hi> Which was well done, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by neceſsitie, but ſith the cauſe was now remooued, no wiſedome would (where litle was to be gotten and much to be loſt) that fortune ſhould be further tempted. This matter (the people not agreeing) was referred to the <hi>Senators,</hi> who found among themſelues the ſame diuerſitie of opinions that was betweene the people and the Nobilitie: which being knowne, much company aſſembled in the Market place, vſing great words of threatnings to the Nobilitie; In ſo much that they for feare, gaue place to the will of the people: but all too late, becauſe in the meane while the enemy was with ſafetie retired to <hi>Lucca.</hi> This diſorder brought the people into ſo great indignation of the Nobilitie, that the <hi>Senators</hi> would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the promiſe, by their conſent giuen to the Rebels: which the Rebels vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and hoping to preuent the <hi>Senate</hi> before the Campe arriued at <hi>Florence,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to enter the gates. But their intent being diſcouered by thoſe in the Citie, were repulſed. Then they ſought to compaſſe that by perſwaſion, which by force they could not, and ſent eight Ambaſſadours to put the <hi>Senators</hi> in remembrance of their promiſe, and the perill they had vnder the ſame aduentured, hoping of that reward which was by them offered. The Nobilitie thereby put in mind, &amp; knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by promiſe bound, laboured greatly in the fauour of the Rebels. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by reaſon the people were offended, for not following the enterpriſe of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio,</hi> nothing was obteined: which afterward proued the great ſhame &amp; diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the citie. For many of the Nobilitie therewith diſpleaſed, did aſſaie to win that by force, which by entreatie they could not. For which purpoſe, they conſpired with the rebelles to enter the Cittie armed, and they would take armes alſo for their aide. This appointment before the day of execution, was diſcouered: whereby the baniſhed men at their comming found the cittie armed, and order giuen to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them abroad, and keepe downe thoſe that were within. Thus this enterpriſe was in euerie reſpect without ſucceſſe. After the departure of the rebels, the citizens deſired to puniſh thoſe by whoſe meanes they did come thither. And albeit euerie man knew who were the offenders, yet no man durſt name them, much leſſe accuſe them. Therefore to vnderſtand the troth without reſpect, it was ordered, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14349:30"/>
the names of the offenders ſhould bee written, and priuilie deliuered to the Captaine. In this accuſation were named <hi>Amerigo Donati, Teghiaio, Freſcobaldi,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringo Gerardini</hi>: who hauing Iudges more fauourable, then perhaps they deſerued, were onely condemned in pecuniall puniſhment. The tumults which grew in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> by comming of the Rebels to the gate, made triall that one Chieftaine for all the companies of the people did not ſuffice: and therefore they required after, that to euerie company might be appointed three or foure Leaders; and to euerie <hi>Gonfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniere</hi> two or three others, whom they would haue called <hi>Pennonieri.</hi> To the end, that in time of neceſsitie all the companie not aſſembling, part of them, vnder one head might be imployed. Moreouer (as it happeneth in all common weales after any accident) ſome old lawes be diſanulled, &amp; ſome others are made new: ſo the <hi>Senate</hi> before appointed from time to time, the <hi>Senators</hi> with the <hi>Collegii</hi> which then were (to the end their force might be the greater) had authority giuen them and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, to continue in office during the ſpace of fortie moneths. And becauſe many Citizens feared their names not to be put into the bagge, they procured a new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borſation. Of this beginning, grew the election of Magiſtrates, as well within, as without the Citie: which election was in thoſe dayes called <hi>Imborſation.</hi> Afterwards the ſame was called <hi>Squittini.</hi> And for that euerie three, or at the moſt fiue yeares, this order was taken, the occaſion of tumults in the Citie, at the choice of Magiſtrats, was remooued, yet were they ignorant of ſuch diſcommodities, as vnder this ſmall commoditie was hidden. The yeare 1315. being come, and <hi>Castruccio</hi> hauing ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed <hi>Pistoia,</hi> was growne to that greatneſſe, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> fearing the ſame, determined before ſuch time as he was ſetled in his Principallitie, to aſſault him, and bring him vnder their obedience. For which purpoſe they leuied twentie thouſand foote men, and three thouſand horſe. With theſe forces they beſieged <hi>Altopaſsio,</hi> in hope by hauing of that Towne, to impeach the paſſage of thoſe that would come to the ſuccour of <hi>Pistoia.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> preuailed in this enterpriſe, and hauing taken the place, marched towards <hi>Lucca,</hi> ſpoiling the country where they went. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, through the ſmall wiſedome of the Generall, or rather his infidelitie, little good enſued thereof.<note place="margin">Ramondo di Cardona, Generall for the Florents.</note> This Captaine was called <hi>Ramondo de Cardona.</hi> Hee, ſeeing the <hi>Florentines</hi> to haue bene liberall of their libertie, giuing the ſame ſomtimes to Kings, and ſometimes to the Legates of Popes, and men of meane qualitie: thought it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring himſelfe to be a Prince; if firſt he could lead them into ſome great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie. He gaue them therefore to vnderſtand, that for his better reputation, it was meete for him to haue the ſame authoritie within the Citie, that he had in the Army: otherwiſe he ſhould not haue that obedience of his ſouldiers which belonged vnto a Generall. Whereto the <hi>Florentines</hi> not conſenting, the Army proceeded ſlowly, or rather euerie day loſing ſomewhat: and <hi>Castruccio</hi> continually gained. Becauſe, by that time were come vnto him diuerſe ſupplies ſent by the <hi>Viſconti,</hi> and other tirants of <hi>Lombardy.

The diſpleaſures which <hi>Castruccio</hi> did after the victorie, by ſpoyling, diſtroying, burning, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; killing, cannot be told. Becauſe without any reſiſtance he rode vp and down in the country, where himſelfe liſted, ſpoyling, and committing what cruelties hee thought good. The <hi>Florentines</hi> ſcantly able, after ſo great an ouerthrow, to defend the citie: yet were they not ſo greatly diſmayd, but that they made much prouiſion,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14349:30"/>
both of men and money: ſending alſo to their friends, to haue their aide. All which ſufficed not to bridle the furie of ſo mightie an enemie. Wherefore as conſtrained, they made choyſe of <hi>Carlo</hi> Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> ſon to King <hi>Roberto,</hi> to be their Prince: offering him, not their friendſhip, but their obedience, and prayed him to defend their Citie. But <hi>Carlo</hi> being occupied in the warres of <hi>Sicilia</hi> (and therefore not at leiſure to come in perſon, ſent thither <hi>Gualtieri,</hi> by Nation a French man,<note place="margin">The Duke of Athene, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Florence.</note> and Duke of <hi>Athene.</hi> He as deputie for his maiſter, tooke poſſeſsion of the Citie, and placed officers according to his owne diſcretion. Notwithſtanding, his behauiour was ſo modeſt, and contrary to his owne nature; that euerie man loued him. <hi>Carlo</hi> hauing ended the warres of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> being followed with a thouſand horſe men came to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and made his entry in the yeare 1326. whoſe comming ſtaied <hi>Castruccio</hi> from ſpoyling of the <hi>Florentines</hi> countrey. But that reliefe which was found abroad, was loſt within, and thoſe diſpleaſures which the enemies could not, were by friendes performed. Bicauſe the <hi>Senators</hi> did nothing without the Dukes conſent: who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of one yeare, leuied in the Citie foure thouſand <hi>Florins,</hi> notwithſtanding that by the capitulation with him taken, it was agreed, hee ſhould haue but two thouſand. So great impoſitions were daily by him or his exacted. To theſe diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures new ſuſpitions, and new enemies were diſcouered. For the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy</hi> ſuſpected ſo much the comming of <hi>Carlo</hi> into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> that <hi>Galiazzo Viſconti</hi> &amp; other tyrants of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> by mony and promiſes,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uico called into Italy.</note> procured <hi>Lodouico di Bauiera</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour elected, againſt the Popes wil to come into <hi>Italy:</hi> who being arriued in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> marched towardes <hi>Toſcana,</hi> where with the helpe of <hi>Castruccio</hi> hee became Lord of <hi>Piſa.</hi> And being relieued with mony, he went towards <hi>Rome:</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Carlo</hi> to leaue <hi>Florence,</hi> and returne to the kingdome, leauing <hi>Philippo de Saggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netto</hi> his Lieftenant. <hi>Castruccio,</hi> after the Emperours departure poſſeſſed <hi>Piſa,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines</hi> tooke from him by practiſe, <hi>Pistoia,</hi> which <hi>Castruccio</hi> after beſieged, with ſo great vertue and reſolution, that although the <hi>Florentines</hi> many times aſſaied to reſcue the Towne, ſometimes aſſailing the Army, and ſometimes diſturbing the Country: yet could they neuer either by force or induſtry, remoue him from that enterpriſe. So greatly he thirſted to chaſtiſe the <hi>Pistoieſi,</hi> and offend the <hi>Florentines.</hi> By meanes whereof, the <hi>Pistoieſi</hi> were conſtrained to receiue him for their Prince: which thing, albeit were greatly to his glorie, proued in the end his diſaduantage. For being returned to <hi>Lucca,</hi> there he died.

They thus become free, reformed the cittie, diſanulled all orders of the olde Councelles, and created twoo newe Councelles: the one hauing in it three hundreth Cittizens Commoners, and the other two hundreth and fiftie Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Commoners, mixed.

And therefore with this honour he remoued from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Piſa</hi>; where, either of melancholy, or for want of mony to paie eight hundred <hi>Almaine</hi> horſemen, who were rebelled, and at <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiaro</hi> had fortified themſelues, died.

haue bene to our cittie moſt profitable, if the <hi>Florentines</hi> had euer continued in that minde: but becauſe ſhortly after they changed opinion, it was greatly to our loſſe. For if at that time for ſo ſmall price, they might ſo peaceably haue had it, and would not, afterward deſiring it, and offering much more then was required, they could not obteine it: which was the occaſion, that <hi>Florence</hi> many times with great preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice hath changed the gouernment. <hi>Lucca</hi> being thus by the <hi>Florentines</hi> refuſed, was by <hi>Gerardino Spinola</hi> of <hi>Genoua,</hi> for thirtie thouſand Florins bought. And becauſe men be more ſlow to laie hold of that which they may come by, then to deſire that they cannot attaine vnto: ſo ſoone as this bargaine made with <hi>Gerardino</hi> was knowne, and how ſmall a ſumme of mony he paid; the people of <hi>Florence</hi> became greatly deſirous to haue it, repenting themſelues, and blaming thoſe that were the cauſe that the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine proceeded not.

               <note place="margin">The troubles and war in Florence all ceaſed.</note> In this meane time, the Emperour was gone out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Antipope by order of the <hi>Piſani,</hi> ſent priſoner into <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> then, from the death of <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> (which happened in the yeare 1328. til the yeare 1340. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued quiet within, &amp; attended their matters of ſtate abroad.

For in that time, the Tower of S. <hi>Reparata,</hi> according to the direction of <hi>Giotto</hi> (an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Painter), was builded. And becauſe, in the yeare 1333. by meanes of a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous flood, the Riuer of <hi>Arno</hi> into many places ouerflowed the cittie, more then 12. cubits; many bridges and buildings were thereby decaied, which with great care and expence were now reſtored. But the yeare 1340. being come, new occaſions of alteration were growne vp. The cittizens of moſt power, had two meanes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and maintain their greatneſſe. The one, by reſtraining the number of thoſe that ſhould be elected Magiſtrates, whereby the offices of authoritie came either vnto them, or their friends. The other, becauſe themſelues being chiefe at the election of the <hi>Rettori,</hi> they were by them in their offices the more fauoured. And this ſecond cauſe they eſteemed ſo much, that to theſe two ordinarie <hi>Rettori,</hi> they alſo ioyned a third: whom they in thoſe dayes brought in extraordinarie, vnder the title of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Guard, and placed therein <hi>Iacamo Gabrieli de Agobio,</hi> giuing him abſolute authoritie ouer the citizens. He, day by day, before the face of them that gouerned, committed many iniuries, &amp; among thoſe that were iniured, was <hi>Piero de Bardi,</hi> and <hi>Bardo Freſcobaldi.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conſpiracy againſt Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Gabrieli of Agobio.</note> They, being gent. and naturally proud, could not endure that a ſtranger wrongfully, and in the preſence of ſome Magiſtrates had done them iniurie: which, both againſt him, and thoſe that gouerned, they conſpired to reuenge. Into that conſpiracie, entered many Noble families, and ſome of the people; whom the tyrannie of him that gouerned, did offend. The order of execution agreed vpon, was, that euery man ſhuld aſſemble into his houſe as many armed men as he could, and in the morning of All Saints day, when euerie bodie was in the church, to take armes, and kill the Captaine. Which done, they determined to place new <hi>Senators,</hi> and with new orders to reforme the ſtate.

For au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority being giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a looſe multitude, could worke no good effect. It was alſo eaſie to moue tumults, but to appeaſe them, hard.

It ſufficed not the Gouernours to haue oppreſſed the <hi>Bardi,</hi> and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcobaldi,</hi> but they did (as men commonly doo) the more authoritie they haue, the worſe they vſe it, and the more inſolent they become: ſo, where was before one Captaine of the Guard who oppreſſed the Cittizens within <hi>Florence,</hi> they alſo choſe an other in the Countrey, to the ende, that men to them ſuſpected, ſhould neither within the Cittie nor without, haue anie dwelling. So earneſtly were they bent againſt the Nobilitie, that they forced not to ſell the Cittie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged: aſpecting onely occaſion, which came well, and they better vſed the ſame. By meanes of many troubles which hapned in <hi>Lombardy</hi> &amp; <hi>Toſcana,</hi> the poſſeſsion of the citie of <hi>Lucca</hi> was come into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of <hi>Maſtino della Scalla,</hi> Lord of <hi>Verona,</hi> who (notwithſtanding hee was bounde to deliuer the ſame to the <hi>Florentines</hi>) did not,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14349:32"/>
becauſe he thought himſelfe able to hold it, the rather, by being Lord of <hi>Parma,</hi> and therefore of his promiſe he made none account at all, which moued the <hi>Florentines</hi> to offence. For reuenge whereof, they ioyned againſt him with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and made ſo hotte warres vpon him, as thereby he was inforced almoſt to abandon his country. Notwithſtanding therof followed nothing, but ſome ſatisfaction of mind, to haue oppreſſed <hi>Mastino.</hi> For the <hi>Venetians</hi> (as all other doe that ioyne in league with ſuch as be weaker then themſelues) after they had ſurpriſed <hi>Triuigi</hi> and <hi>Vuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> without reſpect of the <hi>Florentines</hi> made peace with <hi>Maſtino.</hi> Shortly after, the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconti</hi> Princes of <hi>Milan,</hi> hauing taken <hi>Parma</hi> from <hi>Mastino,</hi> and hee fearing for that cauſe, that <hi>Lucca</hi> could not be kept, determined to ſell it. Thoſe that deſired to buy that citie, were the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the <hi>Piſani.</hi> In beating the bargaine, the <hi>Piſani</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that the <hi>Florentines</hi> richer then they, would obteine it. Therefore they ſought to winne it by force, and with the aide of <hi>Viſconti</hi> beſieged it. The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> notwithſtanding proceeded, and bargained with <hi>Mastino,</hi> paying part of the money in hand, and for payment of the reſt, deliuered hoſtages, <hi>Naldo Rucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lai, Giouanni</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Barnardino de Medici,</hi> and <hi>Roſſo de Rici:</hi> and then by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Mastino,</hi> the poſſeſsion of the Citie was deliuered. The <hi>Piſani</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding purſued their enterpriſe, and by all meanes poſsible laboured to get the Cittie by force: yet went the <hi>Florentines</hi> to reſcue the Cittie, and remooue the ſiege. But after a long warre, the <hi>Florentines</hi> were forced with loſſe of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and honour to depart: and the <hi>Piſani</hi> became Lords of the Citie. The loſſe of this Towne (as in like caſes it euer happeneth) made the people of <hi>Florence</hi> greatly offended with thoſe that gouerned, whome in euerie Market place they defamed, accuſing them of couetouſneſſe and vnaduiſed counſell. At the beginning of this warre, the authoritie thereof, was giuen to twentie Citizens, who elected <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latesta</hi> of <hi>Rimini</hi> for their Generall. He gouerned the ſame with ſmall courage, and leſſe wiſedome.<note place="margin">The Duke of Athene.</note> They alſo praied aide of <hi>Roberto</hi> King of <hi>Napoli,</hi> who ſent vnto them <hi>Gualtieri</hi> Duke of <hi>Athene:</hi> and (as fortune would, prepairing all things for future miſchiefe) arriued in <hi>Florence,</hi> at the ſame inſtant when the enterpriſe of <hi>Lucca</hi> was vtterly loſt. Whereupon the twentie, ſeeing the people diſpleaſed, thought by chuſing a new Captaine, to bring them into new hope. And to the end that the Duke of <hi>Athene</hi> might with more authoritie defende them, they created him firſt their Defender, and after gaue him the title of Captaine Generall, ouer their men at Armes. The great Cittizens, who for the occaſions beforeſaid, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued diſcontent, and many of them hauing alſo acquaintance with <hi>Gualtieri,</hi> at ſuch time as they gouerned <hi>Florence</hi> in the name of <hi>Carlo</hi> Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> thought the time was come to alter the ſtate, &amp; oppreſſe the people, who had ſo long oppreſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the bringing of that to paſſe, they thought good to reduce the gouernment vnder one Prince, who knowing their vertue, &amp; the inſolencie of the people, might reward the one and puniſh the other. They might alſo hope the more of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fauour, if he by their meanes, aſpired to that dignitie. To compaſſe this intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they manie times met in ſecret, &amp; perſwaded the Duke to take the gouernment, offering to aide him to the vttermoſt of their powers. With theſe Gentlemen, ioyned ſome populer families, as the <hi>Peruſsi, Acciaiuoli, Antelleſi,</hi> and <hi>Buonacorſi,</hi> who being greatly indebted, and not able to paie of their owne, deſired with the ſeruitude of their country, and the goods of others to deliuer themſelues from the daunger of their creditors. Thoſe perſwaſions mooued the ambitious minde of the Duke, to great deſire of gouernment, and the rather to make himſelfe beloued, and accounted vpright, therewith alſo to winne the fauoure of the people, hee perſecuted thoſe that had gouerned the warres of <hi>Lucca,</hi> and put to death,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14349:32"/>
               <hi>Giouan de Medici, Naddo Ruccellati,</hi> and <hi>Guglielmo Altouiti:</hi> many alſo were baniſhed, and manie in money condemned. Theſe executions amazed much thoſe of the meane ſort, onelie the Gentlemen and baſeſt people were therewith ſatisfied. Theſe, becauſe their nature is to reioyce at euill, and thoſe for that thereby their iniuries receiued of the people, were reuenged. When ſo euer the Duke paſſed the ſtreetes, his fauourers would publiquely ſpeake to his honour, and wiſh that the fraude of the Citizens might be by him examined and puniſhed. The office of the twentie thus became diſeſteemed, the reputation of the Duke growne great, and all men for feare, or affection, ſeemed to honour him. And in token thereof, ſet the Dukes Armes vpon their houſes. In ſo much, as this Duke wanted nothing that belonged to abſolute authoritie, ſauing the title of Prince. Then he perſwaded himſelfe, that whatſoeuer he attempted might be ſafely done, and therefore ſent vnto the <hi>Senators,</hi> letting them vnderſtand, that for the better gouernment of the citie, it behoued him to haue the full abſolute authoritie &amp; gouernment: and ſeeing that all the reſt of the Citizens were therto conſenting, he deſired that therwith they would be alſo pleaſed. The <hi>Senators</hi> albeit that long before they had foreſeene the ruine of their Countrey, yet were they all with this requeſt greatly troubled. And though they knew alſo the perill, yet not to omit the dutie to their Countrey, they boldly denied the Duke. This Duke to make himſelfe be thought the more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and well diſpoſed, did chooſe for his dwelling, the Monaſterie of Saint <hi>Croce:</hi> and being deſirous to execute his euill intent, hee cauſed to be publiſhed by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that his pleaſure was the people ſhould reſort vnto him, at the gate of the ſaide Monaſterie. This proclamation amazed the <hi>Senate</hi> much more then the meſſage, deliuered them by word. Wherefore they thought good to ioyne with thoſe Cittizens, whome they knew to be louers of their Countrey. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they thinke (knowing the Dukes forces) that there was other remedie, to diuert the Duke from the enterpriſe, then to entreate him: and ſo make proofe what effect faire words might worke, to perſwade him to vſe himſelfe in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment more mildly. Then went certaine of the <hi>Senators</hi> vnto the Duke, and one of them ſpake as followeth. My Lord, we are come hither, firſt moued by your Graces requeſt, and next by your commandement to aſſemble the people. For it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a thing certaine, that you intend to obteine that extraordinarily, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by ordinarie meanes wee haue not conſented. Our meaning is, not by force to hinder your deſignes, but onely laie before you, how greeuous a burthen you put vpon vs, and how perillous an action you take in hand. To the end you may hereafter remember our Councels, and waigh the ſame with theirs, who not for your profit, but for the execution of their owne furie, haue counſelled you. You labour to bring this citie in bondage, which hath euer liued in libertie. For that authoritie which we haue graunted to the Princes of <hi>Napoli,</hi> was compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and not ſubiection. Haue you conſidered of what importaunce and how ioyfull a thing the name of libertie is, in euerie Cittie like vnto this? The vertue whereof, no force can ſubdue, no time can conſume, nor no merite can deſerue. Conſider (my Lord) how great forces it behoueth you to haue, to hold ſo great a Citie in ſeruitude. Thoſe ſtraungers, whome you haue enterteined, bee not of force ſufficient: and theſe that be within the walles, are not to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. For ſuch as be now your friends, &amp; haue counſelled you to this enterpriſe, ſo ſoone as they haue with your authoritie beaten down their enemies, wil ſeek alſo by what means they may to oppreſſe you, &amp; make themſelues Princes. The baſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude alſo in whom you truſt, vpon euery accident, (be it neuer ſo litle) do chaunge their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that in ſhort time, you may looke to find this citie your foe, which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14349:33"/>
ſhall be the ruine thereof, and yours alſo. Neither can you find remedie for ſuch a miſchief, ſith thoſe Princes onely can gouern ſecurely, who haue few enemies: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe few, either by death or exile may eaſily be remoued. But againſt vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall hatred, no aſſurance can be found: becauſe you know not where the miſchiefe groweth. And who ſo feareth euery man, cannot aſſure himſelfe of any man. Alſo, if you ſeeke to be aſſured of others, you enuiron your ſelfe with perils: becauſe thoſe that remain, do hate you the more, and are the more readie to reuenge. A thing moſt certain it is, that no time can weare out the deſire of liberty. For we know, where the ſame hath bene in a citie reuiued by thoſe, who neuer taſted thereof, ſaue onely by the memorie of this name libertie, which their anceſtors by traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did leaue them. Therfore hauing recouered it, with all obſtinacie and reſolution they wil defend it, and if our anceſtors had neuer left any ſigne of libertie, yet ſhould we be put in mind therof, by theſe publike Pallaces, by theſe places made for Magiſtrates, &amp; theſe bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of freedom &amp; libertie: which things be publikely knowne, and with great deſire euery citizen ſtudieth to know them. What can you do, or what can by any meanes be done, to counteruaile the ſweetneſſe of life in libertie, or make the people forget the commodities therof? Yea though you could ioyne all <hi>Toſcana</hi> to the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this ſtate, or might euery day return to the citie, triumphing ouer your enemies, yet all ſhould not ſuffice. Becauſe that glory ſhould not be yours, but ours. And our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quer no ſubiects, but encreaſe companions in ſeruitude. Albeit your maners were godly, your behauiour curteous, and your iudgements iuſt: yet were they not of force inough to make you be loued. If you would beleeue, they did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; you therin ſhould deceiue your ſelf. For to men accuſtomed to a life in libertie, the lighteſt clog ſeemeth heauie, &amp; the loſeſt bands do pinch. A thing impoſsible it is for any ſtate by violence gotten, to be by a good Prince mainteined: becauſe of force he muſt become like vnto his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, otherwiſe the one &amp; the other wil periſh. You muſt therfore thinke either to hold the citie with extreame violence, as caſtles, garriſons of men, &amp; forrein friends (&amp; yet many times they ſuffice not) or els be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, with that authoritie, which we haue giuen you. We therefore perſwade you, and pray you to remember, that ſuch obedience is durable, as is alſo voluntary. And labor not (being blinded with ſome ambition) to ſet your ſelf where you neither can ſtand nor clime higher without your great preiudice &amp; ours, &amp; ſo be forced to fall. Theſe words moued not at all the hardened heart of the Duke,<note place="margin">The Dukes anſwere to the Senate.</note> ſaying, his intention was not to take away, but reſtore the liberty of the citie. For cities diſunited were not free, but thoſe that were vnited. And if <hi>Florence</hi> by reaſon of factions, ambition, and enmitie, had loſt the libertie, hee would reſtore it. Saying moreouer, that not his owne ambition, but the ſute of many Cittizens, brought him to take this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: and therefore they ſhould do well to be content with that, wherewith o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were contented. As touching thoſe perils which hee might by this occaſion incurre, hee feared them not at all. For it was the office of no good man, to leaue the good, for feare of euill, and the propertie of a coward, for feare of good ſucceſſe, to abandon a glorious enterpriſe. Alſo hee hoped ſo to beare himſelfe, as they ſhould haue cauſe in ſhort ſpace, to confeſſe that they truſted him too little, and feared him too much. The <hi>Senate</hi> then ſeeing no more good to be done, agreed that the next morning with their authoritie to giue the gouernment vnto the Duke for one yeare, with the ſame conditions, it was giuen to <hi>Carlo</hi> Duke of <hi>Calauria.</hi> It was the eight day of September 1342. when the Duke accompanied by <hi>Giouan del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Toſa,</hi> with all his followers, and many Cittizens, came into the Market place, and there in preſence of the <hi>Senators,</hi> aſcended vp to the <hi>Ringiera</hi> (for ſo they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that place of the ſtaires belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to the Pallace) where the conditions between
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14349:33"/>
the <hi>Senate,</hi> &amp; the Duke were read. And when the Reader pronounced thoſe words, which gaue the Duke authoritie for one yeare: the people cried for his life. Then <hi>Franceſco Rusticheli</hi> (one of the <hi>Senate</hi>) roſe vp to ſpeake, and appeaſe the tumult: but his words, were, with ſhouting of the people interrupted. So as by conſent of the multitude he was created Prince, not for one yeare only, but for euer: &amp; being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the multitude about the market place, his name was proclaimed. It is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, that whoſoeuer is appointed to the Guard of the Pallace, ſhall in abſence of the <hi>Senators</hi> be ſhut vp therein. To which office at that time was <hi>Rinieri di Giotto</hi> appointed: hee being corrupted by the Dukes friends, without anie violence offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, receiued the Duke into the Pallace. And the <hi>Senators</hi> therewith amazed, and diſhonored, went home to their owne houſes. Then was the Pallace by the Dukes ſeruants ſacked. The <hi>Gonfaloni del Populo</hi> thruſt out, and the Dukes Armes ſet vppon the Pallace, to the great and ineſtimable griefe and ſorrow of all good men, and the great content of thoſe, who either for ignorance, or wicked mind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto conſented. The Duke hauing gotten the gouernment, intending to take all authoritie from thoſe that were woont to defende the libertie of the Cittie, did forbid the <hi>Senators</hi> to aſſemble anie more in the Pallace,<note place="margin">Ordinaunces made by the Duke of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thene in Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> and appointed them a priuate houſe. Hee tooke alſo the Enſignes from the <hi>Gonfalonieri</hi> of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Hee remooued the order of iuſtice againſt the Nobilitie, and deliuered the priſoners that had bene committed. Hee called home the <hi>Bardi,</hi> and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcobaldi,</hi> who had bene baniſhed, and gaue generall commandement that no man ſhould weare weapon. Alſo for his better defence within the Citie, he wanne himſelfe forraine friends, and for that purpoſe pleaſured the <hi>Aretini,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnder the <hi>Florentine</hi> gouernment. Hee made peace with the <hi>Piſani,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee were created Prince purpoſely to make warre with them. Hee tooke the obligations from thoſe merchants, that in the warre of <hi>Lucca</hi> had lent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the ſtate. He encreaſed the old Impoſts, and erected new: taking all authoritie from the <hi>Senators.</hi> The <hi>Rettori</hi> by him appointed, were <hi>Raglione da Perugia,</hi> and <hi>Gugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmo da Sceſi:</hi> with whom he ioyned, <hi>Cerrettieri Biſdomini</hi>; and thoſe three men were his onely Councell. The taxes which he impoſed vpon the Citizens were extreme, his iudgements vniuſt, &amp; that grauitie &amp; curteſie which he had before fained, was conuerted into pride, and crueltie. For many citizens both wealthy and noble were condemned, and diuerſe alſo by new inuented tortures, tormented. Moreouer to ſhew his authoritie in like ſort abroad, as it was in the citie, he authorized ſix <hi>Rettori</hi> for the country, who oppreſſed and ſpoiled the rurall people. He had the great men in ſuſpition, although by them hee had bene pleaſured: and that ſome of them by his meanes had bene reſtored to their Countrey. For hee imagined that ſuch Noble mindes as commonly are in Gentlemen, could not be contented with his gouernment. Hee ſought therefore to winne the good will of the people, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with their loue, and the aide of ſtraungers, to defende his tyrannie. Then the moneth of May being come, at which time the people were accuſtomed to make ſport and triumph, he cauſed the companies of the Common people, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſort to haue Enſignes, and money, with honourable titles to bee giuen them. Wherupon the one part of them, went from place to place feaſting and triumphing: and the other part with great pompe receiued the triumphers. When fame had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed abroad the new principallitie of the Duke, many of the French Nation came vnto him. And hee to euerie one of them (as men moſt to be truſted) gaue counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and enterteinment. So that <hi>Florence</hi> within ſhort ſpace was not onely ſubiect to the French men, but alſo to their factions and apparrell. Becauſe both men and women, without reſpect of ſhame, did followe them. But aboue all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14349:34"/>
things that diſpleaſed, was the violence which he and his, without reſpect, vſed to the women. The Citizens liued then with great indignation, ſeeing the maieſtie of their ſtate ruined, their ordinances broken, their lawes diſanulled, honeſt life corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all ciuill modeſtie extinguiſhed. For the Citizens, not accuſtomed to ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regall pompe, could not without ſorrow behold the Duke amidſt his guardes of armed men, both on foote and horſebacke: for ſo with their owne ſhame, they were forced to honour him, whome they moſt hated. Whereunto might be ioyned, the feare and death of many Citizens, and the continuall exactions, wherewith he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poueriſhed, and conſumed the citie. All which indignations and feares, were well inough knowne to the Duke, yet would he not be thought to miſtruſt any thing, but ſhew himſelfe as though he were beloued of all men. For it happened that <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teo di Moroſo,</hi> either to gratifie him, or acquite himſelfe of danger, reuealed a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie practiſed by the houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> and ſome others. The Duke enformed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">Matteo di Moroſo.</note> did not onely not examine the cauſe, but alſo cauſed <hi>Matteo</hi> moſt miſerably to be put to death. By which doing, he tooke courage from all thoſe that would tell him anie thing for his good, and encouraged others that went about his ruine. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo with great crueltie, the tongue of <hi>Bettone Cini</hi> to be cut off, who after, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of died. And this puniſhment was done, becauſe <hi>Bettone</hi> had found fault with the exactions laid vpon the Cittizens. Theſe cruelties encreaſed offence in the people with their hatred to the Duke, becauſe that citie which was accuſtomed freely to do and ſpeake all things, could not endure to haue their hands tied, and their mouthes cloſed. Theſe offences and this hatred grew to that ripeneſſe, as mooued not onely the <hi>Florentines,</hi> (who could neither maintaine their freedome nor ſuffer ſeruitude) but euen the moſt ſeruile people of the world, to recouer libertie. And therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny citizens of all eſtates reſolued, with the loſſe of their liues to recouer their libertie loſt.<note place="margin">Conſpiracy againſt the Duke of Athene.</note> Then practiſed they three ſorts of conſpiracies, the one among the Nobilitie, the ſecond among the people, the third among the artificers. Theſe conſpiracies, beſides the general reſpect, were for particuler reaſons willingly taken in hand. The great men deſired to recouer authoritie. The people were ſorrowfull for hauing loſt the gouernment. And the Artificers found their trades and earning of money to be decaied. At that time <hi>Agnolo Acciaiuoli,</hi> was Archbiſhop of <hi>Florence,</hi> who in his Sermons and otherwiſe, had extolled the actions of the Duke, and done him great fauour among the people. But afterwards ſeeing him Prince, and knowing his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous proceedings, knew how much he had deceiued his country: and therefore to make amendes of that faulte, determined, that the hande which had made the wound, ſhould alſo cure it. Wherefore he became head of the firſt and greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie: wherein were the <hi>Bardi, Roſsi, Freſcobaldi, Scali, Altouiti, Malagotti, Strozzi,</hi> and <hi>Mancini.</hi> The chiefe of the ſecond conſpiracie, were <hi>Manno</hi> and <hi>Corſo Donati,</hi> and with them the <hi>Pazzi, Cauicciulli, Cherchi,</hi> and <hi>Albici.</hi> The principall of the third conſpiracie, was <hi>Antonio Adimari,</hi> and with him the <hi>Medici, Bordini, Ruccelai,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandini:</hi> whoſe intent was to haue ſlaine the Duke in the houſe of <hi>Albezi,</hi> whither (as they thought) he intended to go vpon Midſomer day, to behold the running of horſes. But thither he went not, and therfore that enterpriſe became fruſtrate. Then they ment to aſſault him walking in the citie; but that ſeemed ha<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to do, becauſe he was well accompanied, and alwaies armed, therewith alſo euerie day changed his walke, ſo as they knew not in what place certaine to wait for him. It was likewiſe the opinion of ſome, that the beſt were to kill him in the Councell: and yet that were hazardous; for though he were ſlaine, the conſpirators ſhould be at the diſcretion of his forces. During that the conſpirators communed of theſe matters, <hi>Anthonio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimari,</hi> diſcouered the matter to ſome of his friends of <hi>Siena,</hi> whoſe aide hee hoped
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14349:34"/>
of, and tolde them the names of ſome conſpirators, ſaying that the whole Citie was bent to recouer libertie. Then one of them imparted his knowledge to <hi>Franceſco Brunelleſchi,</hi> not with intent the practiſe ſhould be laid open, but ſuppoſing that hee alſo had bene of the ſame conſpiracie. <hi>Franceſco</hi> either for feare of himſelfe, or for the hatred he bare towards ſome other, reuealed all to the Duke: and preſently <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golo del Mazecchia,</hi> and <hi>Simon da Mantezappoli</hi> were apprehended; Who detecting the qualitie and quantitie of the conſpirators, did thereby much amaze the Duke, and was therefore counſelled rather to ſend for them, then arreſt them: For if they fled, then he might without his owne diſhonour, by their baniſhment aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The Duke therefore cauſed <hi>Antonio Adimari</hi> to be called, who truſting to his companions, preſently appeared. <hi>Adimari</hi> being ſtaied, the Duke was aduiſed by <hi>Franceſcho Brunelleſchi,</hi> and <hi>Vguccione Buondelmonti,</hi> to ſearch the Citie, and kill ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as could be taken. But that the Duke thought not good, ſuppoſing his forces not ſufficient to encounter ſo many enemies, and therefore proceeded an other way, which hauing taken effect, ſhould both haue aſſured him of the enemies, and alſo gained him ſtrength. The Duke was accuſtomed at occaſions, to aſſemble the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and to take their counſell. Hauing therefore ſent out to aſſemble the people, he made a bill of three hundreth Citizens names; and cauſed his Serieants vnder colour of councelling with them, to warne them to appeare: and being appeared, he intended either to kill them, or impriſon them. The apprehenſion of <hi>Antonio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimari,</hi> and the ſending for other Citizens (which could not be ſecretly done) did greatly diſmay euery man: but moſt of all, thoſe that knew themſelues guiltie. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as men of greateſt courage would not obey him. And becauſe manie had read the bill, wherin one ſaw an others name, the one encouraged the other to take armes, and choſe rather to die like men, then as Calues to be led to the butchery. By this means within an houre, all the three conſpiracies became knowne one vnto the other: and determined the day following (which was the twentie ſixt of Iuly, in the yeare 1343.) to raiſe a tumult in the olde Market place: there to arme themſelues, and call the people to libertie. The next day, about high noone, according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, euerie man tooke armes, and all the people hearing the name of libertie, armed themſelues, and euerie man in his quarter prepared him vnder the Enſigne of the peoples armes, which the conſpirators had ſecretly cauſed to be made. And the chiefe, as well of the Noble houſes, as of the populer families, came forth and ſware both their owne defence, and the Dukes death, (excepting ſome of the <hi>Buondelmonti</hi> and <hi>Caualcanti,</hi> with thoſe foure families of the people, which procured him to be made Prince. They, togither with the Butchers, &amp; people of baſeſt condition, came armed to the Market place in defence of the Duke. At this vproare, the Duke armed all his Court, and his ſeruants in ſundrie places lodged, mounted on horſebacke to come to the Market place. But in many ſtreetes they were beaten downe and ſlaine, and onely three hundred horſes came vnto him. The Duke in the mean while ſtood doubtfull, whether he were better to come out and fight with his enemies, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe within the Pallace. On the other ſide, the <hi>Medici, Cauicculi, Ruccellai,</hi> and other families moſt iniured, did feare that if the Duke would come out, manie that had taken armes againſt him, might happily become his friends. And therefore to remoue the occaſion of his comming forth, and encreaſing his forces, made head, and went vp to the market place. At whoſe arriual, thoſe populer families, that ſtood there for the Duke, ſeeing the Cittizens couragiouſly to charge them, chaunged their mindes. After the Duke had thus altered his fortune, and euerie man reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Citizens, ſauing <hi>Vguccione Buondelmonti,</hi> who went into the Pallace: and <hi>Giannozzo Caualcanti</hi> with part of his men, retired vnto the new Market, and there
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14349:35"/>
ſtood vp, deſiring the people to arme themſelues to defend the Duke. Alſo the rather to terrifie the people, he threatned them, that if obſtinately they followed the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe againſt the Prince, they ſhould be all ſlaine. But finding no man to follow him, nor yet any that purſued him, and ſeeing himſelfe to haue laboured in vain, tempting fortune no further, retired vnto his owne houſe. The conflict in the meane while (betwixt the people and the Dukes ſouldiers) was great, and though the Dukes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces defended the Pallace, yet were they in the end vanquiſhed: ſome of them yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their enemies, and ſome leauing their horſes, folowed into the Pallace. While in the Market place the fight continued, <hi>Corſo</hi> and <hi>Amerigo Donati,</hi> with part of the people brake the priſons, burnt the Records of the <hi>Podesta,</hi> &amp; of the publique cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: ſacked the <hi>Rettori</hi> and their houſes; and ſlew all the officers of the Duke, that they could laie hand vpon. The Duke on the other ſide, ſeeing the Market place loſt, and all the citie againſt him, not hoping of any helpe, made proofe, whether by any curtuous act the people might be appeaſed. Therfore he called vnto him the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp; with gentle words deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; made <hi>Antonio Adimari</hi> (though nothing to his owne contentment) a Knight. Hee cauſed alſo his owne armes to be raſed out of the Pallace, &amp; ſet the peoples armes in the ſame place. Which things being done too late and out of time, by enforcement, and without order, helped litle. Thus as a man diſcontented &amp; beſieged, he remained in the Pallace; and found by experience, that by coueting too much, he loſt all: and therefore looked within fewe dayes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die by famine or ſword. The Citizens intending ſome forme of gouernment, aſſembled themſelues in <hi>Santa Reparata:</hi> and created there foureteene Citizens, halfe of them great, and the other halfe populer, who with the Biſhop, ſhould haue full authoritie to reforme the ſtate of <hi>Florence.</hi> They chuſed alſo ſixe to haue the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the <hi>Podesta,</hi> till hee were come. There were in <hi>Florence</hi> at that time, diuerſe ſtraungers come thither to aide the people: amongſt whom, were ſome <hi>Saneſi</hi> ſent from <hi>Siena,</hi> with ſixe Embaſſadours, men in their country much honoured. They betwixt the people and the Duke practiſed reconſiliation, but the people refuſed to common of any agreement, vntill <hi>Guglielmo da Sceſi,</hi> and his ſonne, with <hi>Cirretieri Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domini</hi> were deliuered into their hands. The Duke would not thereunto conſent, till being threatned by thoſe that were ſhut in with him, ſuffered himſelfe to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Certainly the furie is greater, and the harmes more, when libertie is in recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, then when the ſame is recouered. This <hi>Guglielmo</hi> and his ſonne, being brought among thouſands of enemies, (the yoong man not being eighteene yeares of age) could neither by his youth nor innocencie be ſaued from the furie of the multitude. And thoſe that could not ſtrike him aliue, would needs wound him being dead. Yea not being ſatisfied by cutting him in peeces with ſwords, with their nailes and teeth, they alſo tare his fleſh. And to the end al their ſences might haue part in the reuenge, hauing alreadie heard him lament, ſeene his wounds, and touched their torne fleſh, would alſo that their taſte ſhould take part, ſo that all ſences both without &amp; within might be pleaſed. This terrible furie though it were greeuous to <hi>Guglielmo</hi> and his ſonne, yet was it profitable to <hi>Cirretieri.</hi> Becauſe the multitude, being weary with the crueltie executed vpon thoſe two, did clearly forget him, remaining ſtill within the Pallace not called for. Then, the night following, by certaine of his friends, hee was conueyed away and ſaued. The multitude being appeaſed with blood of theſe two:<note place="margin">The Duke of Athene bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Florentines.</note> A concluſion was made, wherin was let downe, that the Duke and his, ſhould ſafely depart with bagge and baggage, and renounce all his authoritie ouer <hi>Florence.</hi> And afterwards, ſo ſoone as he ſhould come to <hi>Caſentino</hi> vpon the confines, ratifie the ſame. After this compoſition, the ſixt day of Auguſt he departed from <hi>Florence,</hi> accompanied with many Citizens. And arriued in <hi>Caſentino,</hi> he ratified (though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly)
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14349:35"/>
the reſignation of his authoritie: for had he not bene by the Earle <hi>Simone</hi> threatened to be brought backe to <hi>Florence,</hi> he would not haue performed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. This Duke (as his proceedings do ſhew) was couetous and cruell,<note place="margin">Diſcription of the Duke and his diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> no willing hearer of complaints, and in his anſweres, haughtie; hee looked for ſeruice of all men, and eſteemed the loue of no man: yet deſired he to be beloued, more then fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. His perſon and preſence did deſerue to be hated, no leſſe then his conditions; his bodie was ſmall, his face blacke and hard fauoured, his beard long and thin; ſo as both in appearance and being, hee merited the loue of no man. Thus within the tearme of ten moneths, his euill behauiour loſt him that gouernment, which foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Councell of others had giuen him. Theſe accidents being happened within the citie, gaue encouragement to all the townes which had bene ſubiect to the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> to returne alſo to their libertie: whereby <hi>Arezzo, Caſtiglione, Pistoia Volterra, Colle,</hi> and S. <hi>Gimignano,</hi> rebelled. After the Duke was thus driuen away, the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Cittizens, togither with the Biſhop, thought better to pleaſe their ſubiects with peace, then make them enemies by warre. And therfore ſeemed as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the libertie of them, as with their owne. Then ſent they Embaſſadors to <hi>Arezzo,</hi> to renounce all their gouernment and intereſt in that citie, &amp; make a league with the Citizens there. To this end, that ſith they could not haue their aide as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, yet they might haue it as friends: with other townes they likewiſe practiſed to continue them in friendſhip. This counſell wiſely taken, had happie ſucceſſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Arezzo</hi> after a fewe yeares returned vnder the gouernment of <hi>Florence,</hi> &amp; the other townes within a fewe moneths came to their auncient obedience. Whereof may be conceiued, that many times things fled or not deſired, are with leſſe perill and ſmaller charge obteined, then if the ſame had bene by extreame trauell &amp; great force followed. All things thus ſetled abroad, they turned their ſtudie to deale with matters within: and after ſome diſputations betweene the great and populer Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, they agreed that the great men ſhould haue a third part in the <hi>Senate,</hi> &amp; in the ther offices the halfe. The citie (as hath bene beforeſaid) was diuided into ſix parts, ſo that one of the <hi>Senators</hi> was appointed to euery ſixt part, vnleſſe vpon ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent twelue or thirteene were created: but ſhortly after they were reduced againe to the number of ſixe. It was therefore thought good to reforme the gouernment in this point, as well for the euill diſtribution of the parts, as becauſe they intended to deliuer charge of the gates to the great Cittizens; it was neceſſarie to encreaſe the number of the <hi>Senators.</hi> Therfore the citie was againe diuided, into quarters: allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to euerie quarter three <hi>Senators,</hi> leauing out the <hi>Gonfaloniere Della Iustitia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Florence againe refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> and the <hi>Gonfalonieri</hi> of companies. And in lieu of the twelue <hi>Buoni Homini</hi> they created eight Councellours, of either ſort foure. This gouernment with this order ſetled, would haue continued quiet, if the great citizens had bene content to liue with that modeſtie, that to a ciuill life apperteined: but they followed a courſe cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For when they were priuate, they would no companions; and being in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ruled as Lordes. So as euerie day ſome proofe of their inſolencie and pride was ſeene, which thing greatly diſpleaſed the people, ſuppoſing that in place of one ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſent away, there was growne vp a thouſand. The inſolencie of the one part,<note place="margin">The people of Florence offended with the nobilitie.</note> and the offence of the other, grew to that greatneſſe, that the heads of the people did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate vnto the Biſhop the diſhoneſtie of the great men, who were not by anie meanes content to liue like companions and neighbours. And therefore perſwaded him to finde meanes that the great Cittizens might be contented with the meane offices: and that the Magiſtracie of the <hi>Senate</hi> ſhould be onely left to them. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe was naturally good, but eaſily perſwaded to alter opinion: which was the cauſe, that by perſwaſion of his companions, he firſt fauoured the Duke of <hi>Athene,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:14349:36"/>
and ſhortly after by the counſell of other Citizens conſpired againſt him. So now he ſeemed in reformation of the ſtate, firſt to fauour the great men, and after to allow better of the people, moued by thoſe reaſons, which the populer Citizens had tolde him. He therefore ſuppoſing to find as ſmall conſtancie in others, as in himſelfe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded betwixt them a compoſition. Then he aſſembled the foureteene, who yet continued in their authoritie, &amp; perſwaded them to yeeld the office of <hi>Senate</hi> to the people, alleadging that would be the quiet of the citie, and the deniall, the ruine thereof. Theſe words did greatly chaunge the mindes of the great men, and <hi>Ridol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho de Bardi,</hi> with bitter words reproued the Biſhop, calling him a man not to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: laying before him the friendſhip which he entered with the Duke vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and how he baniſhed him afterwardes, traiterouſly. And in concluſion he ſaid, that thoſe honours which they with their perill had gotten, with their perill ſhould be defended. Thus being diuided from the Biſhop, he &amp; his companie tooke leaue, and went vnto others of their conſort, imparting the matter to all the Noble houſes in the Cittie. The people likewiſe brake their mindes to ſuch as were men of their condition. While the great men prepared themſelues to the defence of their <hi>Senators,</hi> the people thought good to be alſo readie, and ſuddeinly ranne vnto the Pallace ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: crying aloud, and requiring that the great Citizens ſhould renounce the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie. The rumour and tumult was great, and the <hi>Senators</hi> found themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned: becauſe all the people beeing armed, the great Cittizens durſt not take armes, but euerie one remained in his owne houſe. By meane whereof, the new <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators</hi> appointed by the people,<note place="margin">The autoritie of the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, taken from them.</note> firſt appeaſed the tumult, and then gaue knowledge thereof: ſaying that their companions were modeſt and good men, and that they were faine, for auoyding a worſe inconuenience to take this courſe, &amp; ſo ſent home the other <hi>Senators</hi> ſafe to their houſes. The great Citizens thus remooued from the Pallace, the office was alſo taken away from the foure great Counſellours. In whoſe place, they appointed twelue of the people, with the eight <hi>Senators</hi> that remained. They created one <hi>Gonfaloniere de Iustitia,</hi> &amp; ſixteene <hi>Gonfalonieri</hi> of the people. They alſo reformed the Councels, ſo as, all the gouernment remained at the diſcretion of the people. At ſuch time as theſe things happened, there was great dearth in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: by meanes whereof, both great Citizens and the baſeſt ſort of people became diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented. Theſe, for hunger, and thoſe for hauing loſt their authoritie: which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion made <hi>Andrea Strozzi</hi> to imagine, that it were poſsible for him to vſurpe the libertie of the citie.<note place="margin">Andrea Strozzi.</note> He perſwaded with that imagination, ſolde his corne much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cheape then others: by meanes whereof, many people reſorted vnto his houſe. And one morning hee mounted on horſebacke, being followed by ſome of them, tooke courage to call the people to armes: which done, within leſſe then one houre foure thouſand people were aſſembled; with whom he went to the <hi>Senate,</hi> deſiring the Pallace might be opened for him. But the <hi>Senators</hi> with threatnings and force, ſent him from thence, and after with proclamations ſo terrified him, that by litle and litle euerie man returned to his houſe. So as <hi>Andrea</hi> being left alone, could ſcantly flie and ſaue himſelfe from the Magiſtrates. This attempt, although it were vnaduiſed, and had ſuch ſucceſſe, as commonly all others like thereunto haue, yet did the ſame giue hope vnto the Nobilitie, that they might eaſily oppreſſe the people, ſeeing the pooreſt ſort miſliked them.<note place="margin">The nobilitie aſſaie to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> For not looſing this opportunitie, they determined to arme themſelues with all ſorts of aide, and recouer that reaſonably, which vniuſtly and by force, had bene taken from them. The aſſured hope they had conceiued of ſucceſſe in this enterpriſe, grew ſo great, that openly they prouided armes, fortified their houſes, and ſent to their friends in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> The people on the other ſide, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with the <hi>Senate,</hi> made their prouiſion, and arming them, ſent to the <hi>Saneſi</hi> and

               <hi>Perugini</hi> for aide. The aſsiſtaunce of the one, and the other beeing come,<note place="margin">The People armed againſt the nobilitie.</note> all the Cittie was in Armes, and the Nobilitie made head on this ſide <hi>Arno</hi> in three places. At the houſes of <hi>Cauicciulli</hi> neare to S. <hi>Giouanni</hi>: at the houſes of the <hi>Pazzi</hi> and <hi>Donati,</hi> in S. <hi>Piero Maggiore:</hi> and at the houſes of the <hi>Caualcanti</hi> in the newe Market. The others beyonde <hi>Arno,</hi> fortified the bridges and ſtreetes next to their houſes. The <hi>Nerli</hi> at the bridge <hi>Caraia</hi>; The <hi>Freſcobaldi</hi> and <hi>Mannelli,</hi> at S. <hi>Trinita.</hi> The <hi>Roſsi</hi> and <hi>Bardi,</hi> at the olde bridge; and the bridge <hi>Rubaconte</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelues. The people on the other part, vnder the <hi>Gonfaloniere della Iustitia,</hi> &amp; the Enſignes of companies aſſembled themſelues. Being thus prepared, the people thought good no longer to delaie the fight. The firſt that gaue the charge were the <hi>Medici</hi> and the <hi>Rondinegli,</hi> who aſſaulted the <hi>Cauicciulli,</hi> in that way which leadeth from the Court before S. <hi>Giouanni</hi> to their houſes. There the conflict was great, by reaſon that from the Towers ſtones were caſt downe to the harme of many, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low others with Croſſe-bowes were ſore hurt. This fight continued three houres, and ſtill the people encreaſed. Then the <hi>Cauicciulli</hi> ſeeing themſelues by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ouermatched, and wanting aide, yeelded to the people: who ſaued their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and their goods, and tooke from them onely their weapons, commanding them to diuide themſelues, and remaine in the houſes of ſuch Commoners as were their kinsfolks and friends. This firſt troupe vanquiſhed the <hi>Donati</hi> &amp; the <hi>Pazzi,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of leſſe force were eaſily ſubdued. Then remained only on this ſide <hi>Arno,</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualcanti,</hi> who by men and the ſeat of the place were ſtrong. Neuertheleſſe ſeeing all the <hi>Gonfalonieri</hi> againſt them, and knowing the others to haue bene by three <hi>Gonfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loni</hi> vanquiſhed without any great reſiſtance yeelded. Thus were three parts of the Cittie in the hands of the people, one part more remained to the Nobilitie: which was hard to be wonne, by reaſon of the ſtrength of them which defended it, and the ſeat of the place, it being ſo fortified with the riuer of <hi>Arno,</hi> that the bridges muſt firſt of force be ſurpriſed, which were defended in that ſort as is beforeſaid. The people then knowing that there they laboured in vaine, aſſaied to paſſe the bridge <hi>Ruba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conte:</hi> where finding the like difficultie, they left for guard of thoſe two bridges, foure <hi>Gonfaloni</hi>; and with the reſt aſſaulted the bridge <hi>Caraia.</hi> Where albeit the <hi>Nerli</hi> manfully defended themſelues, yet could they not withſtand the furie of the people. Both becauſe the bridge wanting towers of defence, was weak, &amp; the <hi>Capponi</hi> with other populer families alſo aſſailed them. In ſo much as being on euery ſide diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they retired and gaue place to the people; who forthwith likewiſe vanquiſhed the <hi>Roſci:</hi> by reaſon that all the people on the farre ſide of <hi>Arno</hi> ioyned with the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious. Then the <hi>Bardi</hi> were onely left, whom neither the ouerthrow of others, nor the vniting of the people againſt them, (nor the ſmall hope they had of reſcue) could any whit amaze: for they did chooſe rather to die fighting, ſee their houſes burnt, and their goods ſpoyled, then voluntarily ſubmit themſelues to the mercie of their enemies. They therefore defended themſelues with ſo great reſolution, that the people many times in vaine aſſaulted them, both vpon the old bridge, and vpon <hi>Rubaconte:</hi> and were with death of many, and the hurting of more, repulſed. There was in times paſt a lane, whereby men paſſed from the way that leadeth towardes <hi>Rome,</hi> by the houſe of the <hi>Pitti,</hi> to go vnto S. <hi>Giorgio.</hi> By this way the people ſent ſix <hi>Gonfalonieri,</hi> with commandement to aſſault the back ſide of the houſe of <hi>Bardi.</hi> That aſſault made the <hi>Bardi</hi> to looſe their hope, and occaſioned the people to aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of victorie: for ſo ſoone as thoſe who defended the ſtreetes knew their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were aſſaulted, they abandoned the fight, and ranne to ſaue them. This was the cauſe that the chaine of the old bridge was loſt, and that the <hi>Bardi</hi> on euerie ſide fled: who were by the <hi>Quarateſi Panzaneſi,</hi> and <hi>Mozzi</hi> encountred. The people in the

meane while (chiefly thoſe of baſeſt qualitie) being greedie of ſpoyle, ſacked their houſes, razed their Towers and burned them, with ſo great furie, that euen he that is moſt foe to the <hi>Florentine</hi> name, would haue bene aſhamed to behold ſo great a crueltie.<note place="margin">The Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie oppreſſed.</note> The Nobilitie thus oppreſſed, the people ordeined a gouernment. And becauſe the Cittizens were diuided into three ſorts, that is to ſay, great men, meane men, and baſe men. It was ordered that of the great men there ſhould be two <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> of the meane men three, and of the baſeſt men three. Alſo the <hi>Gonfalonieri</hi> ſhould ſometime be of the one, and ſometime of the other ſort. Moreouer the ordinances of Iuſtice, againſt the Nobilitie were confirmed. And to make the Nobilitie wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, they tooke ſome of that number, and mixed them with the populer multitude. This ruine of the Nobilitie was great, and ſo much weakened their faction, as after that time they durſt neuer take armes againſt the people: but continually remained poore and abiect of minde; which was the occaſion that <hi>Florence</hi> became ſpoyled, not onely of armes, but alſo of all generoſitie. After this ruine, the citie continued quiet, till the yeare 1353. In which time, happened that memorable plague (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Giouan Boccacio</hi> with great eloquence) hath written. Of which died in <hi>Florence,</hi> 96. thouſand perſons. The <hi>Florentines</hi> made then the firſt warre with the <hi>Viſconti,</hi> occaſioned by the ambition of the Archbiſhop, then Prince of <hi>Milan.</hi> That warre being ended, beganne ſuddeinly new factions within the Citie.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE greeuous and naturall enimities betwixt the people, and Nobilitie, through deſire of the one to commaund, and the other, not to obey: are cauſes of all euils, which happen in euerie citie. For of the diuerſitie of theſe humours, all other things which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe Common weales doo take their nutriment. This was that which held <hi>Rome</hi> diſunited. And this (if we may compare ſmall matters to great) was that which continued <hi>Florence</hi> diuided. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, in thoſe two cities, the diuiſions, did bring forth two ſundrie effects. For the enimitie of the people and Nobilitie in <hi>Rome,</hi> was at the beginning ended by diſputation: but the diuiſion of the people and Nobilitie of <hi>Florence,</hi> was with ſword and ſlaughter determined. That of <hi>Rome</hi> by lawe; but that of <hi>Florence</hi> by exile, and death of many Citizens was ended. That of <hi>Rome</hi> did alwaies encreaſe the vertue militarie, but that of <hi>Florence,</hi> vtterly extinguiſhed the ſame. That of <hi>Rome,</hi> from an equalitie of the Citizens, to a great diſequalitie, reduced the citie: but that of <hi>Florence,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſequalitie, to a maruellous equalitie was changed. Which diuerſitie of effects, muſt of force be occaſioned, by the diuerſe ends, which theſe two people had. For the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> deſired not more, then to participate the ſoueraigne honours with the Nobilitie, but they of <hi>Florence</hi> would be alone, and gouerne all without companie of the Nobilitie. And for as much as the deſire of the Romane people was more reaſonable, the offences done to the Nobilitie became the more tollerable. By meane whereof, that Nobilitie, without reſiſtance gaue place: and after ſome diſputation, a lawe was made to the peoples ſatisfaction, they being content that the Nobilitie ſhould continue their dignities. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the deſire of the <hi>Florentine</hi> people was iniurious and vniuſt; by reaſon whereof, the Nobilitie prepared themſelues for defence, and without baniſhment and bloud of the Cittizens, their contentions were not ended. Alſo thoſe lawes which were afterwards made, not for the common commoditie, but altogither in fauour of the people, were ordeined. Thereof proceeded likewiſe, that by victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the people, the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> became more vertuous. Alſo the people ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſometime authoritie in the warres, and commaundement in gouernment with the Nobilitie, were indowed with like vertue, and cauſed that citie by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of vertue in men, to encreaſe alſo in power. But in <hi>Florence,</hi> the people ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing victorie, the Nobilitie were depriued of Magiſtracie, and being deſirous to recouer it, it behoued them by their behauiour and manner of life, to endeuour themſelues, not onely to ſeeme, but alſo to be men populer. Heereof, came the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Enſignes, and the chaunge of titles, which the Nobilitie (to ſeeme common people) were conſtrained to make. So as that vertue in armes and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſitie
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14349:38"/>
of minde, which had bene in the Nobilitie, was extinguiſhed; and could not be reuiued in the people, where it was not: which is the cauſe that <hi>Florence</hi> euer after becam the more abiect. And as <hi>Rome</hi> knowing the vertue of it ſelf grew to ſuch pride, as without a Prince could not be mainteined: ſo <hi>Florence</hi> was reduced to ſuch termes, as euery wiſe law maker might haue brought the ſame to any order or forme of gouernment: as by reading of the former booke may partly be perceiued. Now hauing already ſhewed the beginning of <hi>Florence,</hi> &amp; the original of the liberty ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with the occaſions of diuiſion: and how the factions of the nobilitie and of the people, with the tyrannie of the Duke of <hi>Athene,</hi> did end: &amp; laſtly how the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were deſtroyed. It remaineth to diſcourſe the enimitie betwixt the people and the multitude,<note place="margin">The enimitie betweene the people and the multitude.</note> with ſuch accidents as of thoſe diuiſions proceeded. So ſoone as the authoritie of the Nobilitie was oppreſſed, and the warre with the Arch-Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> finiſhed; it ſeemed that no occaſion of diſpleaſure or offence, remained in <hi>Florence.</hi> But the froward fortune of our Cittie, and the euill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof, cauſed newe diſſention to ariſe, betwixt the families of <hi>Albizi</hi> and <hi>Ricci:</hi> which diuided <hi>Florence,</hi> as by the <hi>Buondelmonti</hi> and the <hi>Vberti,</hi> and as by the <hi>Donati</hi> and <hi>Circhi</hi> it had before beene diuided. The Popes, who at that time remained in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and the Emperours in <hi>Germany,</hi> to maintaine their reputation in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſent thither at ſundrie times, ſundrie multitudes of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>English</hi> men, <hi>Germaines,</hi> and <hi>Brittaines.</hi> They, (the warres ended) bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without paie and entertainment, ſometime vnder the Enſigne of one Prince, and ſometimes vnder an other, ſpoyled the Countrey. In the yeare 1353. one of thoſe companies came into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Monſigneur Reale,</hi> whoſe comming amazed all the Citties of that Prouince. And the <hi>Florentines</hi> did not onelie in that reſpect publiquely leuie forces, but alſo diuerſe priuate Cittizens.<note place="margin">The faction or diuiſion of Albizi and Ricci.</note> Amongeſt whome, the <hi>Albizi</hi> and <hi>Ricci,</hi> for their owne defence, Armed themſelues. Theſe two houſes hating one the other, ſtudied howe they might one oppreſſe the other: yet were they not come to Armes, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contended in the gouernment, and in Councell. The Cittie then vpon this occaſion armed, there happened by chaunce a quarrell in the olde Market: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many people (as is at like occaſions the cuſtome) reſorted. During the brunt of this brute, newes were brought to the <hi>Ricci,</hi> that the <hi>Albizi</hi> aſſailed them. And in like maner it was tolde to the <hi>Albizi,</hi> that the <hi>Ricci</hi> ſought for them. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe rumours, all the citie aroſe, and the Magiſtrates could with difficultie hold backe the one and the other of theſe families, from dooing of that violence, which without any fault or intent of theirs, was occaſioned. This chance (though of no importance) ſomwhat kindled the minds of thoſe gentlemen, &amp; euery of them were the rather deſirous to allure partakers. And foraſmuch as by the ruin of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, the Citizens were reduced to ſuch an equalitie, that the magiſtrates had more reuerence then they were wont, either of them determined by ordinary meane, and without priuate violence to oppreſſe his aduerſary. We haue alreadie tolde, how after the victory of <hi>Carlo</hi> the firſt, the <hi>Guelfi</hi> were created Magiſtrates, and to them great authoritie giuen ouer the <hi>Ghibilini.</hi> Notwithſtanding through tract of time and new diuiſions, that law became ſo much neglected, that many deſcended of <hi>Ghi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilini,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A new lawe againſt the Ghibilini oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationed by a priuie reſpect.</note> aſpired to the moſt principall offices. <hi>Vguccione de Ricci</hi> then chiefe of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, found meane, that the law againſt the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> was reuiued: of which faction (as ſome thought) the <hi>Albizi</hi> were, who many yeares paſt did come from <hi>Arezzo</hi> to inhabit <hi>Florence.</hi> Vpon reuiuing of this law, <hi>Vguccione</hi> hoped to depriue the <hi>Albizi</hi> of authoritie, becauſe thereby it was ordeined, that whoſoeuer was deſcended of the <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> ſhould not in any wiſe beare office in the ſtate. This practiſe of <hi>Vguccione</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:14349:38"/>
was diſcouered to <hi>Piero</hi> ſonne of <hi>Philippo degli Albizi,</hi> who determined to fauour it, leaſt doing the contrarie, he ſhould declare himſelfe a <hi>Ghibilino.</hi> This lawe although renewed by ambition of the <hi>Ricci,</hi> yet did it not diminiſh, but encreaſe the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Albizi,</hi> and was the originall of many miſchiefs. Neither can any lawe be made more preiudiciall to a Common weale, then that which hath relation to time, long ſince paſſed. <hi>Piero</hi> hauing thus conſented to the law, that, which his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had deuiſed for a let, was the high way to lead him to his greatneſſe. For being made as chiefe of this new ordinance, he ſtill encreaſed in reputation, and became more fauoured of the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> then any other. And for as much as there was no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate appointed for diſcouerie of the <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> the lawe alreadie made, ſerued to ſmall purpoſe. It was therefore prouided that authoritie ſhould be giuen to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, to detect thoſe that were of faction <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> and finding them, to giue admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that they ſhould not take vppon them any office in the ſtate: Or if they ſhould diſobey the ſaid admoniſhment, then to be condemned. Hereof it commeth, that ſince that time, all thoſe that be diſabled to beare office in <hi>Florence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ammoniti.</note> be called <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniti.</hi> The captains the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this authority grew to be ſo inſolent, as they did not only admoniſh thoſe that deſerued admonition, but alſo euery man, whomſoeuer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, being thereto moued by any cauſe whatſoeuer, either of couetouſneſſe or ambition. So that, from the yeare 1357. (at which time this ordinance was made) til the yeare 1366. more then two hundreth Citizens were admoniſhed. By this mean, the Captaines, &amp; faction of <hi>Guelfi</hi> were become mightie, becauſe euery man fearing to be admoniſhed, honoured them. The chief of them were, <hi>Piero delli Albizi, Lapo d<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Castiglionichio,</hi> and <hi>Piero Strozzi.</hi> And albeit this inſolent order of proceeding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed many, yet the <hi>Ricci</hi> were of all other moſt diſcontented. For they ſuppoſing themſelues to be the occaſion of this diſorder, ſaw the common weale ruined, &amp; the <hi>Albizi</hi> their enemies, contrary to expectation, become of moſt authoritie. Wherfore <hi>Vguccione de Ricci,</hi> being one of the <hi>Senate,</hi> deſired to ſtaie this miſchiefe, whereof he &amp; his friends were the beginners: and by a new law he prouided, that the ſix captains ſhould be encreaſed to the number of nine, of whom, two ſhould be of the ſmal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. And ordeined moreouer, that the detection of the <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> ſhould be by 24. Citizens of the ſect of <hi>Guelfi</hi> confirmed. This ordinance for the time, qualified the authoritie of the Captaines, ſo as the admoniſhment grew colde. And if anie happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be admoniſhed, they were not manie. Notwithſtanding, the factions of <hi>Albizi</hi> and <hi>Ricci,</hi> continued: and the leagues, practiſes, and reſolutions, deuiſed in hatred one of the other, did proceed. In this vnquietneſſe, the citie liued from the yeare 1366. till 1371. In which time the <hi>Guelfi</hi> recouered their forces. There was in the family of <hi>Buondelmonti,</hi> one Gentleman called <hi>Benchi,</hi> who for his merit, in the warre againſt the <hi>Piſani,</hi> was made one of the people, and thereby become ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the office of the <hi>Senate.</hi> And when he looked to be choſen to that honour, a lawe was made, that no Gentleman become one of the people, might exerciſe the office of the <hi>Senate.</hi> This greatly offended <hi>Benchi,</hi> wherefore conſulting with <hi>Piero delli Albizi,</hi> determined with the admonition to oppreſſe the meaner ſort of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the reſt alone to enioy the gouernment. Then through the fauour which <hi>Benchi</hi> had with the olde Nobilitie, and through the affection of manie of moſte mightie people borne to <hi>Piero,</hi> the faction of <hi>Guelfi</hi> recouered ſome force: and with new reformation, they handled the matter ſo, that they might both of the Captaines and the twentie foure Cittizens, diſpoſe as themſelues thought good. Wherevppon they returned to admoniſh more boldlie then they were woont and the houſe of <hi>Albizi,</hi> as head of this ſecte, ſtill encreaſed. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the <hi>Ricci</hi> failed not by their owne force and friendes to hinder their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14349:39"/>
enterpriſes all they were able, ſo that all men liued in ſuſpition, and euerie one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted his owne ruine. For which cauſe, manie Cittizens mooued with the loue of their Countrey, aſſembled themſelues in Saint <hi>Pietro Sceraggio,</hi> and reaſoning of theſe diſorders, went to the <hi>Senators:</hi> vnto whome one of moſt authoritie ſpake thus.<note place="margin">The Oration of the citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens touching factions.</note> Wee haue (my Lordes) doubted (although for a publique occaſion) to aſſemble our ſelues by priuate conſent, fearing to be noted for preſumptuous, or condemned as ambitious. Yet conſidering that euerie day (without reſpect) manie Cittizens conferre both in the ſtreetes and in their houſes, not for anie common commoditie, but their owne ambition: we do hope, that as they haue come togithers for the ruine of the Common weale, ſo it ſhall not be offenſiue, that we conſult by what meane the ſame might be preſerued: Neither is there cauſe why we ſhould regard them, ſeeing they of vs, make none eſtimation at all. The loue (my Lordes) which we beare to our Countrey, did firſt bring vs togither, and the ſame alſo hath ledde vs hither to intreate of theſe inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which are now great, and daily encreaſe in this our Common weale. In the redreſſe whereof, we offer our ſelues to aſsiſt you. And (albeit the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe do ſeeme hard) yet may it be performed, if it ſhall like your Lordſhips to laie by all priuate reſpects, and with publique forces imploy your authorities. The common corruption of other Citties of <hi>Italy,</hi> doth alſo corrupt ours. For ſith this Prouince was drawne vnder the Empire, all Cities (wanting Gouernours able to rule them) haue gouerned themſelues: not as free, but as townes into ſects and faction, diuided. Out of this, be ſprung vp al other diſcords that are to be found. Firſt, among the Citizens, there is neither vnion, nor friendſhip, but onely among ſuch, as haue againſt their countrey or priuate perſons, conſpired ſome lewde enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. Alſo, bicauſe religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; feare of God is in euery man almoſt extinguiſhed, othes and faith giuen, are none obligations equall to profit, which all men couet. Yet do they ſtil vſe both promiſing &amp; othes, not to obſerue them, but the rather to deceiue thoſe, that truſt them. And the more eaſily &amp; ſafely they can deceiue, the more they account their praiſe &amp; glory. For this reaſon, hurtfull men be commended as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, &amp; good men blamed as fooliſh. Yea, I aſſure my ſelfe, that all corruption, or that can corrupt others, is to be found in the cities of <hi>Italy.</hi> The young men are idle, old men wanton, euery ſects, and euery age full of lewde conditions: which good lawes, being euil vſed, do not amend. Hereof the couetouſnes which we ſee in Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and the deſire, not of true glory, but of ſhamefull honors, do proceed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon depend hatred, enmitie, diſpleaſures, &amp; ſects. Alſo of them do follow murders, baniſhments, perſecution of the good, &amp; aduancement of the euill. For good men truſting in their owne innocencie do not (as euil men) ſeeke extraordinary defence. Whereby vnſupported and diſhonoured, they are ſuffered to ſinke. This example occaſioneth loue of the factions, and their forces: becauſe the worſt ſort for coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe and ambition, and the beſt for neceſsitie, do follow them. It is alſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie conſideration (as that which is more perillous) to ſee how the leaders of theſe enterpriſes do colour their lewdneſſe with ſome honeſt or godly tearme. For (albeit they are all enemies to libertie) yet vnder the word <hi>Ottimacy,</hi> or popularitie, they cloake their euill intent. Becauſe the rewarde which they aſpect of victorie, is not glorie, by hauing deliuered the Cittie, but the ſatisfaction they take to be victorious, and vſurpe the gouernment thereof. Wherewith allured, there is nothing ſo iniuſt, nothing ſo cruell, or couetous, that they leaue vnattempted. Hereof it proceedeth, that lawes, and ſtatutes, not for the common, but the priuate profit, be made. Hereof it proceedeth, that warre, peace, and leagues, not for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like glory, but for the pleaſure of a few, are contracted. And albeit ſome other Cities
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14349:39"/>
be touched with theſe diſorders, yet none ſo fowly infected as ours. Becauſe the lawes, the ſtatutes, and ciuil ordinances, not according to a life in libertie, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to deſire of the faction victorious, haue bene, and yet are, ordeined; which is the cauſe that euer one faction driuen out, or one diuiſion extinquiſhed, ſodeinly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth an other. For that citie which is mainteined more by faction, then law, ſo ſoone as anie faction hath gotten the ouer hand, &amp; is without oppoſition: it muſt of force be, that the ſame becommeth in it ſelfe diuided. For by thoſe priuate meanes which were made for preſeruation therof, it cannot be defended: which to be true, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and moderne diuiſions of our citie do make triall. Euerie man thought that the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> extirped, the <hi>Guelfi</hi> ſhould euer haue continued in honour. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within ſhort time, the <hi>Bianchi</hi> and <hi>Neri</hi> aroſe. The <hi>Bianchi</hi> vanquiſhed, our citie continued not long without partes, but was ſometimes troubled with fauouring thoſe that were baniſhed, and ſomtimes with the enmitie betwixt the people, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. Yea, at length (giuing that to others, which by accord either we would not or could not poſſeſſe our ſelues) ſometimes to the King <hi>Roberto,</hi> ſometimes to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; laſt of all to the Duke of <hi>Athene,</hi> we yeelded our libertie. And in troth we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſetled our ſelues in any eſtate, as men, that could not conſent to liue free, nor be willing to obey: neither feared we liuing vnder a King (ſo greatly are our orders di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to diuiſion) to preferre before his maieſtie, a man of moſt baſe condition, born in <hi>Agobio.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Athene</hi> may not without ſhame of this citie be remembred: whoſe bitter and cruel mind might make vs wiſe, and inſtruct vs how to liue. But he being ſent away, we ſuddeinly tooke armes in hand, and with more malice and fury, fought among our ſelues, til all our auncient nobilitie were oppreſſed and left at the peoples diſcretion. Then was it thought by many, that neuer for any occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it were poſsible to ſtir vp new troubles or factions in <hi>Florence,</hi> they being caſt down, whoſe pride &amp; vnſupportable ambition was the cauſe thereof. Yet is it now ſeene by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how eaſily the opinion of men is deceiued. For the ambition and pride of the nobilitie was not quenched, but remoued into the people: who now (according to the cuſtome of ambitious men) hope to aſpire to the moſt ſoueraigne offices. And not wanting other meane to vſurpe the ſame, they moued new diſcords, &amp; new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions in the citie, raiſing vp the name of <hi>Guelfi</hi> &amp; <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> which, (had they neuer bene knowne) ſhould haue made our country the more happie. Beſides that, (to the end in this world ſhould be nothing in continuance or quietnes) Fortune hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that in euery ſtate, there ſhould be certaine fatall families, borne, and deſtined, to the deſtruction thereof. Of theſe, our Common weale hath bene more then anie other, repleniſhed. For not one, but many of them haue diſturbed the quiet therof. As, firſt of all the <hi>Buondelmonti</hi> and <hi>Vberti</hi>; then the <hi>Donati</hi> and <hi>Circhi.</hi> And euen now (a ſhamefull and ridiculous matter) the <hi>Ricci</hi> and <hi>Albizi</hi> do trouble and diuide our Citie. We haue not remembred you of thoſe corrupt cuſtomes, and our continuall diuiſion, to diſmay you, but call to your minds the occaſions of them, and enforme you, that the example of thoſe, ſhould not make you to diſpaire the reformation of theſe. Becauſe the power of theſe auncient houſes was ſo great, and the fauour that Princes did beare towards them ſo much, that the lawes and ciuill ordinances were not of force ſufficient to hold them in quiet and due obedience. But now the Empire hauing no force, the Pope not feared, and that all <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; this Citie alſo, is reduced to ſo great equalitie, as may by it ſelf be gouerned, the difficultie cannot be much. And this our common weale (notwithſtanding the ancient examples to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary) may not only be brought to vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo in good cuſtoms &amp; ciuil orders be reformed, if your lordſhips be diſpoſed to do it. Wherunto, we moued with the loue of our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp; no priuate paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do perſuade you. And albeit the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof be great,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14349:40"/>
yet allaie that diſeaſe which infecteth, that furie which conſumeth, that poyſon that killeth: and impute the auncient diſorders not to the nature of men, but the time: which being changed, it may hope, that by meane of new orders, new fortune will follow, whoſe frowardneſſe may be by wiſedome gouerned, in putting a bridle vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ambitious, diſanulling ſuch ordinances, as were nouriſhers of factions, and vſing thoſe that to a ciuill life and libertie, are agreeable. Be ye alſo pleaſed to do this by vertue of lawe, rather now, then deferre the ſame, till ſuch time, as by armes you ſhall be enforced thereunto. The Senators moued with theſe reaſons, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues had before conſidered, and thereunto adding the authoritie, and comfort of the men, gaue commiſsion to fiftie ſixe Citizens, to prouide for the ſafetie of the Common weale. True it is, that the counſell of many is more fit to conſerue a good order, then to inuent it. Theſe Citizens then ſtudied rather to extirpate the preſent factions, then take away the occaſion of future diuiſion. In ſo much, as neither the one or the other, was brought to paſſe: becauſe not remouing the occaſions of new diuiſion, and the one part of thoſe ſects which were preſent, being of greater force then the other,<note place="margin">New refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Florence.</note> became the more perillous to the ſtate. Wherefore, out of euerie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (excepting thoſe that were in the handes of the <hi>Guelfi)</hi> for three yeares they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued three men of the families of <hi>Albizi,</hi> and three of the houſe of <hi>Ricci:</hi> amongſt whom, were <hi>Piero delli Albizi,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vguccione dei Ricci.</hi> They prohibited all Citizens to come into the Pallace, ſauing at ſuch times as the Magiſtrates ſate there. They proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that who euer was ſtriken, or letted to poſſeſſe his owne, might call his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the Counſels, &amp; proteſt him for one of the Nobilitie. Theſe ordinances diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the <hi>Ricci,</hi> and incouraged the <hi>Albizi.</hi> For although they were equally noted, yet the <hi>Ricci</hi> were the more iniured. And albeit the Pallace of the <hi>Senate</hi> was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to <hi>Piero,</hi> yet the counſell houſe of the <hi>Guelfi</hi> (where he had great authoritie) was open for him. Therefore if he and his followers were at the firſt earneſt in admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, now after this iniurie, they became much more earneſt: and to that euil diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,<note place="margin">Pope Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</note> new occaſions were ioyned. At this time <hi>Gregorio</hi> 11. was aſpired to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, who liuing at <hi>Auignion,</hi> did (as his predeceſſors) gouerne <hi>Italy</hi> by Legates. They being men inclined to pride and couetouſneſſe, had thereby greatly afflicted many Cities. One of theſe Legates being in <hi>Bologna,</hi> taking occaſion of the dearth which happened that yeare in <hi>Florence,</hi> determined to make himſelfe Lord of <hi>Toſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> And therefore he not onely withheld from the <hi>Florentines,</hi> preſent reliefe, (but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to remoue all hope of future prouiſion) at the beginning of the next ſpring, with a great Army, entered their Countrey: imagining the people (diſarmed and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) might be eaſily conquered. And happily the enterpriſe had taken effect, if the ſouldiers that ſerued him, had bene faithfull and not corruptible. For the <hi>Florentines</hi> not hauing other remedie, gaue vnto them 130. thouſand <hi>Florins,</hi> and for that mony the ſouldiers abandoned the enterpriſe. To begin a warre, is in the power of euerie man, but to end a warre, no man can, when himſelfe ſo liketh. This warre by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Legate begun, was by the offence of the <hi>Florentines</hi> followed. For the better execution thereof,<note place="margin">A new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of war.</note> they made league with <hi>Barnabo,</hi> and with all the cities ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the church; and elected eight Citizens to gouern the ſaid war: vnto whom authoritie was giuen, to proceed without appeale, and ſpend without account. This warre begun againſt the Pope (notwithſtanding the death of <hi>Vgucciono</hi>) encouraged thoſe that followed the faction of <hi>Ricci,</hi> and had againſt the <hi>Albizi</hi> alwaies fauoured <hi>Barnabo,</hi> and disfauoured the church: and the more, for that the eight were all foes to the faction of <hi>Guelfi:</hi> which was the reaſon that <hi>Piero delli Albizi, Lapo di Castiglio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichio, Carlo Strozzi,</hi> and the reſt, diuerſe times ioyned, to the offence of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And while the eight made warre, and they admoniſhed, the warre continued
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14349:40"/>
three yeares, and by death of the Pope was ended. This warre was with ſo vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall ſatisfaction, and ſo great vertue gouerned, that the office of the eight, was from yeare to yeare continued in thoſe men, and they were called <hi>Santi,</hi> notwithſtanding they litle regarded the Popes curſes, ſpoiled churches, and forced the Clergie. Thus without reſpect, they preferred the ſeruice of their country before the Popes indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And thereby taught the church, that as being friend thereunto, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it, ſo being enemie, they were able to annoy it, hauing procured all <hi>Romagna, La Marca,</hi> and <hi>Perugia,</hi> to rebell. But notwithſtanding all theſe warres made by the <hi>Florentines</hi> againſt the Pope, yet could they not defende themſelues from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of their owne factions and their followers. For, the enuie which the <hi>Guelfi</hi> bare vnto the eight, made them to become inſolent, and though they ſpared the reſt of the Nobilitie, yet reſted they not to iniure the eight. Alſo the Captaines of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were growne vp to ſo great arrogancie, as they were more fauoured then the <hi>Senators,</hi> and men with more reuerence reſorted to their houſes, then to the Pallace. In ſo much as euerie Embaſſadour that came to <hi>Florence,</hi> brought with him ſome commiſsion or inſtruction to entreate with theſe Captaines. Then died Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> whereby the citie being deliuered of forreine warre, preſently begun great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion at home. For on the one ſide, the inſolencie of the <hi>Guelfi</hi> was inſupportable,<note place="margin">New tumults in Florence.</note> and on the other ſide, no meane could be deuiſed to oppreſſe them. Onely this hope was left, that euerie man ſhould take armes, and ſo make triall whether partie ſhould preuaile. On the part of the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> were all the old Nobilitie, with the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the mightieſt people: of whom (as hath bene declared) <hi>Lapo, Piero,</hi> and <hi>Carlo</hi> were the chiefe. On the other ſide, were all the people of leaſt reputation, who had for Leaders, the eight Gouernours of warre, <hi>Georgio Scali, Tomazo Strozzi,</hi> and with them the <hi>Ricci, Alberti,</hi> and <hi>Medici.</hi> The reſt of the multitude (as in like caſes it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer happeneth) ioyned to the partie diſcontented. It ſeemed then to the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> that the forces of their aduerſaries were great, and therefore themſelues in much daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whenſoeuer any vnfriendly <hi>Senate</hi> ſhould happen to be choſen. Therefore thought good for the preuenting of that miſchiefe, to aſſemble themſelues in ſome place conuenient, where they might conſult of the ſtate of that Citie. For it ſeemed that the Citizens admoniſhed, being in number growne great, the moſt part of the Citie were their foes. Whereto they could not deuiſe other remedie, but as they had taken from them the honours, ſo alſo to baniſh them the Citie, take the Pallace by force, and reduce all the ſtate, to the order wherunto it was by the auncient <hi>Guelfi</hi> reduced: who liued not ſecure for any other reaſon, but onely becauſe they had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out all their aduerſaries. To this plot euerie man conſented, but of the time of execution, they diſcented. The yeare 1378. being come, in the moneth of Aprill, <hi>Lapo</hi> thought good not to deferre the time ſaying, there was nothing that hindred time ſo much, as time: and then ſpecially becauſe in the next <hi>Senate, Saluestro de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> was likely to be choſen <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> whom to their factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knew moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Piero delli Albizi</hi> thought otherwiſe, for his opinion was it ſhould be deſerred, becauſe the execution of their intent required forces, which without publiſhing of the matter could not beleuied, &amp; if the matter were diſcouered, they ſhould ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by incurre manifeſt daunger. His opinion therefore was, it ſhould be delaied till the feaſt of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> (then at hand:) at which time, many people would reſort to the towne, among whome they might conuey in vnknowne, as many friendes as they thought good. Moreouer, to finde meanes how to preuent the election of <hi>Salue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro,</hi> it was thought fit to admoniſh him: and if that deuiſe ſeemed not good, then to put into the election an other alſo of the ſame quarter. So as, it might fall out, that inſteed of him, ſome other of his companions ſhould be choſen. This cauſe was ſet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14349:41"/>
downe as a reſolution, (notwithſtanding that <hi>Lapo</hi> vnwillingly thereunto, conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) iudging, delaie was dangerous, and that no time can be in euerie reſpect fit for execution. For whoſoeuer tarrieth all opportunities, either he ſhall neuer performe anything,<note place="margin">The Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy reuealed.</note> or if he doth, the ſame (for the moſt part) falleth out to his diſaduantage. The Colledge was warned, and <hi>Saluestro</hi> not repulſed, but choſen <hi>Gonfaloniere:</hi> for the eight hauing diſcouered the practiſe, found meanes to preuent that which was looked for. Thus <hi>Saluestro</hi> ſonne of <hi>Alemanno di Medici,</hi> who being of a verie noble populer houſe, could not endure that the people ſhould be by a few great men op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. And hauing deuiſed how to end their inſolencie, ſeeing the people fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that enterpriſe, he did communicate his intent to <hi>Benedetto Alberti, Tomazo Strez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi,</hi> and <hi>Georgio Scali:</hi> and they promiſed to bring him all the aide they poſsibly could. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was there a law ſecretly eſtabliſhed, wherby the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of iuſtice againſt the great men were renewed: &amp; the authoritie of Captains was diminiſhed. The ſame alſo, reſtored power to the admoniſhed, to haue reſtitution of their dignities. And becauſe (as it were at one inſtant) they intended both to propound and obteine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt to paſſe the Colledge, &amp; after to determine in the Councels, finding <hi>Salue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro</hi> Preſident (which place in thoſe dayes, for the time being, made him be placed as Prince of the Citie) they cauſed the Colledge &amp; Councell in one ſelfe morning to be aſſembled. And firſt to the Colledge onely, they propounded the lawe made, which as a new thing was by that ſmall number reiected. Whereby <hi>Saluestro,</hi> ſeeing his wings clipped, wherewith he hoped to aſcend to his deſire, fained for his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie to depart the place; and contrarie to expectation, went to the Councell: and ſtanding vp where he might be both ſeen and heard of euerie man, ſaid. He thought himſelfe made <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſpeech of Salueſtro di Medici.</note> not to determine of priuate cauſes, (which haue their ordinary Iudges) but to attend the ſtate, correct the inſolencie of the great men, and qualifie the rigor of thoſe lawes, which were found by proofe to hinder the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale. And albeit he had with diligence trauelled in theſe matters, and to his power preuented all inconueniences, yet the ſiniſter diſpoſition of men, ſo greatly oppoſed it ſelfe to his iuſt indeuour, that the way of well doing was ſtopped: and their intent was altered, not onely from determining well, but alſo from hearing thereof. Wherefore, ſeeing that he could not do aniething more for the ſtate, or the common commoditie, he knew not to what end he ſhould continue longer in that office, which either he deſerued not, or (as it was thought of others) he would not hereafter deſerue. For theſe reſpects he intended to retire home, to the end the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might put in his roome, ſome other of more vertue, or greater fortune. This ſpeech ended, he departed from the Councell towards his houſe, ſuch as were in the Councell his friends, with ſome others alſo deſirous of Innouation, began to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure. Then the <hi>Senators</hi> and Colledges drew neare, and finding their <hi>Gonfalone</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, by entreatie, and authoritie ſtaied him, and into the Councell, (being full of tumult) perſwaded him to returne, where many noble Citizens were with words moſt iniurious, threatned. Among whom, <hi>Carlo Strozzi,</hi> was by an Artificer taken by the bozome, and had bene ſlaine, if the ſtanders by had not ſaued him. But that which ſtirred the greateſt tumult, and put the citie in armes, was the motion of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedetto Alberti,</hi> who from the window of the Pallace, cried aloude to the people to take armes. Wherupon ſodeinly all the Court was full of armed men. By that mean, the Colledges were forced by threatnings and feare, to do that which being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they would not. In the meane time, the Captaines of the factions had aſſembled many Citizens, and conſulted how to defend them againſt the order of the <hi>Senators.</hi> But ſo ſoone as they heard the rumour appeaſed, and vnderſtood what was by the Councell reſolued, euerie man fled to his owne houſe. For there is no man that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14349:41"/>
any alteration in a Citie, that knoweth how either to worke it at his owne wil, or ſuppreſſe it, at his pleaſure. It was the intent of <hi>Saluestro</hi> to create a law, &amp; appeaſe the Citie: but the matter fell out contrarie. For the humours moued, had chaunged euerie man ſo much, that the ſhoppes were ſhut vp, Citizens were aſſailed at their houſes, many conueyed their goods to Monaſteries, and hid them in Churches, as though euerie one looked for ſome miſerie at hand. The companies of miſteries aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and euerie miſterie elected a <hi>Sindaco.</hi> Then the <hi>Priori</hi> called their Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the <hi>Sindachi</hi> conſulted with them, how the Citie might be made quiet, but their opinions being diuerſe, nothing was determined. The next day following, the miſteries drew forth their Enſignes, which the <hi>Senators</hi> knowing, &amp; doubting that which happened; called the Councels to put order: but ere they were all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, a tumult was begun, and preſently the Enſignes were come out, followed by armed men to the Pallace. Thereupon the Councell to giue hope of contentation to the miſteries and the people, and take from them the occaſion of ſuſpition, gaue generall authoritie to the <hi>Senate,</hi> the Colledges, the Eight, the Captaines of parts, and the <hi>Sindachi,</hi> to reforme the Cittie, for common commoditie thereof. While theſe matters were in hand, certaine of the Enſignes of miſteries, with others of leſſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie (thereby moued by ſome that deſired reuenge of the laſt iniuries receiued of the <hi>Guelfi)</hi> ſhrunke away from the reſt, and went vnto the houſe of <hi>Lapo di Castiglioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio,</hi> ſacking and burning the ſame. He hearing that the <hi>Senate</hi> had done an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe contrarie to order taken by the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> and ſeeing the people in armes, hauing no other remedie, but either hide himſelfe or flie; firſt hid him in <hi>Santa Croce,</hi> &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the habit of a Frier fled into <hi>Caſentino:</hi> where he was heard complaine of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for conſenting to <hi>Piero delli Albizi</hi>; and of <hi>Piero,</hi> for that he would needs deferre to aſſure the ſtate, till the feaſt of S. <hi>Giouanni.</hi> But <hi>Piero</hi> and <hi>Carlo Strozzi,</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the vprore hid themſelues, thinking that the brunt paſt, their friends and kinsfolkes were of force ſufficient to continue them ſecure in <hi>Florence.</hi> The houſe of <hi>Lapo</hi> being ſacked (becauſe miſchiefes are hardly begunne, and eaſily encreaſed) many other houſes (ſome for hate vniuerſall, and others by priuate diſpleaſure) were alſo ſpoiled and burned. And the miniſters of theſe miſchiefes, to make their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the more forcible, for the ſpoyling of other mens goods, brake the Gayles, &amp; let forth the priſoners. They alſo ſacked the Monaſterie of <hi>Agnoli</hi> and S. <hi>Spirito,</hi> where many Citizens had beſtowed their goods. Neither had the publique chamber of <hi>Florence</hi> eſcaped the hands of theſe diſordered ſpoylers, if one of the <hi>Senators</hi> had not taken vpon him the defence thereof; who on horſebacke followed with ſome armed men, reſiſted the furie of the multitude. This populer madneſſe, partly by mediation of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and partly for that the night drew on, was appeaſed.<note place="margin">New refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Florence.</note> The next day, the <hi>Balia</hi> reſtored fauour to the Citizens admoniſhed, with condition that within the next three yeares, they ſhould not be capable to exerciſe any office. They alſo diſanulled the lawes made by the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> in preiudice of the Citizens. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Lapo di Castiglionichio,</hi> and his companions Rebels, and with them diuerſe others hated of the multitude. After theſe reſolutions, they publiſhed new <hi>Senators,</hi> among whom <hi>Luigi Guicciardini</hi> was <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi>: whereby hope was conceiued, that all tumults wold ceaſe, becauſe they were holden quiet men and louers of peace. Notwithſtanding the ſhops were kept ſhut, the Citizens ſtill armed, and great wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the citie charged. For which cauſe the <hi>Senators</hi> receiued not their office without the Pallace with the pompe accuſtomed, but within, not vſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ceremonie at all. Theſe <hi>Senators</hi> thought nothing ſo neceſſarie to be done at their entry into office, as to procure a peace in the citie, and therfore cauſed al armes to be laide downe, the ſhops to be opened, and the people of the countrey (called
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14349:42"/>
thither in the fauour of Citizens) to be diſpatched away. They ordeined Guards in many places of the citie; ſo as if the Citizens admoniſhed, could haue liued content, the people had bene quiet. But they not willing to abide three yeares from honour, did finde meane, that for their ſatisfaction, the miſteries againe aſſembled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the <hi>Senate,</hi> that for the good of the citie and quiet thereof, no Cittizen might any more be admoniſhed as a <hi>Ghibilino,</hi> either by the <hi>Senators,</hi> the Colledge, Captaine, or Conſull. Moreouer, they required new Imborſation to be made of the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> and the old to be burned. Theſe demands were preſently accepted, both by the <hi>Senate,</hi> and all other Councels: becauſe thereupon it was ſuppoſed, all newe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults would ceaſe. But mans nature doth not onely content it ſelfe with his owne, but will alſo couet other mens, and be reuenged. Thoſe that hoped in the diſorder, declared to the miſteries that they ſhould neuer be aſſured, vnleſſe many of their enemies were driuen out, and oppreſſed. Which requeſt being preſented, the <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> called before them, the officers of miſteries, &amp; the <hi>Sindachi,</hi> to whom <hi>Luigi Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardini Gonfaloniere</hi> ſpake in manner following.<note place="margin">The Oration of Luigi Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardini.</note> If theſe Lordes, and I alſo, had not knowne the fortune of this cittie, the cuſtome whereof is, that ſo ſoone as it hath made peace abroad, the warre within beginneth: we would haue more maruelled at the tumuls paſſed, and therewith haue bene more greeued. But becauſe things accuſtomed, do bring with them leſſe ſorrow, we haue endured theſe troubles with great patience, and the rather, for that they were begun, without any our default, and ſhall (we hope) end, as all others before haue done, ſith we haue alreadie, in ſo many, and ſo great demands, ſatisfied you. Neuertheleſſe perceiuing that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reſt contented, but ſtill with new iniuries ſeeke to diſturbe your Citizens, and condemne them to newe baniſhments: of your diſhoneſt dealings, our greeuous ſorrow groweth. And truly, if we had thought, that within the tearme of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, this citie ſhould haue bene ſo troubled, we would either by voluntary or violent exile, haue ſhunned theſe honors. But hoping to deale with men, in whom remained curteſie and loue to their country, we willingly receiued theſe offices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing our clemencie, ſhould haue ſuppreſſed your ambition. But, we now ſee by experience, that the more mildly we beare our ſelues towards you, the more proud ye are, and the more diſhoneſt requeſts ye demand at our hands. This plainneſſe of ſpeech we vſe, not to offend you, but to remember you, for our meaning is, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall ſpeake that which pleaſeth you, and we that which is beſt for you. Tell vs (we pray you) what is that, you can honeſtly more require at our hands? You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that the authoritie ſhould be taken from the captains of factions, &amp; ſo it was. You deſired the Imborſations ſhould be burnt &amp; new reformation made, to that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented. You demanded the reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the admoniſhed Citizens to their honors; and they were reſtored. We haue alſo at your entreatie pardoned thoſe that burned houſes, &amp; robbed the churches. Yea for your ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we haue ſent into exile, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honourable and mightie Citizens. The great men alſo by your meanes are with new lawes brideled. What end will thoſe your demands haue? Or how long will you abuſe your libertie? See ye not that we with more patience did endure to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctored, then you to be victorious? Whither will theſe miſdemeanours drawe this your citie? Do ye not remember that by like diſunion, <hi>Castruccio</hi> a poore Citizen of <hi>Lucca,</hi> did oppreſſe it? And the Duke of <hi>Athene,</hi> a priuate Captaine of your owne, did conquere it? So long as it liued in vnion, the power of an Archbiſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> and a Pope, could not preuaile againſt it: but after, a warre continued diuerſe yeares, abandoned the enterpriſe with ſhame. Why would ye then, that your own diſcord, ſhould in peace bring this citie in bondage, which ſo many mightie enemies haue (notwithſtanding their warre) left free? What profit ſhall you looke for by your

diuiſion, other then ſeruitude? Or what commoditie will riſe of the goods you haue robbed, other then pouertie? For they are thoſe, that by our induſtry haue fed the citie: wherof being ſpoiled, it can no longer be nouriſhed. And they that ſhall vſurpe them, wil (as of things euil gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) not know how to keep them. Wherof ſhal follow famine and pouertie. I, and theſe Lords commaund yee, and (if without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie we ſo may) earneſtly praie you to ſtaie your minds, and reſt contented with thoſe things which by vs are ordeined. And whenſoeuer you deſire anie new ſute at our hands, ſeek the ſame ciuilly, and ſtriue not with tumult &amp; armes to obtaine it. For whatſoeuer you reaſonably aske, will be graunted, and men euill diſpoſed ſhal want occaſion to oppreſſe our citie to your ſhame, and the ruine therof. Theſe words (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were true) greatly moued the citizens, and much they thanked the <hi>Gonfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniere,</hi> for hauing performed the office of a good Lord &amp; citizen, offering to obey, wherin ſo euer it ſhould pleaſe him to command them. The <hi>Senators</hi> alſo, to giue the occaſion, did authorize two citizens of euery principal office, togither with the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dachi,</hi> to practiſe a reformation, to the common quiet, and report their doings to the <hi>Senate.</hi> While theſe matters were in hand, an other tumult aroſe,<note place="margin">New tumult in Florence.</note> which troubled the ſtate more then the former. For the greater part, of the burning &amp; ſpoyling in times paſt, were done by the baſeſt ſort of people, who notwithſtanding that being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, they were audatious, yet they euer feared that the furie once paſt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, they ſhould receiue puniſhment for their defaults, or (as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened) be abandoned by thoſe that encouraged them to the performance of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Whereunto was ioyned a hatred of the baſe people, towards the rich Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and heads of the myſteries, iudging themſelues not ſo well paide for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as they had deſerued. Becauſe at ſuch time as the cittie was firſt by <hi>Carlo</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into myſteries, and euerie myſterie a head thereunto appointed, it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted that the ſubiects of euerie myſterie ſhould be in all ciuill matters iudged by the head thereof. Theſe myſteries (as we ſaid before) were at the beginning twelue, afterwards encreaſed to 21. and they became of ſo great power, as in fewe yeares they had all the gouernment of the Cittie. Alſo to the end there ſhould be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt thoſe that were more, or leſſe honourable, they were diuided, and ſeuen of them were called great myſteries, and foureteene named the leſſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. By theſe diuiſions, and ſome other occaſions before recited, grew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie of the Captaines of factions. Becauſe thoſe Cittizens which aunciently were <hi>Guelfi</hi> (vnder whoſe gouernment that office continued) did euer fauour the people of the great myſteries: and perſecuted the leſſe myſteries with their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Whereuppon followed all the tumults that we haue rehearſed. And for that in ordering the bodies of the myſteries, many occupations exerciſed by diuerſe of the baſe people, and common multitude had no place of their owne in the bodie of the myſteries: they were referred &amp; put vnder ſome other myſteries like vnto theirs. Whereof followed, that they either were not ſatisfied for their labours, or by their maiſters oppreſſed, and ſo forced to complaine to the Magiſtrates, of thoſe myſteries who gouerned them: at whoſe handes (as they thought) they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not that iuſtice that to them belonged. Alſo that myſterie which had in it the greateſt number, was the myſterie of wooll, which being of moſt force and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, did nouriſh and entertaine the greateſt part of the multitude, and baſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The multitude then as well of the myſterie of wooll as others (for the cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaide) was full of offence: therewith remembring the burning and ſpoiles by them committed, diuerſe times aſſembled in the night, and reaſoning of matters paſt, euerie man tolde other the daunger wherein they ſtoode. The one of them, a man of moſt audacitie and experience, to animate the reſt, ſpake to this

effect.<note place="margin">A ſeditious perſuation of one of the multitude.</note> If we were now to conſult whether it be beſt to take armes, robbe the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and ſpoile the churches, my ſelfe would thinke it a matter conſiderable, &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſhould preferre a quiet pouertie, before a perillous profit. But ſith armes be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie taken, and many diſpleaſures done, mee thinkes, it behoueth vs not to let goe the aduantage, but ſeeke meane how to aſſure our ſelues. I certainly thinke, that if no man would therein aduiſe vs, yet neceſsitie alone might counſell vs. You ſee all this citie full of diſpleaſure and hatred againſt vs. The Citizens do often aſſemble, and the <hi>Senate</hi> is alwaies accompanied with officers. You ſee they laie ſnares to entrap vs, and prepare new forces to oppreſſe vs. Therefore it ſtandeth vs vpon to procure two things, and in our Councels to haue two endes. The one, that for your late do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we may not be puniſhed, the other, that we may liue with more libertie and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, then heretofore we haue done. It behoueth therefore (as I thinke) that to obtaine pardon of all former faults, our beſt meane is to commit ſome new: dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling all our miſdeeds, by burning, robbing, and ſpoiling, and therein to make many companions. For where many offend, none are puniſhed, and ſmall faults are chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but great and greeuous offences be rewarded. Alſo where many are iniured, fewe do ſeeke reuenge. Becauſe vniuerſal diſpleaſures, are with more patience, then particuler wrongs endured. Therefore the multiplying of miſchiefes is the readieſt way to forgiueneſſe, and the beſt meane to obtaine thoſe things, which for our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie are deſired. Surely it ſeemeth, we go now to a certaine victorie: for as much as thoſe, that ſhould impeach vs, be diſunited and rich. Their diſunion ſhall giue vs victorie, and their riches (being made ours) ſhall maintaine it. Let not the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their bloud (wherof they ſo much boaſt) diſmaie you: for all men hauing one beginning be equally auncient, and are by nature made all after one maner. Behold them naked, you ſhall finde them like to vs, and let vs be clad with their garments, and they with ours; we ſhall aſſuredly ſeeme noble, and they of baſe condition: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe only pouertie and riches are thoſe things, which make the diſequalitie. It gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me to thinke, that many of you do in conſcience repent things done, and intend to refraine doing the like. Surely it is true, that you are not thoſe men, I thought you to be: for indeed, conſcience, nor infamie ought to feare you, ſith hee that winneth victorie, in what maner ſo euer it be, doth neuer receiue ſhame thereof. As for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, none account is thereof to be made. For who ſo ſtandeth in feare of famine and priſon, as you do, ſhould not be daunted with dread of death and hell. And if we conſider the maner of mens proceedings, we ſhall find, that all thoſe who haue gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned great riches or glorie, either by fraude or force are aſpired. And thoſe thinges, which they haue either by craft or violence obteined, (to cloake the infamie of their theft, and make it ſeeme honeſt) do call the ſame purchaſe. Yea, whoſoeuer for want of wit, or rather plaine folly, doth not follow this courſe, either ſinketh in ſeruitude, or periſheth in pouertie. For in troth faithfull ſubiects are ſlaues, and good men be ſtill plagued with want. Such as eſcape bondage, be the moſt faithleſſe, and audati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and they that ſhunne lacke, be onely couetous perſons, or craftie. For God and nature haue laide fortune before all men; of whom we ſee more enclined to robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie then induſtry: and more to the bad, then to good actions diſpoſed. Hereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that one man eateth an other, and he that can do leaſt, muſt ſuffer moſt. You ought therfore to vſe force when occaſion is offered: which can be at no time more then now. The Citizens are diuided, the <hi>Senate</hi> fearefull, and the Magiſtrates diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed. So that before they can be vnited, and reſolued, it is moſt eaſie for vs to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them. By which oppreſsion, we ſhall either become wholly Princes of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or at the leaſt, owners of ſo much, as we ſhall thereby, not onely haue pardon of paſſed errors, but alſo authoritie to threaten new. I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe this reſolution is bold
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14349:43"/>
and daungerous, but where neceſsitie pincheth, deſperation is iudged wiſedome. And in great enterpriſes, valiant men account not of perill: becauſe thoſe attempts which begin with daunger, do end with glorie. Alſo from one daunger men do not eſcape, but by hazarding an other. I likewiſe thinke that ſith we ſee the priſons, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and death prepared for vs, we ought rather feare to ſtand ſtill, then ſeeke to aſſure our ſelues: for by the one, the miſchiefe is certaine, by the other doubtfull. How often haue I heard you complaine vpon the couetouſneſſe of your ſuperiors, and the iniuſtice of your Magiſtrates? Now is the time not onely to be deliuered from them, but alſo to become ſo much their ſuperiors, as they ſhall haue more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to feare you, then you them. The opportunitie which this occaſion offereth, doth paſſe, and being paſt, cannot be called againe. You ſee the prepare of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, let vs preuent their intention. For which ſo euer of vs do firſt take armes, ſhall no doubt be victorious, with ruine of the enemie, and aduancement of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Thus may many of vs gaine glorie, and euerie man enioy ſecuritie. Theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions greatly kindled their minds, alreadie warmed with deſire of miſchief. In ſo much as they reſolued to take armes, and the rather, hauing drawne vnto them more companions of their diſpoſition: whome by oath they bound to helpe them when any ſhould happen by the Magiſtrates to be oppreſſed. While theſe men prepared to ſurpriſe the ſtate, their intent was diſcouered to the <hi>Senators,</hi> who had in hand one called <hi>Simone,</hi> of whom they vnderſtood all the conſpiracy, &amp; that the next day they ment to make a tumult: which perill perceiued, the Colledges did aſſemble, &amp; with the <hi>Sindachi</hi> practiſed to vnite the citie, but before euerie man was come, the night drew on. Then were the <hi>Senators</hi> aduiſed to ſend for the Conſuls of myſteries, who being togither, agreed that all men of warre within <hi>Florence</hi> ſhould be warned to appeare: and the <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> the morning following with their companies to be armed in the Market place. At ſuch time as <hi>Simone</hi> was tormented, and the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens aſſembling, one called <hi>Nicholo da San Friano,</hi> kept the clocke of the Pallace, who being aware of that buſineſſe in hand, beganne to ſpread rumours among his neighbours, ſo as ſuddeinly in the Market place of <hi>Santo Spirito,</hi> more then a thouſand armed men were aſſembled. Theſe newes came to the eares of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſpirators, and <hi>San Piero Maggiore,</hi> and <hi>San Lorenzo</hi> (places by them appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) were full of men armed. By that time day appeared, which was the twentie one of Iuly. At which houre, came not to the Market place in fauoure of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> aboue eightie men of armes, and of the <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> not one: for they hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Cittie was all in Armes, feared to leaue their houſes. The firſt of the multitude that came to the Market place, were thoſe that aſſembled at <hi>San Piero Maggiore:</hi> for whoſe comming the men of Armes remooued not. Then the reſt of the multitude came, and finding no reſiſtance, with a terrible crie demaunded of the <hi>Senate</hi> to enlarge the priſoners, and not ſeeing them deliuered vpon that threatning, ſought by force to haue them, and ſet fire on the houſe of <hi>Luigi Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardini.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Senate,</hi> for auoyding a worſe inconuenience, deliuered the priſoners. Hauing obteined this demaund, they remooued the <hi>Gonfalone della Giustitia</hi> from the <hi>Eſecutore,</hi> and vnder him burned the houſes of many Citizens, perſecuting thoſe, that either for publique or priuate occaſion was hated. Alſo manie Cittizens to reuenge priuate iniuries, brought them to the houſes of their enemies. For it ſufficed that anie one man cried, let vs goe to ſuch a place, or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Gonfalone</hi> by the hande, looked that way. They likewiſe burned all the writings belonging to the myſterie of wooll. Thus hauing committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie euilles, to accompanie them with ſome lawdable deede: they made <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uestro de Medici,</hi> and diuerſe other Knightes, to the number of three ſcore
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14349:44"/>
and foure. Among whom, were <hi>Benedetto</hi> and <hi>Antonio degli Alberti, Tomazo Strozz,</hi> and ſuch others their truſtie friends, yet were ſome of them enforced thereto. In which accident, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other thing, it is to be noted, that ſome of them whoſe houſes they burned, were in the ſame day (ſo neare was the benefit to the iniurie) made knightes: which experience was ſeene in <hi>Luigi Gonfaloniere della Giustitia.</hi> The <hi>Senators</hi> amidſt theſe tumults, finding themſelues abandoned by the men of armes, grew doubtful of the heads of the myſteries, and their <hi>Gonfalonieri:</hi> for none of them according to order giuen, came to the reſcue. And of ſixteene <hi>Gonfaloni,</hi> onely the Enſigne of the golden Lyon, and that of the Cowe and Calfe, with <hi>Giouanni Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bini,</hi> appeared. And they alſo tarried not long in the Market place, becauſe they were not followed by the reſt. On the other ſide, the Citizens ſeeing the furie of the vnbrideled multitude, and the Pallace abandoned, ſome remained in their houſes, others followed the troupes of armed men, hoping the rather to ſaue their owne houſes and defend their friends. By meane whereof the power of the people encreaſed, and the forces of the <hi>Senate</hi> diminiſhed. This tumult conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all that day, and the night being come, at the Pallace of <hi>Stephano</hi> behinde the Church of S. <hi>Barnabo,</hi> it ſtaied. The number of theſe men paſſed ſixe thouſand. And before the day appeared, the next morning they cauſed by threatning the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries to ſend for their Enſignes. Then came foorth the <hi>Gonfalone della Giustitia,</hi> and accompanied with the Enſignes of the myſteries, went to the Pallace of the <hi>Podesta:</hi> who denying to yeelde the poſſeſsion of that houſe, they fought with him, and at length wanne that place. The Senate deſirous to make compoſition with them, ſith by force they could not appeaſe them, called three of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and ſent them to the Pallace of the <hi>Podesta,</hi> to vnderſtand the intent of the people: who founde, that the heades of the multitude with the <hi>Sindachi</hi> of the myſteries, and ſome other Citizens, had determined what ſhould be required of the <hi>Senate.</hi> So as, they accompanied with foure of the people ſpecially appointed, returned with theſe demaundes.<note place="margin">Demaunds of the People.</note> Firſt that the myſterie of wooll, might not from that time foorth haue anie ſtraunger for their Iudge. That three new corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of myſteries ſhould be erected: one to conteine the Carders and Diars; the ſecond to conteine the Barbars, Hoſiers, and ſome other mechanicall Artes; and the third, for the poore people. Alſo, that of theſe three newe myſteries, there ſhould be two of the <hi>Senate:</hi> and of the foureteene leſſe myſteries, three. That the <hi>Senate</hi> ſhould prouide houſes for the meetings and aſſemblies of theſe newe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations. That no man within theſe bodies corporate, ſhould within two yeares, be conſtrained to paie anie debt of leſſe ſumme then two duckets. That the banckes ſhould take no preiudice, but the principall onely to be reſtored. That all men baniſhed or condemned, ſhould be called home. That all the Cittizens admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſhould be admitted to their honours. Many other things in the fauour of their priuate friends they demanded: and likewiſe the contrarie, that many their enemies might be confined and admoniſhed. All which demaundes notwithſtanding they were diſhoneſt and vnfit for the ſtate: yet for feare of worſe, were by the <hi>Senators,</hi> Colledges, &amp; people graunted. Alſo to the end they might receiue full perfection, it behoued to haue them allowed by the common Councell. And (becauſe in one day two Councels could not be aſſembled) that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultation of force was deferred til the next day. In the meane time, it was thought good, that the myſteries &amp; people ſhuld reſt content &amp; ſatisfied, they promiſing, that ſo ſoon as the law were in perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, all tumults ſhuld ceaſe. The next morning while the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel debated the matter, the multitude impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; voluble, vnder their enſigns we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the market place, ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; crying ſo terribly, that all the Councel &amp; the <hi>Senat</hi> were diſmaid. Wherupon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14349:44"/>
               <hi>Gueriante Marignuolo,</hi> one of the <hi>Senators</hi> (mooued rather with feare then any other priuate paſsion) vnder colour to keepe the gate, went downe and fled to his houſe: yet could he not ſo ſecretly paſſe, but was by the multitude knowne. Otherwiſe they did him no iniurie, then crie out ſaying, that the <hi>Senate</hi> would all abandon the Pallace, vnleſſe their children were ſlaine, and their houſes burnt. In the meane ſpace, the lawe was made, and the <hi>Senators</hi> returned to their chambers. Alſo the Councell came downe and ſtaied in the Galleries and Courts without going fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as men diſpairing of the citie, either becauſe they perceiued ſo great diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and frowardneſſe in the multitude, or ſo great cowardice in others, who had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to oppreſſe, or at the leaſt, to allaie the rage of theſe tumults. The <hi>Senators</hi> were alſo amazed, and diſpairing of their countrey, beheld one of their company fled, and no other Cittizen that would either aſsiſt them with force or counſell. Therefore they reſolued of that they could, being incertaine what elſe they ſhould do. <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo Strozzi,</hi> and <hi>Benedetto Alberti,</hi> either mooued with priuate ambition, deſiring to be onely Lords of the Pallace, or elſe becauſe they ſo thought beſt, perſwaded the others to giue place to this populer furie, and as priuate men returne home to their houſes. This counſell giuen by thoſe that were heads of the tumult (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the reſt gaue place) made <hi>Alamanno Acciaiuoli,</hi> and <hi>Nicholo del Bene,</hi> (two of the <hi>Senate</hi>) to become offended. Yet after being come to themſelues, they ſaid; that if other men would depart, they could not let them: but for themſelues, they would not go, till their time appointed, vnleſſe that with their authoritie they did alſo looſe their liues. Theſe contrarieties of opinion, doubled the diſpaire of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and the peoples offence. In ſo much as, the <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> deſiring rather to end his office with ſhame, then perill, reſigned the ſame to <hi>Tomazo Strozzi,</hi> wholed him from the Pallace, and conducted him to his houſe. The other <hi>Senators</hi> in like maner, one after an other, went home. Then <hi>Alamanno</hi> &amp; <hi>Nicholo,</hi> to ſhew no more courage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſeeing themſelues left alone, departed alſo: whereby the Pallace remained in the hand of the multitude and the eight gouernours for the warre,<note place="margin">

               </note> who had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vp their offices. At ſuch time as the people entred the Pallace, one <hi>Michele di Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> a Carder of wooll, bare the Enſigne of the <hi>Gonfaloniere Giustitia,</hi> hee being bare legged and raggedly apparrelled, followed with the multitude, went vp the ſtaires, and being come to the preſence of the <hi>Senators,</hi> ſtaied, and turned himſelfe to the multitude, ſaying; Doo you not ſee that this Pallace and this cittie is yours, and in your hands? what doo you now thinke good to doo? Whereto euerie man aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that hee ſhould be <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> and Lorde to diſpoſe, and gouerne the cittie as himſelfe thought good, <hi>Michele</hi> accepted his authoritie, for hee was indeede a man verie wittie, and more bounde to Nature, then Fortune.

To the execution of which ſeruice, the greater number of thoſe that were preſent did goe. Then to begin that gouernment with iuſtice, which by fauoure of the multitude was giuen him, he commanded by proclamation, that no man ſhould ſteale or take iniuſtly from another. And the rather to terrifie all men,<note place="margin">Ordinaunces of Michele Lando.</note> hee erected a Gibbet in the Market place, he diſplaced the <hi>Sindachi</hi> of myſteries, and made new; he depriued the <hi>Senate</hi> and Colledges, &amp; burned the <hi>Borſi.</hi> In the mean time Sir <hi>Nuto</hi> was by the multitude brought into the market place and there hanged by one ſoote. Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his ſword cut him in pieces, til at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth there remained not any thing but his foote. On the other ſide, the eight gouernours for the war (ſuppoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by the departure of the <hi>Senators</hi> to be only Lords of the citie, appointed new

Then it ſeemed to the poore multitude, that in this reformation of the ſtate, the better ſorte of people were too much partakers thereof: and they not to haue therein ſo much authoritie as to defend themſelues, if neede ſhould require.<note place="margin">The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud offended with Michele Lando his lawes.</note> Wherefore ſet on with their accuſtomed boldneſſe, they tooke armes againe, and vniting themſelues vnder their Enſignes came anew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Market, demaunding of the <hi>Senators</hi> to come downe to the <hi>Ringhiera,</hi> and conſult of new matters concerning their ſecuritie and good. <hi>Michele</hi> ſeeing their arrogancie, (yet not to moue them to more offence, without asking what they would) blamed the maner of their demaunding, and perſwaded them to laie downe armes, ſaying, that ſhould be graunted vnto them, which with the graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Senate</hi> through force, might not be graunted. The multitude with that offended, aſſembled neare the Pallace of S. <hi>Maria Nouella,</hi> where among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they appointed eight heades with their miniſters and orders, which gaue them reuerence and reputation. So as, the citie had two places of ſtate, and was by two diuerſe officers gouerned.

Theſe appointments taken, to make them the more aſſured, they ſent two of them to the <hi>Senate,</hi> to require their conſent, intending, that if that were not graunted, that then by force they would haue it. Thoſe meſſengers, with great audacitie and more preſumption, declared their Commiſsion to the <hi>Senate:</hi> and told the <hi>Gonfalone</hi> what honour and authoritie they had giuen him, and with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and ſmall reſpect at his hand, they were reacquited. At length falling from words to threatnings, <hi>Michele</hi> could no longer endure ſuch arrogancy. But remembring more the place hee occupied, then the baſeneſſe of his late eſtate, thought meete by extraordinary meane, to bridle an extraordinary inſolency; and drawing forth the ſword he ware, hurt one of theſe meſſengers and after cauſed him to be bound and impriſoned. This being knowne, greatly offended the multitude, and hoping to winne that by force, which vnarmed they could not, preſently tooke armes with great furie, and marched towards the <hi>Senators,</hi> with intent to compell them. <hi>Michele</hi> on the other ſide, doubting that which followed, determined to preuent them, and imagining it more for his glorie to aſſault others, then tarry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and be aſſaulted, and ſo like to his predeceſſors be forced with ſhame of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to flie away: did aſſemble a great number of Cittizens, who (hauing well aduiſed themſelues of their errours) mounted on horſebacke, and being followed by many armed men, went to <hi>Santa Maria Nouella,</hi> to fight with the enemy. The people hauing (as wee before declared) made the like determination, almoſte
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14349:45"/>
at the ſame time marched to the Marketplace: but it happened that the one paſſed by one ſtreete, and the other by an other, ſo as by the way they met not. <hi>Michele</hi> being returned backe, founde the Market place taken, and the Pallace aſſaulted:<note place="margin">Michele Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do victorious.</note> hee therefore ſuddeinly charged the enemies and ouerthrew them. Some were forced to flie, others caſt downe their weapons, and others hid themſelues. This victorie gotten, the tumult was appeaſed, onely through the vertue of the <hi>Gonfalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere,</hi> who for courage, wiſdome, &amp; integritie, excelled all the Citizens of that time, and is to be numbred among thoſe few that haue profitted their country. For had he bene of euil diſpoſition or ambitious, the common weale had vtterly loſt the libertie therof, &amp; ſhould haue fallen into a greater tyrannie then that of the Duke of <hi>Athene:</hi> but the bountie of <hi>Lando</hi> was ſuch, as ſuffred no thoght to enter his mind that might be preiudiciall to the vniuerſall quiet. His wiſedom directed all things, ſo as many of his fellowſhip gaue him place, &amp; his aduerſaries by force of armes were oppreſſed. Which maner of proceeding, cauſed the multitude to ſtand diſmaied, and the better ſort of Artificers to looke about them, &amp; thinke how great their ſhame was, hauing oppreſſed the great mens pride, to endure the populer dregs. At ſuch time as <hi>Michele</hi> obteined this victorie againſt the multitude, a new <hi>Senate</hi> was choſen, wherin were two men of ſo vile and vnworthie condition, as euery man deſired to be acquit of that great infamie. When theſe officers were created (which was the firſt day of September) the Market place was full of armed men. So ſoone as the olde Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors came out of the Pallace, there was a brute giuen out among the armed men, that they would not, that any of the baſe people ſhould be of the number of <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Senate</hi> for their ſatisfaction depriued two, the one called <hi>Tira,</hi> the other <hi>Baroccio,</hi> in whoſe roomes, they placed <hi>Georgio Scali,</hi> and <hi>Franceſco di Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chele.</hi> They alſo depoſed the myſteries of the baſe people, and all officers, excepting <hi>Michele-Lando, Lorenzo di Puccio,</hi> and a fewe others of the better ſort. They diuided the honours into two parts, allotting the one, to the greater myſteries, the other to the leſſe. Of the <hi>Senate,</hi> they willed there ſhould be euer fiue of the leſſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and foure of the great. And the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> to be choſen ſometimes of the one, and ſometimes of the other. The ſtate thus ordeined for the preſent, appeaſed the citie. And albeit the gouernment was taken away from the baſe people, yet the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers of meaneſt condition, remained more mightie then the populer Nobilitie, who were forced to giue place, to winne from the baſe people the fauoure of the myſteries, and content them: which was alſo fauoured, by ſuch as deſired that thoſe ſhould be oppreſſed, who vnder the name of <hi>Guelfi,</hi> had with great inſolencie iniured many Cittizens. Among others that allowed this manner of gouernment, <hi>Georgio Scali, Benedetto Alberti, Saluestro di Medici,</hi> and <hi>Tomazo Strozzi</hi> were made as Princes of the citie. Theſe matters thus proceeding and handled, the diuiſion alreadie begunne betwixt the populer Nobilitie, and the meane Artificers, through ambition of <hi>Ricci</hi> and <hi>Albizi,</hi> became confirmed. Whereof (becauſe afterwardes followed greeuous effects, and of them we ſhall be often occaſioned to ſpeake) we will call the one populer, the other plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. The ſtate continued thus three yeares, full of baniſhments and murthers.<note place="margin">New diuiſion in Florence.</note> For they that gouerned, knowing there were both within and abroade, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie euill contented, did liue in great ſuſpition.

And thoſe that liued without, hauing no bridle, by meane of ſome Prince or ſome Common weale, here and there, ſowed ſedition. At this time <hi>Giannozzo di Salerno,</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Durazzo,</hi> deſcended of the Kings of <hi>Napoli,</hi> hapned to be at <hi>Bologna,</hi> intending to aſſault the kingdom, &amp; take the ſame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

During this doubtfull time, it was reuealed to the Magiſtrates, that <hi>Giannozzo</hi> of <hi>Salerno,</hi> ſhould with the baniſhed men preſent himſelfe before <hi>Florence,</hi> and that many within would take armes and deliuer the citie to his hand.<note place="margin">Diuers great Cittizens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</note> Vpon this report many were accuſed, the chiefe of whom, were <hi>Piero delli Albizi,</hi> and <hi>Carlo Strozzi:</hi> and next to them the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priani Giaccomo Sacchetti, Donati Barbadori, Filippo Strozzi,</hi> and <hi>Giouanni Anſelini:</hi> who were all taken, ſauing <hi>Carlo Strozzi,</hi> that fled. And the <hi>Senate,</hi> to the end none ſhould take armes in their fauour, appointed <hi>Tomazo Strozzi,</hi> and <hi>Benedetto Alberti,</hi> with many armed men to guard the citie. Theſe Citizens were apprehended and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the accuſation and their anſwere conferred togither, no fault was in them found: Inſomuch that the Captaine not willing to condemne them, their enemies in the meane ſpace moued the people to mutinie, and by force they were iudged to death. Neither was <hi>Piero degli Albizi</hi> any whit fauoured, either for the greatneſſe of his houſe, or for that long time he had in the citie more reputation then any other, and had bene there more honoured and feared. During his proſperitie, ſome friend of his, either to perſwade him to curteſie in his greatneſſe, or elſe ſome enemie to threaten him with the inconſtancie of fortune: at ſuch time as hee made a ſolemne banquet to diuerſe Citizens, ſent him a ſiluer diſh full of Comfits, and in thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits was hidden a naile; which being founde and ſeene of diuerſe his gueſtes, it was imagined, that thereby he ſhould remember to ſtaie the wheele: becauſe fortune hauing ſet him on the height thereof (the wheele keeping courſe) muſt needes caſt him downe. Which interpretation, was firſt by his decaie, and after by his death ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. After this execution, the citie remained full of confuſion, becauſe both the victored, and the victorious ſtood in feare: but the worſt of all was, that the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours themſelues liued in continuall ſuſpition. For euerie accident were it neuer ſo litle, made them to do new iniuries to the factions, condemning, admoniſhing, and ſending the Citizens into exile. Whereunto they ioyned new lawes, and new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, many times made, onely to fortifie their authoritie. All which was done to the iniurie of them who were to their faction ſuſpected. And they created fortie ſixe men, who with the <hi>Senate</hi> ſhould diſcouer men ſuſpected to the ſtate. Theſe officers admoniſhed thirtie nine Citizens, making many populer perſons great men, &amp; many great men, populer. Alſo, the rather to withſtand all external forces, they enterteined <hi>Iohn Aguto,</hi> an Engliſh Captain, who, in thoſe daies, was accounted of great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the war, &amp; had long ſerued the Pope &amp; others in <hi>Italy.</hi> The ſuſpition abroad proceeded of intelligence giuen, how certain companies of men at armes belonging to <hi>Carlo Durazzo,</hi> were put in readineſſe, to aſſault the kingdome. Among whom, (as was reported) were many baniſhed <hi>Florentines.</hi> For the meeting with thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, beſides the ordinarie forces, a ſumme of mony was prouided. <hi>Carlo</hi> arriued in <hi>Arezzo,</hi> receiued of the <hi>Florentines</hi> fortie thouſand Duckets, promiſing not to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt them.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14349:46"/>
the inſolency of <hi>Georgio Scali,</hi> and <hi>Tomazo Strozzi</hi>; whoſe authoritie preuailed more then the Magiſtrates: and euerie man feared, leaſt they beeing followed with the people, would oppreſſe them. In ſo much as, that, not onely the good men, but alſo the ſeditious ſort, accounted that gouernment tyrannicall &amp; violent. But to the end, that the inſolencie of <hi>Georgio</hi> ſhould at length take end) it fortuned that hee became accuſed of one <hi>Giouanii Cambio,</hi> his companion: hauing (as he ſaid) practiſed diuerſe waies againſt the ſtate: yet vpon examination, was found guiltleſſe by the Captaine. So as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Iudge went about to puniſh the accuſer with that puniſhment, which the partie accuſed ſhould haue ſuffered, had he bene found faultie. And <hi>Georgio,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſute nor authoritie, able to ſaue him, went with <hi>Tomazo Strozzi,</hi> and the multitude armed to deliuer him by force. At which time, they ſacked the Captaines Pallace, and forced him (for ſafetie of his perſon) to hide himſelfe, which action fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the citie with ſo much hatred towards him, that thereby his enemies hoped to ouerthrow him, and take the citie both from him, &amp; the plebeyall people alſo: who through preſumption, had vſurped the ſame three yeares. Thereof alſo the Captaine gaue great occaſion; for he (the tumult ceaſed) went to the <hi>Senate,</hi> &amp; ſaid, that as he had willingly taken vpon him, that, whereto their Lordſhips had elected him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therein he hoped to ſerue iuſt men, readie to take armes, in the fauoure, not in the preiudice of iuſtice: ſo ſeeing he had ſeene and knew the gouernment of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the maner of life therein; that office which he willingly tooke in hand for his profit and honour, as willingly there he would yeeld the ſame vp to ſhunne the perill, and loſſe that might thereof follow. The Captaine was by the <hi>Senators</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and promiſed reparation of former loſſes and future ſecuritie. Then certaine of them, togither with ſome Cittizens, who were holden louers of the Common weale, and men leaſt ſuſpected, concluded that a good opportunitie was offered to take the citie from <hi>Georgio,</hi> and the multitude. By reaſon, that through that his late inſolencie, the Citizens were greatly alienated from him: and was therefore good to execute that intent, before the offended mindes of the multitude were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For well they knew, that the fauoure of the multitude vpon euery trifling ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident is gotten and loſt. Iudging moreouer, that for the bringing this enterpriſe to effect, it behoued them to winne the good will of <hi>Benedetto Alberti,</hi> without whoſe conſent the action ſeemed dangerous. This <hi>Benedetto</hi> was a man exceeding rich,<note place="margin">Benedetto Alberti.</note> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, graue, a louer of the libertie of his country, and ſuch a one, as much miſliked the tyrannous proceedings of the time. By meane whereof, it was eaſie both to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe him, and alſo perſwade him to the deſtruction of <hi>Georgio.</hi> For, the occaſions, which made him enemy to the populer Nobilitie and <hi>Guelfi,</hi> and friend to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, was their inſolencie, and their tyrannous maner of gouernment. And, ſeeing that the heads of the multitude, were become of like inſolencie, he would likewiſe leaue them, as one that would not conſent to the iniuries by them done to many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. So in concluſion, thoſe reaſons which induced him to take part with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did alſo perſwade him to leaue them. <hi>Benedetto</hi> and the heads of the Arts thus drawne to fauoure the populer Nobilitie, tooke armes, apprehended <hi>Georgio,</hi> &amp; <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi> fled away. The next day after, <hi>Georgio</hi> was beheaded, to ſo great terror of his partie, as no man moued in his fauour, though euery man went to behold his ruine.<note place="margin">Georgio Scali beheaded.</note> He being brought to die, complained of thoſe people, that lately had adored him, and lamented his own hard fortune, and the malignitie of the Citizens, who hauing wrongfully iniured him, were forced to fauoure, and honour the multitude, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was neither truſt nor grautuitie. And knowing <hi>Benedetto Alberti</hi> among the reſt, of the armed men, ſaid vnto him; And thou <hi>Benedetto</hi> doeſt conſent to ſee me here ſo iniured, as if I were where thou art, I would not ſuffer thee: but I do prognoſticate,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14349:47"/>
that as this day is the end of my miſerie, ſo is the ſame the beginning of thy deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He complained moreouer of himſelfe, for hauing too much truſted to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom euerie voice, euerie action, and euerie ſupition moueth and corrupteth. With theſe lamentations he ended his life, amidſt his enemies armed, and reioycing at his death. Shortly after, certaine other his neareſt friends were ſlaine, and drawne in the ſtreetes by the people. The death of this Citizen troubled all the citie; for at the execution thereof, many tooke armes in fauoure of the <hi>Senate</hi> and Captaine of the people. Many other, either for their owne ambition, or ſuſpition, did the like. Alſo the citie being full of diuerſe humors, euerie man had his diuerſe intent: which hee deſired to execute before armes were layd downe. The olde Nobilitie (called great men) could not endure to ſee themſelues depriued of the publique honours: and therefore with all ſtudie laboured to recouer them, liking well that authoritie ſhould be reſtored to the Captaines of factions. To the populer Nobilitie, and the greater myſteries it was offenſiue, that the ſtate was participated with the leſſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and baſe people. On the other ſide, the leſſe myſteries deſired rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe then diminiſh their dignities. And the poore people, feared to forgo their Colledges. Which diuerſitie of mindes, made continually in <hi>Florence</hi> tumults to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, for the ſpace of one yeare. Sometimes the great men, ſometimes the chiefe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, ſometimes the leſſe, togither with the multitude, and ſometimes altogithers, at one inſtant in diuerſe places were armed. Whereof enſued among themſelues, and with the ſouldiers of the Pallace, diuerſe conflicts. The <hi>Senate,</hi> ſometimes by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing place, and ſometimes by fighting, ſought all they could to remedie that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. Inſomuch as, in the end, and after two conſultations, and two <hi>Balie,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the citie, and after many harmes, many trauels, and many great perils, a gouernment was ſetled:<note place="margin">New refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Florence.</note> whereby were reuoked, all thoſe that before, and ſith <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uestro de Medici</hi> was <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> had bene confined. All priuiledges and prouiſions, were taken away from thoſe to whome they had bene giuen by the <hi>Balia</hi> of 78. All honours were reſtored to the <hi>Guelfi.</hi> The two new myſteries were diſcorporated, and euerie of thoſe remitted vnder the auncient myſteries. The <hi>Gonfaloniere di Guistitia,</hi> was taken away from the leſſe myſteries, and they reduced to be partakers of halfe the third part of the honours, and of thoſe the beſt were taken from them. So that, the faction of populer Nobilitie &amp; <hi>Guelfi,</hi> recouered the gouernment, &amp; the multitude loſt their authoritie, which they had holden from the yeare 1378. til 81. at which time, this alteration happened: neither was this gouernment leſſe iniurious towards the Citizens, nor more mild, then was that of the multitude. For ſo many of the populer Nobilitie were confined, as had bene noted to be defenders thereof, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with a great number of the principall men of the multitude. And among them,<note place="margin">Michele Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do confined.</note> 
               <hi>Michele Lando</hi>; whoſe former authoritie and good deſerts, could not in this time of populer furie, ſaue him. His country therfore, for many good merits, was to him vnthankfull. Into which errour, becauſe many Princes and Common weales do fall, is the cauſe, that men vppon like examples terrified, before they feele the ſmart of their gournours ingratitude, do firſt offend them. Theſe exilements &amp; theſe ſlaughters did diſpleaſe, and euer had diſpleaſed <hi>Benedetto Alberti,</hi> and he both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, and priuately, blamed them. For which cauſe, the Lords of the ſtate feared him, as chiefe friend to the multitude, and thought him conſenting to the death of <hi>Georgio Scali:</hi> not becauſe his doings did offend him, but to be alone in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides that, his words and workes did encreaſe the ſuſpition, which made that ſide which gouerned, to keepe eye vpon him, and watch opportunitie to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe him. The citie liuing in theſe tearmes, the actions abroad were of no great importance. For if any thing were done, it proceeded of feare, by reaſon that <hi>Lodouico
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14349:47"/>
di Angio</hi> came then into <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Carlo di An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio, come into Italy.</note> to reſtore the kingdome of <hi>Napoli</hi> to the Quene <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanna,</hi> and remooue <hi>Carlo Durazzo.</hi> The paſſage of this Prince, greatly amazed the <hi>Florentines</hi>; for <hi>Carlo</hi> (according to the cuſtome of old friends) demaunded of them aide, &amp; <hi>Lodouico</hi> (like vnto him that ſeeketh new friends) deſired them to ſtand neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall. Whereupon the <hi>Florentines</hi> to ſeeme willing to content <hi>Lodouico,</hi> and aide <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> diſcharged <hi>Giouanni Aguto,</hi> and procured Pope <hi>Vrbano</hi> to entertaine him: which ſubtiltie was eaſily by <hi>Lodouico</hi> diſcouered, and for the ſame held himſelfe much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured by the <hi>Florentines.</hi> During the warre betwixt <hi>Lodouico</hi> and <hi>Carlo</hi> in <hi>Puglia,</hi> new forces came from <hi>France</hi> in the fauoure of <hi>Lodouico,</hi> who arriued in <hi>Toſcana,</hi> were by the baniſhed men of <hi>Arezzo</hi> brought into that citie: where they remoued the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which gouerned for <hi>Carlo:</hi> intending alſo to haue chaunged the ſtate of <hi>Florence,</hi> as they had altered <hi>Arezzo.</hi> Then died <hi>Lodouico,</hi> wherby the affaires of <hi>Puglia</hi> &amp; <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcana</hi> varied Fortune. For <hi>Carlo</hi> aſſured himſelfe on the kingdome, which was well neare loſt. And the <hi>Florentines</hi> miſtruſting the defence of <hi>Florence,</hi> recouered <hi>Arezzo</hi> and bought it, of thoſe ſouldiers which kept it, for <hi>Lodouico. Carlo</hi> then being aſſured of <hi>Puglia,</hi> went to take poſſeſsion of <hi>Hungheria,</hi> which was by inheritance deſcended vnto him, leauing his wife in <hi>Puglia,</hi> with <hi>Ladiſlao</hi> and <hi>Giouanna</hi> his children, being but babes, as hereafter ſhall be declared. <hi>Carlo</hi> poſſeſſed <hi>Hungheria,</hi> but ſhortly after there died. For this conqueſt, much tryumph was made in <hi>Florence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The death of Carlo di An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio.</note> and the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence thereof was no leſſe both for publique and priuate expence, then if the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therof had bene their owne. For many families kept open feaſts: and the houſe of <hi>Alberti</hi> for pompe and magnificence exceeded the reſt. The expences &amp; charge of Armour that the <hi>Alberti</hi> vſed, were not onely fit for priuate perſons of the beſt degree, but for the greateſt Princes: which gained them no ſmall enuie. Whereto adding the ſuſpition which the ſtate had of <hi>Benedetto,</hi> was the cauſe of his ruine;<note place="margin">Benedetto Alberti ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and enuied.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe that gouerned, could not endure him: fearing euerie houre it might come to paſſe, that through fauoure of his faction, hee might recouer reputation, and driue them from the citie. Theſe doubts remaining, it happened, that he being <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> of companies, <hi>Philippo Malagotti</hi> his ſonne in lawe, was choſen <hi>Gonfalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere di Giustitia:</hi> which doubled the miſtruſt of the Gouernours, imagining that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedetto</hi> encreaſed ouer faſt in force, and the ſtate thereby in much perill. For preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which inconueniences without tumult, they encouraged <hi>Beſe Magalotti,</hi> his companion, to ſignifie to the <hi>Senate,</hi> that <hi>Philippo</hi> hauing paſſed his turne, could not, nor ought not, exerciſe that office. The cauſe was by the <hi>Senate</hi> examined, ſome of them for hate, ſome to take away occaſion of ſlander, iudged <hi>Philippo</hi> not capable of that dignitie, and elected in his place <hi>Bardo Mancini,</hi> a man to the plebeyan fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction contrarie, and mortall enemie to <hi>Benedetto.</hi> In ſo much as, hee beeing placed in office, called a <hi>Balia</hi> for reformation of the ſtate, and therein confined <hi>Benedetto Alberti,</hi> and admoniſhed the reſt of that family, onely <hi>Antonio Alberti,</hi> excepted. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedetto</hi> being readie to depart, called vnto him all his friendes, and ſeeing them ſad,<note place="margin">The ſpeech of Benedetto Alberti, at his baniſhment.</note> ſaid; you ſee (my good fathers and Lords) in what ſort Fortune hath oppreſſed me, and threatned you: whereof I maruell not, neither ought you to maruell.

The loue of my Countrey made me to ioyne with <hi>Saluestro di Medici,</hi> and after to depart from <hi>Georgio Scali.</hi> The ſame did likewiſe perſwade me, to hate the maners of thoſe that now gouerne: who as they haue not had any to puniſh them, ſo do they deſire, that none ſhould finde fault with them. For my part I am content with my baniſhment to acquite them of that feare which they had, not of me onely, but of euerie other man, that knoweth their tyrannous and wicked dealings. My puniſhment therefore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14349:48"/>
doth threaten others; of my ſelfe I take no pitie: for thoſe honors which my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being free hath giuen me, now brought vnto ſeruitude, cannot take from mee. And the memorie of my paſſed life ſhall alwaies more comfort mee, then mine hard fortune which brought mine exile, ſhall diſcourage me. It greeueth me much, that my country ſhould become a ſpoile for a fewe, and be ſubiect to their pride and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe. I am alſo right ſorie to thinke, that thoſe euils which now ende in me, will begin in you. And I feare, leaſt thoſe miſeries wil perſecute you with more hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, then they haue perſecuted me. I would therefore counſell you, to prepare your mindes againſt all misfortunes, and beare your ſelues ſo, as what aduerſitie ſo euer happen (for many will happen) euery man may know you are faultleſſe, &amp; that without your guilt they be hapned. After this leaue taken, to giue as great a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his bountie abroad,<note place="margin">The death of Benedetto Alberti.</note> as hee had done in <hi>Florence</hi>: he trauelled to the Sepulchre of Chriſt, from whence returning, in the Ile of <hi>Roda</hi> hee died.

Among the admoniſhed were the <hi>Couoni,</hi> the <hi>Benini,</hi> the <hi>Rinucci,</hi> the <hi>Formico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> the <hi>Corbozi,</hi> the <hi>Manegli,</hi> and the <hi>Alderotti.</hi> It was the cuſtome to create the <hi>Balia</hi> for time certaine, but thoſe Citizens hauing it in their hands, being placed by honeſt meane, notwithſtanding their time were not expired, did yeelde vp their offices: which being knowne, many ranne armed to the Pallace, deſiring that before the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers departed, more Citizens might be confined, and admoniſhed. Which requeſt greatly offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the <hi>Senat,</hi> who with faire promiſes enterteined them, til forces were made readie, &amp; then wrought ſo, as feare enforced them to laie downe thoſe armes, which furie cauſed them to take in hand. Yet ſomewhat to feed ſo fierce an humor, and notwithſtanding take away more authoritie from the plebeyall Artizans: it was ordered, that where they had the third of the offices, they ſhould now haue onely the fourth part. Alſo, to the ende that two of the moſt truſtie Citizens might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies of the <hi>Senate,</hi> they gaue authoritie to the <hi>Gonfaloniere di Giustitia,</hi> and foure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citizens, to make a <hi>Borza</hi> of choſen men: out of which number at euerie <hi>Senate</hi> ſhould be elected two. The ſtate thus ſetled after ſix yeares (which was in the yeare 1381.<note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

In which time, <hi>Giouan Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza Viſconti,</hi> called <hi>Conte di Vertu,</hi> tooke priſoner his vncle <hi>Barnabo,</hi> &amp; by that mean, became Prince of all <hi>Lombardy.</hi> This <hi>Giouan Galiazzo</hi> hoped by force to be made king of <hi>Italy,</hi> as by craft he was atteined to be Lord of <hi>Milan.</hi> And in the yeare 1390. hee began a braue warre againſt the <hi>Florentines:</hi> wherein Fortune became ſo variable, as many times the Duke was in no leſſe daunger to loſe all then the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had loſt all, if the Duke had longer liued. Yet the reſiſtance by them made, was ſo couragious and maruellous, as might be by any Common weale; and the end no leſſe perillous, then the warre had bene terrible. For when the Duke had taken <hi>Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna, Piſa, Perugia,</hi> and <hi>Siena,</hi> and prepared a Crowne to be ſet on his head in <hi>Florence,</hi> as king of <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The death of Galiazzo.</note> he died. Which death ſuffered him not to taſte the ſweete of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed victories, nor the <hi>Florentines</hi> to feele the perils at hand. While this warre with the Duke continued, <hi>Maſſo de gli Albizi</hi> was made <hi>Confaloniere di Giustitia,</hi> whom the death of <hi>Piero</hi> had made enemie to the <hi>Alberti.</hi> And for that the humour of the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions continued, <hi>Maſo</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>Benedetto</hi> was dead in exile) did hope before that <hi>Senate</hi> ended, to be reuenged vpon the reſt of that family: and tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, by one that was vpon certaine practiſes with the Rebelles examined, who
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14349:48"/>
named <hi>Alberto</hi> and <hi>Andrea delli Alberti.</hi> Whereupon, both they were apprehended, and the citie wholly chaunged. In ſo much as the <hi>Senate</hi> tooke armes, aſſembled the people, created a new <hi>Balia,</hi> and by vertue thereof, many Cittizens were confined, and new Imborſations of officers made. Among thoſe that were confined, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the <hi>Alberti,</hi> many Citizens alſo admoniſhed, and ſome put to death. Vpon occaſion of ſo great iniuries, the myſteries and the baſe people tooke armes, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their honour and liues were in hazard. One part of them came into the Market place, an other ranne to the houſe of <hi>Veri di Medici:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Veri di Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci.</note> who after the death of <hi>Salue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro</hi> remained as chiefe of that family. To deceiue thoſe that came into the Market place, the <hi>Senate</hi> appointed Captaines, and gaue the Enſigne of the faction <hi>Guelfa,</hi> deliuering the ſame into the hands of <hi>Rinaldo Gianfigliazzi,</hi> and <hi>Donato Acciaiuioli,</hi> as men of the populer number, more then any other acceptable to the multitude. Thoſe that went to the houſe of <hi>Veri,</hi> deſired him to take the gouernment, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them from ſuch as were enemies to good men, and good orders. All ſuch wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as haue left memorie of the proceedings of that time, do affirme, that if <hi>Veri</hi> had not bene more honeſt, then ambitious, hee might without any let, haue aſpired to the principallitie of that citie. Becauſe the exceeding great iniuries done to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, ſome iuſtly and ſome vniuſtly, had ſo kindled their mindes to reuenge, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanted for the performance of their deſires, but a Captaine to lead them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted thoſe, that would put <hi>Veri</hi> in remembrance what he might do. For <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio di Medici</hi> (who had before time bene long for priuate reſpects, his enemy) did perſwade him to take in hand the gouernment of the ſtate. To whom he anſwered, as thy threatnings (being mine enemie) made me not to feare thee; ſo thy Councell being my friend, ſhall not abuſe me. Hauing vttered theſe words, he turned himſelfe to the multitude, and perſwading them to be of good courage, promiſed to be their defender, ſo that they would be content to be by him directed.<note place="margin">The ſpeech of Veri di Medici to the Senat of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> Then in the midſt of them he went to the Market place, and from thence vp to the Pallace, and being come to the preſence of the <hi>Senate,</hi> ſaid. That he was not ſorie to haue ſo liued, that the people of <hi>Florence</hi> did loue him: but yet ſorie hee was, that they had not ſuch opinion of him, as his paſſed life did deſerue. For ſith he had not ſhewed any ſigne of ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ambition, he could not conceiue why he was thought a mainteiner of ſedition (or as ambitious) a man that ſtudied to vſurpe his country. Therefore hee humbly beſought their Lordſhips, that the ignorance of the multitude might not be imputed his fault: becauſe ſo much as in him was, hee ſubmitted himſelfe vnto them. He moreouer put them in minde to vſe their fortune modeſtly, and be content to take rather halfe a victorie with ſauing the citie, then a whole conqueſt with the ruine thereof. The <hi>Senators</hi> greatly commended <hi>Veri,</hi> and required him to perſuade, that armes might be laide downe, and then they would not faile to do that, which he and other Citizens ſhould counſell them. After theſe ſpeeches, <hi>Veri</hi> returned to the Market place, and ioyning his followers, to thoſe that were conducted by <hi>Rinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> and <hi>Donato,</hi> ſaid vnto them all, that hee had found in the <hi>Senators</hi> a verie good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition towards them, to whom he had alſo ſaid much, albeit by means of the ſhort time, and abſence of the officers, nothing was concluded. Wherfore he praied them to laie their weapons downe, and obey the <hi>Senate</hi>: thereby to declare that curteſie, rather then pride, entreatie, more then threatning, might moue them: and that they ſhould not lacke meanes and ſecuritie, ſo long as they were by him gouerned. Thus vpon his word euery man was content to return to his owne houſe. The multitude hauing vpon this perſwaſion diſarmed themſelues, the <hi>Senate</hi> firſt cauſed a guard to be ſet in the Market place: then they muſtered two thouſand Cittizens, men aſſured to the ſtate, equally diuiding them vnder <hi>Gonfaloni,</hi> whom they commaunded to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14349:49"/>
readie whenſoeuer that they were called. Alſo commandement was giuen, that no man whoſe name was not taken nor warned, ſhould for anie cauſe be armed. This preparation made, they confined &amp; ſlew many of thoſe Artificers which had in the late tumult ſhewed themſelues moſt ſeditious and violent. And to the end that the <hi>Gonfaloniere de Giustitia,</hi> might haue more reputation &amp; dignitie: it was ordered and thought neceſſary, that whoſoeuer did exerciſe that office, ſhuld be of 45. yeres. For confirmation of the ſtate, many other prouiſions were deuiſed. Theſe ordinances made, the <hi>Senators</hi> were inſupportable, and to the good Citizens (euen of their own faction) they became odious. For they could not iudge any ſtate good or ſecure, which had need with ſo great violence to be defended. So that this maner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, did not onely offend thoſe of the familie of <hi>Alberti,</hi> which yet remained in the citie: and the <hi>Medici,</hi> who thought them to haue abuſed the people, but many others alſo were with ſo great violence diſpleaſed. But the firſt that oppoſed himſelfe was <hi>Donato</hi> ſonne to <hi>Giacopo Acciaiuoli.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Donati Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aiuoli.</note> He being in the citie great, and rather ſuperiour, then equall, to <hi>Maſſo degli Alberti</hi> (who for the great ſeruice done, when he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> was accounted as head of the Commonaltie) could not among ſo many diſcontentations liue contented: nor (as the moſt men do) preferre priuate profit, before common commoditie. And therefore, thought he would aſſaie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore thoſe that had bene baniſhed, or at the leaſt, ſet the admoniſhed into their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For compaſsing whereof, he whiſpered h<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> intent in the eare of this and that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, ſhewing that otherwiſe he could not pleaſe the people, nor ſtaie their offence. And concluding ſaid, hee onely ſtaied to be of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and then to put the matter in execution. Yet becauſe in the actions of men, delaie bringeth wearineſſe, and haſte is accompanied with perill: to ſhunne wearineſſe, hee reſolued to aduenture with perill. Amongſt the <hi>Senators, Michele Acciaiuoli</hi> his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and <hi>Nicholo Riconori</hi> his friend, were elected: whereby <hi>Donato</hi> imagined a fit opportunitie to be offered, and deſired them to propound a lawe to the Councels, wherein ſhould be conteined the reſtoration of the Cittizens. They being by him perſwaded, commoned with their fellows, who anſwered, that they would attempt no new matters, ſith the obteining of them was doubtfull, and the perill certaine. Then <hi>Donato</hi> hauing in vaine made proofe of euerie mean, in great choller let them vnderſtand, that ſeeing vpon good occaſion offered, they did not reforme the citie, he would with force of armes do it. Which words being greatly offenſiue, and the matter debated among the chiefe Gouernours, <hi>Donato</hi> was cited, and appearing, was by witneſſe of him to whom he committed the meſſage,<note place="margin">Donati Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aiuoli with others confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> conuinced: and in the end confined to <hi>Barletta.</hi> Alſo <hi>Antonio de Medici</hi> with all the reſt deſcended of <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manno,</hi> togither with many baſe Artizans (yet ſuch as had credit with the people) were baniſhed: which things happened after two yeares, that <hi>Maſſo</hi> had taken in hand the gouernment. The citie thus ſtanding, many were diſcontented within, and many without baniſhed. Of which number remained at <hi>Bologna, Picchio, Cauic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciulli, Tomazo de Ricci, Antonio de Medici, Benedetto degli Spini, Antonio Girolami, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtofano di Carlone,</hi> with two others of vile condition: but all yoong men aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and diſpoſed to hazard any fortune for their country. To theſe men, ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence was giuen by <hi>Piggiello,</hi> and <hi>Baroccio Cauicciulli</hi> (who as men admoniſhed liued in <hi>Florence</hi>) that if they did come to the citie diſguiſed, they wold receiue them into their houſes. From whence they might go and kill <hi>Maſſo degli Albizi,</hi> and call the people to armes,<note place="margin">Conſpiracie in Florence againſt Maſſo Deili Albizi and others.</note> who (being diſcontent) would eaſily moue, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould be followed by the <hi>Ricci, Adimari, Medici, Manegli,</hi> and many other families. They then encouraged with this hope, the fourth of Auguſt 1397. came to <hi>Florence,</hi> and entring ſecretly as they were appointed, ſent to know where <hi>Maſſo</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:14349:49"/>
was, intending with his death to raiſe the tumult. At that time, <hi>Maſſo</hi> was come from his houſe, &amp; ſtaied in an Appothecaries ſhop, neare <hi>San Pietro Maggiore.</hi> The meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſent to await him, ran to tell the conſpirators therof; who taking armes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the place found him gone: yet not diſmaid that this appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſped not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned towards the old Market, &amp; there killed one of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum began, &amp; the people cried armes, libertie, &amp; kill theſe tyrants: which done, they returned towards the new Market, &amp; at the end of <hi>Calimara,</hi> they ſlew an other. And with like ſhowte, following their way, &amp; no man taking armes, at the <hi>Loggia Nighi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſa,</hi> they ſtaied. Then they climed vp to a high place, and a great multitude drew neare, rather to behold them then helpe them, and with a loud voice they perſwaded men to take armes, &amp; acquite themſelues of that ſeruitude which they ſo greatly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; alledging, that the lamentation of the euill contented perſons in the cittie, more then their owne iniuries moued them to ſeeke meane to be deliuered. And that they knew, many did pray God to grant them occaſion to be reuenged: which they wold performe, whenſoeuer they might find a head to lead them. And now occaſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, &amp; Captains ready to lead them, euery man looked one vpon an other, and ſtood as men amazed. So that, their reſolution was in vaine, and the Citizens ſtil with bondage burthened. Alſo they much maruelled, that they (who for euery ſmall iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie were wont to take armes) would not now be moued, but ſuffer ſo many their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to be baniſhed and admoniſhed: yet was it in their power to reſtore the bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to their countrey, and the admoniſhed to their offices. Which words (though true) moued not the multitude at all, either for feare, or els becauſe the death of thoſe two had made the murtherers odious. So that the mouers of the tumult, ſeeing that neither words nor deeds had force to encourage any man, (too late aware how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a thing it is to labour the libertie of a people, that will in any wiſe be ſubiect) diſpairing of the enterpriſe, into the temple of <hi>Santa Reparata,</hi> retired themſelues: and there not to ſaue their liues, but delaie their death, they ſhut themſelues vp. The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators</hi> at the beginning of the tumult were armed and ſhut the Pallace gate, till after the caſe was vnderſtood, &amp; the men knowne that moued the rumour, being before locked vp, tooke courage, &amp; commanded the Captaine to call his ſouldiers to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the offenders. In ſo much that with ſmall force the doores of the Temple were broken: part of them within were ſlain, in defence of the place, &amp; the reſt take. They being examined, confeſſed none to be culpable but <hi>Barocco</hi> and <hi>Piggiello Cauicciulli,</hi> with others that were ſlaine. After this accident, there happened one other of more importance. At this time (as hath bene beforeſaid) the cittie had warre with the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> who finding that to oppreſſe it, his forces ſufficed not, determined to worke with wiles, and by aid of the baniſhed <hi>Florentines</hi> (of whom <hi>Lombardy</hi> was full) practiſed that enterpriſe, whereto alſo many within the towne were made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie. Concluding that vpon a certain day, many of thoſe baniſhed men, apt for armes,<note place="margin">Conſpiracy by the Duke of Milan againſt Florence.</note> ſhould go to places neare <hi>Florence,</hi> &amp; by the riuer <hi>Arno</hi> paſſe into the citie, and there with friends enter the houſes of the chiefe gouernors, and ſleying them, reform the gouernment as themſelues thought good. Among the conſpirators within, was one of the houſe of <hi>Ricci</hi> named <hi>Samminiato,</hi> but (as in conſpiracies for the moſt part it happeneth) that a fewe are not of force inough, and many will not keepe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: <hi>Samminiato</hi> ſeeking companions, found an accuſer. This man imparted the matter to <hi>Saluestro Cauicciulli,</hi> whome the iniuries done to his kinsfolke and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ought haue made truſtie. But he regarding more the feare at hand, then the future hope, ſuddeinly bewrayed the practiſe to the <hi>Senators,</hi> and they apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Samminiato,</hi> conſtrained him to confeſſe all the conſpirators: yet was there no man apprehended, ſauing <hi>Tomazo Duuiſi,</hi> who comming from <hi>Bologna,</hi> and not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14349:50"/>
what happened in <hi>Florence,</hi> was by the way intercepted. All the reſt after the apprehenſion of <hi>Samminiato</hi> for feare, fled. Then <hi>Samminiato</hi> and <hi>Tomazo,</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merits puniſhed: authoritie was giuen to diuerſe Cittizens to finde out more offenders, and aſſure the ſtate. They then diſcouered for Rebels, ſixe of the family of <hi>Ricci,</hi> ſixe of the <hi>Alberti,</hi> three of the <hi>Medici,</hi> three of the <hi>Scali,</hi> two of the <hi>Strozzi, Bindo Altouiti, Barnardo Adimari,</hi> with many of the meaner ſort. They admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed all the family of <hi>Alberti, Ricci,</hi> and <hi>Medici,</hi> for tenne yeares (a fewe of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted). Among the <hi>Alberti</hi> was one called <hi>Antonio,</hi> who being accounted a quiet and peaceable man, was in that reſpect not admoniſhed. It chanced after the ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the conſpiracie not quenched, there was a Monke taken, who had bene ſeene diuerſe times during the conſpiracie, to goe from <hi>Bologna</hi> to <hi>Florence.</hi> This Monke confeſſed that he had brought diuerſe letters to <hi>Antonio,</hi> who denied the matter, yet being auowed by the Monke,<note place="margin">The famely of Alberti confined. An. 1402.</note> he was condemned in mony, and confined 300. miles diſtant from the citie. Alſo to the end, that the <hi>Alberti</hi> might not daily put the ſtate in daunger, all that family aboue fifteene yeares of age, were baniſhed. This accident happened in the yeare 1402. The next yeare died <hi>Giouan Galiazzo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan:</hi> whoſe death (as is beforeſaid) ended the warre which had continued twelue yeares. In this meane ſpace, the gouernment became of more authoritie: and hauing fewe enemies both within and without, the <hi>Florentines</hi> attempted the enterpriſe of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and gloriouſly conquered that citie. They continued then quiet within, from the yeare 1400. till 33. ſauing that in the yeare 1412. the <hi>Alberti,</hi> hauing broken their confines, a <hi>Balia</hi> was choſen, wherby new ordinances were made to aſſure the ſtate, and impoſe greater paiments vpon them.<note place="margin">The death of Ladiſlao king of Naples.</note> In that time alſo, the <hi>Florentines</hi> made war to <hi>Ladiſlao</hi> King of <hi>Napoli,</hi> which was ended by the death of the King: in the yeare 1414. In execution whereof, the King finding himſelfe the weaker, yeelded to the <hi>Florentines</hi> the citie of <hi>Cortona,</hi> where he was Lord. Yet ſhortly after he reuiued the warre, which proued more dangerous then the former. And had the ſame not bene, as the other, ended by the Duke of <hi>Milans</hi> death, he had alſo brought the libertie of our citie into that daunger, that by the Duke it had bene. Neither did this war of the Kings end, with leſſer aduenture then the other. For when he had ſurprized <hi>Rome, Siena, La Marca,</hi> and <hi>Romagna,</hi> and that he wanted nothing, but <hi>Florence</hi> to paſſe with a mightie force into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> hee died. So as, death was euer more friendly to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> then any other friend: and of more power to defend them, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertue. After the death of this King, the citie continued quiet without &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eight yeares. In the end of which time, with the warres of <hi>Philippo</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> the factions were reuiued: and continued til the ruine of that ſtate, which from 1380. had bene gouerned, and with much glorie, enterpriſed many warres, and brought vnder the Empire thereof, <hi>Arezzo, Piſo, Cortona, Liuorno,</hi> and <hi>Monte Pulciano.</hi> And would haue done greater things, had the citie continued vnited, and the old humors not bene reuiued.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL Cities (and chiefly they which be well gouerned vnder the name of Common-weales) doo often alter their ſtate and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: not by meanes of libertie and ſubiection (as many imagine) but by meane of ſeruitude and lycentiouſneſſe. For onely the name of libertie is honoured of the people, who are the miniſters of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe, and ſeruitude ſtill ſought for by the Nobilitie: ſo as either of them do ſtudie not to ſubiect themſelues, either to lawes or men. True it is, that when it happeneth (as ſildome it doth) that by good fortune of ſome Citie, there riſeth vp therein, a wiſe, good, and mightie Citizen, of whome ſuch lawes be made, as theſe humours of the Nobilitie, and of the people, be kept quiet (or at the leaſt ſo reſtrained as they cannot doo euill) then may that Cittie be called free, and that ſtate firme and ſtable. For being builded vpon good lawes, and good orders, it needeth not afterwardes the vertue of anie man to vphold it. Of ſuch lawes and orders, manie auncient Common-weales (whoſe eſtates continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long) were endowed. Such orders and lawes, thoſe ſtates wanted, and doo want, which haue oft times chaunged their gouernment from ſtates tyrannicall, to licentious, and from licentious, to tyrannicall. And in them by meane of their mightie enemies, there is not, nor cannot be anie ſtabilitie at all: becauſe the one pleaſeth not the good men, and the other offendeth the wiſe men. The one may do euill with facilitie, the other can do good with difficultie. In the one inſolent men, in the other, fooles haue too much authoritie. And therefore, it behoueth, that both the one and the other, by the vertue and fortune of ſome excellent man be mainteined: who either by death may be taken away, or by aduerſitie proue vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. I ſay therefore, that gouernment which had the beginning in <hi>Florence</hi> by the death of <hi>Georgio Scali,</hi> in the yeare 1381. proceeded firſt from the vertue of <hi>Maſſo delli Albizi,</hi> and after was by <hi>Nicholo di Vzano</hi> continued. The Cittie liued quiet from the yeare 1314. till the 22. At which time, the King <hi>Ladiſlao</hi> was dead, and the ſtate of <hi>Lombardy</hi> into partes diuided. So that neither without nor within, there was any thing that could breede diffidence or miſtruſt. Next to <hi>Nicholo di Vza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> the Citizens of moſt authoritie, were <hi>Bartolomeo Valori, Nerome di Nigi, Rinaldo de gli Albizi, Neridi Guio,</hi> and <hi>Lapo Nicolini.</hi> The factions which grew, by the diſcord of the <hi>Albizi</hi> &amp; <hi>Ricci,</hi> and after with great troubles by <hi>Saluestro di Medici</hi> reuiued, were neuer quenched. And albeit the partie moſt fauoured of the multitude, raigned not aboue 3. yeares, and in the yere 1381. the ſame was oppreſſed: yet that humor hauing infected the greater number of the people, could not be vtterly quenched. True it is, that the often contentions, &amp; perſecutions of the chief captains fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 1381. til the 1400. brought the factions wel near to nothing. The families moſt perſecuted were

the <hi>Albizi, Ricci,</hi> and <hi>Medici.</hi> Thoſe houſes were diuerſe times ſpoyled, both of their men and ſubſtance, and if any of them remained in the citie, their honours and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were taken from them. Which oppreſsion made that part baſe minded, and (as it were) vtterly trodden downe. Notwithſtanding, there remained in many men, a certaine memorie of iniuries receiued, and a deſire to reuenge them. Yet wanting power to performe their will, they kept that deſire within their breaſts, ſecretly hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Thoſe of the populer Nobilitie, who peaceably gouerned the citie, committed two errors,<note place="margin">Error com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the populer nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> which were the cauſes of their ruine. The one through their inſolency, which grew by continuall authoritie and being in office. The other, through enuie among themſelues, &amp; the long holding the ſtate in their hands, they did not preuent thoſe that might offend them: but daily renuing the vniuerſall hatred by their ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter proceedings, not remoouing the matter that might hurt and was to be feared, were the cauſes that the houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> recouered authoritie. The firſt of them that begun to ſtand vp, was <hi>Giouanni,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Bicci.</hi> He, become exceeding rich, and being of nature curteous, &amp; affable, was with the allowance of thoſe that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, aſcended to the higheſt office. Whereat the multitude ſo greatly reioyced (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to haue gotten a protector) that the wiſer ſort conceiued ſome iuſt cauſe of ſuſpition:<note place="margin">Aduice of Nicolo Vzano againſt the Medici.</note> becauſe thereby they found all the old humors begun to ariſe. And <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo di Vſano</hi> failed not to aduertiſe the other Citizens, how daungerous a thing it was to aduance one, who had among the multitude, ſo much reputation: ſaying, it was eaſie to oppreſſe any inconuenience at the firſt, but letting it growe, the remedie was hardly found. For hee knew well, that in <hi>Giouanni,</hi> there were many more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent partes, then in <hi>Saluestro. Nicholo</hi> could not be heard of his companions: becauſe they enuied his reputation, and ſought for aſsiſtance to oppreſſe him. Men thus liuing in <hi>Florence,</hi> beſet with contrary humours, (which ſecretly began to boyle within their breaſts) <hi>Philippo Viſconti</hi> ſecond ſonne of <hi>Giouan Galiazzo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the death of his brother, become Lord of all <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and deuiſing vpon ſome enterpriſe, deſired greatly to be againe owner of <hi>Genoua,</hi> which at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnder <hi>Tomazo Frogolo</hi> liued in libertie. Yet feared he could neither compaſſe that nor any other thing, vnleſſe firſt hee publiſhed a new accord with the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines:</hi> the reputation whereof, (as hee thought) might bring him to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. For which purpoſe, hee ſent Embaſſadours to <hi>Florence:</hi> who beeing there, and perſwading the league, it was by many Cittizens thought vnfit to ioyne with him, and yet they wiſhed that the peace which had many yeares continued, ſhould ſtill endure. For they knewe what fauoure and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the league would doo him, and how ſmall profit the citie ſhould receiue thereof. To others it was thought good, that the league ſhould be made, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to procure the Duke to enter conditions and bondes, which if he paſſed, euery man might diſcouer his euill intent, and ſhould (if he brake the peace) the more iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make warre vpon him.<note place="margin">Leage betwixt the Florentins and the Duke of Milan.</note> Thus (the matter being throughly debated) the peace was concluded. Wherein <hi>Philippo</hi> promiſed, that hee would not entermedle with anie thing on this ſide the Riuers of <hi>Magra</hi> and <hi>Panaro.</hi> After this concluſion <hi>Philippo</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and ſhortly after <hi>Genoua,</hi> contrary to the opinion of thoſe that had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the peace. For they beleeued that <hi>Breſcia</hi> had bene defended by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and <hi>Genoua</hi> could haue defended it ſelfe. And becauſe in the league which <hi>Philippo</hi> had made with the <hi>Doge</hi> of <hi>Genoua,</hi> he had reſerued <hi>Serezana,</hi> and other Townes on this ſides <hi>Magra,</hi> with condition that if he ſolde them, hee then to ſell them to the <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> the league was broken. Beſides this, hee made peace with the Legate of <hi>Bologna.</hi> Which things, altered the mindes of our Citizens, and made them (doubting newe miſchiefes) to looke for newe remedies. Theſe

ſuſpitions come to the eare of <hi>Filippo,</hi> either to gratifie, or feele the diſpoſition of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> or elſe to abuſe them, ſent Ambaſſadours vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> and by them ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, how he maruelled much at the ſuſpition conceiued, and therewith offered to renounce euerie thing by him done, whereof anie miſtruſt might grow: which Ambaſſadours wrought none other effect, then diuiſion of the citie. For the one part, (and thoſe that were moſt reputed in the gouernment) thought good to arme, and preuent the enemie. Notwithſtanding if <hi>Filippo</hi> ſtood quiet, there ſhould be no war at all, and in the meane time, that prouiſion was an occaſion of peace. Many others, either enuying thoſe that gouerned, or fearing the warre, iudged that it was no wiſedome, lightly to become ſuſpitious: neither were things by <hi>Philippo</hi> done, worthie to be ſuſpected. But they knew wel, that to elect the Ten, and to hire ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, promiſed warre: which being taken in hand againſt ſo great a Prince, ſhould be the ruine of the citie, without hope of any profit. For of his victories (hauing <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magna</hi> in the midſt) we could not receiue good, nor become Princes of that country. And of <hi>Romagna</hi> it ſelf (by reaſon of the neerneſſe of the church) they could not think to become owners. Notwithſtanding, the authoritie of thoſe that would make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for war, preuailed before the other, that deſired peace. And therefore they created the Ten, hired ſouldiers, &amp; impoſed Subſidies. Which proceedings (becauſe they burthened more the leſſe, then greater Cittizens) filled the cittie with ſorrow, and euery man blamed the ambition &amp; authoritie of the great men, accuſing them; that to fulfill their appetites, and oppreſſe the people, they would make a warre not neceſſary. Yet was not the Duke come to manifeſt breach, but euery thing was full of ſuſpition. For <hi>Philippo,</hi> at the requeſt of the Legate of <hi>Bologna</hi> (who feared <hi>Antonio Bentiuogli</hi> baniſhed, and remaining at the Caſtle <hi>Bologneſe</hi>) had ſent men to that citie: which beeing neare the dominion of <hi>Florence,</hi> held the ſtate in miſtruſt. But that which moſt amazed euerie man, and gaue much cauſe to diſcouer the warre, was the enterpriſe of the Duke at <hi>Furli. Georgio Ordilaffi,</hi> was Lord of <hi>Furli,</hi> who dying, left <hi>Tibaldo</hi> his ſonne, vnder protection of <hi>Philippo.</hi> And albeit the mother ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Duke to be a Tutor vnfit, and therefore ſent her childe to <hi>Lodouico Alidoſsi</hi> her father, Lord of <hi>Imola)</hi> yet was ſhe forced by the people to obſerue her husbands teſtament, and commit him to the Dukes hands. Then <hi>Philippo</hi> to make himſelfe the leſſe ſuſpected, and the rather alſo to couer his intent, deuiſed that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara</hi> ſhould ſend <hi>Guido Torello</hi> with ſome forces, to be his deputie, and take the gouernment of <hi>Furli.</hi> Thus came that towne into the poſſeſsion of <hi>Philippo,</hi> which being knowne in <hi>Florence,</hi> togither with the newes of the ſouldiers come to <hi>Bologna,</hi> made the reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the war the more ſpeedie, notwithſtanding it had before great contradiction, &amp; <hi>Giouan de Medici</hi> publikely ſpake againſt it, ſaying,<note place="margin">Conſultation in Florence.</note> that although he were certaine of the Dukes euil diſpoſition, yet were it better that hee ſhould march firſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they go towards him: for ſo the war ſhuld be iuſtifiable, in the iudgement of other princes: neither could we ſo boldly aske aid, as we might after that his ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was diſcouered. Alſo, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold with an other mind defend their own, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſault the goods of others. To the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, was ſaid, it were not good to tarry for the enemy at home, but rather go ſeeke him. And fortune was more friend to him that aſſaulteth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him that defendeth. Moreouer with leſſe loſſe (though with more charge) the war is made far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home, then neare at hand. In the end, this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preuailed. And reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſet down, that the Ten ſhould deuiſe ſome means how the city of <hi>Furli</hi> might be recouered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Duke. <hi>Philippo</hi> ſeeing that the <hi>Florentines</hi> went about to ſurprize thoſe things which he had taken in hand to defend, ſet reſpects apart, &amp; ſent <hi>Agnolodella Pargola</hi> with great forces to <hi>Imola,</hi> to the end, that prince, hauing occaſion to defend his own, ſhould not think vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his grandchild. <hi>Agnolo</hi> arriued neare <hi>Imola,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:14349:52"/>
(the forces of the <hi>Florentines</hi> being alſo at <hi>Magdigliana</hi>) the weather froſtie, and the towne diches frozen, in the night, by ſtealth, ſurprized the towne, and ſent <hi>Lodouico</hi> priſoner to <hi>Milan.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> ſeeing <hi>Imola</hi> loſt, and the warre diſcouered, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded their men to go vnto <hi>Furli,</hi> and on euerie ſide beſieged that citie. Alſo to the end that all the Dukes forces ſhould not come to reſcue it, they hired the Earle <hi>Alberigo,</hi> who from his towne <hi>Zagonara</hi> iſſued out, ſpoyling the country euen to the gates of <hi>Imola. Agnola della Pergola,</hi> finding he could not with ſecuritie ſuccour <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> by reaſon of the ſtrength where our Campe laie, thought good to beſiege <hi>Zago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nara,</hi> thinking that the <hi>Florentines</hi> would not loſe that place, and if they did relieue it, then of force they muſt abandon <hi>Furli,</hi> and fight with diſaduantage. The Dukes forces then enforced <hi>Alberigo</hi> to demaund compoſition, which was graunted; he promiſing to yeeld the towne at any time, if within fifteene daies, it were not reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Florentines.</hi> This diſorder knowne in the <hi>Florentines</hi> Campe and in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and euerie man deſirous to preuent the enemie of that victorie, occaſioned them to haue a greater.<note place="margin">The Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</note> For their Campe being departed from <hi>Furli</hi> to ſuccour <hi>Zagonara,</hi> and entercountring the enemie was ouerthrowne: not ſo much through vertue of the aduerſarie, as the vnhappineſſe of the weather. For, our men hauing diuerſe houres marched in the deepe myre and raine, found the enemies freſh, and for that reaſon by them were vanquiſhed. Notwithſtanding, in ſo great an ouerthrow pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed through all <hi>Italy,</hi> there died no more then <hi>Lodouico degli Obizi,</hi> with two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who fallen from their horſe were myred to death. All the citie of <hi>Florence</hi> at this ouerthrow, became ſad: and chiefly the great Citizens who had counſelled the warre. For they ſawe the enemie braue, their ſelues diſarmed, without friends, and the people againſt them: who murmured, and with iniurious words, complained of the great Impoſitions and Subſidies, they had paide to the maintenance of the warre taken in hand, without any cauſe or occaſion. Saying moreouer, now they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing created the Ten, to terrifie the enemie, haue ſuccoured <hi>Furli,</hi> and taken it from the Duke. Thus do they bewraie their Councels to what end they are: not to defend the libertie, but encreaſe their own power, which God iuſtly hath diminiſhed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue they only burthened the citie with this enterpriſe, but with many others: for like to this, was that againſt King <hi>Ladiſlao.</hi> To whome will they now reſort for aide? To Pope <hi>Martine?</hi> who hath bene in their ſight trodden vpon by <hi>Braccio?</hi> To the Queene <hi>Giouanna?</hi> ſhe was by them abandoned, and forced to put her ſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King of <hi>Aragon.</hi> Beſides theſe contumelies, they repeated all ſuch iniurious reproues, as a people offended, could imagine. It was therefore thought good to the <hi>Senators,</hi> to aſſemble a good number of Citizens, and with curteous ſpeech appeaſe the humours mooued in the multitude. Then <hi>Rinaldo degli Albizi,</hi> eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Maſſo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſpeech of Rinaldo de Albizi to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaze the people.</note> (who with his owne vertue, &amp; the memorie of his father, aſpired to the chief honour of the citie) declared at large: that it was no wiſedome to iudge enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by their ſucceſſe. Becauſe many things well deuiſed, haue had no good end, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers euil deuiſed, haue good. Alſo, if euil counſels hauing good ſucceſſe, ſhould be commended, the ſame wold encourage men to commit errors, which would proue to great diſaduantage of the Common weale: for it euer falleth out, that euill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels be vnfortunate. In like maner they erred, to blame a wiſe counſell, that hath no deſired end: for thereby they diſcouradge the Citizens to counſell the citie, &amp; ſaie frankly, what they knew or vnderſtood. Then he ſhewed the neceſsitie of that war, and how if it had not bene begun in <hi>Romagna,</hi> it ſhould haue bene in <hi>Toſcana.</hi> But ſith it pleaſed God that their forces be ouerthrowne, the loſſe ſhould be the leſſe, if the enterpriſe were not abandoned. For if they would ſtill ſhewe their faces to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and endeuour themſelues to recouer that was loſt, neither ſhould they finde
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14349:52"/>
any loſſe, nor the Duke any victorie. They ought alſo not to repine at the charge or Impoſitions that ſhould be laid vpon them, becauſe thoſe paiments which they had made, were reaſonable, and the reſt that ſhould after be impoſed would not bee ſo great. For leſſe preparation is required for them that defend, then thoſe that will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. In the end, he perſwaded them to imitate their aunceſtors, who by being in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie aduerſitie couragious, did defend themſelues againſt all Princes whatſoeuer. The Citizens encouraged with the authoritie of this man,<note place="margin">Bracc<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Piccinino.</note> enterteined the Earle <hi>Oddo</hi> ſonne of <hi>Braccio,</hi> with whom they ioyned <hi>Nicholo Piccinino,</hi> brought vp vnder <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi>; a man moſt eſteemed of all thoſe that ſerued vnder his Enſigne, and vnder them they appointed other leaders. Alſo of their owne forces lately broken, ſome Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of horſe men remained. Moreouer they elected twentie Citizens to impoſe new Subſidies, who being encouraged with ſeeing the greateſt Citizens oppreſſed by the late ouerthrow, impoſed vpon them without reſpect. This impoſition much greeued the great Cittizens, yet not to declare themſelues vnwilling, at the firſt, ſhewed no priuate offence: but generally blamed the matter, giuing their aduiſe, that the Impoſitions might ceaſe; which being knowne to many, tooke no effect in the Councels: and thereupon to occaſion theſe repiners feele the ſmart of their counſell, and make the matter more odious, they ordered, that the Impoſers ſhould proceed with all ſeueritie, and haue authoritie to kill any man that ſhould withſtand the publique officers. Whereof followed many foule accidents, by murthering and hurting of the Citizens. In ſo much, as the factions came to bloud: and euerie wiſe man feared future miſchiefes. Becauſe, the great men (who were vſed to reſpect) could not endure to be laide hand vppon: and others were not content that euerie man ſhould equally be burthened. Many of the chiefe Citizens therefore aſſembled themſelues, and concluded, that it behoued them to take the gouernment into their hands: becauſe their ſmall diligence had giuen head, and ſuffered the publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to be reproued: allowing ouermuch boldneſſe in thoſe that were wont to be heads of the multitude. Hauing to this effect conſulted, they determined manie times to meete all togither; and in the church of S. <hi>Steffano</hi> aſſembled more then 70. Citizens, with the lycence and allowance of <hi>Lorenzo Ridolfi,</hi> and <hi>Franceſco Gianfi gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azzi,</hi> who at that time were of the <hi>Senate.</hi> To this conuention, <hi>Giouanni de Medici</hi> came not, either becauſe he was as a ſuſpect, vncalled, or that hee would not (being of contrary opinion) appeare. But <hi>Rinaldo delli Albizi,</hi> as mouth of that companie,<note place="margin">Rinaldo di Albizi.</note> diſcourſed the eſtate of the citie, &amp; how by their negligence it was come to the hand of the multitude, from whome in the yeare 1381. by their aunceſtors it was taken: putting them in minde of the iniquitie that raigned in that ſtate, from the yeare 77. till 81. And how ſith that time, till this preſent, ſome had their fathers ſlaine, ſome their grandfathers, &amp; now were returned to the ſelfeſame perils, &amp; the citie fallen to the like diſorders; becauſe the multitude had alreadie at their pleaſure impoſed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies: &amp; wold ere lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, (if the ſame were not by a greater force or better order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) appoint the Magiſtrates. Which being brought to paſſe, the multitude would vſurpe their places, and ruine that ſtate, which had bene with much glorie of the cittie fortie and two yeares continued: and <hi>Florence</hi> ſhould be gouerned either ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually, vnder the will of the multitude (ſo as one part ſhould liue lycentiouſly, the other daungerouſly) or vnder the commandement of ſome one that ſhall make him ſelfe Prince of all. Wherefore he aſſured them, that euerie man that loued his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and his owne honour, was conſtrained to beware: and put them in minde of the vertue of <hi>Bardo Mancini,</hi> who with the ruine of the <hi>Alberti:</hi> ſaued the citie from thoſe perils wherein it then was: and that occaſion of boldneſſe in the multitude, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the large <hi>Squittini,</hi> which were by their negligence made: which was the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14349:53"/>
cauſe alſo that the Pallace was filled with new men and people of baſe condition. He therefore concluded that the only remedie was, to yeeld the gouernment to the great Citizens, and remoue the leſſe Artificers from their authoritie: reducing them from 14. to 7. companies. Which ſhould be a meane that the multitude could haue in the Councels leſſe authoritie: as well in reſpect, that the number of them were diminiſhed, as that the great men ſhould haue moſt power, who for the old enmity did diſfauour the multitude, affirming likewiſe that to know how to imploy men, according to the time was great wiſedom. For as their anceſtors vſed the multitude to oppreſſe the inſolency of the great men (who thereby became humble and the multitude inſolent) ſo it were now fit to bridle the inſolencie thereof, with the aide of the great men. And for compaſſing of theſe matters they might reſort either to ſubtiltie or force. For ſome of them beeing of the Tenne, by that colour might bring men ſecretly into the citie. This counſell giuen by <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> was by euery man allowed. And <hi>Nicholo</hi> of <hi>Vzano</hi> among other, ſaid; that all things alledged by <hi>Rinaldo</hi> were true, and the remedies good and certaine, if the ſame might be done without manifeſt diuiſion of the citie: which would come to paſſe if <hi>Giouan de Medici,</hi> were not perſwaded from them. For hee being on our ſide, the multitude without head and force, could not offend. But if he wold not conſent, without armes it could not be. And with armes it were daungerous, for either they ſhould not preuaile, or not enioy the victory. Alſo, modeſtly he reduced to their memories, his former admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; how they refuſed to preuent theſe difficulties, when they might. But now the time ſerued not to do it, without hazarding a greater miſchiefe, and therefore, as the vttermoſt refuge, it behoued to gaine his fauour. Commiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> to goe vnto <hi>Giouanni,</hi> and perſwade him to be of their minde. This Gentleman performed his Commiſsion, and with the beſt reaſons he was able, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to enter with them into this action, and that he would not for the loue of the multitude become inſolent, to the ruine of the ſtate, &amp; citie. Wherto <hi>Giouanni</hi> anſwered,<note place="margin">The anſwere of Giouanni di Medicito Rinaldo.</note> that he thought it the office of a wiſe and good Citizen, not to alter the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed orders of the citie, becauſe there was nothing that ſo much offended men, as alteration, ſith thereby many be offended, &amp; where many liue diſcontented, ſome euill accident is daily to be looked for. Alſo hee thought, that this their reſolution might worke two effects verie dangerous. The one by giuing the honours to thoſe, who neuer before hauing them, would not much eſteeme them, and ſhould haue the leſſe occaſion to complaine, if they neuer had them. The other by taking the honours from thoſe that were vſed to haue them, ſhould make them vnquiet till they were reſtored. And ſo ſhall the iniurie done to the one part, be greater, then the benefit, which the other part could thereby receiue. Thus ſhall the authour of this change, win few friends, &amp; many enemies: and theſe will be more ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the others to defend him. For me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are more naturally inclined to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge an iniury, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be thankful for a good turne: becauſe this bringeth loſſe, but that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth profit and pleaſure. Then turning his face towards <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> ſaide. And you ſir, if you remember matters paſſed &amp; with what ſubtilties men walk within this citie, your ſelf would be more lowe in theſe reſolutions. For the giuer of that counſell, ſo ſoone as with your forces he hath taken away the authoritie of the people, would againe take the ſame from you, by the aide of thoſe, who by this meane of iniurie, will become your foes. And it will befall to you as it did to <hi>Benedetto Alberti,</hi> who (through the perſwaſions of him that loued him not) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented to the ruine of <hi>Georgio Scali</hi> and <hi>Tomazo Strozzi</hi>: and ſhortly after, by the ſelfeſame men that perſwaded him, was ſent into exile. Hee therefore wiſhed him more naturally to thinke vpon matters, &amp; be willing to follow his father, who hauing loue of the multitude, cared
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14349:53"/>
not to offend a fewe men euill diſpoſed. It was then ordained that whoſoeuer had to paie halfe a Florine for Subſidie, ſhould paie it, or not: as himſelfe pleaſed. And beſides all men indebted, ſhould for the day of the councell goe free, with out mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation of his creditors. In the end he concluded, that for his owne part, he would leaue the cittie in that order and eſtate, it preſently remained. Theſe matters thus handled, were vnderſtood abroad, and the ſame gaue great reputation to <hi>Giouanni</hi> and hatred to the other cittizens. Neuertheleſſe hee diſcontinued all affaires, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſcourage thoſe, that vnder his fauour intended new practiſes. Alſo, in all his comunication, hee let euerie man to vnderſtand that hee would not nouriſh, but extinguiſh factions. And for himſelfe, he deſired nothing but the vnion of the citie: yet were manie that followed him, therewith diſcontented. For diuers of them did perſwade him to be in thoſe matters more quick: of which number was <hi>Alamanno de medici,</hi> who being fierce of nature, ceaſed not to ſollicite him to perſecute their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; fauour friends, blaming his coldneſſe, &amp; ſlow maner of proceding. Which was (as he alledged) occaſion that their foes without reſpect, practiſed againſt him. Which one daie would take effect, with the ruine of his houſe and friends. To the ſame effect, was hee encouraged, by <hi>Coſimo</hi> his ſonne. Yet notwithſtanding all theſe reaſons to him reuealed or prognoſticated, hee ſtood firme in his intent, and by that meanes the faction became diſcouered, and the cittie in manifeſt diuiſion. At that time were in the Pallace two Chauncellors, one called <hi>Ser Martino,</hi> and the other <hi>Ser Pagolo.</hi> This fauoured the parte of <hi>Vzano,</hi> that of <hi>Medici. Rinaldo</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Giouanni</hi> refuſed to concurre with them, thought fit to depriue <hi>Ser Martino</hi> of his office, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping afterwards to finde the Pallace more fuourable. That practiſe foreſeene by the aduerſaries, <hi>Martino</hi> was defended; and <hi>Pagalo</hi> with ſorrow and iniury of his friends remooued: which had preſently wrought bad effects, if the preſent warre had not bene, &amp; the citie by the ouerthrow receiued at <hi>Zagonara,</hi> terrified. During the time that theſe matters were managed in <hi>Florence, Agnola della Pergola</hi> had with the Dukes forces taken all the townes which the <hi>Florentines</hi> poſſeſſed in <hi>Romagna (Castaro</hi> and <hi>Modigliana</hi> excepted) ſome of them beeing loſt by the weakeneſſe of the place, and others by the default of thoſe, that had them in guarde. In the ſurprizing of theſe townes, two notable things appeared. The firſt, how much the vertue of men euen to their enemies, is acceptable. The other, how greatly cowardice and fainte heart, is contemned. <hi>Biagio</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> was Captaine of the fortreſſe called <hi>Montepetroſo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Biagio of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</note> He being enuironed with fire and enemies, not finding any meanes how to defend his charge, or eſcape with life, caſt ouer the wall (where no fire yet burned) certaine cloathes and ſtrawe, and vpon the ſame his owne two children, and ſaid to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; Take you here thoſe goods which fortune hath giuen me, and you haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to bereaue me of, but my riches of minde wherein glorie and my honour lieth, neither will I giue them, nor you can take them from me. The enemies ran to ſaue the poore children, and offered him roapes and ladders to conuey himſelfe downe ſafe. But he refuſed all ſuccours, chuſing rather to die in fire, then receiue a life from the enemies of his country. An example truly like to thoſe, of the auncient time ſo highly commended. And is the more notable, that ſuch reſolutions are but rare. The children were by the enemies reſtored to all thinges that were theirs, and could be found: and with great care conueyed to their friends, to whom their countrey alſo was no leſſe kinde. For (during their liues) they were publikely releeued and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined. The contrary happened in <hi>Galeata,</hi> where <hi>Zanobi di Pino</hi> was <hi>Podesta.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zanobi Pino.</note> For he without any defence, yeelded his charge to the enemie: and beſides perſwaded <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnolo</hi> to abandon the Alpes of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and come into the hilles of <hi>Toſcana,</hi> where he might make warre with leſſe perill, and more profit. But <hi>Agnolo</hi> could not endure
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14349:54"/>
the cowardice and baſe mind of that man, and therfore gaue him priſoner to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, who in contempt, and diſdaine allowed him no more foode, but painted cards, ſaying, by that means they would make him of a <hi>Guelfo</hi> to become a <hi>Ghibellino.</hi> But within a fewe daies, <hi>Pino</hi> pined to death. In this meane time the Earle <hi>Oddo</hi> togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> was entred into the vale of <hi>Lamona,</hi> to reduce the Lord of <hi>Faenza</hi> to the friendſhip of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> or at the leaſt to empeach <hi>Agnola della Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gola</hi> in the ſpoile of <hi>Romagna.</hi> Yet by reaſon that vale is ſtrong, and the country people warlike, it chaunced that <hi>Oddo</hi> was ſlaine, and <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> ledde priſoner to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enza.</hi> But fortune would, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> obteined that by this loſſe, which if they had woon the victorie ſhould percaſe neuer haue bene compaſſed. For <hi>Nicholo</hi> being priſoner, wrought ſo with the Lord of <hi>Faenza</hi> &amp; his mother, that they by his perſwaſion became friendes to the <hi>Florentines.</hi> By this league <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> was deliuered, but folowed not that councel he gaue to others. For whiles he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned with the cities that enterteined him, either for that the conditions he had made ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ouer meane, or that he hoped of better elſewhere, ſuddeinly without leaue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, departed from <hi>Arezzo</hi> where hee lodged, and went into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and there tooke paie of the Duke.<note place="margin">Piccinino reuolted from the league.</note> The <hi>Florentines</hi> by this accident became fearefull: and being diſmayd with their charges loſt, thought they could not alone maintaine the warre, and therfore ſent Embaſſadours to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> deſiring them while the enterpriſe was eaſie, to ioyne againſt one, who being ſuffered to grow, might become as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to them as to the <hi>Florentines.</hi> To the ſame enterpriſe alſo <hi>Franceſco Carmignuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> did perſwade them, who was in thoſe dayes accounted a man of warre moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and had bene ſometimes a ſouldier vnder the Duke, yet at that time, rebelled againſt him. The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſtood doubtfull, not knowing how much they might truſt <hi>Carmignuola,</hi> fearing that the enmitie betwixt the Duke &amp; him was but fained. They thus ſtanding doubtfull, it happened that the Duke procured one of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of <hi>Carmignuola</hi> to poyſon his maiſter: which poyſon not being ſtrong inough, killed him not, but brought him to extremitie. This being knowne to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> cleared all ſuſpition: and the <hi>Florentines</hi> following their requeſt, the league was made betwixt them, either partie binding himſelfe to make warre at their common charge: and that whatſoeuer were gotten in <hi>Lombardy</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and whatſoeuer were poſſeſſed in <hi>Romagna,</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and <hi>Carmignuola</hi> to continue General of the league.<note place="margin">Carmignuola generall for the league.</note> Then was the war by mean of this league brought into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and by <hi>Carmignuola</hi> gouerned with ſo great vertue, that in fewe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths he had taken many townes from the Duke: togither with the Citie of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> the winning whereof (in thoſe dayes, and in thoſe warres) was accounted maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. This warre was continued fiue yeares and the Citizens become wearie of the Impoſitions alreadie paſt, agreed to renew them, and prouided the ſame might be impoſed according to the value of euerie mans wealth. In this Impoſition, it fell out, that many mightie Cittizens were ſore charged. And therefore, before the lawe paſſed, it became of them miſliked. Onely <hi>Giouanni di Medici</hi> openly did commend it, by which commendation, the lawe paſſed. And becauſe in the excuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, euery mans goods were charged (which the <hi>Florentines</hi> called <hi>Accastare</hi>) the Impoſition was called <hi>Cataſto.</hi> This law partly bridled the tirannie of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Citizens, being thereby reſtrained from oppreſſion of their inferiours, and their threatnings and counſels could not hold them ſilent, as before they might. That Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition therfore was by the multitude willingly, but by the mighty citizens, verie vnwillingly, receiued. Notwithſtanding (as it euer happeneth) that men be neuer ſatiſfied; but hauing the thing they wiſh for, deſire an other: ſo this people not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this equalitie of Impoſition by lawe, required that no reſpect ſhould be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14349:54"/>
had to time paſt, but deſired to examine how much the great men (according to the <hi>Cataſto</hi>) had paide too little, becauſe they would haue them to be charged as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues had before bene; who paying more then they ought, were forced to ſell their poſſeſsions. This demaund, did more terrifie the great men, then the <hi>Cataſto,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cataſto.</note> therfore they ceaſed not to find fault, affirming it was moſt iniuſt, that the impoſition ſhould extend to their moueables, which many times were one day poſſeſſed, and the next day loſt. And moreouer many men had money ſo ſecretly kept, that the <hi>Cataſto</hi> could not find it. Adding thereto, that for ſeruice of the ſtate, they omitted their priuate buſines, and therfore ought be the leſſe charged. For trauelling in their perſons, it was no reaſon that the citie ſhould imploy both their goods and their induſtry, and of other men take onely their goods. The others (to whom the <hi>Cataſto</hi> contented) did anſwere that if the goods moueable did varie, the Impoſitions might alſo varie, and ſo that inconuenience was remedied. And for goods concealed or hidden, therof it was not needfull to make accompt, for of ſuch monies as are not occupied to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, no reaſon would they ſhould pay. And if they would imploy them, then ſhould they thereby diſcouer them. Moreouer, if they liked no longer to vſe their induſtrie for the Common weale, they might at their pleaſures leaue thoſe paines, &amp; that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. For the ſtate ſhould find other good Citizens willing to helpe and ſerue, both with their counſell and ſubſtaunce. Alſo the gouernment carried therewith ſo many commodities &amp; honors, as the ſame might ſuffice them that gouerned, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining their impoſitions. But the griefe lay not where they alledged. For it greeued them that they could not make warre without their owne loſſe, being to contribute to the charge as others did. As if this way had bene before found, the warre with King <hi>Ladiſlao</hi> ſhould not haue bene then, nor this warre with the Duke now. Both which warres were made to enrich the Citizens, and not for neceſsitie. Theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors ſtirred, were appeaſed by <hi>Giouan de Medici,</hi> declaring that it was not well done, to call againe matters paſſed, but rather to foreſee future euents. And if the Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before time were iniuſt, then ought they to thanke God for that warre, whereby they were made iuſt, and that this order might ſerue to reunite, not to deuide the citie: as it would, if paſſed Impoſitions were called in queſtion, to make the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeaſement: becauſe whoſoeuer is content with a reaſonable victorie, doth beſt, ſeeing they that be enforced to pay for many pardons, do therby become deſperate. With theſe or like wordes, hee appeaſed the humours, and the comparing of the old Impoſitions, with the new. The warre with the Duke yet continued, but ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after a peace was made at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> by mediation of the Popes Legate. The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherof, were by the Duke at the beginning broken. So that they of the league tooke armes againe, and ioyning battle with the Duke at <hi>Maclouio,</hi> they ouerthrew him. After which ouerthrow, the Duke mooued new communication of peace, whereto the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> conſented. Theſe becauſe they ſuſpected the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and thought they ſpent much to make others mightie. The other, for that, ſince the ouerthrow, they perceiued <hi>Carmignuola</hi> to proceede ſlowly, and therfore feared to repoſe any truſt in him. The peace therfore was concluded the yeare 1428 whereby the <hi>Florentines</hi> reouered the townes loſt in <hi>Romagna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Peace betwixt the League &amp; the Duke.</note> and <hi>Breſcia</hi> remained in the hands of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Beſides theſe, the Duke gaue them <hi>Bergamo</hi> with the country thereto belonging. In this warre the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſpent three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and fiue thouſand duckats. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> gained land and force: and they po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and diuiſion. The peace thus made abroad, the warre at home began. And the great Citizens not enduring the <hi>Cataſto,</hi> nor knowing by what meane to be free from it, deuiſed to make the lawe to haue more enimies, thereby to haue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to repreſſe it. Then they declared to the officers of the Impoſition, that the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14349:55"/>
lawe commaunded them alſo to ſeaze the Townes ſubiect, to ſee, if among them remained any <hi>Florentines</hi> goods. Thereupon all ſubiects were commaunded within a certaine time to bring in bils of their goods. Then the inhabitants of <hi>Volterra</hi> ſent vnto the Senate to complayne of that matter, inſomuch that the officers put xviii. of them in priſon. This made the <hi>Volterrani</hi> much offended, yet for the reſpect they had to their priſoners, they rebelled not. At this time <hi>Giouanni de Medici</hi> fell ſicke, and knowing his diſeaſe mortall, called vnto him his ſonnes <hi>Coſimo</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and ſayd vnto them:<note place="margin">The ſpeech of coſimo de Medici at his death.</note> I thinke now to haue liued ſo long, as at my birth God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had appoynted. I dye content, becauſe I leaue you rich, healthie, and in eſtate (if you follow my footeſteps) to liue in <hi>Florence</hi> honorablie, and fauoured of all men: For, there is nothing that maketh me dye ſo contented, as to remember, that I haue neuer offended any man, but rather (ſo farre as I could) pleaſured all men. So do I perſwade you (if you will liue ſecurely) to take of the State no more then by the lawes, and by men is giuen you, which ſhall neuer bring with it, either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie or perill. For that which is woon by violence, not that which is giuen freely, doth make men hated. And you ſhall find many coueting an other mans, to loſe their owne, and before that loſſe, liue in continuall diſquiet of mind. With theſe rules among ſo manie enemyes, and contrarieties of opinions, I haue not onely maynteyned, but alſo encreaſed my reputation in this cittie. Euen ſo, if you follow my courſe, you ſhall in like ſort maynteyne and augment your credit. But when you do otherwiſe, looke that your end ſhall be no more fortunate then theirs, who haue ruyned themſelues, and vndone their houſes. Shortly after theſe words pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he tooke leaue of life, and was much lamented by the greateſt number of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, for ſo his excellent vertues deſerued. This <hi>Giouanni</hi> was charitable, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to giue almes not onely to them that asked, but alſo many times vnasked. He beſtowed reliefe on the poore, where need required. He loued euery man, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the good, and pittying the euill. He neuer deſired offices, yet had he them all, he went not at any time to the Pallace vncalled, he loued peace, and ſhunned warre, he relieued men in aduerſitie, and furthered them in proſperitie. He medled not with publique extortion, but encreaſed the common profit. He was in office curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, of no great eloquence, but ſinguler wiſe. His complexion ſeemed melancholy, yet was he in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation pleaſant and merrie. He died rich in treaſure, but more rich of loue, and good report: which inheritance aſwell in goods of fortune as of mind, was by <hi>Coſimo</hi> not only preſerued, but alſo enlarged. The <hi>Volterani</hi> being wearie of impriſonment, promiſed to condiſcend to that which was demaunded. They then being deliuered, and returned to <hi>Volterra,</hi> found the time come for the election of new <hi>Priori.</hi> Among whom was choſen one iuſt man, a baſe fellow, yet of credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the multitude, and was in the number of thoſe that had ben priſoners in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>

And not omitting oportunitie, they ſodeinly ſent thither <hi>Rinaldo de gli Albizi,</hi> and <hi>Palla Strozzi,</hi> as their Comiſſaries. <hi>Giusto</hi> in the meane ſpace, ſuppoſing the <hi>Florentines</hi> would aſſault him, prayed ayd of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſi</hi> and <hi>Luccheſi.</hi> The <hi>Saneſi</hi> denyed him, ſaying they were in league with the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines.</hi>

And <hi>Pagolo Guinigi</hi> Lord of <hi>Lucca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pagolo Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigi Lord of Lucca.</note> to recouer the fauoure of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> people (which in the Dukes warres he feared to haue loſt) did not onely refuſe to ayde <hi>Giusto,</hi> but alſo ſent his meſſenger priſoner to <hi>Florence.</hi> Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries in the meane ſpace, to come vnlooked for of the <hi>Volterani,</hi> aſſembled all their men of Armes, and in the neather <hi>Valderno,</hi> and the Prouince of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> leauyed many footemen, from whence they marched to <hi>Volterra.</hi> Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Giusto</hi> for being abandoned of his neighbours, nor the aſſault of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> abandon himſelfe: but truſting to the ſtrength of the Scite, and the greatnes of the Towne, prepared for defence. There was at that time in <hi>Volterra,</hi> one called <hi>Arcolano,</hi> brother to <hi>Giouanni,</hi> who had perſwaded <hi>Giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto</hi> to take the gouernment, a man among the Nobilitie of good reputation. He, aſſembling his friends, declared how God by this accident had ſupplied the neceſsitie of their Cittie. For now if they were pleaſed to take armes, remoue <hi>Giusto</hi> from the <hi>Senate,</hi> and reſtore the Cittie to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> they ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become chiefe of their Cittie, and continue their auncient priuiledges. Theſe men conſenting to the enterpriſe, went to the Pallace where this Lord <hi>Giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto</hi> remayned: ſome of them alſo being left belowe, <hi>Arcolano</hi> with three others went vp, and finding him with ſome other Cittizens, drew him aſide, as though he had to ſpeake with him in ſome earneſt matter, ſo enterteyning him from cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to chamber, till he came to the place where the reſt of the companie remayned. Yet were they not ſo ſuddein, but that <hi>Giusto</hi> drew his ſword, and before himſelfe was ſlayne, hurt two of them. Notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">Giuſto ſlaine.</note> in the end vnable to reſiſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, was murthered, and caſt out of the Pallace. Then all the reſt of the conſpiracie with <hi>Arcolano</hi> tooke Armes, and gaue the Towne to the Commiſſaries for the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who were with Souldiers neere at hand. They, without other capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, entered the Towne, whereby the <hi>Volterani</hi> made their condition worſe then before. For among other things,<note place="margin">Volterra re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered by the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> they diſmembred the greater part of the Countrey, and was reduced to <hi>Vicariato.</hi> Thus <hi>Volterra,</hi> as it were at one inſtant loſt, and recouered, no occaſion of new warre remayned, had not the ambition of men bene cauſe thereof. There ſerued long time the <hi>Florentines</hi> in their warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> one called <hi>Nicholo Fortibraccio,</hi> ſonne to one of the ſiſters of <hi>Braccio di Perugia.</hi> He after the peace made, was by the <hi>Florentines</hi> diſcharged, and at ſuch time as this chance happened at <hi>Volterra</hi> was lodged at <hi>Fucecchio,</hi> whereby the Commiſſaries in that enterpriſe employed him and his Souldiers. It was ſuppoſed that at ſuch time as <hi>Rinaldo</hi> trauelled with him in that warre, he perſwaded <hi>Nicholo</hi> vnder ſome fayned quarrell to aſſault the <hi>Luccheſi,</hi> ſaying, that if he would goe againſt <hi>Lucca,</hi> he ſhould be made Generall of the iourney. <hi>Volterra</hi> thus ſurprized, and <hi>Nicholo</hi> returned home to <hi>Fucecchio,</hi> either by perſwaſion of <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> or of his owne will, in Nouember, the yeare 1429. with 300. horſe, and 300. footemen, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized <hi>Ruoti</hi> and <hi>Compito,</hi> Caſtles belonging to the <hi>Luccheſi,</hi> and after came into the Countrey, and there made great ſpoyle. The newes of this enterpriſe publiſhed at <hi>Florence,</hi> many people aſſembled in diuers places of the Cittie, and the greater number wiſhed that <hi>Lucca</hi> might be aſſaulted. The great Cittizens that fauoured the enterpriſe were thoſe of the faction of <hi>Medici,</hi> and with them ioyned <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> thereto perſwaded, either becauſe he thought the enterpriſe profitable to the common-weale, or elſe for his owne ambition, hoping to haue the honor of the victorie. Thoſe that diſfauoured the attempt, were <hi>Nicholo de Vzano,</hi> and his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. And it ſeemeth a thing incredible, that ſo great contrarietie ſhould be in one Cittie, touching the making of a warre. For thoſe Cittizens, and that people, who after tenne yeeres of peace blamed the warre againſt the Duke <hi>Philippo,</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14349:56"/>
of their libertie: now after ſo great expences, and ſo much affliction of the Cittie, withall earneſtly deſired to make a new warre againſt <hi>Lucca,</hi> and to vſurpe the libertie of others. On the other ſide, thoſe that deſired the firſt warre, found fault with this motion, ſo greatly did the opinions of men alter with time; for the multitude ſeemeth more readie to take from others, then keepe their owne. Alſo, men are more moued with hope of winning, then feare of loſing: For this feare is not beleeued, till it be neere at hand, but that hope, is hoped for, although farre off. The people of <hi>Florence</hi> was full of hope, both by the victories they had obteyned, and by letters ſent vnto <hi>Fortebraccio</hi> from the <hi>Rettori</hi> neere to <hi>Lucca.</hi> For the Deputies of <hi>Peſcia</hi> and of <hi>Vico</hi> did write, that if they might haue leaue to receiue thoſe Caſtles, they would be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, and by that meanes all the Countrey of <hi>Lucca</hi> ſhould be gayned. Beſides theſe good newes, the Lord of <hi>Lucca</hi> ſent his Embaſſador to <hi>Florence,</hi> to complayne of the ſpoyles committed by <hi>Nicholo,</hi> deſiring the <hi>Senate,</hi> not to moue warre againſt their neighbours, and a Citie that had euer been friend to the <hi>Florentines.</hi> This Embaſſador was called <hi>Iacopo Viuiani.</hi> He not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been kept priſoner with <hi>Pagolo</hi> for a conſpiracie againſt him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of although he were guiltie, yet was his life ſaued. And <hi>Pagolo</hi> ſuppoſing that <hi>Iacopo</hi> had likewiſe forgotten the iniurie, put him in truſt. But <hi>Iacopo</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring more the perill he had paſſed, then the benefite he receiued, being arriued in <hi>Florence,</hi> ſecretly encouraged the Cittizens to proceed in the enterpriſe: which encouragement, ioyned to other hope, was the cauſe that the <hi>Senate</hi> aſſembled a Councell, wherein were foure hundred ninetie eight Cittizens, before whome, by the principall men of the Cittie, the matter was debated. Among the chiefe that perſwaded the iourney (as is before ſayd) was <hi>Rinaldo,</hi>

Hee alſo declared the occaſion of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and how the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> were abandoned by the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Duke. And that the Pope (being buſied in the affayres of the Kingdome) could not ſuccour them. Thereto he remembred how eaſie it was to winne the Cittie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſubiection to one Cittizen, whereby it had loſt that naturall ſtrength and auntient care to defend the libertie. So that, either by meane of the people, who ſtudied to driue out the Tyrant, or the Tyrants feare of them, the ſucceſſe was not to be doubted. Hee likewiſe layd before them the iniuries which that Lord had done to our Common-wealth, and his euill diſpoſition towards the ſame; And how dangerous a thing it were if the Pope or the Duke ſhould make warre, concluding, that no enterpriſe attempted by the people of <hi>Florence,</hi> was euer more eaſie or more iuſt.<note place="margin">The perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ni. de Vzano to the contrary.</note> Againſt this perſwaſion, <hi>Nicholo de Vzano</hi> ſayde, that <hi>Florence</hi> did neuer take in hand any thing more vniuſt, nor more perilous, nor whereof more daunger might followe. Firſt, they ſhould goe about to offend a Cittie affectionate to the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> and ſuch a one as had euer bene friend to the people of <hi>Florence,</hi> and had with perill to it ſelfe many times receiued the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> when they durſt not abide in their owne Countrey. And by the memoriall of our proceedings, it cannot be found, that <hi>Lucca</hi> being free, did euer offend <hi>Florence:</hi> but the offence at any time done, was committed by thoſe that vſurped, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Castruccio,</hi> and now by this man, which defaults cannot be imputed to the Cittie, but the Tyrants. And therefore if the warre might be made vppon the Tyrant, and not the Cittie, the diſpleaſure ſhould be the leſſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that could not be, he might not conſent that a Cittie, beforetime a friend, ſhould be ſpoyled of her ſubſtance. Yet ſith at this day, men liue as though of right
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14349:56"/>
or wrong none account is to be made, hee would leaue to ſpeake thereof, and thinke onely vpon the profit of the Cittie. His opinion therefore was, that thoſe things might be called profitable, which would not lightlie procure loſſe. Wherefore he knewe not how any man could call that enterpriſe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, where the loſſe was certaine, and the gayne doubtfull. The certeine loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were the charges it carried with it, which ſeemed ſo great, as would terrifie any peaceable Cittie, much more ours, hauing bene by long warres wearied. The profit of the enterpriſe, was the poſſeſsion of <hi>Lucca,</hi> which hee confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be great; Yet were they to conſider the lets thereof: and they ſeemed to him ſo great, as hee thought the ſucceſſe impoſsible. Neither could hee beleeue that the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Philippo</hi> were therewith pleaſed: Becauſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> conſent, was onely to ſeeme thankefull, hauing lately with the <hi>Florentines</hi> woon a great Dominion. The other would be glad, that in a new warre wee ſhoulde ſpende more treaſure: ſo as worne, and wearyed on euerie ſide, wee might after be the more eaſily annoyed. Alſo, there would not want meanes for him, euen in the beſt hope of victorie, to ſuccour the <hi>Luccheſi,</hi> eyther co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly with money, or with caſsing of bands, and ſending ſouldiers as aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers to ayde them. Hee therefore perſwaded that the enterpriſe might ſtay, and ſuffer them liue with the Tyrant, whereby they ſhoulde haue the more enemyes. For there was no way ſo apt to ſubdue the Cittie, as to ſuffer it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue vnder a Tyrant, and be by him aſſaulted or weakened. This matter wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, the Cittie would be brought in termes, that the Tyrant not able to hold it, nor knowing how to gouerne it ſelfe, ſhould of force fall in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zome. Neuertheleſſe, ſeeing his words were not heard, hee would prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that they would make a warre, wherein much ſhould be ſpent, many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards made, and in ſtead of ſurprizing <hi>Lucca,</hi> deliuer it from the Tyrant, and procure that Cittie which before was ſubiect and weake, to become a towne free, and full of diſpleaſure: yea with time, an obſtacle to the honour of the <hi>Florentine</hi> common-weale. This enterpriſe thus perſwaded, and diſſwaded, they begun (as the cuſtome is) to practiſe with men ſecretly for the winning of their good wills, ſo as onely 98. perſons did ſpeake againſt it. Then the reſolution ſet downe, and the Tenne elected for gouernment of the warre,<note place="margin">The warre of Lucca reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> they enterteyned ſouldiers both on horſebacke and foote. <hi>Astore Gianni,</hi> and <hi>Rinaldo de gli Albizi</hi> were appointed Generalls, and they agreed, that <hi>Nicholo Fortibraccio</hi> ſhould haue the gouernment of the Townes, if the enterpriſe tooke ſucceſſe. The Generalls with the Armyes beeing arriued within the territorie of <hi>Lucca,</hi> diuided their forces. <hi>Astore</hi> went into the playne, towards <hi>Ca Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giore</hi> and <hi>Pietraſanta:</hi> And <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> towardes the Mountaynes, thinking, that the Countrey being ſpoyled, the Cittie would be eaſily taken. The attempt of theſe men prooued vnfortunate, not becauſe they ſurprized no Townes, but for the diſhonor committed by one of them in the ſeruice: For true it is, that <hi>Astore Gianni</hi> gaue great occaſions of his owne diſhonour. Neere vnto <hi>Pietra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanta,</hi> there is a Vale called <hi>Serauezeza,</hi> rich, and full of inhabitants, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Generall was come, preſented them ſelues: deſiring him to receiue them for faithfull ſeruants to the people of <hi>Florence. Astore</hi> ſeemed to accept the offer, and after cauſed his Souldiers to poſſeſſe all the paſſages, and ſtrong places of the Vale: then commaunding all the inhabitants to aſſemble in the principall Church, and there willed his men to take them priſoners, ſack them,<note place="margin">Cruelty of the Florentine Generall.</note> and ſpoyle all the Countrey moſt cruelly: not ſparing the ſacred places, but without reſpecte, abuſing aſwell Virgins, as married women. The manner of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14349:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theſe proceedings being knowne in <hi>Florence,</hi> offended not onely the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but the whole Cittie alſo. Some fewe of the <hi>Sarauezeſi,</hi> who eſcaped the hands of the Generall, ran to <hi>Florence,</hi> telling in euery ſtreete, and to euery man their miſeries, and were by many Citizens encouraged, either becauſe they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue the Generall puniſhed, thinking him indeed an euill man, or elſe for that they knewe him not to fauour their faction.<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Sarauezeſi.</note> So that the <hi>Sarauezeſi</hi> were brought before the tenne, where one of them ſtepped foorth, and ſpake to this effect. Sure we are (my good Lords) that our words ſhould find beliefe, and compaſsion, if your Lordſhips did know in what ſort your Generall hath vſed our Countrey, and how we haue bene by him handled. Our <hi>Vale</hi> (as we hope your memorials do make mention) did alwayes loue the faction <hi>Guelfa,</hi> and hath bene many times a faithfull receptacle for your Citizens, when flying perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Ghibilini,</hi> they came thither. Our aunceſtors, and we alſo, haue euer adored the name of this noble common weale, being the head and chiefe of that ſecte. So long as the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> were <hi>Guelfi,</hi> we willingly obeyed their gouernment, but ſince they ſubmitted themſelues to a Tyrant, (who hath abandoned his old friends, and followed the <hi>Ghibilini</hi>) rather by compulſion, then voluntarily, we haue obeyed him. And God knoweth, how often we haue prayed for occaſion, whereby to ſhewe our zeale to the auncient faction. But alas how blind are men in their deſires? that which we wiſhed for our helpe, is now become our harme. For ſo ſoone as we heard your Generall marched towards vs, we went, not as enemyes to encounter him, but (as our aunceſtors were wont) to yeeld into his hand our Countrey and fortunes: hoping that in him, although there were not the mind of a <hi>Florentine,</hi> yet ſhould we find him a man. We beſeech your Lordſhips to pardon vs, for our extremitie is ſo much, as more may not be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is the cauſe we make bold to ſpeake thus plainely. This your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hath not of a man more then his preſence, nor of a <hi>Florentine</hi> any thing ſaue the name: but may be called a mortall plague, a cruell beaſt, and as horrible a monſter, as by any wrighter can be deſcribed. For he hauing aſſembled vs in our Temple, vnder pretence to talke with vs, hath made vs his priſoners: ſpoyling the whole countrey, burning the houſes, robbing the inhabitants, ſacking their goods, beating and murthering the men, forcing the Virgins, yea, pulling them from the hands of their Mothers, made them the pleaſures of his ſouldiers. If for any iniury done to the people of <hi>Florence</hi> or him, we had deſerued ſo great a puniſhment, or if we had armed our ſelues againſt him, and bene taken, then ſhould we haue had leſſe cauſe to complayne, yea, we would rather haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed our ſelues, confeſsing, that eyther for iniurie or pride, we had ſo merited to be handled. But being diſarmed, and freely offering ourſelues, then to rob vs, and with ſo great deſpight and ignomie to ſpoyle vs, we thinke it ſtrange, and are inforced before your Lordſhips to lay downe our griefe. And albeit we might fill all <hi>Lombardy</hi> with offence, and with reproch of this Citie, publiſh our iniuries through all <hi>Italy,</hi> yet would we not, leſt thereby to blemiſh ſo honeſt, ſo honorable, and ſo compaſsionate a common weale, with the diſhoneſtie and crueltie of one wicked Citizen, whoſe auarice before our ruine, was partly knowne vnto vs. And wee intended to ſtrayne our ſelues to ſatisfie his greedie mind, which hath neither meaſure nor bottom. But ſith our gifts come too late, we thinke good to reſort to your Lordſhips, beſeeching the ſame to relieue the misfortune of your ſubiects, to the end, that other men may not be afraid to yeeld them ſelues to your deuotion. If our infinite miſeries cannot moue you, yet let the feare of Gods ire perſwade you, who hath ſeene the Churches ſacked and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14349:57"/>
burnt, and our people betrayed in them. Theſe words pronounced, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell downe proſtrate vpon the ground, weeping, and deſiring their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, that their goods and countrey might be reſtored, and that (though the womens honors could not be recouered) yet the Wiues might be deliuered to their Husbands, and the Children to their Fathers. This heauie caſe being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reported, and now by the liuely voyce of thoſe afflicted men confirmed, did much moue the Magiſtrates: and without delay, they reuoked <hi>Astore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aſtore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and Riſlandred.</note> who after was condemned, and admoniſhed. Then was there Inquiſition made for the goods of the <hi>Serauezeſi,</hi> and ſo much as could be found, was reſtored. For the reſt, they were in time diuers wayes ſatisfied. <hi>Rinaldo de gli Albizi,</hi> was likewiſe defamed, for hauing made the warre, not for the profit of the people of <hi>Florence,</hi> but his owne. Hee was alſo charged that ſo ſoone as hee became Generall, the deſire of ſurprizing <hi>Lucca</hi> was forgotten, becauſe hee ſought no further then to ſpoyle the countrey, fill his paſtures with cattle, and furniſh his houſes with the goods of others. Moreouer, that his owne ſhare of the bootie contented him not, but hee alſo bought the priuate ſpoyles of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. So that of a Generall, hee was become a Merchaunt. Theſe ſlaunders come to his owne hearing, moued his honeſt and honorable mind more, then they ought to haue done. In ſo much, as hee became therewith ſo amazed, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king offence againſt the Magiſtrates and Citizens, without delay or leaue taken, hee returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> and preſenting himſelfe to the Tenne, ſayd:<note place="margin">The ſpeech of Ri. in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> He knew well, how great difficultie and perill there was in ſeruing a looſe people, and a Cittie diuided. For the one is credulous of euery rumor, the other, puniſheth no euill doings, rewardeth not the good, and blameth the indifferent; ſo that no man commendeth him that is victorious: For as much, as his fellowes for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and his foes for hatred, will perſecute him. Notwithſtanding, himſelfe had neuer for feare of vndeſerued blame, omitted to performe an action that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a certaine good to his countrey. But true it was, that the diſhoneſtie of the preſent ſlaunders had oppreſſed his patience, and made him chaunge nature. Wherefore hee beſought the Magiſtrates, to be from thence-foorth more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to defend their Citizens, to the end, they might be likewiſe more readie to labour for their countrey. And although that in <hi>Florence</hi> no triumph was graunted, yet might they, at the leaſte defende them from ignominious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, and remember that they them ſelues were alſo Citizens of the ſame towne, and that to them ſelues euerie houre the like might happen: whereby they ſhoulde vnderſtand howe great griefe falſe ſlaunders might breede in the mindes of men of integritie. The Tenne as time would ſerue, laboured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe him, and committed the care thereof to <hi>Neri di Gino,</hi> and to <hi>Alaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Saluiati:</hi> who leauing to ſpoyle the countrey of <hi>Lucca,</hi> with their Campe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched the Towne. And becauſe the ſeaſon was colde, they ſtayed at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panuole.</hi> Where it ſeemed to the Generall that time was loſt: and deſirous to beſiege the Towne, by reaſon of the euill weather, the Souldiers woulde not thereto conſent. Notwithſtanding, that the Tenne did ſollicite them to the ſiege, and would accept none excuſe at all. At that time,<note place="margin">Filippo Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelſco.</note> there was in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> an Architector, called <hi>Filippo Brunelleſco,</hi> of whoſe handie-worke our Cittie is full: In ſo much, that after death, hee deſerued to haue his Image of Marble, erected in the chiefe Church of <hi>Florence,</hi> with Letters, to teſtifie hys greate vertue. This man declared, howe <hi>Lucca</hi> conſidering the ſcite of the Cittie, and the paſſage of the Riuer <hi>Serchio,</hi> mighte bee drowned.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14349:58"/>
And perſwaded them (ſo farre as the tenne gaue commiſsion) that this experiment ſhould be tried, yet thereof followed nothing, but diſorder to our camp, and ſuretie of the <hi>Luccheſi:</hi> for the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> aduaunced their land, and then in the night brake the ſluice of that ditch whereby the water was conducted: ſo that the ground to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lucca</hi> being mounted, the water could not enter, and the ditch whereby the water ſhould paſſe being broken, cauſed the riuer to reuert towards the plaine, by meane whereof the Campe was forced to remoue, and could not approch the towne. This enterpriſe, by meanes aforeſaid preuented, the tenne newly elected, ſent <hi>Giouanni Guicciardini</hi> for their Generall. He, with all ſpeede poſsible, beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Cittie. The Lord thereof, finding himſelfe enuironed with enemies, and encouraged by <hi>Anthonio del Roſſo</hi> (who there remained as Embaſſador for the <hi>Saneſi</hi>) ſent vnto the Duke of <hi>Milan Saluestro Trenta,</hi> and <hi>Lodouico Bonuiſi.</hi> They in the behalfe of their Lord,<note place="margin">The Luccheſi pray aide of the Duke of Milan.</note> deſired the Dukes aide, but finding him cold, ſecretly deſired him to graunt them ſouldiers, and in recompence thereof, they promiſed to deliuer into his hands their Lord, with the poſſeſsion of their Cittie: Aſſuring him, that if hee did not accept this offer, their Lord would giue the Towne to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who with great promiſes, required to haue it at his hand.<note place="margin">Franceſco Sforſa ſent to relieue Lucca.</note> The feare which the Duke conceaued thereof, cauſed him to lay aſide all reſpects: and gaue order, that the Earle <hi>Franceſco Sforza,</hi> his chiefe Captaine, ſhould openly aske him leaue to make a iourney to the Kingdome of <hi>Napoli.</hi> Which being obteined, he with his forces, went vnto <hi>Lucca,</hi> although that he knewe the practiſe was miſtruſted, and that the <hi>Florentines</hi> had ſent to the Earle <hi>Boccacino Alamanni</hi> their friend, to preuent it. The Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> being arriued at <hi>Lucca,</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> retired their Campe to <hi>Librafatta,</hi> and the Earle preſently beſieged <hi>Peſcia,</hi> where <hi>Pagolo da Diacetto</hi> was Gouernor: who being rather coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled by feare, then any other paſsion, fled vnto <hi>Pistoia.</hi> And if that towne had not bene by <hi>Giouanni Malauolti</hi> defended, it had bene preſently loſt. The Earle then after one aſſault retired thence, and ſurprized <hi>Borgo</hi> a <hi>Buggiano,</hi> and burned <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liano,</hi> a Caſtell neere thereunto. The <hi>Florentines</hi> ſeeing theſe ruines, reſorted vnto thoſe helpes which oftentimes had before ſaued them: well knowing, that againſt mercinarie ſouldiers, when force preuaileth not, corruption may: and therefore proffered vnto the Earle certaine money, to the end he ſhould not onely depart, but alſo deliuer the towne into their hands. The Earle ſuppoſing that more money could not be had of the <hi>Luccheſi,</hi> was contented to take of thoſe that could giue it. Wherefore he concluded with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> not to deliuer them <hi>Lucca,</hi> (becauſe with his honeſtie he could not ſo do) but ſo ſoone as he ſhould receiue fiftie thouſand duckets, he would abandon the enterprice. This bargaine being made, to the end the people of <hi>Lucca</hi> might excuſe him to the Duke, he prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with them to driue out their Lord. At that time (as is before ſaid) <hi>Antonio Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> Embaſſador of <hi>Siena</hi> was at <hi>Lucca.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pagolo Lord of Lucca de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> He with the authoritie of the Earle, practiſed with the Citizens the deſtruction of <hi>Pagolo.</hi> The chiefe of this conſpiracie were <hi>Piero Cennanni,</hi> and <hi>Giouanni da Chiuizano.</hi> The Earle was lodged without the towne by the Riuer <hi>Scirchio,</hi> and with him <hi>Lanzilao</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Pagolo.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators being in number fortie, all armed, went vnto <hi>Pagolo,</hi> who ſeeing them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the cauſe of their comming. To whome <hi>Piero Cennanni</hi> anſwered, that they had bene gouerned by him till their enemies beſieged them with ſword and famine, and therefore they were now determined from that time forward, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne themſelues. Therewith they required the keyes of the Citie, and the treaſure. <hi>Pagolo</hi> anſwered, that the treaſure was conſumed, but the keyes and himſelfe alſo were at their deuotion. Then he deſired the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that as his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was begun and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14349:58"/>
continued without bloud, ſo without bloud, by their fauours, it might be ended. <hi>Pagolo</hi> and his ſonne, were by the Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> brought to the Duke, and died in priſon. The departure of the Earle, deliuered <hi>Lucca</hi> from the tyrant, &amp; the <hi>Florentines</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feare of his ſouldiers. So as then, the one prepared to defend, &amp; the other retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to offend, electing the Earle of <hi>Vrbino</hi> to be their Generall: who againe ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſieging the citie, enforced the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> to reſort anew vnto the Duke, who (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame colour that hee had ſent the Earle) did now imploy in their aide <hi>Nicholo Piccinino.</hi> He, being readie to enter into <hi>Lucca,</hi> was encountred vppon the Riuer of <hi>Serchio,</hi> and in the paſſage thereof, our men receiued the ouerthrow,<note place="margin">The Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines defeated</note> and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall with a fewe of our ſouldiers ſaued themſelues at <hi>Piſa.</hi> This misfortune greeued the whole citie, yet becauſe the enterpriſe was taken in hand by generall conſent, the people not knowing whom to blame, ſlaundered onely them that were officers of the warre, ſith they could not accuſe thoſe that were the deuiſers therof. Then they reuiued the former fault laid vpon <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> but aboue al others, they charged <hi>Giouan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Guicciardini,</hi> accuſing him for not hauing ended the warre after the departure of the Earle <hi>Franceſco:</hi> ſaying that he had bene corrupted with mony, whereof he had ſent part to his own houſe, and the reſt he had carried with him &amp; conſumed. Theſe rumours, and theſe accuſations, proceeded ſo farre, that the Captaine of the people moued with publike voices, and alſo by the contrary partie prouoked, ſent for him. <hi>Giouanni</hi> full of offence, appeared: wherupon his kinsfolkes for their owne honour, laboured the matter ſo earneſtly, that the Captain did not proceed. The <hi>Luccheſi</hi> after the victorie, did not onelie recouer their owne townes, but alſo ſurprized all others belonging to <hi>Piſa,</hi> except <hi>Bientia, Calcinaua, Liuorno,</hi> &amp; <hi>Librafatta.</hi> And had not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie bene diſcouered in <hi>Piſa,</hi> the citie it ſelfe ſhould haue bene loſt. The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> repairing their forces, made <hi>Michelletto</hi> their Generall, who had bene trained vp by <hi>Sforza.</hi> On the contrarie ſide, the Duke followed the victorie (and the rather to moleſt the <hi>Florentines</hi>) procured that the <hi>Genoueſi, Saneſi,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Piombino,</hi> ioyned in league for the defence of <hi>Lucca,</hi> and that <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> ſhould be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined for their General, which was the cauſe that the practiſe was laid open. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> renewed their league, and the warre began to be openly made both in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Toſcana.</hi> In either of which Countries, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe fortune, diuerſe conflicts followed. So that either ſide wearie,<note place="margin">Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Florentines, and Luccheſi.</note> a peace was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, in the yeare 1343. whereby the <hi>Florentines, Luccheſi,</hi> and <hi>Saneſi,</hi> who had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Caſtles one of the others in the warre, left them all, and euerie man repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed his owne. During the time that this warre continued, the euill diſpoſition of factious men within the citie, beganne to worke, and <hi>Coſimo de Medici,</hi> after the death of <hi>Giouanni</hi> his father, gouerned all things concerning the Common wealth, with more care of the publike profit, and more liberalitie towards his friends, then was by his father vſed. In ſo much, as thoſe that reioyced at the death of <hi>Giouanni,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vertue of <hi>Coſimo,</hi> became ſorie. This <hi>Coſimo</hi> was a man of excellent wiſdom, of preſence graue and gratious, greatly liberall, curteous, and ſuch a one as neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any thing either againſt any faction or the ſtate, but ſought by all meanes to pleaſure euerie man, and with his liberalitie to gaine the good wil of many Citizens. So that his good deſerts defaced thoſe that gouerned, &amp; brought himſelf to beleeue; that he might by that meanes liue at <hi>Florence,</hi> in ſufficient ſtrength and ſecuritie. And if the ambition of his aduerſaries ſhould moue any extraordinarie occaſion to the contrarie, hee hoped both by armes and fauoure of friendes to oppreſſe them. The greateſt inſtruments to worke his greatneſſe, were <hi>Auerardo de Medici,</hi> &amp; <hi>Puccio Pucci.</hi> Of them <hi>Auerardo</hi> with courage, and <hi>Puccio</hi> with wiſedome, procured him great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. For the counſell and wiſedome of <hi>Puccio,</hi> was ſo well knowne to euerie
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14349:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man, that the faction of <hi>Coſimo</hi> was called not by his owne name, but by the name of <hi>Puccio.</hi> The citie notwithſtanding thus diuided, the enterpriſe of <hi>Lucca</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whereby the humours of the factions, were rather encreaſed then extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And although the faction of <hi>Coſimo</hi> chiefly counfelled the warre, yet many of the contrarie part were appointed officers therein; as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt reputed in the ſtate: which <hi>Auerardo</hi> and others not being able to remedie, ſought by all induſtrie and practiſe to ſlaunder them: and if any loſſe happened (as many did) they imputed the ſame not to fortune or force of the enemie, but want of wiſedome in the officers. This was the cauſe that the offences of <hi>Astor Gianni</hi> were eſteemed ſo great. This made <hi>Rinaldo delli Albizi</hi> offended, and without lycence to depart from his charge. This was the occaſion that the deliuerie of <hi>Giouanni Guicciardini</hi> was required at the hand of the Captaine of the people. And heereof proceeded all blames that had bene imputed to the Magiſtrates and miniſters of the warre. For the true ſlaunders were encreaſed, and the vntrue were inuented: and both the true, and not true, were of the people that loued them, not beleeued. Theſe matters and manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding extraordinarie, was well knowne to <hi>Nicholo di Vzano,</hi> and others of his faction, who had many times thought vpon remedie, but found no meanes how to deale therein: Becauſe it ſeemed to them, that the ſuffering thereof was dangerous, and forcibly to helpe it, was not eaſie. <hi>Nicholo di Vzano,</hi> was the firſt vnto whom this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way diſpleaſed. Thus the warres continuing without the citie, and theſe diſorders within:<note place="margin">Perſwaſion of Barbadori to Nicholo Vza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no againſt Coſimo di Medici. Anſwere of Nicholo Vza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no to Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dori.</note> 
               <hi>Nicholo Barbadori,</hi> deſirous to bring <hi>Nicholo di Vzano</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the oppreſsion of <hi>Coſimo,</hi> went vnto his houſe, where he found him ſadly ſet in his Cloſet, and there with the beſt reaſons he could, perſwaded him to ioyne with <hi>Rinaldo</hi> to driue <hi>Coſimo</hi> out of the Citie. Vnto whome <hi>Nicholo di Vzano</hi> anſwered, as followeth. I thinke it were better for thy houſe and our Commonweale, that all the reſt, whoſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou herein followeſt, had their beards (as men ſaie) rather of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, then gold, as thou haſt. For then, their counſels proceeding from heads graie, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, would be more aduiſed, &amp; more profitable. It ſeemeth to me, that thoſe which deſire to baniſh <hi>Coſimo</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Florence,</hi> had neede firſt of all to meaſure their forces, with his. This our ſide, you haue called by the name of Nobilitie: and the contrarie part, you haue termed the plebeial partie. If the truth anſwered to theſe names, in euerie accident, the victorie would proue doubtfull, and we haue more cauſe to feare then to hope, moued with the example of the auncient Nobilitie of this citie, which hath ben by this plebeiall ſort heretofore oppreſſed. But the greateſt cauſe of our feare is, that our ſide is diſmembred, &amp; our aduerſaries continue whole and entyre. Firſt you muſt conſider, that <hi>Neri di Gino</hi> and <hi>Nerone de Nigi</hi> (two of our principall Citizens) be not, as you know, more friends to vs, then to them. There be alſo many families, among themſelues diuided. For diuerſe through enuie of their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or their kinſmen, do disfauor vs, &amp; fauor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I wil reſite vnto you the names of ſome few, the reſt you may the more eaſily remember with your ſelf. Of the houſe of <hi>Guicciardini,</hi> and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the ſonnes of <hi>Luigi, Piero</hi> is enemy to <hi>Giouanni,</hi> &amp; fauoureth our aduerſaries. <hi>Tomazo</hi> &amp; <hi>Nicholo Soderini,</hi> for the hate they haue to <hi>Franceſco</hi> their vncle, are openly proteſted our enimies. So that, if we conſider well what they are, &amp; what we our ſelues be, I know not for what reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhuld cal our or their partie more noble. And if it be, that we cal their part plebeial, bicauſe they are by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude moſt followed, their ſtate therin is the better, &amp; ours the worſe. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer we ſhal come to arms, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Alſo if we ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on our dignities, they haue bin giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs by the ſtate, &amp; by vertue therof, we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe 50. veres. Yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer we ſhal come to proofe, our weaknes wil appear, &amp; we ſhal loſe our authority. If you haply ſay, that the iuſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which moueth vs to this enterpriſe,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14349:59"/>
ſhall encreaſe our credit, and diminiſh theirs? Thereto I anſwere, that it behooueth this iuſt quarrel of ours to be knowne, &amp; beleeued of others, as wel as of our ſelues: which falleth out cleane contrarie, for the occaſion alledged, is altogither builded vpon the ſuſpition we haue, that he goeth about to make himſelfe Prince of this cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This is the miſtruſt we haue, which others haue not, but they rather accuſe vs of that, we accuſe him. The matters which make <hi>Coſimo</hi> ſuſpected, are that he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his mony to ſerue euerie occaſion, not onely to priuate vſes, but alſo to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affaires: and that as well to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> as the Captaines and Leaders. The cauſe why he doth fauoure this, and that Cittizen, hauing need of authoritie, is for that his credit with the multitude, hath aduaunced this and that friend, to great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. Therefore it behoueth you to alledge the reaſons why hee ſhould be expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Becauſe he is charitable, friendly, liberall, and loued of all men? And now tel me I pray you, what lawe inhibiteth, blameth, or condemneth men for their charitie, their liberalitie, and their loue? And albeit theſe be meanes for him to aſpire, yet are they not ſo taken, neither are wee of credite inough to make them ſo to bee thought. For our proceedings haue wrought our diſcredit, and our cittie (naturally diſpoſed to diuiſion, and liuing alwaies in corruption) cannot giue eare to ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations. But admit you could expulſe him, which (hauing a <hi>Senate</hi> for the purpoſe may eaſily come to paſſe): yet how can ye deuiſe, that he hauing in the citie ſo many friends ſtudying for his reurne, ſhould not be reuoked? This I think impoſsible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his friends being many, and he (hauing loue vniuerſal) you cannot aſſure him. The more of his chiefe friends you labour to baniſh, the more enemies you winne to your ſelues. So that within ſhort ſpace he ſhall be returned, and you haue gained thus much, that a good man he was baniſhed, and returned an euil man: becauſe his nature ſhall be corrupted by thoſe, that will labour his reuocation. To whom being made beholding, he may not oppoſe himſelfe, and if you would put him to death, by order of Magiſtrates, you could neuer procure it: becauſe his riches, and our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible nature, would aſſuredly ſaue him. Yet admit he were dead, or baniſhed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to returne? I ſee not what is gotten to our Common weale: for though it be thereby deliuered of <hi>Coſimo,</hi> it becommeth ſubiect to <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> and I am one of thoſe, who wiſh, that no Citizen ſhould ſurpaſſe an other in power and authoritie. But if any of theſe two ſhould preuaile, I know not for what cauſe I ought to loue <hi>Rinaldo</hi> more then <hi>Coſimo.</hi> Neither will I ſay more, then I pray God to defend, that any Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen ſhould aſpire to be Prince of this citie. And though our ſinnes haue merited ſuch a plague, yet God forbid we ſhould obey him. Do not therefore perſwade an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, which in euerie reſpect is dangerous, nor thinke that you (accompanied with a fewe) can withſtand the will of many. For all theſe Citizens partly through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and partly of their lewdneſſe, be prepared to make ſale of the Common weale: and fortune is ſo friendly vnto them, as they haue alreadie founde a chapman. Be therefore pleaſed to follow my counſell: liue modeſtly, and ſo ſhall you find cauſe, as well to ſuſpect ſome of our ſide for enemies to the libertie, as thoſe of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and when any troubles happen being neutrall, you ſhall be to both acceptable. So ſhall you helpe your ſelfe, and not hinder your country. Theſe words did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what appeaſe the minde of <hi>Barbadoro:</hi> and the citie continued quiet, during the war of <hi>Lucca.</hi> But the peace made, and <hi>Nicholo da Vzano</hi> dead, the cittie remained both without warre and order. By meane whereof, euill humours grew, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe to be onely Prince, ceaſed not to entreate, and perſwade all thoſe Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens (whom he thought likely to be <hi>Genfalonieri</hi>) to arme themſelues for the defence of their country, againſt that man, who through the lewdneſſe of a few, &amp; the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of many, ſhould of neceſsitie bring the ſame to ſeruitude. This courſe holden
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14349:60"/>
by <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> and the contrarie laboured by the aduerſe part, filled the citie with ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and at the election of euerie Magiſtrate, the one againſt the other partie, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely murmured, &amp; at the election of the <hi>Senators,</hi> all the citie was in open vproare. Euerie matter brought before the Magiſtrates (how litle ſoeuer it were) occaſioned a mutinie. All ſecret matters were laide open; good and euill, were fauoured &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauoured: good men, and euill men, equally moleſted; and no Magiſtrate could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his office. <hi>Florence</hi> remaining in this confuſion, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> labouring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the greatneſſe of <hi>Coſimo:</hi> knowing that <hi>Barnardo Guadagni,</hi> was likely to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> paide his debts, to the end, that ſuch mony as he owed to the ſtate, ſhould not be a meane, to keepe him from that dignitie. The <hi>Senators</hi> being choſen, (and fortune fauouring our diſcords:) it came to paſſe, that <hi>Barnardo</hi> was choſen <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faloniere,</hi> to ſit in that office, during the two moneths of September and October. Him preſently <hi>Rinaldo</hi> viſited, and told him how greatly the Nobilitie reioyced for his being aſpired to that honour, which for his vertue he deſerued: and therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him, ſo to behaue himſelfe in the office, that their reioycing ſhould not be in vaine. Then he laid before him, the perils which proceeded of faction, &amp; that there was no other remedie to vnite the citie, but the oppreſsion of <hi>Coſimo:</hi> becauſe hee, with the loue which his exceeding riches had gained him, held others downe, and aſpired to make himſelfe Prince. It were therfore conuenient, for remedie of ſo great a miſchiefe, that the people ſhould be aſſembled in the Market place: And by vertue of the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> the citie reſtored to libertie. He moreouer declared, how <hi>Salueſtro de Medici,</hi> could without iuſtice bridle the greatneſſe of the <hi>Guelfi,</hi> vnto whome by the bloud of their aunceſtors loſt in that quarrell, the gouernment to them appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And if he iniuſtly could do that againſt ſo many, then might <hi>Barnardo</hi> with iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice do the ſame, againſt one alone. Then he perſwaded him not to feare any man, becauſe his friends would be readie armed to aſsiſt him. Of the multitude which ſo greatly honoured <hi>Coſimo,</hi> none account was to be made, for <hi>Coſimo</hi> ſhould haue by their fauours none other good, then had <hi>Georgio Scali.</hi> Neither ſhould he feare his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for they being come to the hands of the <hi>Senators,</hi> ſhould be theirs. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſaid, that this action ſhould make the ſtate vnited, and him famous. To theſe perſwaſions, <hi>Barnardo</hi> briefly anſwered; how he thought neceſſary to do according to that counſel. And bicauſe the time was to be imploied rather in actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then words, he would preſently prepare forces, to be readie, ſo ſoone as his companions could be perſwaded to the enterpriſe. <hi>Barnardo</hi> being placed in office, and hauing woon his companions, &amp; counſelled with <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> ſent for <hi>Coſimo:</hi> who, albeit he were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aduiſed, did appeare, truſting rather to his owne innocencie, then the mercie of the <hi>Senators.</hi> So ſoone as <hi>Coſimo</hi> was entered the Pallace, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> with many others armed, came to the Market place, and there met with the reſt of that faction. Then the <hi>Senators</hi> cauſed the people to be called, and made a <hi>Balia</hi> of two hundreth men, to reforme the ſtate of the citie: which <hi>Balia,</hi> with ſuch ſpeed as poſsibly they could, conſulted vpon the reformation, and alſo of the life and death of <hi>Coſimo.</hi> Many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded he ſhould be baniſhed,<note place="margin">Coſimo di Medici cited &amp; committed.</note> others would haue him put to death, and many alſo ſaid nothing, either for the compaſsion they tooke of the man, or for the fear of them ſelues. This diuerſitie of opinions, did procure that nothing was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded. In a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Pallace called <hi>Albergettino, Coſimo</hi> was kept priſoner vnder the guard of <hi>Federigo Malauolti.</hi> From which place, <hi>Coſimo</hi> hearing them talke, and perceiuing the noyſe of armed men in the Market place, togither with the often ringing of the Bell to the <hi>Balia,</hi> he ſtood in great ſuſpition of his life: and feared alſo, leaſt his particuler enemies would extraordinaly murther him. For theſe reſpects, during the ſpace of foure dayes, he would eate nothing, but one litle peece of bread: which <hi>Federigo</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:14349:60"/>
perceiuing, ſaide vnto him. <hi>Coſimo,</hi> I ſee thou feareſt to be poyſoned, and therefore would firſt famiſh thy ſelfe. But thou doeſt me great diſhonor, to thinke that I wold put my hand to ſo wicked a deede. I ſurely beleeue, that thou art not to die for this matter, hauing ſo good friends both within &amp; without the Pallace. But if it be ment, that thy life ſhall be taken from thee, be ſure, they ſhould finde other miniſters then me, to performe that deed. For I will not imbrew my hands in the bloud of any man, and chiefly in thine, who neuer offended me. Be therefore of good cheare, eate thy meate, and preſerue thy life to the comfort of thy friends and country, and becauſe thou ſhalt miſtruſt the leſſe, I my ſelfe will eate part of thoſe meates which be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee. Theſe words comforted <hi>Coſimo</hi> exceedingly, and with teares in his eyes, he embraced and kiſſed <hi>Federigo</hi>; thanking him moſt heartily for his friendly and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious dealing: offering to be thankfull whenſoeuer occaſion ſhould be preſented. Thus <hi>Coſimo</hi> ſomewhat comforted, and his cauſe diſputed among the Citizens: It happened, that <hi>Federigo</hi> brought with him to ſupper a friend of the <hi>Gonfalonieries,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Farganaccio,</hi> a man verie wittie, and pleaſantly diſpoſed. The ſupper being almoſt ended, <hi>Coſimo</hi> hoping to helpe himſelfe by this mans preſence (for he was with him well acquainted) made ſignes to <hi>Federigo</hi> to go aſide: who knowing the occaſion, fained to go for ſomething that wanted. And leauing them alone, <hi>Coſimo</hi> after a fewe friendly words ſpoken to <hi>Farganaccio,</hi> gaue him a token, and ſent him to the Hoſpital of <hi>Santa Maria Nuoua,</hi> for a thouſand and one hundreth crownes: wherof one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth to be kept to his owne vſe, the other to beliuered to the <hi>Gonfaloniere. Farganac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> performed his Commiſsion, the mony was paide: and by vertue thereof,<note place="margin">Coſimo di Medici bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> 
               <hi>Barnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> became more fauourable. So as, then it was ordered, that <hi>Coſimo</hi> ſhould be onely confined to <hi>Padoa,</hi> contrary to the expectation of <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> that deſired his life. <hi>Aue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardo</hi> &amp; many others of the houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> were alſo baniſhed; and with them <hi>Puc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> and <hi>Giouanni Pucci.</hi> Alſo to terrifie others that were offended with the exile of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo,</hi> they gaue Commiſsion of <hi>Balia,</hi> to the Eight of the Guard, and the Captaine of the people. After which order taken, <hi>Coſimo</hi> vpon the third of October, in the yeare 1433. came before the <hi>Senators,</hi> who pronounced his baniſhment, and perſwaded him to obey the ſame: Or if he would refuſe, more ſeueritie would be vſed, both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his perſon and goods. <hi>Coſimo</hi> with chearfull countenance receiued his confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proteſting that whither ſo euer the <hi>Senate</hi> ſhould pleaſe to ſend him, hee was moſt willing to obey. Humbly deſiring, that as they had preſerued his life, ſo it might pleaſe them to defend him: for he was giuen to vnderſtand of many, that watched in the Market place to haue his bloud. He ſaid moreouer, that himſelfe and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhould be euer at the commandement of the citie, the people, and their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. The <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> did comfort him, and kept him in the Pallace till night was come. There he ſupped, &amp; after brought him to his houſe: which done, cauſed him to be accompanied with many armed men, &amp; by them was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fines. Whereſoeuer <hi>Coſimo</hi> paſſed, he was honourably receiued, and by the <hi>Venetians</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely viſited, not as baniſhed, but as a man in great authoritie. <hi>Florence</hi> thus depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of ſo worthie a Citizen, ſo vniuerſally loued, euerie man was diſmaid, and as wel they that had the victorie, as thoſe that were victored, did feare. <hi>Rinaldo</hi> miſtruſting future miſaduenture, to ſerue his owne turne and his friends, aſſembled many Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and ſaid to them, that he now ſaw their ruine at hand, becauſe they were with faire words, teares, &amp; the enemies mony vanquiſhed: forgetting that ſhortly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſhould be forced to entreate and weepe, when their ſutes ſhall not be heard, and of their teares no man would take compaſsion. Alſo touching the monies recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the ſame muſt be repaid, with torments, death, &amp; exile, inſtead of vſurie. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that it had bin better for themſelues to be dead, then ſuffer <hi>Coſimo</hi> to paſſe with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14349:61"/>
life; and leaue his friends in <hi>Florence.</hi> Becauſe great perſonages ſhould either not be touched, or being, muſt be made ſure from taking reuenge. No other remedie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remained, but to fortifie themſelues within the citie: to the end, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies taking knowledge thereof (as eaſily they will) we may reſiſt them with armes, ſith by order and lawe we could not auoyd them. The remedie of all this was (that which long before had bene remembred); to recouer the great men, reſtoring &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to them all the honors of the citie, making our ſelues ſtrong with that faction: becauſe the aduerſaries were ſtrengthned by the multitude. By this means their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould be knowne of how great force, vertue, courage, and credite it were. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging alſo, that if this laſt and trueſt refuge were not put in proofe, he ſawe not by what other meane, the ſtate might be among ſo many enemies preſerued. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beheld at hand, a deſtruction of them and their Citie. To anſwer this ſpeech, <hi>Mariotto Baldouineti</hi> one of the company oppoſed himſelfe, and ſaid; that the pride and inſupportable nature of the Nobilitie was ſuch, that it were no wiſedome to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to a tyrannie certain, to eſchue the doubtfull perils of the multitude. <hi>Rinaldo</hi> ſeeing his counſell not heard, lamented the misfortune of himſelfe and his friends, imputing euerie thing rather to the heauens that ſo would haue it, then to the ignorance and blindneſſe of men. The matter thus depending, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie prouiſion made, a letter was found, written by <hi>Agnolo Acciaiuoli</hi> to <hi>Coſimo,</hi> wherein he aduertiſed the diſpoſition of the citie towards him, and wiſhed him to moue ſome warre, making <hi>Nero di Gino</hi> his friend. For hee thought the Cittie had much need of mony, and no way knowne that would ſupplie that want. By occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherof, the deſire of his return, would be greatly reuiued in the Citizens minds. And if <hi>Neri</hi> ſhould fall from <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> then that ſide would become ſo weak, as could not defend it ſelfe. This letter come to the handes of the Magiſtrates, was the cauſe that <hi>Agnolo</hi> was taken, and ſent to exile. By this example, ſome part of that humour which fauoured <hi>Coſimo,</hi> was cooled. The yeare of <hi>Coſimo</hi> his baniſhment expired, &amp; the end of Auguſt at hand, in the yere 1430. <hi>Nicholo di Cocco</hi> was choſen <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> for the two moneths next following, and with him eight <hi>Senators,</hi> all friends to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo.</hi> So as, that <hi>Senate</hi> terrified <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> &amp; all his followers. Alſo becauſe the cuſtome was, that the <hi>Senators</hi> elected, ſhould three dayes before they enter their office, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as priuate men at home: within that time, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> conferred with the chiefe of his faction, and ſhewed them their certaine, and approching perill: the remedie whereof was, to take armes, and by force procure that <hi>Donato Velluti</hi> (who was yet <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi>) ſhould aſſemble the people in the Market place, call a new <hi>Balia,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue the new <hi>Senators</hi> of their office, creating a new <hi>Senate</hi> for their purpoſe, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunging the old <hi>Squittini,</hi> put in new, with the names of their friends. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe was by many thought ſecure and neceſſarie. Of others, it was holden ouer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and dangerous. Among thoſe that diſallowed thereof, was <hi>Palla Strozzi,</hi> who being a man indeed quietly diſpoſed, gentle, curteous, &amp; inclined rather to learning, then apt to encounter a faction, or oppoſe himſelfe to ciuill diſorder: ſaid, that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes hauing in them either craft or courage, do ſeeme at the beginning eaſie, but afterwards they prooue hard in their proceeding, and in the end daungerous. Hee alſo beleeued, that the feare of new warres abroad, begun by the Duke in <hi>Romagna,</hi> neare to our confines, ſhould be a meane, that the <hi>Senators</hi> would be more mindfull of them, then of theſe diſcords at home. But if it were ſeene, that they would change the gouernment, the ſame could not be with ſuch ſpeed, but armes might be taken, and all things done neceſſarie for defence of the publike ſtate. And this being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vpon neceſsitie, and not ſooner, ſhould be the leſſe maruelled at of the people, and with leſſe reproach to themſelues. For theſe reaſons it was concluded, that the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14349:61"/>
new <hi>Senators</hi> ſhould be ſuffered to enter, and heede be taken to their proceedings; to the end that if any thing were attempted contrarie to the faction, that then eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man ſhould take Armes and reſort to S. <hi>Pulinare,</hi> (a place neare to the Pallace) from whence they might go to performe whatſoeuer ſhould be thought neceſſary. This concluſion made, euerie man returned home. The new <hi>Senators</hi> entered their offices, and the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> (to giue himſelfe reputation, and terrifie the contrarie partie) condemned to priſon <hi>Donato Velluti,</hi> his predeceſſor, for hauing imploied the publike treaſure. After theſe things were done, he ſounded the minds of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, touching the returne of <hi>Coſimo:</hi> &amp; finding them well diſpoſed, conſulted with all thoſe whom he thought to be chiefe heads of the faction of <hi>Medici.</hi> By them he was greatly incouraged: And thereupon commanded that <hi>Rinaldo</hi> (as principall man of the contrary faction) ſhould be ſent for. After this commandement giuen, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> thought good no longer to protract time, but came from his houſe followed with many armed men, &amp; with him ioyned preſently <hi>Ridolpho Peruzzi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rinaldo and his friends ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt the Medici.</note> &amp; <hi>Nicholo Barbado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi> Amongſt them were alſo diuerſe other Citizens, and many ſouldiers, who at that time hapned to be in <hi>Florence</hi> without pay. All which company, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reſorted to S. <hi>Pulinare,</hi> &amp; there ſtaied. <hi>Palla Strozzi</hi> had alſo aſſembled much company, but came not out: the like did alſo <hi>Giouanni Guicciardini.</hi> For which ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> ſent to ſollicite them, &amp; reproue them of their delaie. <hi>Giouanni</hi> anſwered, that hee made warre inough to the enemie, if by his tarrying at home, he could holde <hi>Piero</hi> his brother from going out, to reſcue the Pallace. <hi>Palla</hi> after manie meſſages ſent vnto him, came on horſe backe to S. <hi>Pulinare,</hi> with two onely foote men, and himſelfe, vnarmed. And <hi>Rinaldo</hi> ſeeing him, went towards him, and reproued him greatly of negligence, ſaying that hee ſhewed himſelfe thereby a man either of ſmall troth, or little courage. Both which reproachfull faultes, a man of that ſort, whereof he was holden, ought to eſchue. And if happily he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for not performing his promiſe, that the enemie (hauing victorie) would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don either his life or his exile, therein he was deceiued. As for himſelfe, if any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune happened, yet this content of minde ſhould remaine, that before the perill, hee was not diſmaid, and the perill being come, hee was not afraid. But he (and ſuch others as he was) ſhould double their owne diſcontentments, knowing they had three times betraied their Countrey. Firſt when they ſaued <hi>Coſimo,</hi> next when they refuſed his counſell, and laſt for not comming in Armes, according to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To theſe ſpeeches, <hi>Palla</hi> anſwered not any thing that was heard of thoſe that were there, but murmuring, turned his horſe, and went home. The <hi>Senators</hi> hearing that <hi>Rinaldo</hi> and his followers were in Armes, and ſeeing themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, ſhut the Pallace gates, and as amazed, knew not what to doo. But <hi>Rinaldo</hi> delaying his going thither, attending for forces which came not, loſt the occaſion of victorie, and gaue courage to the <hi>Senators</hi> to make prouiſion, and to other Cittizens to goe vnto them, and aduiſe them how matters might bee appeaſed. Then ſome friendes to the <hi>Senators</hi> leaſt ſuſpected, went vnto <hi>Rinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and ſaide, that the <hi>Senate</hi> knew no cauſe of theſe motions, and that they had no intent to offend him, or if it were for <hi>Coſimo,</hi> there was no meaning of his reuocation. If therefore theſe were the occaſions of their ſuſpition, they might aſſure themſelues, come to their Pallace, be welcome, and haue their demaunds graunted. Theſe words could not alter the reſolution of <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> but ſaid that hee would make the <hi>Senators</hi> priuate men, and by that meanes bee aſſured: which done, reforme the Cittie to the benefite of all men. But it euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that amongſt thoſe whoſe authoritie is equall, and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions diuerſe, for the moſte parte, nothing is well reſolued. <hi>Ridolpho

Peruzzi</hi> moued with the words of thoſe Citizens, ſaid, that for his owne part, hee ſought not further, then that <hi>Coſimo</hi> might no more return, which being granted, he thought the victorie ſufficient. Neither deſired he in hope of more, to fill the Citie with bloud, and therefore he would obey the <hi>Senate.</hi> Then went he to the Pallace, where he was ioyfully receiued. Thus the ſtaie of <hi>Rinaldo</hi> at S. <hi>Pullinare,</hi> the fainte heart of <hi>Palla,</hi> and the departure of <hi>Ridolpho,</hi> had vtterly ouerthrowne the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: and the mindes of thoſe Cittizens that followed <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> beganne to faile of their wonted courage, whereunto the authoritie of the Pope was ioyned. For at this time, Pope <hi>Eugenio</hi> being expulſed <hi>Rome,</hi> happened to be in <hi>Florence,</hi> where he heard of theſe tumults, and thought it his office to be a meane to pacifie the Cittie.<note place="margin">Pope Eugenio laboureth a Pacificat<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

To him the Pope declared, what credite the <hi>Senate</hi> had giuen him, which was, to determine all controuerſies, and order all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as ſhould by him bee thought good. <hi>Rinaldo</hi> hauing made proofe of the coldneſſe of <hi>Palla,</hi> and the inconſtancie of <hi>Ridolpho Peruzzi,</hi> and wanting a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhift, yeelded himſelfe into the Popes hands, hoping his authoritie ſhould haue continued. Thereuppon the Pope cauſed knowledge to be giuen to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholo Barbadori,</hi> and the reſt, who attended without, that they ſhould laie downe their Armes: becauſe <hi>Rinaldo</hi> remained with him, for the concluding a peace with the <hi>Senatours.</hi> Which wordes reſolued euerie man, and they diſarmed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The <hi>Senators</hi> ſeeing their aduerſaries diſarmed, practiſed a peace by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Pope, and in the meane time ſent ſecretly to <hi>Pistoia,</hi> for certaine bandes of foote men, whome (accompanied with all their men at Armes) they ſuffered in the night to enter the Cittie: and poſſeſsing the ſtrongeſt places, and calling the people to the Market place, created there a new <hi>Balia,</hi> which at the firſt aſſembly,<note place="margin">Coſimo reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> determined the reuocation of <hi>Coſimo,</hi> with all others that were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And of the contrary faction, they confined <hi>Rinaldo delli Albizi, Ridol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo Peruzzi, Nicholo Barbadori, Palla Strozzi,</hi> and many other Cittizens, that the number of them was ſuch, as that fewe Townes of <hi>Italy</hi> (and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo) but were full of them. By this accident the Citie of <hi>Florence</hi> became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued, not onely of honeſt men, but alſo of riches and induſtry. The Pope ſeeing the ruine of thoſe men, who at his requeſt had laide downe Armes, became greatly diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented, lamenting with <hi>Rinaldo</hi> for the iniury to him done vnder his credit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him to patience,<note place="margin">The words of Rinaldo at his baniſhment.</note> and hope of better fortune. To whome <hi>Rinaldo</hi> anſwered; the ſmall credit which they gaue me, who ought to haue beleeued me, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch credite which I haue giuen to you, hath vtterly vndone me, and my Countrey. But I complaine more of my ſelfe then anie others, for beleeuing, that you being baniſhed your Countrey, could maintaine mee, in mine. Of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes dalliances I haue had experience inough, and ſith I little truſted to proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, mine aduerſitie ſhall the leſſe offend mee, for I knowe well, that (Fortune beeing ſo pleaſed) can againe fauoure mee. But if ſhee neuer ſo do, I ſhall euer care little, to liue in that Cittie, where the lawes are of leſſe authoritie, then men. Becauſe that Countrey is to be defired, where the wealth and friends of men may be with ſecuritie enioyed, and not that, where mens goods may bee taken from them, and their friendes (for feare to looſe theyr owne) in greateſt neceſsitie forſake them. It was alſo euer leſſe greeuous to good

and wiſe men, to heare the miſeries of their Countrey, then with their owne eyes to ſee them. And it is alſo thought a thing more glorious, to be reputed an honourable Rebel, then a ſlauiſh Citizen. After this ſpeech made, being much troubled in mind, he tooke leaue of the Pope, finding great fault with his Councels, and the coldneſſe of his friends, and ſo went towards his exile. <hi>Coſimo</hi> on the other ſide, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued knowledge of his reſtitution, returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> and was there receiued, with no leſſe pompe, then is vſed to other Citizens, who after victorie, came home in tryumph. So great was the Concourſe of people; ſo great the demonſtration of their beneuolence towards him, at this his returne from baniſhment, as the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens willingly ſaluted him by name of the peoples Benefactor, and Father of the Country.</p>

For na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hauing made all worldly thinges variable, ſo ſoone as they haue atteined their vttermoſt perfection and height, doo of force deſcend: and being come downe ſo low, as lower they cannot, of neceſsitie muſt aſcend. So that from good they deſcended to euill, and from euill aſcend to good. Warre begetteth quiet, quiet occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioneth idleneſſe, Idleneſſe breedeth diſorder, Diſorder maketh ruine: Likewiſe of ruine groweth order, of order vertue, and of vertue, glorie with good fortune. It hath bene therefore by wiſe men obſerued, that learning followeth Armes, and in all Cities and Countries, Captaines were before Philoſophers. For good and well gouerned Armes, hauing wonne victorie, of that victorie followeth quiet. And ſurely the courage of warlike mindes cannot with a more honeſt idleneſſe, then the ſtudie of Letters, be corrupted; nor idleneſſe by anie greater or more peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous craft enter Cities well gouerned: which <hi>Cato</hi> (at ſuch time as <hi>Diogenes</hi> and <hi>Carneades</hi> Philoſophers, were ſent Embaſſadours from <hi>Athens</hi> to the <hi>Senate</hi>) did well obſerue.

Wherewith men being beaten and weary of troubles, returne (as is beforeſaid) to order, if by extraordinarie force

they be not vtterly ruined. Theſe occaſions, by vertue of the auncient <hi>Toſcani</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> did make <hi>Italy,</hi> ſometimes happie, and ſometimes miſerable. And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it ſince that time, nothing hath bene builded vppon the <hi>Romane</hi> ruines compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the olde, (as might with great glorie haue bene vnder the gouernment of a vertuous Prince). Yet in ſome newe Citties ſo much vertue is growne vp (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romane</hi> ſpoyles) that although no one hath atteined ſuch power as to commaund the reſt, yet became they ſo well ordered and lincked togither, as they deliuered and defended themſelues from the barbarous people. Of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was the <hi>Florentines</hi> gouernment, (although of leſſe Empire) yet in authoritie and power not inferiour to anie, but rather by inhabiting the middeſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich and readie to offend, either happily they anſwered the warres made againſt them, or elſe gaue the victorie to thoſe in whoſe fauoure they imployed their forces. By the vertue of theſe principallities, although no times of quiet, and long peace were, yet were they not by terrour of warre much perillous. For we cannot account that peace, where one ſtate oftentimes with Armes aſſayleth the other. Neither can that be called warre, where men be not ſlaine, Citties not ſacked, nor principallities deſtroyed. For the warres of that time became ſo cold, as they were begunne without feare, continued without perill, and ended without loſſe. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as that vertue which in other Countries was wont by long peace to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, was in <hi>Italy</hi> by their owne cowardice quenched, as will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, by that we will hereafter declare from the 1434. till the 94. Whereby we may ſee, how at length a way was againe opened for the entrie of ſtraungers, and <hi>Italy</hi> became to them ſubiect. And albeit the actions of our Princes both abroad and at home, are not (as thoſe of auncient time were) to be read and maruelled at for their vertue and greatneſſe: yet for ſome other quallities, to be with no leſſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration conſidered, ſeeing ſo many Noble people, were by ſo fewe and euill trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſouldiers kept in awe. And if in declaration of things happened in this badde world, we ſhall not ſet downe the courage of anie ſouldier, the vertue of anie Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or the loue of anie Cittizen towards his Countrey: yet ſhall you finde, what cunning and Art, the Princes, the Souldiers, and chiefe Gouernours in Common weales (to maintaine the reputation they did not deſerue) haue vſed: which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe will prooue not leſſe worthie, and profitable to be knowne, then thoſe of moſt auncient time. For as thoſe do ſtirre vp Noble mindes to follow them: So theſe, to eſchue their lewdneſſe and lacke of vertue, wil prouoke vs. In thoſe dayes <hi>Italy</hi> was brought to ſuch condition, by them that there commaunded: that whenſoeuer through reconciliation of the Princes a peace was made; ſhortly after, (by ſuch as had weapons in hand) it was againe diſturbed. So that neither by the warres en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was gotten glorie, nor by the peace, quiet. The peace being concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and thoſe of the League, in the yeare 1433. the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers deſiring ſtill to exerciſe the warre, made an enterpriſe againſt the Church. There were at that time in <hi>Italy,</hi> two ſorts of ſouldiers, the one trained vnder <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two ſorts of ſouldiers in Italy. 1433.</note> the other vnder <hi>Sforza.</hi> Of theſe, the chiefe Captain was the Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> ſonne of <hi>Sforza.</hi> Of the other, <hi>Nicholo Piccinino,</hi> and <hi>Nicholo Fortibraccio</hi> were the Leaders.

All which was graunted: So much did Pope <hi>Eugenio,</hi> feare more a daungerous warre, then a diſhonourable peace.

All theſe things chanced during the exile of <hi>Coſimo:</hi> after whoſe returne, theſe who had ſought his reuocation, with diuerſe other Cittizens before iniured, thought without reſpect, to aſſure themſelues of the gouernment. And the <hi>Senate</hi> which ſucceeded, in the moneths of Nouember and December, not contented with that which their predeceſſours had done in fauour of their faction, prolonged &amp; changed the time and places of thoſe that were baniſhed, and confined many others anew. Alſo diuerſe Citizens were in that time hindered, not only by the humour of faction, but alſo in reſpect of their riches, their parentage, and priuate friendſhip.

Moreouer with new lawes, and orders, they ſtrengthened themſelues, making new <hi>Squittini,</hi> taking out the names of their enemies, &amp; putting in the names of their friends. Alſo being warned by the ruine of their enemies, and iudging that it ſufficed not for the holding of the ſtate, to haue the <hi>Squittini</hi> full of their friends: they alſo thought good, that the Magiſtrates of life and death, ſhould be choſen of the chiefe of their faction. It was therfore required, that the makers of the new <hi>Squittini,</hi> togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the old <hi>Senate,</hi> ſhould haue authoritie to create the new. They gaue vnto the Eight authoritie ouer life and death, and prouided that thoſe that were baniſhed, ſhould not (though their time were expired) return, vnleſſe of the <hi>Senat</hi> and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges being in number 37.) were thereunto conſenting, or at the leaſt, thirtie foure of them. To write vnto thoſe that were confined, or receiue any letters from them, was forbidden. Alſo euery word, euery ſigne, &amp; euery action that offended the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, was greeuouſly puniſhed.

Alſo not to want forrein aid, but

preuent ſuch as thereby determined to offend them, they did confederate, and make league with the Pope, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Milan.</hi> The ſtate of <hi>Florence</hi> reſting in theſe tearmes, <hi>Giouanna</hi> Queene of <hi>Naples</hi> dyed, making by her teſtament <hi>Rinieri de Angio,</hi> heyre of her Kingdome. At that time <hi>Alfonſo</hi> King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> happened to be in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and hauing the friendſhip of many Barrons there,<note place="margin">VVarre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Rinieri de Angio, and King Alfonſo of Aragon.</note> prepared himſelfe to poſſeſſe that Kingdome. The <hi>Napolitanes,</hi> and many of the Lords fauoured <hi>Rinieri.</hi> The Pope on the other ſide, would neither that <hi>Rinieri,</hi> nor <hi>Alfonſo</hi> might poſſeſſe it: but deſired that himſelfe ſhould gouerne it, by a Deputy of his owne. Yet <hi>Alfonſo</hi> being arriued in the Kingdome, was by the Duke of <hi>Seſſa</hi> receiued, and there enterteined ſome other Princes, hoping to ſurprize <hi>Capoua</hi> (which the Prince of <hi>Tarranto</hi> in the name of <hi>Alfonſo</hi> poſſeſſed) and by that meane to conſtraine the <hi>Napolitanes</hi> to yeeld to his will. For that purpoſe he ſent his Nauie to aſſault <hi>Gaietta,</hi> which was holden for the <hi>Neapolitanes.</hi> The <hi>Napolitanes</hi> then prayed ayde of <hi>Philippo,</hi> who perſwaded the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> to take that enterpriſe in hand. They not onely to ſatisfie the Duke their Prince, but alſo to ſaue the merchandize they had in <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Gaietta,</hi> armed a mightie Nauie. <hi>Alfonſo</hi> on the contrary ſide, vnderſtanding thereof, encreaſed his forces, and went in perſon to encounter the <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> with whom he fought neere vnto the Iſland of <hi>Pontio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">King Alfonſo taken by the Genoueſi.</note> and there his Nauie was vanquiſhed, himſelfe with diuerſe other Princes taken and ſent by the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> to <hi>Philippo.</hi> This victorie diſmayd all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe thereby they thought he might become owner of all. But he (ſo diuerſe are the opinions of men) tooke a courſe, cleane contrary to expectation. This <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> being a man verie wiſe, ſo ſoone as he could come to the ſpeech of <hi>Philippo,</hi> tolde how greatly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued himſelfe to fauour <hi>Rinieri,</hi> and diſfauour him: becauſe if <hi>Rinieri</hi> were King of <hi>Naples,</hi> he would labour with all his force to bring the Dukedome of <hi>Milan</hi> to the hands of the French King, by reaſon his ayde was at hand, his furniture of all things neceſſarie, and the way open for his reliefe. Neither could he looke for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his owne ruine, if he made that ſtate to become French. But the contrarie would follow, if himſelfe might be Prince. For he not fearing any other enemy then the French, ſhould be enforced to loue, honour and obey him, who had the onely power to open the way to his enemies. So that although the Kingdome ſhould reſt with <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> yet the authoritie and power thereof would remaine in the hands of <hi>Philippo.</hi> Wherefore it would much more import him then himſelfe, to conſider the perill of the one, and the profit of the other, vnleſſe he deſired more to ſatisfie his fanteſie, then aſſure the ſtate. Becauſe in doing the one, he ſhould be Prince, and free, by the other (in the middeſt of two mightie enemies) either ſure to loſe the ſtate vtterly, liue alwayes in ſuſpition, or, as a ſubiect, obey them.<note place="margin">King Alfonſo deliuered.</note> Theſe words wrought ſo deepe in the Dukes mind, that (changing his intent) he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> honorably returned him to <hi>Genoua,</hi> and from thence to the Kingdome. There he imbarked againe, and being arriued at <hi>Gaietta,</hi> his deliuery was knowne, and that Countrey ſodeinly ſurprized by certaine Lords his followers. The <hi>Genoueſi</hi> ſeeing, that without reſpect to them, the Duke had deliuered the King, and that he, whome they with their charge and perill had honoured, did not make them aſwell partakers of the honor in the Kings inlargement, as of the iniurie to him done, and his ouerthrow, grew greatly offended. In the Cittie of <hi>Genoua</hi> (when it liueth in libertie) there is created one head, whome they call <hi>Doge,</hi> not to be a Prince abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, nor to determine alone, but as chiefe to propound thoſe matters, whereof the Magiſtrates and Councels ſhould conſult. Within that Towne be many noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which are ſo mightie, that with difficultie, they yeeld to the authoritie of Magiſtrates. And of them the houſes of <hi>Fregoſa</hi> and <hi>Adorna</hi> be of greateſt force.<note place="margin">Fregoſi and Adorni.</note>

From theſe, the diuiſions of that Cittie, and the cauſes of ciuill diſorders did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. For they many times contending for gouernment, not onely ciuilly, but alſo by armes, it falleth out, that euer the one faction is afflicted, and the other gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. It alſo happeneth many times, that thoſe who are depoſed from authoritie, do pray ayde of forreine armes, and yeeld that gouernment to others, which they themſelues could not enioy. Hereof it proceedeth, that thoſe who gouerned in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> do for the moſt part commaund in <hi>Genoua,</hi> as it happened at ſuch time as <hi>Alfonſo</hi> was taken. Among the chiefe of the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> that cauſed the Cittie to be giuen into the hands of <hi>Philippo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Franceſco Spinola.</note> was <hi>Franceſco Spinola,</hi> who not long after he had brought his countrey in bondage (as in like caſes it euer happeneth) became ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to the Duke. Wherewith he being diſcontent, voluntarily exiled himſelfe to <hi>Gaietta,</hi> and there chanced to be, at ſuch time as the fight by ſea was performed againſt <hi>Alfonſo.</hi> In which exploit he ſerued ſo valiantly, that he perſwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to haue deſerued ſo well of the Duke, as in reſpect of his ſeruice, he might (at the leaſt) liue in <hi>Genoua</hi> with ſecuritie. Yet perceiuing the Duke to continue in his ſuſpition, and fearing leaſt he beleeued, that a man who had not loued the liberty of his countrey, could not loue him, determined to try a new fortune, and at one inſtant both to deliuer his countrey, and win himſelfe fame with ſecuritie; Being perſwaded, that by no meanes he might recouer the good will of the Cittizens bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to performe ſuch an acte with his owne hand: So as, the ſame hand which had offended, and hurt his countrey, ſhould alſo miniſter the medicine, and heale it. Then knowing the vniuerſall hatred borne to the Duke by the deliuerie of the King, thought the time to ſerue well for the execution of his intent. Wherefore he imparted his mind to ſome, whome he knew of his owne opinion: Them he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded and prepared to followe him. The feaſt of S. Iohn Baptiſt being come, <hi>Ariſmino</hi> (the new Gouernor ſent by the Duke) entred into <hi>Genoua,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Opicino</hi> the old Gouernor, and many other Cittizens. <hi>Franceſco Spinola</hi> thought then good no longer to deferre the matter, but came out of his houſe with diuerſe others, all armed, and priuie to his determination. So ſoone as hee came to the market place, where himſelfe dwelled, he proclaymed the name of libertie. And it was a thing very maruellous to ſee, with how great ſpeed the people and Cittizens to that name aſſembled: So as no man that loued the Duke either for his owne profit, or other occaſion, had leiſure to take armes, or thinke how to ſaue himſelfe. <hi>Ariſmino</hi> with ſome other <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> fled into the Caſtle which he kept for the Duke. <hi>Opicino</hi> preſuming that (if he fled to the Pallace) hauing there two thouſand Souldiers at his commaundement, he ſhould either ſaue himſelfe, or giue courage to his friends to defend him, went thitherwards, but before he came to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, was ſlaine, cut in pieces, and drawne through euery ſtreete of the Cittie. The <hi>Genoueſi</hi> hauing thus reduced the Cittie vnder their owne Magiſtrates and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, within few dayes alſo ſurprized the Caſtle, with the other places of ſtrength poſſeſſed by the Duke,<note place="margin">The libertie of Genoua recouered.</note> and ſo clearely caſt off the yoke of <hi>Philippo.</hi> Theſe matters thus handled, as at the beginning, the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> was diſmayd, fearing that the Duke ſhould become ouermightie, ſo this gaue them hope (ſeeing what end they had) to be able to bridle him. And notwithſtanding the league lately made, the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> made peace with the <hi>Genoueſi</hi>: whereupon, <hi>Rinaldo delli Albizi,</hi> and other leaders of the <hi>Florentines</hi> baniſhed, ſeeing things out of order, and the world changed, did hope to perſwade the Duke to make open warre againſt the <hi>Florentines.</hi>

If we ſometimes your enemies, do now confidently deſire ayde of you for the recouerie of our countrey, neither you,

nor any other (that conſider worldly matters, how they proceed, and how variable fortune is) ought to meruaile, albeit neither of our paſſed or preſent actions, nor of that we haue long ſince done either to you, or to our countrey, or that which now is in doing, we can render a good and reaſonable excuſe. There is no good man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth another for defending his Countrey, in what ſort ſoeuer the ſame is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Neither was it euer our meaning, to iniure you, but to defend our owne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being iniured; which was ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proued in the greateſt victories of our league. For ſo ſoone as we knew you inclined to a true peace, we were thereof more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, then you your ſelfe, ſo that we need not feare to obteine any fauour at your hands. Neither can our Countrey find fault, although we now perſwade you to take armes againſt it, whome with ſo great reſolution we haue withſtood. For that countrey deſerueth to be loued of all men, which indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly loueth them; and not that countrey, which diſdaining the greateſt number, aduanceth a few. There is no man alſo that ought to condemne men, although for ſome cauſes they take armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt their countrey. For albeit the Cities be bodies mixed, yet haue they of bodies ſimple, ſome reſemblance. And as in theſe, many infirmities grow, which without fire &amp; force cannot be cured: ſo in the other, many miſchiefes ariſe, which a godly and good Citizen ſhould offend to leaue vncured: notwithſtanding that in the cure he doth (as it behoueth him) apply both fire &amp; force. What ſicknes in the bodie of a common-weale can be greater, then ſeruitude? And what medicine is more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then this in the cure of that diſeaſe? Thoſe warres be only iuſt, which be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, and thoſe armes moſt mercifull, where other hope cannot be had, then by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I know not what neceſsitie is greater then ours, or what compaſsion can be more, then to deliuer a Countrey fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruitude? Moſt certainly we know our cauſe is to be pittied and iuſt, which ought to be both by vs and you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered. For your part, faile not to affoord this iuſtice, ſith the <hi>Florentines</hi> haue not bene aſhamed, after a peace with ſo great ſolemnitie concluded, to make league with the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels: ſo that though our cauſe moue you not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſsion, yet this diſhonor offered vnto your ſelfe, ought to perſwade you, and the rather that you ſee the enterpriſe eaſie. Let not exampls paſſed diſcourage you, hauing ſeen the power of that people, and their obſtinate defence of themſelues. Which two things, might yet reaſonably be feared, were they of the ſame vertue, which in thoſe daies they haue bene. But now you ſhall finde all contrarie. For what force can you looke for in any Cittie, which hath ſpoiled the greateſt part of the riches, and induſtrie thereof. What reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution can be hoped of in a people, by ſo diuers and new quarrels diſunited? Which diſunion, is cauſe, that thoſe riches there remaining in ſuch ſort as they were wont, be imploied, becauſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do willingly ſpend their patrimony, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee the ſame for their owne glory, their owne honor, and their owne Countrey imployed; euer hoping to recouer that in peace, which the warre hath conſumed: and not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee themſelues both in war &amp; peace oppreſſed; hauing in the one to ſuſpect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie of enemies, and in the other, the inſolencie of them that command. Alſo, the people are more harmed by couetouſnes of our own Citizens, then the ſpoile of our enemies, for of this ſome end may be hoped of, but of that none at all. In the warres paſſed, you made warre to the whole Citie, but now you are only to contend with a few. Then you came to take the ſtate from many, and thoſe good Citizens, but now you are to aſſault a fewe, and thoſe but bace companions. Then you came to take the libertie from the Cittie, but now you come to reſtore it. It is not therefore like, that in ſo great a contrarietie of occaſions, the effect that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſhall be like. Yea, you are rather to hope of victorie certaine, which how greatlie it fortifieth your State, your ſelfe may eaſilie iudge, hauing thereby

greatly bound <hi>Toſcana</hi> to be your friend. And though at ſome other time, this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie would be accounted ambitious &amp; violent, yet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this occaſion, is eſteemed iuſt and reaſonable. Omit not therefore the preſent opportunitie, and thinke that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your other enterpriſes againſt the Cittie, did with their difficultie breed your expences and infamie, yet this with great facilitie ſhall bring you foorth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding profit, with moſt honourable report. There needed not many words to perſwade the Duke to moue warre againſt the <hi>Florentines,</hi> becauſe he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto diſpoſed by hate hereditarie, and blind ambition, which humors did leade and commaund him: and the rather, being ſpurred forward by new iniuries, and offence for the league made with the <hi>Genoueſi.</hi> Notwithſtanding, his former charges, with the freſh memory of perils, and loſſes paſſed, togither with the vaine hope of the baniſhed men,<note place="margin">Genoua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted from the Duke.</note> did diſcourage him. This Duke, ſo ſoone as he vnderſtood the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>Genoua,</hi> had ſent <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> with all his men of armes, and thoſe footemen he could hire in his iourney, to recouer the Cittie, before the Cittizens had ſetled their minds and planted a new gouernment, greatly truſting vnto the Caſtle of <hi>Genoua</hi> which was holden for him. And albeit that <hi>Nicholo</hi> had forced the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> to flee vnto the mountaines, and taken from them the Vale of <hi>Pozeueri,</hi> where they fortified themſelues, and alſo conſtrained them to retire within the walles of their Cittie: yet found he ſo great difficultie in going forward, by reaſon of the Cittizens reſolute defending themſelues, that he was enforced to remoue from thence. Whereupon the Duke at the perſwaſion of the baniſhed <hi>Florentines,</hi> commaunded that the Riuer on the Eaſt ſide ſhould be aſſaulted, approching the confines of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and there make the greateſt warre to <hi>Genoua,</hi> that poſsibly they could, ſuppoſing, that reſolution would from time to time enforme, what courſe were beſt to be followed. Then <hi>Nicholo</hi> aſſaulted and ſurprized <hi>Serezana,</hi> and after many diſpleaſures done, to make the <hi>Florentines</hi> more ſuſpitious, he came to <hi>Lucca,</hi> and cauſed a report to be made, that he intended a iourney to <hi>Naples</hi> in ayde of the King of <hi>Aragon.</hi> Pope <hi>Eugenio</hi> vpon theſe new accidents, went from <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Bologna,</hi> where he practiſed new compoſition betweene the Duke and the League, perſwading the Duke, that if he would not conſent to the peace, he ſhould be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to deliuer the Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> his confederate, at that preſent remayning in his pay. But notwithſtanding the Pope his great indeuour, all his deſignes prooued vayne, becauſe the Duke, without poſſeſsion of <hi>Genoua,</hi> would not conſent, and the League would refuſe, vnleſſe <hi>Genoua</hi> continued free. Euery man then diſpairing of peace, prepared for the warre. <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> being come to <hi>Lucca,</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> miſtruſted no new matter, but cauſed <hi>Neri</hi> of <hi>Gino</hi> to goe with their Souldiers to the countrey of <hi>Piſa,</hi> obteining of the Pope, that the Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> ſhould ioyne with him, and ſo with both their armies togither, make head at <hi>S. Gonda. Piccinino</hi> arriued at <hi>Lucca,</hi> deſired paſſage to march towards the Kingdome, and being denied, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to paſſe by force. Theſe two armies, were in force and vertue of the Captaines equall, for which reſpect, neither of them prooued their fortune, being alſo hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the cold weather, for then the moneth of December was begun. In which reſpects many daies, without one offending the other, they ſtaied. The firſt of them which marched, was <hi>Nicholo Piccinino,</hi> who was informed, that if he would in the night aſſault <hi>Vico Piſano,</hi> he might eaſily ſurprize it. <hi>Nicholo</hi> tooke the matter in hand, but not preuailing, ſpoiled and burned the countrey thereabouts, togither with the Towne of <hi>S. Giouanni alla Vena.</hi> This enterpriſe, albeit for the moſt part thereof to no purpoſe, yet did the ſame encourage <hi>Nicholo</hi> to goe forwards, ſeeing the Earle and <hi>Neri</hi> moued not. Therefore he aſſaulted and poſſeſſed <hi>Santa Maria</hi> in <hi>Castello,</hi> and <hi>Filetto.</hi> Yet for all this, the <hi>Florentine</hi> forces remoued not: not becauſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14349:66"/>
the Earle ſtood in feare, but becauſe the warre (for the reuerence borne to the Pope, who intreated for peace) was not by the Magiſtrates in <hi>Florence</hi> determined. And that, which the <hi>Florentines</hi> by their owne wiſedome were counſailed to do, was thought of the enemy to be done for feare. Which conceite gaue them cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to take new enterpriſes in hand, ſo that they determined to beſiege <hi>Borgo,</hi> and before it preſented all their forces. This new aſſault, cauſed the <hi>Florentines</hi> to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all reſpects, and not only to reſcue <hi>Borgo,</hi> but alſo to aſſault the countrey of <hi>Lucca.</hi> Then the Earle marching towards <hi>Nicholo,</hi> and fighting with him neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Borgo,</hi> vanquiſhed his forces, and leuied the ſiege. The <hi>Venetians</hi> in the meane while, thinking that the Duke had broken the peace, ſent <hi>Giouan Franceſco da Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga</hi> their Generall, into <hi>Ghiriadada,</hi> who ſpoiling greatly the Dukes countrey, conſtrained him to reuoke <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> from the enterprize of <hi>Toſcana.</hi> Which reuocation, togither with the victorie had againſt <hi>Nicholo,</hi> gaue the <hi>Florentines</hi> courage to aſſault <hi>Lucca,</hi> with hope to poſſeſſe it; Wherein they had neither feare, nor reſpect at all, ſeeing the Duke, whome they onely feared, to be aſſailed by the <hi>Venetians:</hi> And that the <hi>Luccheſi,</hi> hauing receiued enemies at home, were content to be aſſaulted, in reſpect whereof they could not at all complaine. In the moneth of Aprill, the yeare 1437. the Earle marched with his army, but before the <hi>Florentines</hi> would aſſault others, deſired to recouer their owne, and therefore recouered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <hi>Santa Maria in Castello,</hi> with all other places ſurprized by <hi>Piccinino.</hi> That done, directed a courſe to the countrey of <hi>Lucca,</hi> aſſailing <hi>Ca-Maggiore.</hi> The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants whereof, though faithfull to their Lord, yet becauſe feare of the enemy neere at hand, had greater force in them, then the dutie toward their friend farre off, they yeelded themſelues. And with like reputation was <hi>Maſſa,</hi> and <hi>Serezana</hi> ſurprized. Which things being done about the end of the moneth of May, the army returned towards <hi>Lucca,</hi> ſpoiling the Corne, burning the Villages,<note place="margin">Lucca diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> cutting the Vines and trees, driuing away the Cattle, and not fearing to performe euery outrage that ſouldiers were wont to do vnto their enemies. The <hi>Luccheſi</hi> on the other ſide, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues by the Duke abandoned, and diſpairing to defend their countrey, intrenched and fortified the Cittie by all meanes they poſsible could. And hauing men ſufficient, hoped they might for a time defend the ſame, as in former aſſaults of the <hi>Florentines</hi> they had done. They only feared the mutable minds of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, leaſt they being beſieged, would grow wearie, eſteeming more their owne priuate perill, then the libertie of others, and ſo enforce ſome diſhonorable and dangerous compoſition. Wherefore to perſwade them to take courage, and be reſolute in defence of the Cittie, one of the moſt auntient and wiſeſt Cittizens aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the people in the market place, and ſaid vnto them as followeth. You ought alwaies to remember, that things done by neceſsitie,<note place="margin">The Oration of the Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cittizens.</note> deſerue neither commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor blame. If therefore you haue found fault with theſe warres which the <hi>Florentines</hi> do make vpon you, and that we haue gained in receiuing ſouldiers from the Duke, and ſuffered them to aſſault vs, you greatl<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

Alſo, the auncient enimitie of the <hi>Florentines</hi> towards you is well knowne: whereof, neither your iniuries, nor their owne feare, but our weakeneſſe, and their ambition, hath bene the cauſe; for that, the one giueth them hope to oppreſſe you, and the other incouragement to performe the oppreſsion. Do not beleeue that any merit of yours can remoue that deſire in them, neither any iniurie by you done, can more increaſe the deſire they haue to offend you. Wherefore, as they do ſtudie to take your libertie from you, ſo muſt you labour to defend the ſame. And, for thoſe things which both they and we do to that end, euery man may be ſorie, but no man can meruaile. Let vs then be ſorie that we are aſſaulted, that our townes are beſieged,

our houſes burned, and our countrey ſpoiled. Notwithſtanding, which of vs is ſo vnwiſe, as to meruaile thereat? For if we were able, we ourſelues would do the like, or worſe to them. If they haue moued this warre by the comming of <hi>Nicholo,</hi> had he not come, they would haue done the like vpon ſome other occaſion. If this miſchiefe had bene deferred, the ſame perhaps would haue prooued greater, ſo that, this his comming, ought not ſo much to be blamed, as our euill fortune, and their ambitious nature. For ſith we could not refuſe to receiue the Dukes ſouldiers, they being come, could not refraine to make the warre. You know well, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aide of ſome mightie Prince, we could not be defended: neither was there any of power ſufficient, nor more likely to defend vs both with fidelitie and force, then the Duke. Hee hath reſtored our libertie, and therefore reaſon would, hee ſhould defend it. He hath bene alſo enemy to all thoſe that were our auntient ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. If then by not offending the <hi>Florentines,</hi> we had incurred the Dukes diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we ſhould thereby haue loſt our friend, and made the enemy more mightie, and more apt to offend vs. So as it is much better to haue this warre with the Dukes loue, then peace with his diſpleaſure. And we may hope well he will deliuer vs from thoſe dangers, whereunto he hath drawne vs, ſo that we do not forſake him. You know with how great furie the <hi>Florentines</hi> haue diuerſe times aſſailed vs, and with how great glorie we haue often defended our ſelues againſt them, euen when we had none other hope, but of God and time, the one and the other of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued vs. And therefore why ſhould we now diſpaire to defend our ſelues? At that time all <hi>Italy</hi> had abandoned vs, but now, the Duke is on our ſide, and we may alſo hope that the <hi>Venetians</hi> will not be haſtie to offend vs, as men that deſire not to increaſe the <hi>Florentines</hi> greatnes. Heretofore the <hi>Florentines</hi> haue bene more free, they had alſo more hope to be aided, of themſelues, they were more mightie, and we in euery reſpect weaker then we now are. For at that time we defended a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but now we defend our ſelues. Then the honour of our defence was an other mans, now it is our owne. At that time when they aſſaulted vs, they were vnited, but now they aſſaile vs diſunited, all <hi>Italy</hi> being full of their Rebels. But if all theſe hopes were not, yet extreame neceſsitie ought to make vs reſolute in our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Euery enemy ought to be by vs iuſtly feared, for euery of them do ſeeke their owne glorie and our deſtruction. But of all others, we ought moſt to abhorre the <hi>Florentines,</hi> becauſe our obedience, our tribute, and the ſubiection of this Cittie do not ſuffice to content them, but they would alſo haue our bodies and wealth, to the end they might feed their crueltie with our bloud, and fill their couetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire with our riches. Euery man therefore of what ſort ſoeuer, ought to deteſt them. Be not therefore diſmayed to behold the fields ſpoiled, the Villages burned, and the Townes ſacked. Yet if this Cittie be ſaued, of neceſsitie they will be recouered; But if this Cittie be loſt, without any our profit they ſhould be ſaued: Becauſe we continuing our libertie, the enemy ſhall with difficultie poſſeſſe them, but loſing our libertie, in vaine we ſhall poſſeſſe them. Take your weapons therefore in hand, and when you fight, beleeue that the renowne of your victorie ſhall be not onely the ſafetie of our common countrey, but alſo of your priuate houſes and children. The laſt wordes of his ſpeech were with ſo great comfort of the people receiued, that with one voyce they promiſed to dye, rather then yeeld or conſent to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in preiudice of their libertie: and therefore prepared all things neceſſarie for defence of the Cittie. In the meane ſpace, the <hi>Florentine</hi> army loſt no time, but after much hurt done to the Countrey, by treatie tooke <hi>Monte Carlo,</hi> and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued to <hi>Vzano,</hi> to the end that the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> enuironed on euery ſide, ſhould looke for no reſcue, and ſo by famine force that Cittie to yeeld. The Caſtle was verie
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14349:67"/>
ſtrong, and fully manned, whereby the winning thereof, was not ſo eaſie as the others. The <hi>Luccheſi</hi> ſeeing their Cittie on euery ſide beſieged, did (as reaſon would) reſort to the Duke: To whome, by all manner of perſwaſions,<note place="margin">The Luccheſi pray <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ide of the Duke.</note> both ſweete and ſowre, they recommended themſelues. And in their ſpeech, ſometimes they made mention of their owne merits, and ſometimes they laied before him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie done by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and what incouragement other his friends would take, if they were defended; or not, what feare might be conceiued thereby. But if they ſhould loſe their libertie and liues, he ſhould thereby loſe his friends and honour, togither with the loue of all thoſe, that would at euery daunger aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for him. Theſe words were accompanied with teares, to the end, that if his owne obligation moued him not, yet the compaſsion of their miſerie might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him. So that the Duke adding to his auntient hate towards the <hi>Florentines</hi> the new deſert of the <hi>Luccheſi,</hi> and aboue all, deſiring that the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſhould not grow great by this victorie, reſolued, to ſend mightie forces into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> or elſe with much furie aſſault the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſo as, the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſhould be forced to leaue their enterpriſe and ſuccour them. This reſolution made, was ſpeedely aduertiſed to <hi>Florence,</hi> that the Duke intended to ſend men into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> which moued the <hi>Florentines</hi> to hope the leſſe of victorie. And to the end the Duke might be holden occupied in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> they did ſollicite the <hi>Venetians</hi> to ſet vpon him with all their forces. But they were greatly daunted with the departure of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> who had abandoned them, and was ioyned with the Duke. And therefore being (as it were) diſarmed, did anſwere, they were not only vnable to make themſelues ſtronger, but alſo vnfit to continue the warre, vnleſſe the Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> were ſent vnto them, with condition that he ſhould in perſon paſſe the Riuer <hi>Po.</hi> For they would not in any wiſe allow of the old Capitulations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſtood bound not to paſſe the Riuer <hi>Po.</hi> And moreouer they alleaged, that without a Captaine they could not make warre, and of other then the Earle, they had no hope. Neither could they imploy him, vnleſſe he were bound to make warre in all places. It ſeemed to the <hi>Florentines</hi> neceſſarie, that the warre ſhould be made in <hi>Lombardy</hi> with great force: yet on the other ſide, if the Earle were remoued from the ſiege of <hi>Lucca,</hi> that enterpriſe were to no purpoſe. And well they knewe this requeſt made of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> was not ſo much of any neede they had of the Earle, as to hinder them of that victorie. Contrary to that allegation was alleaged, that the Earle was prepared to goe into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> whenſoeuer they of the League ſhould commaund him, yet would he not alter his bond, leaſt thereby he might hinder himſelfe in the marriage, promiſed by the Duke. Thus were the <hi>Florentines</hi> poſſeſſed with two contrarie paſsions, the deſire to winne <hi>Lucca,</hi> and the feare of the Dukes warre. But (as for the moſt part it happeneth) feare preuailed, and they content that the Earle hauing wonne <hi>Vzano,</hi> ſhould goe into <hi>Lombardy.</hi> One other difficultie alſo there was, which not being in the power of the <hi>Florentines</hi> to diſpoſe, perplexed them more then the former. Which was, that the Earle would not paſſe the <hi>Po,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> otherwiſe would not enterteine him. So no meane being to accord them, but that the one muſt yeeld to the other, the <hi>Florentines</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Earle to write a letter, and thereby promiſe the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> to paſſe the Riuer, which he might do without diſhonor, becauſe that priuate promiſe ſhould not be any breach of his publike obligation: and notwithſtanding he might after make warre without paſsing the Riuer, yet thereof this commoditie would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that the warre being kindled, the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould be forced to followe it, and ſo the humor which they feared, would be turned another way. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other ſide affirmed, that his priuate Letter did ſuffice
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14349:68"/>
to binde him, and they were therewith ſatisfied. And if the Earle might ſtill vſe reſpects to his Father in law, they would allow thereof: for it was neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himſelfe, or them, without great neceſsitie to diſcouer him. By this meanes, the paſſage of the Earle into <hi>Lombardy</hi> was determined. Who hauing ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized <hi>Vzano,</hi> and made ſome Bulwarks about <hi>Lucca,</hi> to keepe the Cittizens from iſſuing out, and recommending the warre to his Deputies, paſſed the Alps, and went vnto <hi>Reggio.</hi> Then the <hi>Venetians</hi> grew ſuſpitious of his proceedings. And firſt of all to prooue his diſpoſition, required him to paſſe the Riuer <hi>Po,</hi> and ioyne with their other forces. Which the Earle vtterly denied, and many iniurious words paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betwixt him and <hi>Andrea Mauroceno,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diffidence betweene the Venetians and the Earle Franceſco.</note> ſent thither by the <hi>Venetians</hi>; the one of theſe accuſing the other of much pride, and little fidelitie. The Earle affirming he was not bound to the ſeruice, and the other proteſting that no paiment ſhould be made. So in the end, the Earle returned into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and <hi>Mauroceno</hi> to <hi>Venice.</hi> The Earle, was by the <hi>Florentines</hi> lodged in the countrey of <hi>Piſa,</hi> hoping to perſwade him to renew the warre againſt the <hi>Luccheſi.</hi> But thereunto they found him not diſpoſed. The Duke then vnderſtanding, that for reſpect and reuerence borne to him, the Earle would not paſſe the Riuer, he hoped alſo that by this meanes he might ſaue the <hi>Luccheſi</hi>; And therefore prayed him to make peace betwixt the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and (if he would) to include him alſo: Giuing him hope, that hee ſhould, whenſoeuer he pleaſed, be married vnto his daughter. This alliaunce greatly moued the Earle, becauſe thereby hee hoped, (the Duke not hauing any ſonnes) to become owner of <hi>Milan.</hi> For which cauſe, he euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to proceed in the warres as the <hi>Florentines</hi> did require him, alleaging hee would not marche vnleſſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> did performe their payment and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Neither was their paie ſufficient: for he, being deſirous to liue ſecure in his owne Countrey, it behoued him to haue other friends then the <hi>Florentines.</hi> Wherefore, if by the <hi>Venetians</hi> hee were abandoned, then ſhould it behoue him to take heed vnto his owne doings, and (ſo ſeemed) a little to threaten an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the Duke. Theſe cauillations, and theſe ſubtilties, highlie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the <hi>Florentines.</hi> For thereby they thought the enterpriſe of <hi>Lucca</hi> to be loſt, and doubted alſo of their owne eſtate, if the Duke and the Earle ſhould ioyne togither.<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines of diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching the pay of the Earle their Generall.</note> Then to perſwade the <hi>Venetians</hi> to performe the paie promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto the Earle, <hi>Coſimo de Medici</hi> went vnto <hi>Venice,</hi> hoping with his credit to perſwade them. Being there arriued, he diſputed of this matter at large with the <hi>Senate,</hi> and laide before them the ſtate of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the daunger thereof. Declaring alſo, of how great forces and reputation in Armes the Duke was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that if the Duke did ioyne with the Earle, the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould bee forced to retire to the Sea, and the <hi>Florentines</hi> be in perill of their libertie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the <hi>Venetians</hi> aunſwered, that they knewe their owne ſtrength, and the <hi>Italian</hi> forces, and beleeued they were able ynough to defend themſelues. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming alſo, they were not woont to paie Souldiers that ſerued other men. Wherefore it behoued the <hi>Florentines,</hi> themſelues ſhould paie the Earle, ſith by him they were ſerued: and that for the ſafe enioying their eſtate, it was more neceſſarie to keepe downe the Earles inſolencie, then to paie him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men had no boundes wherein to ſtaie their ambition. Alſo, if hee were nowe paide without any ſeruice done, hee would ſhortly after make ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſhoneſt and more perillous requeſt. They therefore thought neceſſarie to bridle his pride, and not ſuffer the ſame to increaſe till it were incorrigible. If then they, either for feare, or for any other intent would continue him a friend, it ſtood then vppon to paie him themſelues. Thus <hi>Coſimo</hi> returned without
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14349:68"/>
other concluſion. The <hi>Florentines</hi> notwithſtanding laboured, that the Earle ſhould not fall from the League, and indeed very vnwilling he was to depart. Yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he had to conclude his marriage, did hold him doubtfull, ſo that the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion (as after it came to paſſe) might loſe him. The Earle had appointed his Townes in <hi>La Marca</hi> to be guarded by a Captaine called <hi>Furlano,</hi> one of his principall Leaders. Hee hauing beene long ſollicited by the Duke, diſcharged himſelfe of the Earles entertainement, and went vnto him: which was the cauſe, that the Earle, (ſetting aſide all reſpectes) for feare of himſelfe,<note place="margin">The Earle Franceſco a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoneth the Venetians and Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> made peace with the Duke. And among other conditions it was agreed, that in the matters of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and <hi>Toſcana,</hi> the Earle ſhoulde not intermeddle further. After this peace made, the Earle inſtantlie perſwaded the <hi>Florentines</hi> to agree with the <hi>Luccheſi,</hi> and in a ſort conſtrayned them. They therefore ſeeing none other remedie, yeelded to compoſition in the moneth of Aprill, 1438. In which agreement, the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> remayned in their libertie, and <hi>Monte Carlo,</hi> with ſome other Caſtles, continued in poſſeſsion of the <hi>Florentines.</hi> Afterwards they lamented throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> that the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> could not be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their gouernment. And ſeldome it happeneth that any man hath bene ſo greatly greeued with loſing his owne, as the <hi>Florentines</hi> were, for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten that which belonged to others. Although then the <hi>Florentines</hi> were occupied in ſo great an enterpriſe, yet were they not forgetfull of their neighbours, nor fayled to furniſh their owne Cittie. At that time (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayd) <hi>Nicholo Fortibraccio</hi> (who had married the daughter of the Earle of <hi>Poppi</hi>) was dead. The Earle at the death of <hi>Nicholo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Earle of Poppi.</note> had in his poſſeſsion <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go A ſan Sepulcro,</hi> with the fortreſſe of that Towne, which in the name of his ſonne in lawe, during his life hee gouerned. After his death, as the dowrie of his daughter hee held the ſame, and refuſed to yeeld that Caſtle vnto the Pope, who claymed it, as lande belonging to the Church. In ſo much, as the Pope ſente the Patriarke thither with Souldiers to recouer it. The Earle finding himſelfe vnable to reſiſt that force, offered the Towne to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and they refuſed it. Yet ſo ſoone as the Pope returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> they trauelled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him, and the Earle, to make an agreement. Wherein, finding ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, the Patriarke aſſaulted <hi>Caſentino,</hi> and ſurprized <hi>Prato Vecchio,</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> offering the ſame likewiſe to the <hi>Florentines.</hi> But they would not accept it, vnleſſe the Pope did firſte conſent, that they might reſtore it to the Earle: Wherewith the Pope after much diſputation, was contented. Yet ſo, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſhould promiſe to perſwade, that the Earle of <hi>Poppi,</hi> ſhould reſtore vnto him <hi>Borgo.</hi> The Popes minde by this meanes ſatisfied, the <hi>Florentines</hi> thought good the Cathedrall Church of their Cittie called <hi>Santa Reparata,</hi> (being long before begun, and now come to ſuch perfection, as diuine Ceremonies might therein be celebrate) to deſire his holineſſe, that perſonally he would conſecrate the ſame. Whereunto the Pope willingly conſented, and for more magnificence of the Cittie, the Temple, and the Pope, a Tarrace was made, from <hi>Santa Maria Nouella,</hi> where the Pope lay, vnto the Church which he ſhould conſecrate, the ſame being inbredth foure yards, and in height three, and of both ſides it was coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with exceeding rich cloth. Vpon this Tarrace, only the Pope with his Court, and the Cittizens eſpecially appointed to attend him did go. All the reſt of the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and people ſtood in the ſtreets, in their houſes, and in the Temple, to behold the ſame. When all ceremonies belonging to ſo great a conſecration, were fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the Pope, in token of more loue, honored <hi>Guiliano de Auanzati</hi> with Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, being at that preſent <hi>Gonfaloniere de Iuſtitia,</hi> and in al times accounted a noble &amp;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14349:69"/>
notable Cittizen, whereunto the <hi>Senate,</hi> to ſeeme no leſſe deſirous then the Pope of his aduancement, gaue vnto him the Captaineſhip of <hi>Piſa</hi> for one yeare. About this time, ſome difference grew betwixt the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the diuine Seruice. And foraſmuch as in the laſt Councell holden at <hi>Baſile,</hi> much had bene ſayd in that matter by the Prelates of the Weſt Church, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Emperours, that great diligence ſhould be vſed to vnite them, and was concluded in the Councell of <hi>Baſile,</hi> that proofe ſhould be made whether the <hi>Gretian</hi> Church might be brought to concurre with that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Albeit this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was contrarie to the maieſtie of the <hi>Gretian</hi> Emperour, and the pride of his Prelates to yeeld vnto the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the Emperour being oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Turkes, and fearing that the <hi>Gretians</hi> could not be defended by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the rather alſo to liue in ſecuritie, and be ayded of others, determined to giue place. Then the Emperour accompanied with the Patriarke, the Prelates and Barons of <hi>Greece,</hi> according to the order taken by the Councell of <hi>Baſile,</hi> came vnto <hi>Venice.</hi> Which Cittie being infected with the plague, it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that the matter ſhould be tried in the Cittie of <hi>Florence.</hi> After many dayes of diſputation,<note place="margin">The Gretian Church ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to the Church of Rome.</note> betwixt the Prelates of the <hi>Romane</hi> and <hi>Gretian</hi> Churches, the <hi>Gretians</hi> ſubmitted themſelues to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then was the peace concluded betwixt the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> and the <hi>Florentines.</hi> And was alſo hoped, that the warres betwixt the Duke and the Earle (chiefely in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Toſcana</hi>) might eaſily be pacified, becauſe that warre which was begunne in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples,</hi> betwixt <hi>Rinato de Angio,</hi> and <hi>Alfonſo</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſhould of force take end by the ruine of thoſe two. And although the Pope was euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented for the loſſe of many his Townes, and that therewithall, the great am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Duke and the <hi>Venetians</hi> was apparant, yet euery man ſuppoſed, that the Pope for neceſsitie, and the others for wearineſſe, would lay downe their armes. But the matter came otherwiſe to paſſe, for neither the Duke, nor the <hi>Venetians,</hi> would be quiet. By reaſon whereof, it fell out that they tooke Armes anew,<note place="margin">New troubles in Lombardy and Toſcana.</note> and made warre in the moſt places of <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Toſcana.</hi> The great minde of the Duke, could not endure that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould poſſeſſe <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo</hi> and <hi>Breſcia:</hi> And the rather, ſeeing them prepared for the warres, and euery day moleſting and diſquieting his Countrey. He therefore thought, that if they might be abandoned by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the Earle, he ſhould not onely bridle them, but alſo recouer his owne. To compaſſe that conceipt, he intended to take <hi>Romagna</hi> from the Church, iudging that afterwards the Pope could not offend him. And the <hi>Florentines,</hi> ſeeing the fire at hand, either they would not ſtirre for feare, or if they did, they could not conueniently aſſault him. The Duke alſo knewe the diſpleaſure betwixt the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Lucca,</hi> and for that cauſe, ſuppoſed the <hi>Florentines</hi> were the leſſe willing to take Armes for them. As for the Earle <hi>Franceſco,</hi> he thought that the newe friendſhip, and hope of the marriage, ſhould ſuffice to hold him aſſured. Alſo, to flie all offence, and giue the leſſe occaſion to all others to take Armes, and chiefely, for that he was bound by the Capitulations with the Earle, not to aſſault <hi>Romagna,</hi> he cauſed <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> (as thereto moued by his owne ambition) to take that enterpriſe in hand. At ſuch time as the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded betwixt the Duke and the Earle, <hi>Nicholo</hi> remained in <hi>Romagna,</hi> and ſeemed much diſcontent with that new friendſhip made between the ſayd Duke and the Earle his perpetuall enemy. He therefore with his ſouldiers retired to <hi>Camurata</hi> (a place betwixt <hi>Furli</hi> and <hi>Rauenna</hi>) where he fortified himſelfe to remaine, till ſuch time as ſome other reſolution were taken. The fame of his anger being blowne about euery where,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14349:69"/>
               <hi>Nicholo</hi> gaue the Pope to vnderſtand of his well deſeruing of the Duke, and with what ingratitude he was requited. He alſo alleaged, that the Duke through the helpe of principall Captaines, had wonne all the ſouldiers of <hi>Italy</hi> to be at his commaundement. Notwithſtanding, if his holineſſe were ſo pleaſed, he could procure, that of theſe two Captaines, the one ſhould prooue enemy to the Duke, and the other improfitable. For accompliſhment whereof, if money were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and the warres continued, he would ſo aſſault the Earle, who had ſurprized the townes belonging to the Church, as he ſhould haue ynough to defend his owne, and not be able to follow the ambition of <hi>Philippo.</hi> The Pope gaue credit to theſe words, ſeeming to him reaſonable, and ſent vnto <hi>Nicholo</hi> fiue thouſand Duckets, with many faire promiſes, offering to giue lands to him, and his ſonnes. And although the Pope were diuerſe wayes aduertiſed of this deceipt, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued well, and was not content to heare any thing to the contrarie. The Cittie of <hi>Rauenna</hi> was then gouerned for the Pope by <hi>Octacio de Polenta. Nicholo</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good, not to deferre his enterpriſe (becauſe his ſonne had alreadie with the ignomie of the Pope ſacked <hi>Spoletto</hi>) determined to aſſault <hi>Rauenna:</hi> (either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he iudged the enterpriſe eaſie, or that he had ſome ſecret intelligence with <hi>Octacio</hi>) within few dayes he tooke the Towne by compoſition, and ſhortly after <hi>Bologna, Imola,</hi> and <hi>Furli,</hi> were by him ſurprized.<note place="margin">The Popes countrey ſpoyled by Ni. Piccinino.</note> Alſo (as a thing more meruailous) of twentie Caſtles which were in thoſe countries holden for the Pope, there was not one that refuſed to yeeld vnto <hi>Nicholo.</hi> Neither did it ſuffice him with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to offend the Pope, but he would alſo to theſe deeds mock and deride him in words: Writing vnto the Pope, that vpon iuſt cauſe his Townes were ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, becauſe he had broken the friendſhip betwixt the Duke and him: and written letters to many places of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſignifying, that he (the Earle) had abandoned the Duke, and ioyned with the <hi>Venetians. Nicholo</hi> thus poſſeſsing <hi>Romagna,</hi> left the ſame in charge to his ſonne <hi>Franceſco,</hi> and himſelfe with the greater part of his army went into <hi>Lombardy.</hi> Where ioyning with the remaine of the Dukes forces, he aſſayled the Countrey of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> which in ſhort ſpace he tooke, and beſieged the Cittie. The Duke, who deſired that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould be left for him as a pray, excuſed himſelfe to the Pope, to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and to the Earle: declaring, that thoſe things which had bene done in <hi>Romagna</hi> by <hi>Nicholo,</hi> if they were contrarie to the Capitulations, they were likewiſe contrarie to his will. Moreouer, by ſecret meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers he gaue them to vnderſtand, that for his diſobedience (as occaſion and time ſhould ſuffer) he would finde meanes to haue him puniſhed. The <hi>Florentines</hi> and the Earle gaue no credit thereunto, but beleeued (as in deede the truth was) that theſe warres were made to hold them occupied, till ſuch time as he might oppreſſe the <hi>Venetians:</hi> who, being full of pride, and beleeuing they could by themſelues reſiſt the Dukes forces, did not vouchſafe to demaund aid of any man,<note place="margin">Gatamelata Generall for the Venetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> but with <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melata</hi> their Captaine, made warre alone. The Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> with the fauour of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> intended to haue gone to the aide of King <hi>Rinato,</hi> if the accidents of <hi>Romagna</hi> and <hi>Lombardy</hi> had not withholden him. And the <hi>Florentines</hi> would alſo willingly haue fauoured that enterpriſe, for the auncient friendſhip betweene them, and the houſe of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> But the one and the other of thoſe, being occupied in the warres neere at hand, refrained to attempt any enterpriſe further off. The <hi>Florentines</hi> then ſeeing <hi>Romagna</hi> ſurprized by the Dukes forces, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted (as thoſe that by the ruine of others did feare their owne) deſired the Earle to come into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> there to conſider what was to be done to encounter the forces of the Duke, which were greater then euer they had bene. Affirming, that if his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie were not by ſome meanes bridled, euery man that gouerned any part of <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:14349:70"/>
ſhould within ſhort ſpace be oppreſſed. The Earle knew well that the <hi>Florentines</hi> had reaſon to feare. Notwithſtanding, the deſire he had to proceed in the marriage with the Dukes daughter, did make him ſuſpected. And the Duke knowing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, gaue him great hope thereof, if he would refuſe to take armes againſt him. And becauſe the Dukes daughter was alreadie marriageable, the matter was brought to this ripeneſſe, that all things for the purpoſe were prepared. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, with diuerſe cauillations, the marriage day was delayed, yet by words to hold the Earle in hope, ſome deeds were performed: and to that end thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand Florins (according to the Articles agreed vpon for the marriage) were ſent vnto him, notwithſtanding the warre of <hi>Lombardy</hi> increaſed, and the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> euery day loſt ſome Towne or other. Alſo, all the veſſels for the warres, which they ſent into the Riuers, were by the Dukes Souldiers taken. The Countries of <hi>Verona,</hi> and <hi>Breſcia,</hi> were all ſpoiled: and both thoſe Citties ſo ſtraightly beſieged, as in the common opinion, it was hard for them to be many dayes defended. The Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> who had bene many yeares Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall for that State, beyond all expectation had abandoned them, and was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Duke, ſo as that which in the beginning of the warres their pride ſuffered not, afterwards feare inforced them to do. For knowing none other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie but the friendſhip of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the Earle, they began to ſpeake them faire, though ſhamefully, and with ſuſpition, bicauſe they feared leaſt the <hi>Florentines</hi> would make them the ſame anſwere, which they at the enterpriſe of <hi>Lucca,</hi> and in the Earles cauſe had receiued at their hands. Neuertheleſſe, they found the <hi>Florentines</hi> more eaſily intreated, then either they hoped, or their deſerts did merit. For greater was the <hi>Florentines</hi> hate to a friend become a foe, then the diſpleaſure they bare to an old and auncient enemy.<note place="margin">Perſwaſions of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines to the Earle not to abandon them.</note> They hauing long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowne the neceſsitie whereunto the <hi>Venetians</hi> would fall, declared to the Earle, that their ruine woulde be alſo his: and that hee deceiued himſelfe, if hee beleeued the Duke <hi>Philippo</hi> woulde eſteeme him ſo much in his good, as his euill fortune. For the occaſion why the Duke offered his daughter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, was the feare wherein he ſtood: and ſith things promiſed by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, are neuer performed without neceſsitie, it behoued him ſtill to hold the Duke diſtreſſed, which without the greatneſſe of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> could not be done. Therefore, hee ought to thinke, that if the <hi>Venetians</hi> were forced to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon their Countrey vppon the firme land, he ſhould not onely want thoſe commodities which he receiued by them, but alſo all others, which of other men for feare of them he might attaine vnto. And if hee conſidered well the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtates of <hi>Italy,</hi> he ſhould finde ſome of them poore, and ſome others his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Neither were the <hi>Florentines</hi> alone (as hee had often ſayd) of force ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to mainteine him. So as, on euery ſide it appeared, that for him it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, to mainteine the <hi>Venetians</hi> mightie vppon the land. Theſe perſwaſions ioyned with the hate which the Earle had conceiued of the Duke, for being moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the marriage, cauſed him conſent to the compoſition, yet would hee not at that time be bound to paſſe the Riuer of <hi>Po.</hi> Theſe compoſitions were made in the moneth of February, the yeare 1438. Wherein, the <hi>Venetians</hi> did couenaunt to defraie two thirds, and the <hi>Florentines</hi> one third of the charge. And both of them togither at their common charge, entred obligation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the lands which the Earle had woon in <hi>La Marca.</hi> Neither was this League contented with theſe forces, but vnto them they ioyned the Lord of <hi>Faenza,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Pandolfo Malatesta</hi> of <hi>Rimini,</hi> and <hi>Pietro Giampagolo Orſino.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with great promiſes they had perſwaded the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua,</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:14349:70"/>
yet could they not remoue him from the friendſhip and paie of the Duke. Alſo the Lord of <hi>Faenza,</hi> after that the League was ſetled, finding a better bargaine, reuolted to the Duke, which depriued the League of hope, to be able to performe the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes entended in <hi>Romagna.</hi> In theſe dayes, <hi>Lombardy</hi> remained thus troubled, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcia</hi> was beſieged with the Dukes forces, ſo ſtraightly as euerie day was feared that for famine it ſhould be forced to yeeld. And <hi>Verona</hi> became ſo inuironed with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that it doubted the like end, and if any of theſe two Cities were loſt, euery man iudged all the other preparation for the wars would be to no effect, and the charges till that time made, vtterly loſt. Neither was there found any other certaine remedy, then to procure, that the Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> might paſſe into <hi>Lombardy:</hi> Wherein were three difficulties, the one in perſwading the Earle to paſſe the Riuer of <hi>Po,</hi> and make warre in all places. The ſecond, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſeemed to be at the diſcretion of the Duke, if the Earle ſhould goe from them. The third was, what way the Earle with his forces ſhould take, to conuey himſelfe into the country of <hi>Padoa,</hi> where the reſt of the <hi>Venetians</hi> forces remained. Of theſe three difficulties, the ſecond which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteined to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> was moſt to be doubted. Notwithſtanding they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſitie, and being weary of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who with all importunitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Earle, (ſaying that without him, they ſhould be abandoned) they preferred the neceſſitie of others before the ſuſpition of themſelues. There remained alſo one other doubt, which way they ſhould go, and how the ſame might be made aſſured by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Moreouer, becauſe the handling of this contract with the Earle, and the perſwading him to paſſe the Riuer <hi>Po,</hi> was appointed to <hi>Neri,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Gino Capponi,</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> thought good to ſend him expreſly to <hi>Venice,</hi> to make that fauoure the more acceptable there, and to take order for the way, and ſafe paſſage of the Earle. Then was <hi>Neri</hi> diſpatched from <hi>Ceſena,</hi> and in a Boate conueyed to <hi>Venice:</hi> where, by the <hi>Senate</hi> hee was receiued with more honour, then euer any Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time had bene. For vpon his comming, and that which by him ſhould be determined, they thought the welfare of their dominion depended. <hi>Neri</hi> then being brought to preſence of the <hi>Senate,</hi> ſpake as followeth. Moſt Noble Prince,<note place="margin">The Oration of Neri Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni, to the Senate of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</note> my Lords who haue ſent mee, were hitherto euer of opinion, that the greatneſſe of the Duke, would be the ruine both of this ſtate and of their own Common-weale. So that, the well doing of theſe ſtates, muſt be your greatneſſe, and ours alſo. If this had bene by your Lordſhips beleeued, we ſhould be now in better condition, and your ſtate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured from thoſe perils, which preſently do threaten it. But becauſe that in time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, you haue neither giuen vs ayd, nor countenance, we could not readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure remedie for your harmes, nor you, ſpeedily demaund it: as men which both in aduerſitie and proſperitie knew not how to behaue your ſelues; forgetting that we are of ſuch diſpoſition, as whom we once loue, we will loue euer; and whom we hate, we will hate euer. The good will which we haue euer borne to this moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Senate,</hi> your ſelues do know, and haue oftentimes ſeene, by the aide we haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you both in mony and men. The diſpleaſure which we haue borne to <hi>Philippo,</hi> is ſuch, as we will alwaies beare towards his houſe, and ſo the world knoweth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it poſsible that auncient hatred, can be either by new deſertes or new diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures cancelled. We were and are aſſured, that in this war, we might with great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour haue ſtood indifferent to the Duke, and with no great daunger to our ſelues. For though he had bene by your ruine become Lord of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> yet had there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſo much force in <hi>Italy,</hi> as we need not to haue diſpaired of our well doing, becauſe he encreaſing in ſtate and power, the enmitie, &amp; enuie towards him would haue alſo encreaſed. Of which two things, warre and diſpleaſure be engendred. We knew alſo how great charges by eſchuing this war, we ſhould haue auoyded, how
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14349:71"/>
eminent perils we ſhould haue eſcaped: and how this warre, by our meanes might be remoued from <hi>Lombardy</hi> into <hi>Toſcana.</hi> Notwithſtanding all theſe ſuſpitions haue bene, by our auncient affection borne to your ſtate, cancelled: and we haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to aide you, with the ſame readie good will, wherewith we will defend our own, if the ſame ſhould be aſſaulted. Wherfore my Lords, iudging it before all other things moſt neceſſarie, to ſuccour <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and thinking alſo that without the Earle the ſame could not be, they haue ſent me hither, firſt to perſwade him to come into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and make war in all places: he being heretofore (as you know) bound not to paſſe the Riuer of <hi>Po.</hi> Therefore I vſed with him thoſe reaſons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we our ſelues be moued. And he, (as he ſeemeth) by Armes inuincible, wil not be ouercome with curteſie. And that liberallitie which he ſawe vs vſe towards you, he hath bene pleaſed to ſurpaſſe the ſame. For knowing well in how great perils, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his departure, <hi>Toſcana</hi> remained, and ſeeing that we haue more regarded your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, then our owne well doing; is alſo content to preferre the ſame, before his owne. I am therfore now come here, to offer you the Earle with ſeuen thouſand horſe, and two thouſand foote men; readie to aſſault the enemie in what place ſoeuer he may finde him. I beſeech you then, (and my Lords alſo do intreate you) that as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his ſouldiers is greater then his obligation, wherby he bound himſelf to ſerue, ſo it may pleaſe you, that your liberallitie towards him may be likewiſe enlarged. To the end, that neither he ſhall repent his comming to your ſeruice, nor we be ſorie to haue perſwaded him thereunto. This ſpeech pronounced by <hi>Neri,</hi> was with no leſſe attention heard of the <hi>Senate,</hi> then if from the mouth of ſome Oracle, the ſame had proceeded. For by his words all the audience was ſo mooued, that they would not ſuffer the Prince (as is the cuſtome) to make any anſwere: But euerie man ſtood vp, and many of them weeping for ioy, held vp their hands, thanking the <hi>Florentines</hi> for ſo friendly an offer, and him, for hauing with ſo great diligence and ſpeede perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſame. Promiſing moreouer, neuer to forget that fauoure, nor that any time, either in themſelues or in their poſterie, ſhould cancell the memorie of this merite. And that their Common-weale, ſhould be as much at the <hi>Florentines</hi> commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as their owne. Theſe curteſies and congratulations ended, they conſulted what way the Earle might martch, to the end, that the bridges and paſſages ſhould be prepared. Foure waies were then thought vpon whereby he might paſſe. The one from <hi>Rauenna,</hi> by the ſea ſide: which being narrow and full of mariſhes, was not liked. An other was by the direct way, which being impeached by a Fortreſſe called <hi>Vccellino,</hi> kept for the Duke, the ſame ought to be ſurprized before the Armie ſhould march further; which was heard to do in ſo ſhort a time, vnleſſe the occaſion of the enterpriſe were omitted, the ſame requiring great diligence and ſpeede. The third was by the wood of <hi>Lago,</hi> where becauſe the Riuer of <hi>Po</hi> was ouerflowed, to paſſe that way, ſeemed not onely hard, but alſo impoſsible. The fourth was by the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of <hi>Bologna,</hi> from thence to <hi>Ponte Pulidrano,</hi> to <hi>Cento,</hi> through <hi>Finale,</hi> and <hi>Bonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Farrara:</hi> From whence by water and land, they might be conueyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Padouana,</hi> there to ioyne with the <hi>Venetian</hi> forces. In this way, albeit there was manie difficulties, and might by the enemie, in ſome places be impeached: yet was it thought the beſt of all others. Whereof the Earle aduertiſed, with great ſpeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his iourney, and on the twentith of Iune, arriued in <hi>Padouana.</hi> The comming of this Captaine into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> made <hi>Venice,</hi> and all the countrie thereto belonging, in great hope. For as they ſeemed before to diſpaire, now they began to hope, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hold their owne, but alſo to win from others. The Earle firſt of all went to the reſcue of <hi>Verona,</hi> and the rather to meete with <hi>Nicholo,</hi> and his Armie he marched to <hi>Soaue,</hi> a Caſtle builded betwixt <hi>Vicentino</hi> &amp; <hi>Veroneſi,</hi> and inuironed by a diche: which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14349:71"/>
reached from <hi>Soaue</hi> to the mariſh of <hi>Adice.</hi> The Earle ſeeing his paſſage by the plaine ſtopped, thought to paſſe by the mountaines, and by that way to come neare to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi>; Suppoſing <hi>Nicholo</hi> did not thinke, that he would take that way being vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant &amp; mountanous: or if he did, he could not in time come thither to impeach him. Wherefore being prouided of victuals for eight daies, hee and his men paſſed the mountaine and arriued vnder <hi>Soaue,</hi> in the plaine. Where, albeit ſome bulwarks had bene made by <hi>Nicholo,</hi> yet were they not ſuch as ſtaied his paſſage. <hi>Nicholo</hi> then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemie aboue his expectation come thither, fearing to fight vpon diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, retired himſelfe on the other ſide of <hi>Adice:</hi> and the Earle without anie obſtacle, entred into <hi>Verona.</hi> Thus the Earle hauing performed the firſt enterpriſe, which was to remoue the ſiege, the ſecond yet remained, to reſcue <hi>Breſcia.</hi> This Citie is ſo ſeated vpon the riuer of <hi>Garda,</hi> the ſcite wherof is ſuch, that though it be beſieged by land, yet may it be victualled by water: which was the cauſe, why the Duke put ſo great forces vpon that Lage, and in the beginning of his victories, had ſurprized all thoſe townes which by the Lage could relieue <hi>Breſcia.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> had alſo Gallies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Lage, but they were not of power inough to fight with the Dukes forces. The Earle therefore thought fit with ſome more ſouldiers to ſtrengthen the Nauie, and win thoſe townes which with held the vittails from <hi>Breſcia.</hi> He therfore brought his Campe before <hi>Bandolino,</hi> a Caſtle vpon the Lage, hoping if that were wonne, the reſt would preſently yeeld. In that enterpriſe fortune disfauoured the Earle, for the greateſt number of his men fell ſicke: ſo as, leauing the enterpriſe, hee went vnto <hi>Zeno,</hi> a caſtle belonging to <hi>Verona,</hi> where the country is plentiful, &amp; the aire whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. <hi>Nicholo</hi> ſeeing the Earle retired: not to omit occaſion to poſſeſſe himſelfe of the Lage, left his Campe at <hi>Vegatio,</hi> and with ſome choiſe men went vnto the Lage. There, with great furie, he aſſaulted the <hi>Venetian</hi> Armie, &amp; tooke welneare all their Gallies. After this victory, almoſt al the Caſtles vpon the Lage, yeelded vnto <hi>Nicholo.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> diſmaid at this his loſſe, and fearing therby, that they of <hi>Breſcia</hi> would yeeld alſo, ſollicited the Earle, both by Letters and Meſſengers, to make ſpeed to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour it. But the Earle ſeeing that by the Lage there was no hope to relieue it, &amp; by land it was impoſsible, by reaſon of ditches, bulwarkes, and trenches, made by <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholo,</hi> ſo as, whoſoeuer ſhould enter, muſt go to preſent deſtruction; determined to proue the way of the mountains: wherby, as he had before ſaued <hi>Verona,</hi> ſo he hoped perhaps to reſcue <hi>Breſcia.</hi> The Earle for the atchiuing thereof, departed from <hi>Zeno,</hi> and by the <hi>Vale</hi> of <hi>Acrine,</hi> marched to the Lage of S. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and came to <hi>Torboli,</hi> and <hi>Penda,</hi> vpon the Lage of <hi>Garda.</hi> From thence he went to <hi>Tenna,</hi> and there pitched his Campe: becauſe, to paſſe from thence to <hi>Breſcia,</hi> it behooued him to ſurpriſe that Caſtle. <hi>Nicholo</hi> vnderſtanding the intent of the Earle, brought his Armie to <hi>Piſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra:</hi> and after with the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and ſome of his owne choiſe ſouldiers, marched towards the Earle, and fighting togither, <hi>Nicholo</hi> was ouerthrowne.<note place="margin">The Campe of Nicholo Piccinino de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</note> Some part of his men were taken priſoners, an other part, retired to the Armie, &amp; the third part, fled to the Nauie. <hi>Nicholo</hi> then, retired himſelfe into <hi>Tenna,</hi> and the night being come, imagined he could not eſcape from thence, if he tarried til the next day. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to eſchue that perill certaine, he aduentured a daunger doubtfull. <hi>Nicholo</hi> had amongſt many his ſeruants one <hi>Almaine,</hi> a man of great ſtrength, and to him aboue others, euer moſt faithfull. <hi>Nicholo</hi> perſwaded this man, that if hee would put him into a ſacke, he might vpon his ſhoulders (as though he were ſome other thing) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him to ſome place, from whence he might eſcape. At this time the Campe yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained about <hi>Tenna.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, by meanes of the victorie the day before, no great order or watch was taken, ſo that this <hi>Almaine,</hi> the more eaſily might conuey his maiſter. Wherefore taking him vpon his ſhoulders, (as though he were ſome
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14349:72"/>
other burthen, himſelfe being apparelled like a Porter) he paſſed through the Camp without any let, and ſo ſaued his maiſter. This victorie, if it had bene well vſed, as it was happily wonne, had much better releeued <hi>Breſcia:</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> thereby ſhould haue proued more happie. But the ſame being euill vſed, the ioy thereof was the leſſe; and <hi>Breſcia</hi> remained in the ſame diſtreſſe that it was before. For <hi>Nicholo</hi> hauing recouered ſouldiers,<note place="margin">Nicholo Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinino, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his honor.</note> determined with them ſome new victorie, to blot out the diſhonour of the late loſſe, and take from the <hi>Venetians</hi> the meane whereby they ſhould reſcue <hi>Breſcia.</hi> He hauing intelligence from ſome priſoners taken in that war, that the <hi>Cittadell</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> was weakely manned and guarded; ſo as, eaſily it might be ſurprized: thought that Fortune thereby had offered an occaſion to recouer his honour; and that the new ioy of his enemie, for the late victorie, ſhould now for a later loſſe, be conuerted into ſorrow. The Citie of <hi>Verona</hi> is in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> ſeated at the foote of thoſe mountaines which diuide <hi>Italy</hi> from <hi>Germany:</hi> and is ſo builded, as it partaketh both of the mountaines and the plaine. The Riuer of <hi>Adice</hi> ſpringeth out of the <hi>Vale</hi> of <hi>Trento,</hi> and in the courſe thereof to <hi>Italy,</hi> it deſcendeth not ſtraight into the plaine, but turneth on the left hand, and paſſeth by the midſt of that Cittie. Yet the one part of the Citie towards the plaine, is greater then the other part towardes the mountaines. Vpon theſe be built two Fortreſſes, the one called S. <hi>Piero,</hi> and the other S. <hi>Felice</hi>; which ſeeme more ſtrong by nature of the ſeate, then the thickneſſe of the wall. For being ſet high, they commaund the whole Citie. In the plain on this ſide the <hi>Adice,</hi> are ioyning to the wall of the towne, two other Fortreſſes, the one diſtant from the other a thouſand paces, one of them is named the newe <hi>Cittadella,</hi> and the other the old <hi>Cittadella.</hi> From the one of theſe within, there paſſeth a wall to the other, and is in reſpect of the compaſſe, as it were a ſtring to a bowe. All this ſpace betwixt the one wall and the other is inhabited, and called <hi>Borgo di San Zeno.</hi> Theſe Fortreſſes, and this <hi>Borgo, Nicholo Piccinino</hi> intended to ſurprize, thinking the ſame eaſie, as well for the negligence of the guard therin, as the ſmall care had thereof, by meanes of the late victory. For he knew well, that in the warre there is no enterpriſe ſo eaſily performed, as is that, which the enemie feareth not. Hee therefore making choyſe of his men, being acquainted with the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> in the night marched to <hi>Verona,</hi> and not being there looked for, ſcaled the walles, and wanne the new <hi>Cittadell.</hi> From thence he ſent his men into the towne, who brake the gate of S. <hi>Antonio</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereby all his horſemen entred. Thoſe that for the <hi>Venetians</hi> kept the old <hi>Cittadell,</hi> hearing firſt a noyſe when the guard of the firſt <hi>Cittadell</hi> was ſlaine, and after when the gates were broken open: knew well that enemies were come, made Alarum, rung Belles, and ſtirred vp the people. Whereof the Citizens taking know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, came out in a confuſed ſort: thoſe that were of moſt courage, tooke Armes and went vnto the Pallace of the <hi>Rettore.</hi> In the meane while, <hi>Nicholo</hi> had ſacked <hi>Borgo</hi> of S. <hi>Zeno.</hi> Then going forward, the Citizens knowing that the Dukes ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were within the towne, and ſeeing no way to reſiſt them, perſwaded the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Rettore</hi> to flee to the Fortreſſe, thereby to ſaue their perſons, and the towne: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was better to preſerue their liues, and the riches of the citie, till a time more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; then for the encountring of the preſent furie, to die themſelues, and vtterly impoueriſh the citie.<note place="margin">Verona ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholo Picci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino.</note> Then the <hi>Rettore,</hi> and all other <hi>Venetians</hi> whatſoeuer, fled into the Fortreſſe of S. <hi>Felice.</hi> Which done, many of the chiefe Citizens came to <hi>Nicholo</hi> and to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> beſeeching, that it would pleaſe them, to take that citie with honour, as it was rich, rather then with their ſhame, to ſuffer it to be made poore and ſpoyled. And the rather, becauſe they had neither deſerued well of their chiefe Lords, nor in defence of the town merited any mallice of <hi>Nicholo</hi> or the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe. Then were they, both by <hi>Nicholo</hi> &amp; the Marqueſſe comforted, and (as much

as in furie of the warre might poſsibly be) defended from the ſpoyle. <hi>Nicholo</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aſſuredly, that the Earle would come to recouer the Towne, laboured by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meane to get into his hands all the ſtrong places; and thoſe which hee could not get, with trenches and ditches were diuided from the Towne: to the end, that the enemie ſhould paſſe in with more difficultie. The Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> was with his men at <hi>Tenna,</hi> and hearing thoſe newes, at the firſt thought the ſame vntrue, but after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better aduertiſed of the troth, thought good by ſpeedie proceeding, to amend his former negligence. And albeit his chiefe Captaines of the Campe, did counſell him to leaue the enterpriſe of <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and go to <hi>Vicenza,</hi> for not being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged of the enemie during his aboad there; yet would hee not be perſwaded by them, but in any wiſe trie his fortune to recouer that cittie: and in the midſt of theſe doubtfull imaginations, promiſed the <hi>Proueditore</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Barnardo de Medici,</hi> the <hi>Florentine</hi> Generall, certeinly to recouer the citie, if any of the Fortreſſes did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vntaken till he came thither. Then giuing order for his iourney, he with his ſouldiers in great haſte marched towards <hi>Verona.</hi> Whom, <hi>Nicholo</hi> ſeeing, thought good, as he had bene counſelled by his Captaines, to go to <hi>Vicenza.</hi> Yet finding that the enemies marched towards the Towne, directing their courſe to S. <hi>Felice,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to defend that Fort: but all too late, becauſe the trenches about the Caſtle were not finiſhed, and the ſouldiers (for couetouſneſſe of the ſpoyle) were diuided among themſelues, ſo that he could not come thither ſoone inough. For the Earles ſouldiers had before approached the Fortreſſe,<note place="margin">Verona reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the Earle Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco.</note> and from thence with good ſucceſſe and diſhonour of <hi>Nicholo,</hi> recouered the citie. Who togither with the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua</hi> fled firſt to the <hi>Cittadell,</hi> and from thence, to <hi>Mantoua.</hi> Where aſſembling the remaine of their ſaued ſouldiers, they ioyned with the others, that beſieged <hi>Breſcia.</hi> Thus was <hi>Verona</hi> in foure daies by the Dukes Army, both wonne and loſt. The Earle after this victorie (being at that time winter, and the cold great) had with much difficultie victualled <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and went to remain in <hi>Verona:</hi> giuing order, that certaine Gallies ſhould tarry that winter at <hi>Torbali,</hi> to the end, that at the ſpring of the next yeare, he might be ſtrong both by ſea and land for the reſcue of <hi>Breſcia.</hi> The Duke ſeeing the warre for that time ſtaied, and his hope to ſurpriſe <hi>Verona</hi> &amp; <hi>Breſcia</hi> remooued, wherof the Councell, and the money of the <hi>Florentines</hi> was the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that they could not be altered from the loue of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for any iniurie they had receiued of them, nor for any promiſe he could make them; determined (to the end they ſhould ſhortly reape fruite of thoſe ſeedes they had ſowne) to aſſault <hi>Toſcana:</hi> being therto encouraged by the baniſhed men of <hi>Florence,</hi> and by <hi>Nicholo. Nicholo</hi> was thereto moued with the deſire he had to winne the poſſeſsions of <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> and driue the Earle out of <hi>La Marca.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke perſwaded by Nicholo and the baniſhed Florentines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to aſſault To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcana.</note> And the <hi>Florentines</hi> deſired to returne to their Country. So either of theſe, with reaſons according to their owne deſire, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Duke. <hi>Nicholo</hi> tolde him, that himſelfe might be ſent into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and <hi>Breſcia</hi> might neuertheleſſe be ſtill beſieged; for the Duke was Lorde of the Lage, and had the ſtrong places belonging to the Towne well furniſhed: the Captaines there remaining, and men inough to encounter the Earle whenſoeuer he ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any other enterpriſe; which without the reſcue of <hi>Breſcia</hi> hee could not, and to reſcue it, was impoſsible. So that he might make war in <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and yet not leaue the enterpriſe in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> Hee told him moreouer, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> were enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo ſoone as he came into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> to reuoke the Earle, or elſe loſe it: ſo that if any of theſe two things came to paſſe, the victorie would follow. The baniſhed men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that if <hi>Nicholo</hi> with his Army did drawe neare to <hi>Florence,</hi> it was impoſsible but that the people (being wearie of charges, and the inſolency of the great men) would take Armes againſt the Gouernours. They ſhewed alſo how eaſie it was to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14349:73"/>
approach <hi>Florence,</hi> promiſing to make the way open through <hi>Caſentino,</hi> by meanes of the friendſhip which <hi>Rinaldo</hi> had with that Earle. Thus the Duke, firſt diſpoſed of himſelfe, and after confirmed by perſwaſions of theſe men, reſolued vpon this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. The <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other part, notwithſtanding the bitterneſſe of the winter, failed not to call vpon the Earle with all his forces to ſuccor <hi>Breſcia.</hi> Which the Earle anſwered could not be in that time done, but of force it muſt tarrie the ſpring of the yeare: and in the mean time prepare an Army by water, ſo as both by water and land it might at time conuenient be releeued. Hereupon the <hi>Venetians</hi> became ſorie and ſlow in all their prouiſions, which was the cauſe that in their Army many people died. Of all theſe things the <hi>Florentines</hi> being aduertiſed, began to miſtruſt: ſeeing the warre at hand, and no great good done in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> The ſuſpition alſo which they had of the Popes ſouldiers, did greatly perplex them: not becauſe the Pope was their enemie, but for that they ſawe thoſe ſouldiers more obedient to the Patriarke, their mortall foe, more then to the Pope himſelfe. <hi>Giouanni Vittelleſchi Cornetano,</hi> was firſt Notarie Apoſtolicall,<note place="margin">The Patriarke of Aleſſandria Generall for the Pope.</note> after Biſhop of <hi>Ricanati,</hi> then Patriark of <hi>Aleſſandria,</hi> and at length after all theſe dignities, become Cardinall, &amp; was called the Cardinall of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> This Cardinall being a man both couragious and craftie, &amp; ſuch a one, as was by the Pope ſo greatly beloued, as thereby he became Generall of all the forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church: and was Captaine in all enterpriſes that the Pope tooke in hand, either in <hi>Toſcana, Romagna,</hi> the Kingdome, or the Citie of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereby he wonne ſuch reputation among the people, and ſo great authoritie vnder the Pope, that the Pope himſelfe ſtood in doubt how to commaund him, and the people did onely obey him, and no other. At ſuch time as the newes came, that <hi>Nicholo</hi> would paſſe into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> this Cardinall with his company happened to be at <hi>Rome:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Florentines</hi> feare was doubled, becauſe that Cardinall after the baniſhment of <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> had euer bene enemie to <hi>Florence:</hi> for that the pacification among the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Florence</hi> made by his meanes, were not obſerued, but all things done to the preiudice of <hi>Rinaldo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pa. friend to Rinaldo de Albizi.</note> who had bene the occaſion that Armes were laid down, which gaue his enemies good means to baniſh him. Then the Gouernors of the ſtate, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the time come to reſtore <hi>Rinaldo</hi> of his loſſes, if with <hi>Nicholo</hi> (being come into <hi>Toſcana</hi>) they ioyned their forces: but therof they doubted the more by the vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departure of <hi>Nicholo</hi> from <hi>Lombardy,</hi> who left there an enterpriſe halfe wonne, to begin an other more doubtfull: which he would not do, without ſome new intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ſecret ſubtiltie. Of this their miſtruſt they had enformed the Pope, who knew his owne errour in giuing to an other ouermuch authoritie. But when the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſtood thus doubtfull what to do, Fortune found then a meane, whereby to aſſure the Patriarke. That ſtate, in thoſe times mainteined diligent eſpials, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer what Letters were brought too and fro, and thereby conceiued, if any thing were practiſed to the preiudice thereof. It happened that at <hi>Monte Pulliciano,</hi> ſome Letters were taken, which the Patriarke without conſent of the Pope, wrote vnto <hi>Nicholo Piccinino.</hi> Thoſe Letters by the Generall of the warre, were preſently ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pope; And although they were written in Carects vnuſed, ſo as no certaine ſence could be made of them: yet this obſcuritie, togither with the practiſe of the enemie,<note place="margin">The pope ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to depoſe the Patriarke.</note> bred ſo great ſuſpition in the Pope, as he determined to aſſure himſelfe. The charge of this action he committed to <hi>Antonio Rido</hi> of <hi>Padoua,</hi> being then Captaine of the Caſtle in <hi>Rome. Rido</hi> hauing receiued this Commiſsion, was readie to obey the Popes commandement, aſpecting an opportunitie to performe the ſame. The Patriarke being determined to goe into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and minding the next day to depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> deſired the Captaine <hi>Rido</hi> to attend for him in the morning vpon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Bridge, at ſuch time as hee ſhould paſſe that way. <hi>Antonio Rido</hi> thought then a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14349:73"/>
good occaſion was preſented: and gaue order to his men what to do, tarrying for the comming of the Patriarke, vppon the Bridge, which way of neceſsitie he muſt paſſe, hard by the Caſtle. So ſoone as hee was arriued vppon that part, which vſed to be drawne vp, <hi>Rido</hi> gaue his men a ſigne to drawe the Bridge and ſhut the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke into the Caſtle, which was performed. So as of a Generall to the Armie, the Patriarke was become a priſoner in the Caſtle. The people that followed him, at the firſt murmured, but vnderſtanding the Popes pleaſure,<note place="margin">The Patriarke made priſoner</note> pacified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The Captaine did comfort him with curteous wordes, and perſwaded him to hope well. To whome the Patriarke aunſwered, that great perſonages were not wont firſt to be apprehended, and after ſet at libertie. For thoſe that deſerue impriſonment, did not merite to bee enlarged, and ſo ſhortly after died in priſon. After his death, the Pope appointed Generall of his Armie, <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uico</hi> Patriarke of <hi>Aquilea.</hi> Who albeit before that time would not intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the warre, betwixt the League and the Duke; yet was then content to take the ſame in hande: promiſing to be readie to defende <hi>Toſcana</hi> with foure thouſande Horſe, and two thouſande footemen. The <hi>Florentines</hi> deliuered of this feare, ſtood yet in doubt of <hi>Nicholo,</hi> and miſtruſted the confuſion of matters in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> by reaſon of the diuerſitie of opinions betwixt the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Earle. Wherefore, to bee more fullie aduertiſed, of their mindes, they ſent <hi>Neri</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Gino Capponi,</hi> and <hi>Guiliano de Auanzati,</hi> to <hi>Venice.</hi> Whom they gaue in Commiſsion, to determine in what ſorte the Warre ſhoulde bee made the next yeare following. Commaunding <hi>Neri,</hi> that ſo ſoone as hee vnderſtoode the mindes and opinions of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> hee ſhoulde goe vnto the Earle, to knowe his; and perſwade him to thoſe thinges, which for the welfare of the League ſhoulde bee thought meete and neceſſarie. Theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours beeing in their iourney not ſo farre as <hi>Farrara,</hi> had intelligence, that <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> with ſixe thouſande horſe was paſſed the <hi>Po.</hi> Which newes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to make the more ſpeede. Being arriued at <hi>Venice,</hi> they found the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> fully determined, that <hi>Breſcia</hi> without any delaie ſhould be reſcued, becauſe, that Cittie, could neither tarry vnreleeued till the next Spring, nor till the Nauie by water were prepared; but ſhould be inforced for want of aide, to yeelde vnto the enemie: which would make the Duke victorious, and occaſion the loſſe of all their ſtate, vpon the firme land. <hi>Neri</hi> therefore went from thence to <hi>Verona,</hi> to heare what the Earle could alledge to the contrary. Who by many reaſons declared, that for the preſent, it were no furtherance, but rather an impeachment of the enterpriſe to march towards <hi>Breſcia.</hi> For, conſidering the ſeaſon of the yeare, and the ſeate of the Cittie, no good could be done, but great diſorder, and to the ſouldiers great trouble would follow thereof. So that, when the Spring ſhould be come, and the ſeaſon fit for the action, the Army muſt be enforced to returne to <hi>Verona,</hi> for prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe things, which the winter had conſumed. By reaſon whereof, all the time fit for warre, ſhould be ſpent in going and returning. There was ſent to <hi>Verona</hi> with the Earle for the conſultation of theſe matters, <hi>Orſato Giustiniani,</hi> and <hi>Giouan Piſani.</hi> With theſe Commiſsioners after much diſputation, it was concluded,<note place="margin">Reſolution of the League, againſt the Duke.</note> that the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> ſhould giue vnto the Earle for the next yeare to come, foureſcore thouſand Duckettes, and to euerie one of his ſouldiers, fortie. And that they ſhould ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the Earle to march with his whole Armie, and aſſault the Duke. To the ende, that hee, for feare of his owne countrey ſhould be forced to reuoke <hi>Nicholo</hi> into <hi>Lombardy.</hi> After which concluſion, the Embaſſadours returned to <hi>Venice. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholo Piccinino</hi> in this meane ſpace proceeded in his iourney, &amp; was arriued at <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna:</hi> where he perſwaded ſo far with the ſonnes of <hi>Pandolpho Malatesta,</hi> that they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14349:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abandoned the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and ioyned with the Duke. Theſe newes were diſpleaſant to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and much more diſpleaſant to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> becauſe they hoped by that way to haue reſiſted <hi>Nicholo.</hi> But ſeeing the <hi>Malatesti</hi> rebelled, they were thereat amazed, and the more, for the feare they had that <hi>Giampagolo Orſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> their Captaine, (who at that time was in the countrey of <hi>Malatesti</hi>) ſhould be defeated, and they ſo diſarmed. Theſe occurrents alſo diſmayed the Earle, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to loſe <hi>La Marca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſpeech of the Earle Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco to the Senate of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</note> if <hi>Nicholo</hi> paſſed into <hi>Toſcana.</hi> And intending to goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reſcue of his owne, came firſt to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he declared vnto the Prince, that his comming into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> was improfitable for the League. Becauſe the warre was euer to be made, where the Armie and Generall of the enemie is, and not where their Townes are, or their priuate Garriſons. For if the Armie bee ouerthrowne the warre is ended: but though the Townes be wonne, and the Armie be left whole, the warres for the moſt part becommeth more liuely. Then hee enformed him, that <hi>La Marca</hi> and <hi>Toſcana</hi> were loſt, if good reſiſtaunce were not made againſt <hi>Nicholo.</hi> Of which loſſe, <hi>Lombardy</hi> had no remedie. Or if it had, hee meaned not to abandon his owne ſubiects and friendes. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come a Lorde into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> hee would not depart thence, as a priuate Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans anſwer to the Earle.</note> Heereunto the Prince aunſwered, it was a thing moſt manifeſt, that if he did goe from <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and with his Armie repaſſe the <hi>Po,</hi> that all their ſtate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the firme land, ſhould be loſt, and that they would not ſpend any more vpon the defence therof. For it were follie, to defend a thing, which by no meane could be holden. And leſſe diſhonour it were to loſe the countries onely, then to loſe the country and their money alſo. But if it ſhould ſo fall out, that theſe things were loſt, it ſhould thereby appeare how greatly it ſtood the <hi>Venetians</hi> vppon, to defende <hi>Toſcana</hi> and <hi>Romagna.</hi> They were therefore altogither contrarie to his opinion, for they beleeued that whoſoeuer were victorious in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> could alſo haue victorie in all other places. And it was eaſie to haue the victorie, becauſe the Duke and his country was become weake by the departure of <hi>Nicholo:</hi> ſo as hee might be oppreſſed, before that either hee could reuoke <hi>Nicholo,</hi> or be prouided of other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. Moreouer, who ſo wiſely conſidereth all things, ſhould ſee, that the Duke had ſent <hi>Nicholo</hi> into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> to no other end, then to remooue the Earle from thoſe enterpriſes, &amp; make that war in other places, which hee now had at home. So that in purſuing him (if before hee found no extreame neceſsitie) hee ſhould execute that which he had in hand, and be owner of his intent. But if the men of warre were ſtill imployed both in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and in <hi>Toſcana,</hi> howſoeuer it came to paſſe, hee ſhould ouerlate finde his ouerſight, and in time ſee that without remedie hee had loſte <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and gained nothing in <hi>Toſcana.</hi> Thus euerie one hauing ſaid and replied according to his opinion,<note place="margin">Reſolution of the Venetians with the Earle Franceſco.</note> it was concluded, that a ſtaie for a fewe dayes ſhould be made, to ſee what effect the agreement betwixt the <hi>Malatesti</hi> and <hi>Nicholo</hi> would bring foorth: and whether the <hi>Florentines</hi> could imploy <hi>Giampagolo:</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope did faithfully deale with the League, as hee had promiſed. This concluſion made, ſhortly after they were aduertiſed, that the <hi>Malatesti</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to the agreement, rather for feare, then any euill intent: and that <hi>Pietro Giampagolo</hi> with his ſouldiers, were marched towardes <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and the Pope was more willing to aide the League, then before time hee had bene. Theſe aduertiſements ſatisfied the Earles minde. So as he became contented that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe might remaine in <hi>Lombardy:</hi> and <hi>Nery Capponi</hi> ſhoulde returne to <hi>Florence,</hi> with a thouſande of his Horſe, and fiue hundreth others And if it did ſo fall out in <hi>Toſcana,</hi> that the preſence of the Earle were there needfull and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that then hee ſhoulde wryte vnto him, and the Earle (without anie
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14349:74"/>
reſpect) be diſpatched thither. <hi>Neri</hi> with his forces arriued at <hi>Florence,</hi> in the moneth of Aprill. And the ſame day, <hi>Giampagolo</hi> came thither. In the meane time <hi>Nicholo Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinino</hi> hauing ſetled all things in <hi>Romagna,</hi> determined to come into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to paſſe by the Alpes of S. <hi>Benedetto,</hi> and the Vale of <hi>Montone,</hi> found thoſe places by the vertue of <hi>Nicholo de Piſa,</hi> ſo well defended, that hee thought all his power too little. Moreouer, becauſe the <hi>Florentines</hi> were not well furniſhed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Captaines or ſouldiers, for this ſuddeine aſſault, they had ſent diuerſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to the paſſages of thoſe Alpes, with footemen leuied in haſte, for that purpoſe. Amongſt whome was <hi>Bartholomeo Orlandini:</hi> and to him was appointed the keeping of the Caſtle of <hi>Marradi,</hi> with the paſſage of thoſe Alpes. <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> ſuppoſing hee could not goe by S. <hi>Benedetto</hi> for the vertue of him that defended that way, yet thought hee it eaſie to paſſe by the other which <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeo</hi> kept: perſwaded thereto by the cowardice of that Captaine. <hi>Marradi</hi> is a Caſtle built at the foote of thoſe Alpes, which diuide <hi>Toſcana</hi> from <hi>Romagna.</hi> But on that ſide which is towardes <hi>Romagna,</hi> in the beginning of the Vale of <hi>Lamona,</hi> although it bee without walles, yet the Riuer, the Mountaine, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunts of the countrey doo make it ſtrong. For the men be warlike and faithfull. The Riuer hath alſo worne into the lande, and made ſo deepe caues and places, as it is impoſsible to approach it by that Vale, ſo long as one little Bridge bee defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And on that ſide towardes the Mountaines, the ſhoare is ſo ſteepe as maketh it moſt aſſured. Notwithſtanding, the cowardice of <hi>Bartholomeo</hi> was ſuch, as made thoſe people become baſe minded, and the ſeate to ſeeme of no force at all. For ſo ſoone as the noyſe of the enemie was heard, hee abandoned his charge, and with his ſouldiers fledde away, neuer ſtaying till hee came to <hi>Borgo</hi> S. <hi>Lorenzo. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholo</hi> entered into the places abandoned, much maruelling that they were not better defended. And being glad of that hee had gotten, came downe into <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gello,</hi> where hee ſurprized ſome Caſtles; and at <hi>Puliciano</hi> hee lodged his Campe. From thence hee ſpoyled all the Countrey, to the Mountaines of <hi>Fieſole.</hi> Hee was alſo ſo bolde, as hee doubted not to paſſe the Riuer of <hi>Arno,</hi> forraging and ſpoyling euerie place within three myles of the Cittie of <hi>Florence.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> on the other ſide were not diſmayed, but before all other thinges ſetled the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. Whereof they could not much doubt, as well for the good will the people bare vnto <hi>Coſimo</hi>; as becauſe the chiefe Offices, were reduced into the handes of a fewe mightie Cittizens, who with their ſeueritie handled the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo, that they aſſured themſelues of euerie man, that ſhewed themſelues diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, or deſirous of Innouaſion. They knewe alſo by the contract made in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> with what Forces <hi>Neri</hi> returned, and they looked alſo for other ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to come from the Pope, which till the comming of <hi>Neri,</hi> made them hope well. But <hi>Neri</hi> finding the Cittie in theſe diſorders, and feares, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to goe into the field, ſomewhat to bridle the furie of <hi>Nicholo,</hi> that hee ſhould not ſo much at his pleaſure ſpoyle the countrey. Then making a band of certaine footemen, the people with all the horſes they had went out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered <hi>Remole,</hi> which the enemies had taken. There they encamped themſelues, empeaching <hi>Nicholo</hi> to proceed in his ſpoyle, and gaue hope to the Cittizens to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the enemie. <hi>Nicholo</hi> ſeeing that the enemies hauing loſt their ſouldiers, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not: and vnderſtanding alſo, with what ſecuritie they liued in that citie, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to loſe time, but enterpriſe ſome other thinges. To the ende that the <hi>Florentines</hi> might haue occaſion to ſende out their Forces and fight with him. And if the victorie prooued his, then hee hoped that all other matters ſhould proſperouſly follow. In the Campe of <hi>Nicholo, Franceſco</hi> Earle of <hi>Poppi</hi> happened
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14349:75"/>
to be. He in that time (that the enemies were in <hi>Mugello</hi>) rebelled from the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Earle of Poppi rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the Florentines.</note> with whom he had bene before in League. And albeit the <hi>Florentines</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore miſtruſted that hee would ſo doo, yet thought they to haue bounde him with benefites, and to that ende encreaſed his entertainment, and made him Gouernour ouer all their Townes neare vnto him. All which notwithſtanding (ſo great ſtrength had the loue which hee bare to the contrarie faction) that no benefite nor no feare, could force him to forget, the affection hee bare to <hi>Rinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and the others that gouerned in times paſt. In ſo much, as when hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that <hi>Nicholo</hi> drewe neare, ſuddeinly hee ioyned with him, and perſwaded him with all earneſtie to goe from the Cittie, and paſſe into <hi>Caſentino:</hi> ſhewing him the ſtrength of that countrey, and with what ſecuritie, he might from thence diſtreſſe the enemie. <hi>Nicholo</hi> was well content to be aduiſed by his counſell, and come into <hi>Caſentino,</hi> ſurprized <hi>Romana</hi> and <hi>Bibiena,</hi> and after lodged his Campe at the Caſtle S. <hi>Nicholo.</hi> This Caſtle is ſeated at the foote of thoſe mountaines which diuide <hi>Caſentino</hi> from the Vale of <hi>Arno,</hi> and by reaſon the ſeate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is high, and the place well manned, the taking thereof prooued hard: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that <hi>Nicholo</hi> did with his Artillarie continually make the batterie. This ſiege had continued more then twentie dayes. In which time, the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> aſſembled their Forces at <hi>Figghini,</hi> to the number of foure thouſande horſe; vnder the conduct of <hi>Pietro Giampagolo,</hi> the Generall, <hi>Neri Caponi,</hi> and <hi>Barnardo de Medici</hi> Commiſſaries. To them foure Meſſengers were ſent from the Caſtle of Saint <hi>Nicholo</hi> to deſire their aide. Thoſe Commiſſaries hauing conſidered the ſeate of that place, founde they could not reſcue it anie other way, then by the Alpes, which come from the Vale of <hi>Arno,</hi> and the tops of them might be poſſeſſed by the enemie, before they could come thither, as well for that they were nearer, as that they could not goe vnknowne. So as, they ſhould attempt a thing to no purpoſe, and hazard the ruine of their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Thereuppon the Captaines commending their fidelitie, commaunded them, that if they were not able anie longer to defende themſelues, that then they ſhould yeelde. Thus <hi>Nicholo</hi> preuailed in that enterpriſe, and poſſeſſed this Caſtle in the ende of thirtie two dayes, after hee and his Campe had beſieged it. And for ſo great a loſſe of time, obteyned this ſmall victorie, which was the greateſt occaſion whereby a greater enterpriſe was not performed. For if hee had ſtill continued with his Campe before <hi>Florence,</hi> he had forced thoſe that gouerned, to leuie money amongſt the Cittizens, prepare Forces, and make eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie other prouiſion, with more difficultie, the enemie being ſo neare at hand, manie of the Cittizens would alſo haue bene deſirous of peace, to aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from <hi>Nicholo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nicholo euill counſelled by the Earle of Poppi.</note> ſeeing the warre likely to continue. But the deſire which the Earle of <hi>Poppi</hi> had to bee reuenged of ſome Captaines of Caſtles, who had beene long his enemies, did leade him to giue that counſaile: And <hi>Nicholo</hi> for his ſatisfaction, followed the ſame; which was the deſtruction both of the one and the other. Whereof may be conceiued, that for the moſte part, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler paſsions of men, doo hinder the publique commoditie. <hi>Nicholo</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the victorie, ſurprized <hi>Raſsina</hi> and <hi>Chiuſi.</hi> In theſe places, the Earle of <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> perſwaded him to tarrie, declaring that hee might diſperſe his Forces into <hi>Chiuſi, Capreſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pieue:</hi> by that meanes to become Lord of the mountaines, and at his pleaſure deſcende from thence, into <hi>Caſentino,</hi> into the Vale of <hi>Arno,</hi> to the Vale of <hi>Chiana,</hi> and the Vale of <hi>Teueri,</hi> and bee alſo readie, ſo aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to anye motion whatſoeuer, that the Enemie coulde make.

did not eate ſtones, and ſo went to the <hi>Borgo</hi> of S. <hi>Sepulchro,</hi> where he was friendly receiued. From thence hee practiſed to winne the fauoure of the inhabitants, of the Cittie called <hi>Castello:</hi> who being friendes to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> refuſed him. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deſiring to haue the <hi>Perugini</hi> at his deuotion, hee went with fortie horſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Perugia:</hi> and was receiued (being there a Cittizen borne) verie louingly, yet within fewe dayes after hee became ſuſpected. For albeit both with the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and the Cittizens, hee practiſed manie things, yet nothing was brought to paſſe. But receiuing of them eight thouſand Duckets he returned to the Camp. Then hee deuiſed how to take <hi>Cortona</hi> from the <hi>Florentines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Practiſe to ſurpriſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona.</note> which beeing diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered before the time of execution, that deuiſe came not to effect. Among the chiefe Cittizens of that Towne, was <hi>Bartholomeo di Senſo,</hi> who one euening go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by commaundement of the Captaine to take the Guard of one of the gates, was by a Countrey man his friende, aduiſed not to goe thither, vnleſſe hee were content there to be ſlaine. <hi>Bartholomeo</hi> deſirous to vnderſtand the bottome of that matter, founde there were ſome practiſe made with <hi>Nicholo:</hi> which <hi>Bartholomeo</hi> by authoritie of the Captaine reuealed, and made ſure the chiefe of the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie. Then doubling the Guarde of the Gate, tarried there till <hi>Nicholo</hi> did come. Who at his arriuall, vnderſtanding the matter was diſcouered, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Camp. During that thinges were in <hi>Toſcana</hi> thus handled, and that the Dukes ſouldiers had gained little: <hi>Lombardy</hi> grewe vnquiet, with loſſe and diſaduanntage of the Duke. Becauſe the Earle <hi>Franceſco,</hi> ſo ſoone as the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the yeare ſuffered, came foorth with his Armie to the field, and for that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſupplied their Forces vppon the Lake, the Earle thought good firſt to make himſelfe Lorde of the Water, and then driue the Duke from the Lake: (which done) all other thinges would be eaſily brought to paſſe. Then with the Nauie of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he aſſaulted the Dukes Gallies, and had the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. Hee alſo tooke thoſe Caſtles which were holden of the Duke. In ſo much, as the Dukes other ſouldiers who beſieged <hi>Breſcia</hi> by lande, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this ouerthrowe, retyred. In this ſorte was <hi>Breſcia</hi> after three yeares ſiege deliuered. This victorie had, the Earle marched towardes his enemies,<note place="margin">The ſiere of Breſcia remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> who were come to <hi>Soncino,</hi> a Caſtle vppon the Riuer of <hi>Ogglio,</hi> where hee diſlod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, and forced them remooue to <hi>Cremona.</hi> There the Duke made head, and on that ſide defended his Countries. But the Earle day by day drawing nearer, and the Duke fearing to loſe either all or part of his Countrey, founde how vnaduiſedly hee had done to ſende <hi>Nicholo</hi> into <hi>Toſcana.</hi> And to amende that errour hee wrote vnto <hi>Nicholo</hi> in what tearmes hee ſtood: praying him, with what ſpeed he poſsiblie might, to leaue <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and returne into <hi>Lombardy.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> in this meane ſpace, by order of their Generalles, had ioyned their ſouldiers with the Popes Forces, and made head at <hi>Anghiari,</hi> a Caſtle at the foote of the mountains, which diuided the Vale of <hi>Teuere,</hi> from the Vale of <hi>Chiana,</hi> foure myles from S. <hi>Sepulchro,</hi> where the fieldes be large to receiue Horſe men, and fit for all actions of warre. And becauſe they had intelligence of the Earles victorie, and the reuocation of <hi>Nicholo,</hi> they thought that without the ſword, or more labour, the warre was ended. Therefore wrote vnto their Generals not to fight, for that <hi>Nicholo</hi> could not manie dayes remaine in <hi>Toſcana.</hi> This Commiſsion became knowne to <hi>Nicholo,</hi> who ſeeing that of neceſsitie hee muſt depart: to leaue nothing vnattempted, hee determined to fight, ſuppoſing to finde the enemie altogither vnprouided, and not looking for anye Battayle at all. Whereunto hee was alſo animated and encouraged by <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Poppi,</hi> and diuerſe other baniſhed men of <hi>Florence,</hi> who knewe theyr

owne deſtruction to be certaine, if <hi>Nicholo</hi> did remoue thence: but by fighting they hoped either to winne the victorie, or loſe it with honor. This reſolution made, the Army marched from the place where it was, till it came betweene the Cities of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stello</hi> and <hi>Borgo,</hi> and being come to <hi>Borgo,</hi> before that the enemies knew thereof, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied from the Towne two thouſand men, who truſting to the vertue of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and his promiſes, being deſirous of ſpoyle, followed him. Then <hi>Nicholo</hi> with his Army, marched in Battle-wiſe towards <hi>Anghiari,</hi> &amp; was within two miles of the enemie or leſſe, when by <hi>Micheletto Attendulo</hi> was ſeene a great duſt, who knowing the enemies to be there, warned euerie man to prepare himſelfe. The noyſe in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Campe was great; becauſe that Army encamped for the moſt part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſcipline, and ſuppoſed the enemie to be far off, ſo all the <hi>Florentines</hi> were more readie to flie then fight. For euery man was far from his own lodging, and diſarmed, either to refreſh himſelfe in that hotte ſeaſon, or to take ſome other delight. Yet ſo great was the diligence of the Gouernours and the Captaine, that before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies approached,<note place="margin">The battle of Anghiari.</note> they were on horſebacke, and prepared to reſiſt the charge. And as <hi>Micheletto</hi> was the firſt to diſcouer the enemies, ſo was he alſo the firſt that char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, and with his ſouldiers made ſpeede to winne the Bridge which croſſeth the way not farre from <hi>Anghiari.</hi> And becauſe before the comming of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, <hi>Pietro Giampagolo</hi> had cauſed the ditches to be caſt downe, which are on either ſide the waie: <hi>Micheletto</hi> ſtanding againſt the Bridge, <hi>Simoncino</hi> the Popes Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronell, togither with the Legate, ſtaied on the right hand, and on the left hand ſtood the Commiſſaries for <hi>Florence,</hi> and the foote men placed along the Riuer. Then had the enemie no other way open whereby hee might charge, but by the Bridge. Neither had the <hi>Florentines</hi> to fight but onely vppon the Bridge, ſauing that they commaunded their footemen, that if the footemen of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie did goe towardes the men of Armes; that then they with their Croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes ſhould charge them: to the ende that the <hi>Florentine</hi> horſemen in paſsing the Bridge, ſhould not bee hurt on the ſide. So that they that gaue the firſt charge were by <hi>Micheletto</hi> brauely reſiſted: but afterwardes <hi>Astore</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco Piccinino</hi> with their choyſe bandes, ſo furiouſly charged <hi>Micheletto,</hi> as they tooke from him the Bridge, and draue him to the foote of the hill, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vp to <hi>Anghiari.</hi> After that they were put backe by him, and forced to retyre beyonde the Bridge, and hee alſo charged them vppon the ſide. This fight continued two houres, for ſometime <hi>Nicholo,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> were Lordes of the Bridge. And although vppon the Bridge they were of equall force, yet both on that, and this ſide of the Bridge, <hi>Nicholo</hi> fought with great diſaduantage. Becauſe when the ſouldiers of <hi>Nicholo</hi> had paſſed the Bridge, they founde the enemies ſtrong vppon that ſtraight, and could not with like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage be charged: and thoſe that were wearie, might eaſily be, by freſh men ſupplied. But when the <hi>Florentines</hi> happened to paſſe, <hi>Nicholo</hi> could not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly releeue his wearied men, beeing ſtraightned and holden in, with ditches and trenches: So as, though manie times <hi>Nicholo</hi> had wonne the Bridge, yet by the ſupplie of freſh enemies, hee was euer driuen backe. But when the Bridge was by the <hi>Florentines</hi> aſſuredly wonne, and that their forces were entered into the waie, <hi>Nicholo</hi> wanted time, through the furie of the enemie, and the incommoditie of the place, to ſupplie his ſouldiers. For they of the Vangarde were forced to mixt themſelues, with the Rearewarde: and ſo the one diſordering the other, all the whole Armye was forced to flie, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man without anie reſpect ranne towardes the Towne.<note place="margin">Nicholo Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cintino defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Then the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> ſouldiers beganne to ſpoyle: which ſpoyle of priſoners, armour, and horſes,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14349:76"/>
was great. For with <hi>Nicholo</hi> there was not ſaued aboue one thouſand horſes. They of the <hi>Borgo,</hi> who in hope of ſpoyle had followed <hi>Nicholo,</hi> were of ſpoilers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſpoyle, bicauſe they were all taken and put to ranſome. Their enſignes and carriages were loſt, and the victorie was much more profitable for <hi>Toſcana,</hi> then preiudiciall for the Duke. For if the <hi>Florentines</hi> had loſt the battell, <hi>Toſcana</hi> had bene his, but he loſing the battell, loſt no other thing but the armour and horſes of his Army, which with plentie of money might be recouered. Neither could any warre be made in the countrey of another leſſe dangerous, then was the warre of thoſe dayes. For in ſo great an ouerthrow, and ſo long a fight (which continued from twentie to foure and twentie of the clock) more were not ſlaine then one man, and he alſo not hurt by the vertue of any other, but being falne from his horſe, was trodden vpon with horſes, and ſo died: with ſo great ſecuritie men fought in that age. The reaſon thereof is, that for the moſt part the ſouldiers fought on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and couered with armour, they were defended from death till they yeelded. And therefore finding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues able to fight, they ſo did, and being not longer able, they yeelded. This conflict (for matters which happened both in and after the fight) was a ſigne of the great vnhappines of thoſe warres, bicauſe the enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanquiſhed, and <hi>Nicholo</hi> returned into <hi>Borgo,</hi> the Gouernours of the <hi>Florentines</hi> would haue followed, and beſieged him there to haue the victorie ſullie. But ſome ſouldiers, and ſome Captaines alſo, refuſed to obey them, ſaying they would firſt carrie away the ſpoile, and cure the hurt men. Alſo (a thing more notable) the next day at high noone,<note place="margin">VVant of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in the Florentines Campe.</note> without leaue or reſpect either of the Gouernours or of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, the ſouldiers went vnto <hi>Arezzo,</hi> and there beſtowed their ſpoile (which done) they returned to <hi>Anghiari.</hi> A thing ſo much againſt all order Militarie and Diſcipline of warre, that the remaine of any Army well ordered, might and would eaſily and deſeruingly haue recouered that victorie, which the <hi>Florentines</hi> vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly had gotten. Beſides this, the Gouernours commaunding that all ſouldiers taken, ſhould be ſtayed, to the end, that the enemy might not grow and ſodeinly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer ſtrength, yet were they preſently deliuered. All which things are greatly to be meruailed at. Firſt, how in ſuch an Army, there ſhould be vertue ſufficient to win victorie: And then, how there could be in any enemy ſo little value, as would be of ſo diſordered a people oppreſſed. But while the <hi>Florentines</hi> went, and returned from <hi>Arezzo, Nicholo</hi> gained time to go with his ſouldiers from <hi>Borgo,</hi> and marched towards <hi>Romagna,</hi> with whome alſo fled the <hi>Florentine</hi> Rebels, who ſeeing all hope failed for their returne to <hi>Florence,</hi> they deuided themſelues, and euery man tooke his owne way, ſome remaining in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſome without, as they could find meane to beſtow themſelues. Of which number was <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> who made his habitation at <hi>Ancona:</hi> from whence (the rather to gaine himſelfe a celeſtiall countrey) hauing loſt his dwelling vpon earth, he went vnto the Sepulchre of Chriſt, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, at the marriage of one of his daughters ſitting at the table,<note place="margin">The death of Rinaldo de A<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

A man in euery fortune honourable, and would haue bene much more honourable, had he bene borne in a Cittie vndeuided. Bicauſe many times thoſe his vertues which in a factious Cittie did hinder him, in a Cittie vnited would haue aduanced him. The Commiſſaries then ſeeing the ſouldiers returned from <hi>Arezzo,</hi> and <hi>Nicholo</hi> departed, preſented themſelues before <hi>Borgo.</hi> The <hi>Borgheſi</hi> offered to yeeld to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> but they refuſed to receiue them. And in compounding this agreement, the Popes Legat grew ſuſpitious of the Commiſſaries, fearing they intended to take that Towne from the Church: in ſo much, as they grew to words of offence, and ſome diſorder would haue followed betwixt the <hi>Florentine</hi> and the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14349:77"/>
Popes ſouldiers, if the matter had bene more ſpoken of. But bicauſe euery thing paſſed according to the Legats deſire, all anger was pacified. While this aſſault of <hi>Borgo</hi> continued, aduertiſements were giuen, that <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> was gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome,</hi> and (as others ſaid) towards <hi>La Marca.</hi> Whereupon the Legat, and the reſt thought good to marche towards <hi>Perugia,</hi> to ſuccour <hi>La Marca</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> if <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholo</hi> directed his courſe to any of them. <hi>Barnardo de Medici</hi> followed, and <hi>Neri</hi> with the <hi>Florentines</hi> marched to ſurprize <hi>Caſentino.</hi> This reſolution made, <hi>Neri</hi> incamped before <hi>Ruſsina,</hi> and ſurprized it with the like furie, that he had taken <hi>Bihiena, Prato, Vecchio,</hi>

Neither is victorie for other occaſion ſought, nor the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the enemy to other end deſired, then thereby to make thy ſelfe mightie, and thy aduerſarie weake. It followeth therefore, that ſo oft as thy victorie doth impoueriſh thee, or thy gaines do weaken thee, either thou paſſe or come ſhort of the marke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the warre is directed. That Prince, and that State, is by the victories of warre inriched, which extirpeth the enemies, and becommeth Lord of the ſpoiles, and ranſomes. And that Prince or Common-weale is impoueriſhed, who cannot (though he be victorious) extirpate the enemy, or hath not to his owne vſe, the ſpoiles and ranſomes, but leaueth them to his ſouldiers. Such a Prince in his loſſes is vnhappie, and in his victories moſt infortunate, bicauſe in loſing he ſuffereth all iniuries which the enemy can do him, and in winning, muſt abide the offences of friends: which as they are leſſe reaſonable, ſo are they alſo leſſe tollerable, ſeeing that by impoſitions, and new exactions, he is againe to burden his owne ſubiects. That Prince then, in whome is any generoſitie of minde, cannot reioyce at ſuch a victorie whereat all his ſubiects be conſtrained to lament. The auncient and well ordered Common weales were wont by conqueſts to fill their Treaſuries with gold and ſiluer, to giue rewards to the people, to forgiue tributes, and to make triumphs and publique feaſtings. But the States of whome we write, firſt emptied their treaſure houſes, and after impoueriſhed the people, without aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of their enemies. All which grew by their diſorderly proceeding in the warres. For when they tooke any priſoners, not holding them nor ſlaying them, the reuenge was no longer deferred, then the leaders of the enemy were furniſhed anew with horſe and weapon. Beſides that, the ſpoyles and raunſoms being giuen to the ſouldiers, the Princes victorious could not imploy the ſame in the next warre, but were forced to draw their prouiſion from the bowels of their owne people. Neither did that victorie bring foorth other benefite, then make the Prince gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and with leſſe reſpect to burthen them. For the ſouldiers had brought the warre to ſuch a paſſe (as both the victorious and the victored, if they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund their owne men) had like need of money, bicauſe the one was to arme them a new, the other to reward them. And as they vnmounted could not fight, ſo theſe without new rewards, would not. Whereby it followed, that the one inioyed not much of the victorie, the other felt little of the loſſe, ſeeing the victored was ſpeedily repaired, and the victorious could not in time purſue the victorie. This diſorder, and this peruerſe proceeding in warre, cauſed that <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> was
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14349:78"/>
againe ſet on horſeback, before his ouerthrow was knowne through all <hi>Italy,</hi> and made after greater warre then before he had done. This was the cauſe, that after the diſcomfit at <hi>Tenna,</hi> he could ſurprize <hi>Verona.</hi> This was the cauſe, that after the ſlaughter of his ſouldiers at <hi>Verona,</hi> he could recouer a greater Army, and come into <hi>Toſcana.</hi> This was the cauſe, that being ouerthrowne at <hi>Anghiari,</hi> before he arriued in <hi>Romagna,</hi> he was more mightie in the field, then before he had bene: and might thereby put the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> in hope to defend <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which by his abſence was ſuppoſed to be welneare loſt. For when <hi>Nicholo</hi> had filled <hi>Lombardy</hi> with troubles, the Duke was brought to ſuch paſſe, as he began to doubt of his owne eſtate. And fearing his ruine might follow before the comming of <hi>Nicholo,</hi> (for whome he had ſent) to bridle the Earles furie, and with induſtrie to temper for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, (which with force he could not) he reſorted to thoſe remedies which in like caſes had before time helped him.<note place="margin">The Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth peace.</note> He therefore ſent <hi>Nicholo da Este</hi> Prince of <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> vnto <hi>Piſchiera</hi> (where the Earle was) to practice a peace, and perſwade that warre not to be for his aduantage. Bicauſe, if the Duke were brought to that weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he could not mainteine his owne reputation, he ſhould be the rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed. And for more aſſurance that indeed he deſired peace, he offered him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the marriage, and would ſend his daughter to <hi>Farrara,</hi> ſhe promiſing (the peace made) to yeeld her ſelfe into his hands. The Earle anſwered, that if the Duke did faithfullie deſire peace, with eaſe he might finde it; as a thing both by the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> wiſhed for. Yet did he miſtruſt the ſame much, knowing that before time, he had neuer made peace, but for neceſsitie, which being paſſed, he would alwaies returne to his old minde, and make warre. Neither could he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the Duke intended the marriage, hauing bene before at his hand ſo many times mocked: Notwithſtanding, if the peace were concluded, he would after deale in the marriage as by friends he ſhould be aduiſed. The <hi>Venetians</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon were ſuſpitious of their owne ſouldiers,<note place="margin">The Venetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s miſtruſt the Earle Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco their Generall.</note> of thoſe entertainements reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablie conceiued miſtruſt. Which the Earle being carefull to remoue, followed the warre with greater furie. Notwithſtanding, his mind was ſtil ſo tempered with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> were ſo infected with ſuſpition, as the reſt of that ſommer was paſſed without any enterpriſe of importance. In ſo much as <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> being returned into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and the winter begun, all the ſouldiers repaired to their lodgings: the Earle to <hi>Verona,</hi> the Duke to <hi>Cremona,</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> to <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and the Popes forces to <hi>Romagna.</hi> After the victorie at <hi>Anghiari,</hi> they aſſaulted <hi>Furli,</hi> and <hi>Bologna,</hi> with intent to take them from <hi>Franceſco Piccinino,</hi> who in the name of his father kept them. But that enterpriſe tooke none effect, yet their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither did ſo much terrifie the people of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> that with the conſent of <hi>Ostacio di Polenta,</hi> they abandoned the Pope, and yeelded their obedience to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> who in recompence of the towne (and to the end that <hi>Ostacio</hi> ſhould neuer recouer that from them by force,<note place="margin">Ingratitude of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</note> which for want of wit he had giuen them) ſent him and his ſonne to die in <hi>Candia.</hi> In which enterpriſes, notwithſtanding the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Anghiari,</hi> the Pope wanting money, ſould the Caſtell of <hi>Borgo Saint Sepulcro</hi> for twentie fiue thouſand Florins. In this eſtate all things being, in reſpect of the winter, euery man ſuppoſed himſelfe in ſafetie, and therefore of peace thought not at all: chiefely the Duke, held himſelfe by <hi>Nicholo,</hi> and the winter ſeaſon aſſured. For that conſideration, the parle of peace with the Earle was broken, and <hi>Nicholo</hi> with all diligence was ſet on horſeback, with euery other furniture for a future warre neceſſarie. Hereof the Earle being aduertiſed, went vnto <hi>Venice,</hi> to conſult with the <hi>Senators</hi> what was to be done the yeare following. <hi>Nicholo</hi> on the other ſide was readie, and ſeeing the enemy vnprepared, tarried not for the Spring, but in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14349:78"/>
the depth of winter paſſed <hi>Adda,</hi> and entred <hi>Breſciano,</hi> poſſeſsing himſelfe of all that Countrey <hi>(Adula</hi> and <hi>Acri</hi> excepted) and there ſpoyling and taking priſoners two thouſand of the Dukes horſes, who vnwares were there aſſaulted. But that which more diſpleaſed the Earle and <hi>Venetians,</hi> was, the reuolt of <hi>Ciarpellone,</hi> one of his chiefe Captaines. The Earle receiuing theſe newes, went ſodeinly from <hi>Venice,</hi> and being arriued at <hi>Breſcia,</hi> found that <hi>Nicholo</hi> had done thoſe diſpleaſures, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his lodging, ſo as he thought not good to kindle the warre againe, being in that ſort quenched. And ſith the enemy and time did giue opportunitie, thought good to prepare himſelfe, hoping the rather with the new yeare to be reuenged of old iniuries. He therefore procured that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould call back their forces, which ſerued the <hi>Florentines</hi> in <hi>Toſcana:</hi> and commaunded, that the place of <hi>Gatta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melata</hi> being dead, ſhould by <hi>Micheletto</hi> be ſupplied. The Spring being come,<note place="margin">Micheletto Generall for the League.</note> 
               <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Piccinino</hi> was the firſt that marched to the field, and beſieged <hi>Cignano,</hi> a Caſtle diſtant from <hi>Breſcia</hi> twelue miles. To the reſcue whereof came the Earle, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two Captaines, according to their cuſtome the warre was made. The Earle ſtanding in doubt of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> beſieged <hi>Martinengo,</hi> which Caſtle being eaſily wonne, the ſuccour of <hi>Bergamo</hi> could not be hard. That Cittie being by <hi>Nicholo</hi> greatly diſtreſſed, and hauing prouided ſo, as it could not receiue harme, but by the way of <hi>Martinengo,</hi> they manned it ſo fully, as behoued the Earle to goe vnto the ſiege thereof with all forces. Whereupon <hi>Nicholo</hi> with his whole Army placed himſelfe where he might impeach the Earle of his victuall, and was with trenches and bulwarks ſo fortified, as the Earle without his apparant danger could not aſſault him, and brought the matter to that paſſe, that the beſieger was in more perill then the people of <hi>Martinengo</hi> who were beſieged; in ſo much as the Earle for want of victuall, could neither continue the ſiege, nor for the peril he was in, depart thence. Thus the Dukes victorie was thought aſſured, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> and Earles ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw ſeemed apparant. But fortune, (who neuer faileth of meane, to fauour her friends, and diſfauour her foes) made <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> with hope of this victorie to become ſo ambitious and inſolent, as without reſpect to the Duke (and himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) by a meſſenger ſignified vnto him,<note place="margin">A proude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholo.</note> that he had long time ſerued vnder his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and yet had not gained ſo much land as he could therein burie himſelfe: and was therefore deſirous to know wherewith his ſeruice ſhould be rewarded, ſith now it was in his power to make him Lord of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and oppreſſe all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And to the end that of certaine victorie he might aſpect a certaine recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, deſired to haue of his gift the Cittie of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> where being wearie of long trauell, he might ſometimes repoſe himſelfe: and in concluſion ſomewhat threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to abandon the enterpriſe, if the Duke refuſed to ſatisfie his demaund. This preſumptuous and inſolent ſute, ſo highly offended the Duke, as he made choiſe rather to loſe the victorie, then conſent thereunto. And that which ſo many dangers and threatnings of enemies could not compaſſe, the inſolent behauiour of friends brought to paſſe, and the Duke reſolued to make a peace with the Earle.<note place="margin">Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the League and Duke, and his daughter married to the Harle Franceſco.</note> To whome he ſent <hi>Antonio Guidobuono</hi> of <hi>Tortona,</hi> and by him offered his daughter with the conditions of peace: which offer, was by the Earle, and all his Collegats greedily accepted, and the particularities betwixt them ſecretly concluded. The Duke then ſent vnto <hi>Nicholo,</hi> willing him to take a truce with the Earle for one yeare, alleaging he had bene ſo ſore burthened with charges, as he could not refuſe a certaine peace for a doubtfull victorie. <hi>Nicholo</hi> meruailed much at this reſolution, as one that knew not what might moue the Duke to ſhunne a victorie ſo certaine: and could not beleeue that for want of good will to reward friends, he would ſaue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Wherefore in the beſt manner he could, oppoſed himſelfe to this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14349:79"/>
In ſo much as the Duke was conſtrained to threaten him, that if he were not conformable, he would giue him either as a priſoner to the enemy, or as a ſpoile to his owne ſouldiers. Then <hi>Nicholo</hi> obeied, but with no other minde, then he that by force abandoneth his friends and countrey: complaining his hap to be hard, ſith ſometimes fortune, and ſometimes the Duke, had taken from him the victorie ouer his enemies. This peace made, the marriage betwixt the Ladie <hi>Bianca</hi> and the Earle, was ſolemnized, and to her was allotted for dowrie the Cittie of <hi>Cremona.</hi> Which done, the peace was ratified in Nouember, the yeare 1441. where, for the <hi>Venetians, Franceſco Barbarigo,</hi> and <hi>Pagolo Trono,</hi> and for the <hi>Florentines, Agnolo Acciai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolo,</hi> were Commiſsioners. In this contract, the <hi>Venetians</hi> gained <hi>Peſchiera, Aſola,</hi> and <hi>Lonato,</hi> a Caſtle belonging to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua.</hi> The warre thus ſtayed in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> it remained to take order for the troubles in the kingdome, which not being pacified, would be an occaſion to renew the warres in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> The King <hi>Rinato</hi> during the warres in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> had bene ſpoiled by <hi>Alfonſo</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> of all his Kingdome, ſaue only the Cittie of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſo that <hi>Alfonſo</hi> thinking to haue victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in his owne hand, determined during the ſiege of <hi>Naples,</hi> to take from the Earle <hi>Beneuento</hi>; and other his Countreys thereabouts: for he thought the ſame without perill might be done by the Earles abſence, and his imployment in the warres of <hi>Lombardy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The warre betweene King Rinato and Alfonſo reuiued.</note> This enterpriſe was by <hi>Alfonſo</hi> eaſily performed, and with ſmall trauell he ſurprized all thoſe Townes. But the newes of the peace in <hi>Lombardy</hi> being come, <hi>Alfonſo</hi> feared that the Earle, the rather for that his townes were taken from him, would ioyne with <hi>Rinato,</hi> and <hi>Rinato</hi> hoped for the ſame occaſion that he would ſo do. <hi>Rinato</hi> then ſent vnto the Earle, deſiring him to come to the aide of his friend, and the reuenge of his enemy. On the other ſide, <hi>Alfonſo</hi> intreated <hi>Philippo,</hi> that for the good will betwixt them, he would cauſe the Earle to be ſo much ſet a worke, as to attend greater matters, he might be inforded to let this alone. <hi>Philippo</hi> graunted this requeſt, not thinking what diſturbed that peace, which he, not long ſince, had made to his diſaduantage. Then he gaue the Pope <hi>Eugenio</hi> to vnderſtand, that the time was now come, to recouer thoſe Townes which the Earle had taken from the Church. And for performance of that enterpriſe, he offered him <hi>Nicholo Piccinino</hi> paid, ſo long as the warres continued. For (the peace now made) he remained with his ſouldiers in <hi>Romagna. Eugenio</hi> greedily entertained this counſell, aſwell for the diſpleaſure he bare to the Earle, as the deſire he had to recouer his owne. And though before time, he had bene with the ſame hope by <hi>Nicholo</hi> deceiued, yet now the Duke vndertaking the action, he miſtruſted no more deceipt, but preſently ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his forces with <hi>Nicholo,</hi> and aſſaulted <hi>La Marca.</hi> The Earle being ſo ſodeinly ſet vpon, ordered his ſouldiers, and marched towards the enemy. In this meane while, the King <hi>Alfonſo</hi> wonne <hi>Naples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Cittie of Naples wonne by Alfonſo.</note> whereby all that Kingdome (excepting Caſtle <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouo</hi>) was at his deuotion. Then <hi>Rinato</hi> leauing that Caſtle well guarded, went from thence to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he was moſt honourably receiued, and there remaining a few dayes, finding he could not make warre any longer, went vnto <hi>Marſilia. Alfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> in the meane while had taken the Caſtle <hi>Nuouo,</hi> and the Earle remained in <hi>La Marca,</hi> in ſtrength inferiour to the Pope and <hi>Nicholo,</hi> and therefore prayed the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> to aide him with men and money. Letting them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, it was neceſſarie to bridle the Pope and the King, during the time he was able: for otherwiſe they were to looke for little good, ſeeing the Pope and King would ioyne themſelues with <hi>Philippo,</hi> and diuide all <hi>Italy</hi> betwixt them. The <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> for a time ſtood doubtfull what to do, aſwell bicauſe they knew not whether it were their beſt to be enemies to the Pope and King, as for that they were occupied with the matters of <hi>Bologna.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14349:79"/>
of that Cittie <hi>Franceſco Piccinino.</hi> And the rather to defend the ſame from the Duke, (who fauoured <hi>Franceſco</hi>) he ſent for aide to the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> and they did not denie him: ſo as being occupied in theſe matters, they could not reſolue to aſsiſt the Earle. But <hi>Annibale</hi> hauing ouerthrowne <hi>Franceſco Piccinino,</hi> and thoſe matters ſetled, the <hi>Florentines</hi> determined to aide the Earle: yet firſt to be aſſured of the Duke, they renewed the league with him, which the Duke refuſed not, hauing conſented that the warre ſhould be made vpon the Earle, ſo long as the King <hi>Rinato</hi> was in Armes. But ſeeing him vanquiſhed, and vtterly depriued of his Kingdome, he was not pleaſed that the Earle ſhould then be bereft of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And therefore he not onely conſented to aide the Earle, but alſo wrote vnto <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> deſiring him to be pleaſed to returne to the Kingdome, and make no longer warre. Whereunto, albeit <hi>Alfonſo</hi> was vnwilling, yet being beholding to the Duke, determined to content him, and retired himſelfe with his Army to the other ſide of <hi>Tronto.</hi> While matters were thus handled in <hi>Romagna,</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> within themſelues became diſquiet. Among the Cittizens of moſt reputation and authoritie in <hi>Florence,</hi> was <hi>Neri,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Gino Capponi,</hi> whoſe greatneſſe,<note place="margin">Neri Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni.

               <hi>Coſimo de Medici</hi> aboue all others feared. For beſides his great credit in the Cittie, he was alſo greatly honored of the ſouldiers, hauing bene many times Generall of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> Armies, and with his victorie, vertue, and well deſeruing, had gained their loue.

Among many other of the chiefe Captaines in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Army,<note place="margin">Baldaccio Generall of the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine footmen.</note> was <hi>Baldaccio</hi> of <hi>Anghiari,</hi> a man of warre moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For in thoſe daies, there was not any in <hi>Italy,</hi> that for vertue, perſon, &amp; courage, could excell him, and had among the footemen (for of thoſe he was euer a leader) ſo much reputation, as all that ſort of ſouldiers in euery enterpriſe, and whenſoeuer he pleaſed, would willingly follow him. This <hi>Baldaccio</hi> loued <hi>Neri</hi> exceeding much, as a man whoſe vertue (wherof he was a witneſſe) ſo deſerued, which bred in the other Cittizens great ſuſpition. And they iudging to ſuffer him, was perillous, &amp; to reſtraine him was moſt danger of all: determined to diſpatch him vtterly, which intent fortune greatly fauoured. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeo Orlandini</hi> was <hi>Gonfaloniere de Giuſlitia.</hi> He being (as is before ſaid) Captaine of <hi>Marradi,</hi> at ſuch time as <hi>Ni.

This cowardice at that time greatly offended <hi>Baldaccio,</hi> who with words of reproofe &amp; letters, made the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerywhere knowne. Whereat <hi>Bartholomeo</hi> aſhamed &amp; offended, did greatly ſtudy to be reuenged, hoping by the death of the accuſor, to cancell the fame of his infamie. This deſire of <hi>Bartholomeo</hi> being known to other cittizens, with ſmall labour he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to the oppreſsion of <hi>Baldaccio,</hi> whereby in one act he might reuenge his priuat iniurie, and deliuer the ſtate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that man, whom they muſt of force enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine with peril, or diſcharge with diſaduantage. Therefore <hi>Bartholomeo</hi> being fully determined to kil him, conueied into his chamber many yong men armed. Then the <hi>Gonfalone</hi> ſeeing <hi>Baldaccio</hi> come into the market place (whither he reſorted daily to confer with the Magiſtrates of his charge) ſent for him, and he obeied. Being come, the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> met him, enterteining him with ſpeech touching his buſineſſe from chamber to chamber, till he came neare to that place where the armed men were hidden, and when he thought good, called them foorth. <hi>Baldaccio</hi> being diſarmed,<note place="margin">Baldaccio murd<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

The peace made in <hi>La Marca,</hi> all <hi>Italy</hi> had liued in quiet, if the <hi>Bologneſi</hi> had not diſturbed the ſame.<note place="margin">Trouble in Bologna.</note> There was in <hi>Bologna</hi> two mightie Families, <hi>Channeſchi,</hi> and <hi>Bentiuogli,</hi> of the one <hi>Annibale,</hi> and of the other <hi>Battista</hi> was chiefe. Theſe (to be the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſured one of the others friendſhip) contracted a marriage. But betweene men which aſpire to one greatneſſe, though alliance may eaſily be made, yet friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip cannot. <hi>Bolognia</hi> was in league with the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> which league had bene concluded by meane of <hi>Annibale Bentiuogli,</hi> after they had driuen out <hi>Franceſco Piccinino. Battiſta</hi> knowing that the Duke deſired greatly to haue the fauour of that Cittie, practiſed with him to kill <hi>Annibale,</hi> and bring that Cittie vnder his enſigne. The order of this murther agreed vpon, the 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Iune 1445. <hi>Battiſta</hi>

with his men aſſaulted <hi>Annibale</hi> &amp; ſlew him: which done, he proclaimed the Dukes name throughout the towne. At that time, the Commiſſaries for the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> were in <hi>Bologna</hi>; and at the firſt rumor retired vnto their houſes, but afterwards perceiuing that the murtherers were not fauoured by the people (who were in great numbers armed, and aſſembled, lamenting the death of <hi>Annibale</hi>) they tooke courage, went towards them, &amp; aſſailed the <hi>Canneſchi,</hi> whom in leſſe then one houre they ouerthrew; ſlaying ſome, and forcing the reſt to flie the Cittie. <hi>Battiſta</hi> not fleeing in time nor ſlaine, remained at his houſe and hid himſelf in a veſſell made for the keeping of corne. His enemies hauing all the day ſought him, and aſſured he was not gone out of the towne, threatned his ſeruants ſo much, as one of them at length diſcouered where he was. From thence he was taken out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſlaine, then drawne through the ſtreets, and at laſt burned: ſo as the victorie of the Duke, was of force ſufficient to perſwade <hi>Annibale</hi> to the enterpriſe, but not of power ynough to ſaue him from death. Thus by the death of <hi>Battiſta,</hi> and the fleeing of the <hi>Canneſchi,</hi> theſe tumuls were appeaſed. The <hi>Bologneſi</hi> remained in great confuſion, bicauſe there was not left of the houſe of <hi>Bentiuogli</hi> any man fit for gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And for that there remained one ſonne onely of <hi>Annibale</hi> but ſix yeares old (who was called <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanni</hi>) the <hi>Bologneſi</hi> feared leaſt among the friends of the <hi>Bentiuogli</hi> ſome diuiſion would grow, which might perhaps occaſion the returne of the <hi>Canneſchi,</hi> with the ruine of their countrey and faction. While the <hi>Bologneſi</hi> continued in this doubtfull imagination, <hi>Franceſco</hi> late Earle of <hi>Poppi</hi> being in <hi>Bologna,</hi> informed the chiefe Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, that if they had deſire to be gouerned by one deſcended of the bloud of <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bale,</hi> he could informe them of ſuch a one. Declaring that about 20. yeares paſt, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole</hi> the Coſen of <hi>Annibale</hi> happened to be at <hi>Poppi,</hi> and had there carnall knowledge of a yong woman in that Caſtle, who was after deliuered of a ſonne called <hi>Santi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Santi Benti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uogli.</note> whom <hi>Hercole</hi> diuerſe times affirmed to be his. And it ſeemed to be a thing likely, for that the child ſo much reſembled <hi>Hercole,</hi> as liker it could not be. His words were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued by thoſe Cittizens, and they deſerred no time to ſend vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> to find out the yong man, and perſwade with <hi>Coſimo di Medici,</hi> and <hi>Neri Capponi,</hi> that they might haue him. The ſuppoſed father of this <hi>Santi</hi> was dead, and the yong man liued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tuition of an Vncle of his called <hi>Antonio Caſceſe.</hi> This <hi>Antonio</hi> was rich, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out children, and friend to <hi>Neri.</hi> The matter being vnderſtood, <hi>Neri</hi> thought fit, neither to reiect the motion, nor imbrace it, but commaunded that <hi>Santi</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Coſimo,</hi> and thoſe that were ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Bologna,</hi> ſhould ſpeake with him. Then order being taken for their meeting, <hi>Santi</hi> was by the <hi>Bologneſi</hi> not only honored, but alſo (as it were) adored. Then <hi>Coſimo</hi> calling <hi>Santi</hi> aſide, ſaid vnto him, there is none that in this matter can better counſell thee, then thy ſelfe, for thou art to take that choiſe whereto thine own mind is inclined. If thou be the ſonne of <hi>Hercole Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuogli,</hi> thou wilt diſpoſe thy ſelfe to ſuch actions as be worthie of thy father and his houſe, but if thou art the ſonne of <hi>Agnolo Caſceſe,</hi> thou ſhalt remaine in <hi>Florence,</hi> and imploy thy life baſely in the art of clothmaking. Theſe words much incouraged the yong man, for where he had before refuſed to take the matter vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he ſaid now that he would be directed in all by <hi>Coſimo</hi> and <hi>Neri.</hi> Then they reſolued with the meſſengers of <hi>Bologna</hi> to apparrell him, horſe him, and man him, and ſo in honorable wiſe conuey him to the Cittie, there to take the gouernment: where he after gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſo great wiſedome, that notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the greater part of his predeceſſors had ben by their enemies ſlaine, yet he peaceably and honorably liued &amp; died. After the death of <hi>Nicholo Piccinino,</hi> &amp; the peace made in <hi>La Marca, Philippo</hi> deſired to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine a Captaine to gouerne his Army, and ſecretly practiſed with <hi>Ciarpellone,</hi> one of the Earles chiefe Leaders, and grew with him to compoſition. <hi>Ciarpellone</hi> prayed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14349:81"/>
leaue of the Earle to goe to <hi>Milan,</hi> to take poſſeſsion of certaine Caſtles, which in the late warre were by <hi>Philippo</hi> giuen him. The Earle miſtruſting that which was, (and to the end the Duke ſhould not be ſerued to his diſaduantage) firſt ſtayed him, and ſhortly after put him to death, alleaging he had bene by him abuſed. Therewith <hi>Philippo</hi> was exceedingly angrie, and the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> much pleaſed, as they that feared leaſt the Earles forces and the Dukes power ioyned in friendſhip. This anger was occaſion to reſuſcitate new warre in <hi>La Marca.</hi> In <hi>Rimini, Giſmondo Malateſti</hi> was Lord, who being ſon in law to the Earle, hoped to haue poſſeſsion of <hi>Peſaro:</hi> notwithſtanding the Earle hauing ſurprized it, gaue it to <hi>Aleſſandro</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherewith <hi>Giſmondo</hi> grew greatly offended, and the more bicauſe <hi>Federigo di Montefeltro</hi> his enemy, by the Earles fauour, had vſurped <hi>Vrbino.</hi> This was the cauſe that <hi>Giſmondo</hi> ioyned with the Duke, and ſollicited the Pope &amp; King to make warre vpon the Earle. Who to the end <hi>Giſmondo</hi> ſhould feele the firſt fruits of that warre which he deſired, thought to preuent him, and ſodeinly aſſailed him. Whereupon <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>La Marca</hi> were on the ſoden brought into tumult, bicauſe <hi>Philippo,</hi> the king, and the Pope, ſent great aide to <hi>Giſmondo:</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> furniſhed the Earle, though with no men, yet with plentie of money. Neither was <hi>Philippo</hi> content to make warre in <hi>Romagna,</hi> but he alſo determined to take from the Earle <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Pontremoli:</hi> yet was <hi>Pontremoli</hi> by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and <hi>Cremona</hi> by the <hi>Venetians</hi> defended.<note place="margin">New warres in Lombardy.</note> So that by theſe meanes the warre in <hi>Lombardy</hi> was renewed, and therein ſomewhat done in <hi>Cremoneſe. Franceſco Piccinino</hi> Generall for the Duke, was by <hi>Micheletto,</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi> forces at <hi>Caſale</hi> defeated. By which victorie, the <hi>Venetians</hi> hoped to take the Dukes ſtate from him, and ſent their Commiſſarie to <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> aſſailing <hi>Ghiraadada,</hi> and poſſeſſed all ſauing <hi>Cremona.</hi> Afterwards they paſſed <hi>Adda,</hi> ſpoiling the countrey hard to the gates of <hi>Milan.</hi> Thereupon the Duke deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aide of <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> declaring what perill would enſue to the kingdome, if <hi>Lombardy</hi> were in the <hi>Venetians</hi> hand. <hi>Alfonſo</hi> promiſed to ſend him ſouldiers, who without conſent of the Earle could with difficultie paſſe. Then <hi>Philippo</hi> intreated the Earle not to abandon his father in law being aged and blind. The Earle ſound himſelf of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the Duke for hauing moued the warre againſt him. On the other ſide he miſliked the greatneſſe of the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Earle his friendſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired both by the Duke and Venetians.</note> his money grew low, and the ſame was ſcarcely ſupplied by the Lords of the League. For the <hi>Florentines</hi> feared no more the Duke, which was the cauſe they eſteemed the Earle, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> deſired his ruine, iudging that the ſtate of <hi>Lombardy</hi> could not be taken from them but by the Earle. Notwithſtanding, while <hi>Philippo</hi> ſought to draw him into his pay, offering him the commaundement of all his ſouldiers, ſo that he would forſake the <hi>Venetians</hi> and reſtore <hi>La Marca</hi> to the Pope. They alſo ſent Embaſſadors vnto him, promiſing him the poſſeſsion of <hi>Milan,</hi> if they could win it, and the perpetuitie in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their men of warre, if he would ſtill follow the warre in <hi>La Marca,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the comming of aide from <hi>Alfonſo</hi> into <hi>Lombardy.</hi> Thus were the promiſes of the <hi>Venetians</hi> great, and their deſerts of him greater, hauing begun that warre, to ſaue <hi>Cremona</hi> for the Earle. On the other part, the iniuries done by the Duke were freſh, his promiſes not faithfull nor great. Yet did the <hi>Earle</hi> much doubt what reſolution to make. For of the one ſide, the obligation of the league, their well deſeruing of him, and their promiſes of pleaſures to come, did moue him. On the other, the intreatie of his Father in lawe, and chiefely the poiſon which hee feared to be hidden vnder the great promiſes of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> did ſtay him; ſuſpecting leaſt their promiſe of that ſtate, if hee ſhould hap to win it, might not be performed: hauing none other hold, but their bare promiſe, whereunto no wiſe Prince, vnleſſe it were for great neceſsitie, had euer truſted. Theſe difficulties of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14349:81"/>
Earles reſolution, were remoued by the ambition of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who hoping to ſurprize <hi>Cremona</hi> by meanes of ſome intelligence they had within the Cittie, vnder another pretence cauſed their ſouldiers to marche neere vnto it. But that enterpriſe was diſcouered by thoſe that guarded the towne for the Earle, whereby the treaſon tooke no effect, and they thereby wan not <hi>Cremona,</hi> but vtterly loſt the loue of the Earle, who preſently thereupon laying all reſpects apart, ioyned himſelfe with the Duke. Now was Pope <hi>Eugenio</hi> dead, and in his place ſucceeded <hi>Nicholao quinto.</hi> The Earle had his whole Army at <hi>Cotigniola,</hi> readie to paſſe into <hi>Lombardy.</hi> Thither came newes, aduertiſing the death of <hi>Philippo,</hi> which was the laſt of Auguſt,<note place="margin">Death of Duke Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po of Milan.</note> in the yeare 1447. Theſe newes grieued the Earle exceedingly, bicauſe he thought his army not fully paid, would be vnreadie, &amp; feared leaſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> being in armes, would become his enemies. For hauing abandoned them &amp; ioyned with the Duke, he feared <hi>Alfonſo</hi> his continuall enemy, not truſting either the Pope, or the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> Theſe, bicauſe they were in league with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the other, for that he did poſſeſſe ſome townes belonging to the Church. Notwithſtanding, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſhew his face to fortune, and according to the chances therof to proceed. For many times by doing ſomewhat, ſecrets are diſcouered, which by ſtanding ſtil could not be knowne. Great hope he conceiued in thinking, that if the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> would be defended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ambition of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that of force they muſt imploy him and his ſouldiers. Therof taking courage, he marched into the countrey of <hi>Bologna,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Regio,</hi> ſtaying with his forces at <hi>Lenza,</hi> from whence he ſent vnto <hi>Milan</hi> to offer his ſeruice. Some of the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> hauing buried their Duke, deſired to liue in libertie, and ſome others were contented to receiue a Prince. Of thoſe which deſired a Prince, ſome would haue the Earle, and ſome the King <hi>Alfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> whereby thoſe that loued libertie, being more vnited, became the ſtronger part, and framed after their faction a ſtate and gouernment, which was neuertheleſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed by many Citties of the Dukedome, imagining that they might alſo (as <hi>Milan</hi> did) enioy their libertie. And others alſo, which aſpired not thereunto, did likewiſe refuſe to yeeld vnto the <hi>Milaneſi.</hi> The Citties of <hi>Lodi</hi> &amp; <hi>Piacenza</hi> gaue themſelues to the <hi>Venetians. Pauia</hi> &amp; <hi>Parma</hi> would be free. The Earle vnderſtanding theſe confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, went vnto <hi>Cremona,</hi> whither his Embaſſadors and the Embaſſadors of <hi>Milan</hi> came with this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he ſhould remain Captain general of the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Earle made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for the Milaneſi.</note> with thoſe conditions laſt ſet down by the Duke <hi>Philippo,</hi> adding thereunto that the Earle ſhould haue <hi>Breſcia,</hi> till he ſurpriſed <hi>Verona.</hi> And being poſſeſſed therof, to yeeld vp <hi>Breſcia.</hi> Before the death of this Duke, Pope <hi>Nicholo</hi> at his aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſought to make peace amongſt all the Italian Princes. For the compaſsing whereof, by Embaſſadors he practiſed, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſhould ſend vnto him at the time of his creation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to appoint a Parliament at <hi>Farrara,</hi> to procure therein either a long truce, or a perfect peace. Vpon which occaſion in that Cittie aſſembled the Popes Legat, the Embaſſadors for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> Embaſſadors for the Duke, &amp; Embaſſadors for the <hi>Florentines.</hi> But thoſe which were looked for from King <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> appeared not. This King was then at <hi>Tiboli,</hi> accompanied with many men of warre, both on foote and horſeback. From thence he gaue countenance to the Duke, and it was thought that ſo ſoone as they had drawne the Earle to their ſide, they would openly aſſault the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines.</hi> In the meane time, the Earles ſouldiers ſhould remaine in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> &amp; the peace to be enterteined at <hi>Farrara,</hi> whither the King ſent not, ſaying he would ratifie all things the Duke would aſſent vnto. This peace was many dayes conſulted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and after much diſputation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, that either it ſhould be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall peace, or a truce for 5. yeares, at the election of the Duke, whoſe Embaſſadors being returned to <hi>Milan</hi> to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his pleaſure, at their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thither found him

dead. The <hi>Milaneſi</hi> notwithſtanding his death, would needs haue the concluſion of peace allowed. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> did not conſent, hoping greatly to vſurpe that ſtate. And the rather, bicauſe <hi>Lodi</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> ſodeinly after the Dukes death were yeelded vnto them:<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans aſpire to vſurpe the Duchie of Milan.</note> whereby they hoped, either by force or compoſition within ſhort ſpace to become Lords of all the territorie of <hi>Milan,</hi> and in the end ſo diſtreſſe the Cittie, as it ſhould alſo be forced to yeeld before any man could reſcue it. And the rather they thus perſwaded themſelues, for that they ſawe the <hi>Florentines</hi> buſied in warre with King <hi>Alfonſo.</hi> That King being at <hi>Tiboli,</hi> and intending to follow the enterpriſe of <hi>Toſcana,</hi> as he had determined with <hi>Philippo,</hi> thinking therewith that the warre alreadie begun in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> would giue him time and commoditie deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to haue one foote into the ſtate of <hi>Florence,</hi> before ſuch time as he would openly make the warre,<note place="margin">King Alfonſo aſſaulteth the Florentines.</note> and for that purpoſe practiſed to win the Caſtle <hi>Cennina</hi> in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vale of <hi>Arno,</hi> and wan it. The <hi>Florentines</hi> ſtriken with this vnlooked for accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and ſeeing the King readie to march to their offence, hired ſouldiers, created the ten Magiſtrates, and according to their cuſtome, prepared all things for the warre. By this time the King with his Army was come to the countrey of <hi>Siena,</hi> labouring by all meanes to bring that Cittie to fauour him. Notwithſtanding, the Cittizens there ſtood firme in their friendſhip to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and refuſed to receiue the King, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into <hi>Siena,</hi> or any other of their townes: yet did they prouide him victuall, whereof the importunitie of the King, and the force of the enemy might excuſe them. The King then thought not good to enter by the way of the vale of <hi>Arno,</hi> as he firſt determined, aſwell for that he had ſpoiled <hi>Cennina,</hi> as bicauſe the <hi>Florentines</hi> were partly furniſhed with ſouldiers, and therefore marched towards <hi>Volterra,</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized many Caſtles in the countrey thereto belonging. From thence, he marched into the countrey of <hi>Piſa,</hi> where, by the fauour of <hi>Arrigo</hi> and <hi>Fatio,</hi> Earles of <hi>Chirar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſca,</hi> he tooke ſome Caſtles, and aſſaulted <hi>Campilia,</hi> which being defended by the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the cold winter, he could not ſurprize. Then the King leauing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his owne ſouldiers to guard the townes by him taken, and to defend the countrey, retired with the reſt of his Army to his lodgings in the countrey of <hi>Siena.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> fauoured by that ſeaſon of the yeare, carefully laboured to prouide ſouldiers. Their chiefe leaders were <hi>Federigo</hi> Lord of <hi>Vrbino,</hi> and <hi>Giſmondo Malateſta</hi> of <hi>Rimino.</hi> And albeit there was betwixt them two ſome diſagreement, yet by the wiſedome of <hi>Neri,</hi> and <hi>Barnardetto di Medici,</hi> (Commiſſaries for the <hi>Florentines</hi>) they agreed ſo well, that notwithſtanding the hard winter continuing, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and recouered thoſe townes which were loſt in the countrey of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and the <hi>Ripomerancie</hi> in the territorie of <hi>Volterra.</hi> They alſo bridled the Kings ſouldiers, who before had ſpoyled the ſea coaſt, ſo as with difficultie they might defend the townes committed to their guard. But the Spring time being come, the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries drew forth all their ſouldiers, to the number of 5000. horſe, and 2000. footmen. And the King came with his, to the number of welneare fifteene thouſand, beſides 3000. at <hi>Campiglia.</hi> And when he intended to returne to the ſiege of that towne, he went to <hi>Piombino,</hi> hoping eaſily to win it, bicauſe the towne was not well furniſhed, he thought the hauing thereof profitable for him, and diſaduantagious for the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi>; bicauſe, from thence he might protract the warres, and conſume them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing meane to victuall himſelfe by ſea, and diſturbe the whole countrey of <hi>Piſa.</hi> This aſſault greatly diſpleaſed the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter, thought that if they might with their Army remaine in the bounds of <hi>Campiglia,</hi> that the King ſhould therby be inforced to depart either broken or diſhonoured. For which purpoſe they armed foure ſmall Gallies at <hi>Liuorno,</hi> and with them put into the towne of <hi>Piombino</hi> three hundred footemen, placing them at the <hi>Galdani,</hi> a place where
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14349:82"/>
with difficultie they might be aſſaulted. For if they were lodged in the plaine vpon the Confines, the ſame was thought dangerous. The <hi>Florentines</hi> receiued their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals from the Townes thereabouts, which being but fewe and not much inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did ſcarcely furniſh them. So as the Armie ſuffered penurie, and moſt chiefly of wine: Becauſe none being there made, nor brought thither from other places, it was impoſsible for euerie man to haue ſo much as ſhould ſuffice him. But the King, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he were by the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſtraightly holden in, yet had he abundance almoſt of euerie prouiſion, by reaſon hee receiued it from the ſea. The <hi>Florentines</hi> therefore thought good; likewiſe to make proofe, if they might be by ſea releeued: and for that purpoſe loaded their Gallies with victuall, and ſent them thither. But in their paſſage they were encountred with ſeuen of the Kings Gallies, which tooke two of them, and ſuncke the others. This loſſe bereft the <hi>Florentine</hi> ſouldiers, of hope to be reuictualled. Thereupon two hundreth or more Pyoners for want of drinke fled vnto the Kings Campe: the reſt of the ſouldiers mutined, complayning that in thoſe hote places they could not remaine without wine, becauſe water was there moſt vnwholeſome. So that the Commiſſaries determined to abandon that place, and imploy their forces to recouer certaine Caſtles which remained in the Kings hand. Who on the other ſide, although he wanted not victual, being in force the ſtronger, yet was his Camp afflicted with ſickneſſe, bred there, by the infection of the aire, nere vnto the ſea: by mean wherof, almoſt euerie man was infected, and many of them alſo died. Theſe occaſions miniſtred communication of peace, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King demaunded fiftie thouſand Florins, and <hi>Piombino</hi> to be left at his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The matter being debated at <hi>Florence,</hi> by many deſirous of peace, the demands were thought reaſonable. For they were perſwaded a war ſo chargeable as that was, could not without great expence be mainteined. Notwithſtanding <hi>Neri Capponi</hi> went vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> and there with ſuch reaſons as he made, altered their minds. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them vtterly to accept thoſe conditions: and the <hi>Florentines</hi> receiued the Lord of <hi>Piombino</hi> as recommended; promiſing both intime of warre and peace to defend him, if he would, (as hitherto he had) fight couragiouſly in defence of his owne Citie. The King vnderſtanding this reſolution, and ſeeing his owne Campe afflicted with ſickneſſe, brake vp, and retired with the reſt into the country of <hi>Siena</hi>; leauing behinde him two thouſand dead bodies. From thence he marched towards the kingdome, and being exceedingly offended with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> threatned the next Spring to make vppon them a new warre. While matters were thus handled in <hi>Toſcana,</hi> the Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> became Generall of the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> and before anie thing done, obteined the friendſhip of <hi>Franceſco Piccinino,</hi> who had likewiſe ſerued them, which he did, to the end that his enterpriſes might be the more fauoured, and by <hi>Piccinino</hi> the leſſe impeached. Then marched he with his Armie to the field, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Citizens of <hi>Pauia,</hi> fearing they could not defend themſelues, and being on the other ſide, vnwilling to obey the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> offered him the Towne, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he ſhould not deliuer it to them. The Earle greatly deſired the poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Citie, thinking that the hauing thereof would be a good beginning to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour his intent, being neither deteined with feare, nor abaſhed to breake his faith. For great men do call loſſe, a thing diſhonourable, but to compaſſe their deſire by craft, is accounted no ſhame at all. Notwithſtanding he doubted, leaſt his taking of the Towne in this ſort, would ſo offend the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> as for that cauſe, they woulde yeeld themſelues to the <hi>Venetians:</hi> and if it were not taken by him, then he feared the Duke of <hi>Sauoia,</hi> to whom many of the Citizens were willing to giue it. So as by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of thoſe meanes, hee thought himſelfe bereft of the dominion of <hi>Lombardy:</hi> yet ſuppoſing it leſſe perill, to take the Citie for himſelfe then leaue it to an other, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14349:83"/>
to accept it, being perſwaded it was notwithſtanding poſsible to content the <hi>Milaneſi:</hi> whom he enformed of thoſe perils wherunto they ſhould fall, if he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not the Citie of <hi>Pauia.</hi> For that Citie (if it were by him refuſed) would yeelde to the <hi>Venetians</hi> or the Duke of <hi>Sauoia,</hi> in either of which caſes, their countrey ſhould be loſt, and therefore thought rather be contented to haue him their neighbour and friend,<note place="margin">The Milaneſi iealious of the Earle.</note> then any other that were more mightie, and their enemie. The <hi>Milaneſi</hi> were much troubled with this matter, imagining that the Earle had thereby diſcouered his ambition, and the end whereunto he tended. Yet thought they not good, to take knowledge thereof, becauſe leauing the Earle, they ſawe not whither to addreſſe themſelues, vnleſſe it were to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whoſe pride and hard dealing they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted. Wherefore they reſolued, not to ſhake off the Earle, but for the preſent, by him to be be deliuered of thoſe inconueniences, hoping after to be alſo deliuered of himſelfe. For they were not onely aſſaulted by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but alſo by the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Sauoia,</hi> who made warre in the name of <hi>Carlo</hi> of <hi>Orliens,</hi> ſonne to the ſiſter of <hi>Philippo.</hi> But the Earle eaſily withſtood their mallice. Then were the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> his only enemies, who with a mightie Armie determined to ſurprize that ſtate, and had alreadie poſſeſſed <hi>Lodi,</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> wherunto the Earle brought his camp: and after a long ſiege ſacked that Citie. Which done, (becauſe the winter was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die come) he retired his men to their lodgings, and went himſelfe to <hi>Cremona</hi>; where with his wife he reſted all that winter. But the ſpring being come, the Armies of the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> returned to the field. The <hi>Milaneſi</hi> deſired to ſurprize <hi>Lodi,</hi> and after make peace with the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Becauſe the charges of warre did burthen them, and the fidelitie of their General was ſuſpected. For theſe reaſons they wiſhed a peace, as well to repoſe themſelues, as to be aſſured of the Earle. Then they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, their Army ſhould beſiege <hi>Carrauaggio,</hi> hoping that <hi>Lodi</hi> would yeeld, ſo ſoone as the Caſtle could be taken from the enemie. The Earle obeyed the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his intent was to haue paſſed <hi>Adda,</hi> and aſſault the country of <hi>Breſcia.</hi> The ſiege being laid to the Caſtle of <hi>Carrauaggio,</hi> hee trenched and fortified his Campe, leaſt happily the <hi>Venetians</hi> would aſſaile him. The <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other ſide, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by <hi>Micheletto</hi> their Generall, marched within two bowes ſhot off the Earles Campe, where diuerſe dayes both the Armies remained, the one many times offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other. Notwithſtanding, the Earle ſtil beſieged the caſtle, &amp; did ſo ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtreſſe it, as it was readie to yeeld: which greatly diſpleaſed the <hi>Venetians</hi>; fearing that the loſſe thereof would be the ruine of all the enterpriſe. Great diſputation aroſe among their Captaines, by what meanes it might be ſuccoured. But no other way could be deuiſed, then to aſſault the enemies in their trenches, which was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding daungerous. Notwithſtanding ſo greatly they eſteemed the loſſe of that Caſtle, as the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> (beeing naturally fearefull to meddle with any matter either doubtful or dangerous) did chuſe rather to hazard all, then with the loſſe of that, to loſe the enterpriſe. They reſolued therfore by all meanes to aſſault the Earle, &amp; one morning earely charged him on that ſide where they thought he was weakeſt. At the firſt charge (as it happeneth in thoſe aſſaults which be not looked for) all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie was diſmaid. Notwithſtanding, the Earle ſodeinly repaired the diſorders, &amp; had handled the matter ſo, that notwithſtanding many aſſaults, the enemies were forced in the end,<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans defeated by the Earle Francefco.</note> not onely to retire, but alſo were ſo purſued: that of their Camp (which was twelue thouſand horſe) not one thouſand was ſaued. All their goods were ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and their carriages taken. So as neuer before that time the <hi>Venetians</hi> receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ouerthrow greater, or more terrible. Among the ſpoyles and priſoners taken in this conflict, was the <hi>Venetian Proueditor,</hi> who before that skirmiſh, and after during the wars, had vſed diuerſe opprobrious words of the Earle, calling him Baſtard and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14349:83"/>
Coward. But being become priſoner, remembring what hee had deſerued, and brought to the Earles preſence: according to the nature of proud &amp; cowardly men (which is to be in proſperitie inſolent, and in aduerſitie abiect &amp; vile) kneeled down before him, weeping, &amp; deſiring pardon of his offences. The Earle tooke him vp by the arme, comforted him, and willed him to be of good cheare. And afterwards ſaid, that he maruelled much how a man of his wiſdom &amp; grauitie, could commit ſo great an error, as to ſpeake euill of them that had not ſo deſerued. And touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſlaunder, he knew not in what ſort <hi>Sforza</hi> his father, had vſed his mother <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna Lucia,</hi> becauſe he was not there preſent. So as of that which was done by them he could receiue neither blame nor commendation. But for his owne doings, he knew well, that nothing was by any man to be reprooued: and thereof both he and his <hi>Senate</hi> could fully and truly witneſſe with him. Whereof hee wiſhed him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be more modeſt in ſpeech, and in his proceedings more diſcreet. After this victorie, the Earle with his tryumphant Campe, marched to the territorie of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and poſſeſsing all that country, ſetled his Campe within two myles of the Citie. The <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other ſide, hauing receiued this ouerthrow, feared, (as it came to paſſe) that <hi>Breſcia</hi> would be firſt aſſaulted, ſpeedily as they might, made prouiſion, and with all diligence, leuied forces, ioyning them to thoſe that remained of the old Campe. Therewith alſo by vertue of the League, deſired aid of the <hi>Florentines.</hi> Who being free from the warre of King <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> ſent vnto them one thouſand footemen, and two thouſand horſe. The <hi>Venetians</hi> by hauing theſe ſouldiers, gained time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of peace. It hath bene long time a thing fatall to the <hi>Venetian</hi> ſtate,<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fortunate.</note> to loſe by warre, and recouer the loſſe by compoſition. And thoſe things which by the warres are taken from them, by the peace many times be reſtored double. The <hi>Venetians</hi> knew well, that the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> miſtruſted the Earle, and that he deſired not to be their Captaine, but aſpired to the principallitie of <hi>Milan.</hi> Alſo that it was in their choiſe to make peace with either of them: the one deſiring it for ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other for feare. Then they choſe to make peace with the <hi>Earle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Earle and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

Being then brought to this paſſe that they could not defende themſelues, nor would truſt vnto the Earle, they ſhould be enforced, (not hauing other refuge) to truſt vnto the <hi>Venetians.</hi> This reſolution made, they ſounded the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of the Earle, and found him greatly diſpoſed to the peace: as deſirous that the victorie of <hi>Carrauaggio</hi> might be his, and not the <hi>Milanieſes.</hi> Then was there a compoſition concluded, wherein the <hi>Venetians</hi> bound themſelues to paie vnto the Earle, ſo long as he deferred the taking of <hi>Milan,</hi> thirteene thouſand Florines for euerie moneth: and during the reſt of the warre, to aide him with foure thouſand horſe, and two thouſand footemen. And the Earle for his part did binde himſelfe to reſtore to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> all Townes, priſoners, and euerie other thing by him taken, and reſt contented with thoſe Townes onely, which the Duke <hi>Philippo</hi> at his death poſſeſſed. This agreement being knowne in <hi>Milan,</hi> did bring much more ſorrow to that Citie, then the victorie of <hi>Carrauaggio</hi> had giuen gladneſſe. The chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates lamented, the people were ſorrowfull, the women and children wept, and all with one voyce, called the Earle diſloyall and traytour. For although they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued not, either by intreatie or promiſes, to diuert him from his vnthankful intent, yet ſent they Embaſſadors to ſee with what face, and with what words, hee would maintaine his wickedneſſe. Who being come to the preſence of the Earle,<note place="margin">The Oration of the Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſi to the Earle.</note> one of them ſpake to this effect. Thoſe that deſire to obtaine any thing of others, were wont by entreatie, gifts, or threatnings, to perſwade them. So that, either by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14349:84"/>
by profit, or feare, they might compaſſe the thing which they deſired. But of cruell men, &amp; couetous, being in their owne opinion mightie (thoſe three means not preuailing) nothing is obteined: ſo as whoſoeuer doth truſt by entreatie to make them pittifull, or by gifts to winne them, or by threatnings to feare them, deceiueth himſelfe. We therefore now knowing (though all too late) thy crueltie, thy ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thy pride, are come vnto thee, not requiring any thing, nor hoping (though we had ſuch deſire) to obteine it, but to put thee in remembrance what benefites thou haſt receiued of the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> and laie before thee, with what ingratitude thou doeſt requite them. To the end, that among ſo many iniuries by vs endured, wee may take this only pleaſure, to reproue thee. Thou oughtſt to remember wel, what thy ſtate and condition was, after the death of Duke <hi>Philippo.</hi> Thou wert enemie to the Pope and the King. Thou wert abandoned by the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> who either iuſtly offended with thee, or hauing no more neede of thee, wert become as their enemy. Thou wert weary of the war which thou hadſt made with the church; Thou hadſt fewe men, fewe friends, litle money, and bereft of all hope to be able to hold thine owne countrey, and thy auncient reputation: which ſhould eaſily haue bene taken from thee, had not our ſimplicitie helped. For we onely receiued thee, perſwaded with the reuerence we bare to the happie memorie of our Duke, vnto whom thou (being allied) didſt make vs belieue, that his loue would haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his heires. And ſith to his benefits, we ioyned ours, that fauour and friendſhip ought to haue bene, not onely firme, but alſo inſeparable. In reſpect whereof, to the auncient compoſition, we ioyned <hi>Verona</hi> &amp; <hi>Breſcia.</hi> What could we more giue thee or promiſe thee? And what couldſt thou either of vs or any others, in thoſe dayes either haue or deſire more? Thou haſt receiued of vs a pleaſure vnlooked for, and we for recompence, haue receiued of thee, a diſpleaſure not deſerued. Neither haſt thou deferred thus long to ſhew thy pride. For thou wert no ſooner General of our Armie, but contrary to iuſtice thou didſt receiue <hi>Pauia:</hi> which ought to haue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs, to what end thy friendſhip tended. Which iniurie we bare, ſuppoſing that victorie with the greatneſſe thereof, would haue ſatisfied thy ambition. But (alaſſe) thoſe who deſire all, cannot with inough be contented. Thou didſt promiſe that we ſhould enioy all things after that time by thee wonne. For thou kneweſt well, that which thou gaueſt at many times, thou mighteſt reſume at once: as it came to paſſe after the victorie of <hi>Carrauaggio</hi>; which being begun with bloud &amp; mony, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter followed with our deſtruction. O how vnhappie are thoſe Cities which be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to defend their liberties: againſt the ambition of all thoſe that wold oppreſſe them: but much more vnhappy be they that are inforced to imploy in their defence, mercinarie and diſloyall ſouldiers, ſuch as thou art. God graunt that this our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be a warning to others hereafter: ſith that of <hi>Thebe</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macidon,</hi> hath not warned vs. Who hauing wonne victorie of their enemies, became of their owne Captaine, firſt their enemie, and after their Prince. We may not therefore be blamed of other fault, then to haue truſted too much in thee, whom we ought not to haue truſted at all. For thy former life, &amp; thy inſatiable mind, not contented with any honour or eſtate, might haue forewarned vs. Neither ought we to haue repoſed any truſt in thee, who had betraied the Lord of <hi>Lucca,</hi> fleeſed the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> litle eſteemed the Duke, nor regarded the King, and aboue all, with many iniuries offended God and his Church. Neither ought we euer to haue beleeued, that ſo many Princes had leſſe power of <hi>Franceſco Sforza,</hi> then the <hi>Milaneſi</hi>; or that he would keep his faith to vs, which to ſo many others he had broken. But this our ſmall wiſdom which we do blame in our ſelues, doth not excuſe thy breach of faith, nor purge thee of thoſe infamies, which our iuſt complaints ſhall diſperſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14349:84"/>
the world. Neither can it be, but that the pricke of thine owne conſcience will perſecute thee. For thoſe Armes which were prepared by vs, to aſſault others, muſt now by thy meanes offend our ſelues: ſo as thou wilt iudge thy ſelfe worthie of that puniſhment which murtherers haue deſerued. If ambition hath blinded thee, all the world being witneſſe of thy wickedneſſe, will force thee to open thine eyes. God alſo will cauſe thee to behold thy periuries, thy faith broken, &amp; thy treaſons. Which things ſo greatly diſpleaſe him, that although hitherto, for ſome hidden good, hee hath not puniſhed, yet will he neuer fauour men ſo impiouſly diſpoſed. Do not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſe thy ſelfe a victorie certaine, ſith the iuſt ire of God will impeach it, and we are determined with loſſe of libertie to loſe our liues. Which if we be not able to defend, then haue we rather to ſubmit our ſelues to anie other Prince then to thy ſelfe. For if our ſinnes be ſuch, as againſt our willes we muſt fall into thy hands, be aſſured, a dominion begunne with craft and infamie, ſhall either in thee or thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ende with diſhonour and ſhame. The Earle notwithſtanding he felt himſelfe by the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> many waies touched, yet ſhewed he no extraordinarie chaunge, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or Ieſture: but anſwered hee was content to beare their chollor,<note place="margin">The Earles anſwere.</note> and the great iniurie of their vnwiſe words. Whereunto he would anſwere particuler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they were before a Iudge indifferent to determine the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie. For it ſhould appeare that he had not offended the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> but prouided that they ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie him. And well he knew, after the victorie of <hi>Carrauaggio</hi> what they had done: when in ſtead of rewarding him with <hi>Verona</hi> or <hi>Breſcia,</hi> they ſought to make peace with the <hi>Venetians.</hi> To the end, that vpon him onely the diſpleaſure ſhould be laide: and they to enioy the profit of the victorie, with the honor of the peace, and all the commoditie reaped by the warre. So as they had no cauſe to complaine, though he had made that compoſition which they practiſed to bring to paſſe. Which reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being deferred, they were as much to blame their owne ingratitude, as find fault with him: and whether this were true or not, that God (whom they had called to reuenge their iniuries) would by the end of the war ſhew whom he moſt fauoured, or which partie did fight with moſt iuſtice. The Embaſſadours being departed, the Earle prepared to aſſaile the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> and they made readie for defence. Then with the vertue of <hi>Franceſco</hi> and <hi>Giacopo Piccinino</hi> (who for the auncient hatred the <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſchi</hi> bare to the <hi>Sforzeſchi,</hi> had bene to the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> faithfull) they hoped to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their libertie: at the leaſt, till ſuch time as they might diſunite the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Earle, who they thought would not be long his friends nor faithfull. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the Earle knowing thereof, ſuppoſed it was wiſedome, to binde the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by reward, which would holde ſure, though the bond of friendſhip were too weake. And therfore in giuing order for the war, he was content that they ſhould aſſault <hi>Crema,</hi> and hee with other forces would ſet vppon the reſt of that countrey. This compoſition laide before the <hi>Venetians,</hi> was the occaſion that they continued ſo long in the Earles friendſhip, till he had ſurprized all the dominion of the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> and diſtreſſed the Towne ſo neare, as the dwellers therein could not make prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things neceſſarie. In ſo much, as diſpairing of all other aide, they ſent Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to <hi>Venice,</hi> deſiring the <hi>Senate</hi> to haue compaſsion of their eſtate,<note place="margin">Expoſtulation of the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, to the Senate of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</note> and be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (according to the cuſtome of Common-weales) to fauour libertie, and disfauor a Tyrant. Who preuailing and become Lord of <hi>Milan,</hi> could not be by the <hi>Venetians</hi> eaſily brideled. For they beleeued not, that he was content with the auncient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the ſtate, but aſpired further. The <hi>Venetians</hi> not hauing yet the poſſeſsion of <hi>Crema</hi> (which before they chaunged countenance, they determined to haue) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered publikely, that in reſpect of the contract made with the Earle, they might not helpe the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> yet priuately they enterteined the Embaſſadors with hope,

that a compoſition was likely to be made, and then, they ſhould aſſure their <hi>Senate</hi> to truſt vnto them. The Earle with his men was alreadie ſo near <hi>Milan,</hi> as they aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſuburbes, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> hauing taken <hi>Crema,</hi> thought good no longer to deferre the aiding of the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> with whom they compounded. Among the firſt Articles, they promiſed by all meanes to defend their libertie. This new contract made,<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans deſirous to abandon the Earle.</note> they commaunded that all their ſouldiers ſeruing vnder the Earle, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, and retire themſelues to the <hi>Venetians</hi> Campe. They alſo ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earle, the peace concluded with the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> to whom they had giuen twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie daies ſpace to accept it. The Earle maruelled not at this reſolution taken by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> becauſe that long before he had foreſeene it, and looked the ſame ſhould euerie day come to paſſe. Yet could he not but be ſorie, and feele the ſame offence, which the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> did, when he abandoned them. For anſwering of the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors ſent from <hi>Venice</hi> to declare the League, he tooke the leiſure of two daies. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, he determined to enterteine the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and not abandon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. And therefore publikely ſaid, he would allow the peace, and ſent Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Venice,</hi> with a large Commiſsion to ratifie the ſame: yet ſecretly he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, not to conclude, but with delaies and cauillations, to deferre the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And to make the <hi>Venetians</hi> the rather beleeue, that which hee ſpake, hee made truce with the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> for one moneth: retyring his Campe farre from the Citie, and diuiding his forces into other places neare hand, which he had lately wonne. This practiſe was occaſion of his victorie, for the <hi>Venetians</hi> truſting to the peace, were more ſlow in preparation to the warre, and the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> ſeeing the truce made, the enemie farre off, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> their friends, beleeued aſſuredly that the Earle would abandon the enterpriſe. Which determination, by two means hindred them. The firſt was, becauſe they neglected to prepare for their own defence. The other, for that they laid the countrey open to the enemie. For the time then being fit to till the earth, they ſowed great ſtore of corne: by meane whereof, the Earle might the more eaſily famiſh them. To the Earle on the other ſide, all thoſe thinges helped, which hindered the enemie: and beſides the delaie gaue him commoditie to take breath, and prouide for aide. In all this warre of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> were not diſcouered to be of any ſide, nor to haue fauoured the Earle, either when he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> nor after. For the Earle hauing had no need, did not verie ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlie ſeeke it. Onely after the ouerthrow of <hi>Carrauaggio,</hi> by vertue of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in the League, they ſent aide to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> But the Earle <hi>Franceſco</hi> being alone, and wanting other refuge, was enforced inſtantly to praie aide of the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coſimo de Medici, friend to the Earle Franceſco.</note> both of the ſtate publikely, &amp; of his friends priuately: chiefly of <hi>Coſimo de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici,</hi> with whom he had euer bene in great familiaritie, and was by him in all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions faithfully counſelled, and liberally ſupplied. Neither did <hi>Coſimo</hi> in this ſo great a neceſsitie forſake him: for as a priuate man he bountifully releeued him, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the enterpriſe encouraged him. Hee alſo entreated the Cittie publikely to aſsiſt him where need required. At that time liued in <hi>Florence, Neri</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Gino Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni,</hi> a Citizen of great power, who thought it not good for the Citie, that the Earle ſhould poſſeſſe <hi>Milan,</hi> ſuppoſing it more profitable for <hi>Italy,</hi> that hee ſhould ratifie the peace,<note place="margin">Neri Cappo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni againſt the Earle.</note> then proſecute the warre. Firſt he doubted leaſt the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure they bare to the Earle, would yeeld wholly to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which would be the ruine of euerie man. Then he iudged if the Earle ſhould happen to ſurprize <hi>Milan,</hi> that ſo great forces and countries ioyned togither, were to be feared. And if he were inſupportable, being an Earle, aſpired to the title of Duke, no man ſhould endure his pride. Wherefore, he thought better both for the Common-weale of <hi>Florence,</hi> and all <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Earle ſhould continue with his reputation in Armes,

And in that choyſe, there was no man ſo witleſſe, that knew not whether it were better to haue at hand a mightie neighbour, or a more mightie enemie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he thinke it to be doubted, that the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> (for hauing warre with the Earle) would yeeld their obedience to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> For the Earle hauing a factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Milan,</hi> &amp; not they, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer they could not defend themſelues as free, they wold rather yeeld to the Earle, then to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Theſe diuerſities of opinions held the citie doubtful what to determine.

His aduiſe therefore was, that the campe ſhould not diſlodge, wherby the <hi>Milaneſi</hi> might ſtil hope of ayd, and not by diſpair yeeld them to the Earle. This opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was by the <hi>Venetians</hi> allowed, as wel in reſpect of ſecuritie, as that they thought the <hi>Milaneſi,</hi> being in ſo great neceſsitie, ſhould be enforced to yeeld to their dominion, perſuaded that they wold neuer giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the Earle, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had bin many waies iniured.

Others drew vnto them, till they were a good number. Therby a brute was blowne through <hi>Milan,</hi> that the inhabitants neare to the new gate were alreadie in Armes. Then all the multitude (which aſpected onely occaſion) tooke Armes and created <hi>Gaſparo da Vicomercato</hi> their Captain, &amp; went to the place where the magiſtrates were aſſembled: whom they ſo terrified, that ſo many as could, did flee, the reſt were ſlain. Among whom <hi>Leonardo Veniero,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador was murthered: who had before that time reioyced at their miſerie, and was thought to haue bene the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the miſchiefe and famine. Thus the multitude (as Lords of the Citie) among themſelues conſulted, what was to be done, to deliuer them from ſo manifold ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, wherinto they were entred. And euery man thought good to yeeld the citie (ſith the libertie could not be preſerued) to ſome Prince that were able to defend it.

And therfore being forced to depart with libertie, it was beſt to yeeld to ſuch a one, as could &amp; would defend it. So as by that ſeruitude, they might at the leaſt gain peace without further loſſe, or war more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. This ſpeech was with great attentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hearkned vnto, &amp; euery man with one voice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented that the Earle ſhould be choſen, and <hi>Gaſparo</hi> was made Embaſſador to call him: who by commandement of the people, went vnto the Earle to preſent him this pleaſant &amp; happie newes.

Theſe Embaſſadors were by the Duke honorably receiued, &amp; bountifully entertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For he knew wel that againſt the power of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he could not find in all <hi>Italy,</hi> more faithful nor more mighty friends, then the <hi>Florentins.</hi> Who hauing remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued feare of the <hi>Viſconti,</hi> thought they ſhould be forced to fight with <hi>Aragon</hi> &amp; <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> Becauſe the houſe of <hi>Aragon</hi> then Kings of <hi>Naples,</hi> was their enemie in reſpect of the friendſhip by them borne to the houſe of <hi>France</hi>: and the <hi>Venetians</hi> knew that the auncient feare of the <hi>Viſconti,</hi> was freſh, and that carefully they had perſecuted them; wherefore doubting the like perſecution, ſought their ruine. Theſe matters were the occaſion that the new Duke was eaſily induced to friend the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and that the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the King <hi>Alfonſo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo and the Venetians.</note> agreed to ioyne againſt their common enemie: binding themſelues at one ſelfe time, to take armes; &amp; that the King ſhould aſſault the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſet vpon the Duke. Who being new in the ſtate, was not (as they thought) neither able with his owne forces to withſtand them, nor with the aide of others could be defended. Yet becauſe the league betwixt the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> continued, and that the King after the warres of <hi>Piombino</hi> had made peace with them, they thought not good to breake that peace,<note place="margin">Embaſſadors from Venice to Florence.</note> till ſuch time as they had ſome colour to make warre. Wherefore both the one &amp; the other, ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> to ſignifie in the behalf of their Lords, that the league was made not to offend any man, but to defend their Countries.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14349:87"/>
And moreouer the <hi>Venetians</hi> complained, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> had giuen paſſage to <hi>Aliſandro,</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Lunigiana,</hi> whereby he with his forces paſſed into <hi>Lombardy:</hi> and that they were alſo the Authors and Councellours, to make the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt the Duke and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua.</hi> All which things (they ſaid) were preiudiciall to their ſtate, and the friendſhip betwixt them. Whereſore friendly wiſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to remember, that who ſo offendeth an other wrongfully, doth giue occaſion to him that is offended, iuſtly to ſeek reuenge: and he that breaketh the peace, muſt euer looke to find war.<note place="margin">The Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor anſwered.</note> The anſwer of this Embaſſage was by the <hi>Senate</hi> committed to <hi>Coſimo:</hi> who in a long and wiſe Oration, laid before them all the beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which his citie had beſtowed vpon the <hi>Venetian</hi> common-weale. Declaring how great dominion they had wonne by means of the mony, the men, &amp; counſel, of the <hi>Florentines.</hi> And aſſured them, that ſith the <hi>Florentines</hi> did occaſion the friendſhip, no cauſe of warre ſhould euer proceed from them. For they hauing bene euer louers of peace, commended greatly the agreement betwixt them, ſo as for peace, and not for war the ſame were made. But he maruelled much of the <hi>Venetian</hi> complaints, &amp; that of ſo ſmall &amp; vain matters, ſo great a common-weale wold make account. But if they had bene worthie conſideration, yet was it knowne to the world, that the <hi>Florentine</hi> country was free, and open to all men, and the Duke was ſuch a one as to win friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>Mantoua,</hi> had no need, either of counſel or fauour. Wherfore he doubted, that theſe complaints, had vnder them hidden, ſome ſecret poiſon not yet perceiued. Which ſo being, euery man ſhould eaſily vnderſtand, that as the <hi>Florentines</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did profit them, ſo their diſpleaſure could hinder them. Thus for that time the matter was lightly paſſed ouer, &amp; the Embaſſadors ſeemed to depart wel inough co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. Notwithſtanding, the league being made, the maner of the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Kings proceedings, did occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Florentines</hi> &amp; the Duke, rather to looke for ſome new war, then hope of firme peace.<note place="margin">League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Florentines and Duke.</note> Therefore the <hi>Florentines</hi> ioyned in league with the Duke, &amp; in the mean while, the euil diſpoſition of the <hi>Venetians</hi> was diſcouered: becauſe they made league with the <hi>Saneſi,</hi> &amp; baniſhed all the <hi>Florentines,</hi> with euery other perſon ſubiect to the ſtate of <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> Shortly after, the king <hi>Alfonſo</hi> did the like, without any reſpect to the peace made the yeare before, &amp; without iuſt cauſe or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured occaſion. The <hi>Venetians</hi> laboured to gain the poſſeſsion of <hi>Bologna</hi> &amp; for that purpoſe aided the baniſhed men of that Citie, who with many others, found means in the night to enter the towne. They were no ſooner within the walles, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues made an Alarum. Whereat <hi>Santi Bentiuogli</hi> ſuddeinly ſtart vp, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Citie was ſurprized by Rebels: (although hee were by many friendes counſelled, by fleeing to ſaue his life) yet would he in any wiſe ſhew his face to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, take armes, and encourage others to do the like. He therefore with ſome others, made head &amp; aſſaulted part of the Rebels, and brake them, ſleying many, and forcing the reſt to flee the Citie. Whereuppon euery man iudged, that hee had made good proofe to be of the right race of <hi>Bentiuogli.</hi> Theſe actions,<note place="margin">Preparation for warre in Florence.</note> brought vnto <hi>Florence</hi> a firme beliefe of the future warre. Therefore the <hi>Florentines</hi> reſorting to their aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent orders, created the ten Magiſtrates for the war, entertained new Captaines, ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> and to <hi>Siena,</hi> procure aid of their friends, diſcouer ſuſpects, gaine the good will of thoſe that were neutrall, and ſounde the determination of enemies. Of the Pope they could get nothing but general words, curteſie, and perſwaſion to peace. Of the King they vnderſtood only his vaine excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for diſcharging the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and offered to giue ſafe conduct to euerie man that deſired it. And albeit he went about by all meanes, to conceale the intention of the new warre, yet the Embaſſadours knewe well his euill meaning, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected manie dealinges of his, to the diſaduauntage of their Common-weale.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14349:88"/>
With the Duke they renewed the League, fortifying the ſame with ſundrie Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations: and by his meanes gained the good will of the <hi>Genoueſi:</hi> cancelling all former quarrels. Notwithſtanding that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had laboured manie wayes, to impeach that compoſition, and intreated the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from his countries all the <hi>Florentine</hi> Nation. So greatly they grew into hate by this war, and ſo great force had their deſire of gouernment, as without reſpect, they ſought to oppreſſe thoſe who were the cauſe of their greatneſſe. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by that Emperour they were not hearkened vnto. The Embaſſadours for the <hi>Florentines,</hi> were by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate forbidden to enter into their Countrey: alleaging that they being in league with the King, might not (without his priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) giue them audience. The <hi>Saneſi</hi> enterteined the Embaſſadours with curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words, fearing to be ſurprized before the league could defende them: and therefore thought good not to ſtirre thoſe Armes, which they were not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. The <hi>Venetians</hi> and the King (as was then coniectured) would haue ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to <hi>Florence,</hi> to iuſtifie the warre. But the Embaſſadour for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> would not enter into the <hi>Florentines</hi> dominion, and the Kings Embaſſador durſt not alone execute that meſſage. Whereby the Embaſſage was not performed. And the <hi>Venetians</hi> by meanes thereof, knew that they were litle eſteemed of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> they (a few months paſt) eſteemed not much. During the feare of theſe motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour <hi>Federigo</hi> the third,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Federigo in Florence.</note> came into <hi>Italy</hi> to be crowned, the thirtie day of Ianuary, in the yeare 1451. And entring into <hi>Florence</hi> with a thouſand fiue hundred horſes, was by that Cittie, moſt honourably receiued and enterteined, till the ſixt of February. At which time hee tooke his iourney from thence towards his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was ſolemnely Crowned and married to the Empreſſe, being come thither by ſea. Theſe ceremonies performed, the Emperour returned towards <hi>Germany,</hi> and came againe to <hi>Florence</hi> in the moneth of May: where he was vſed with the ſame honours he had there before receiued. Alſo in his returne, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene pleaſured by the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara,</hi> for recompence the Emperour granted vnto him the Cities of <hi>Modina</hi> &amp; <hi>Reggio.</hi> During all theſe doings, the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> omitted not their preparation for the war, giuing themſelues reputation, and the enemie terror. They and the Duke ioyned league with the French King, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of all their countries in generall. Which league with great magnificence and reioycing, they publiſhed throughout all <hi>Italy.</hi> By this time was come the yere 1452. when in May, the <hi>Venetians</hi> thought good no longer to deferre the warre againſt the Duke.<note place="margin">The Duke of Milan aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Wherefore with ſixteene thouſand horſe, and ſixe thouſand footemen, they aſſaulted him towards <hi>Lodi:</hi> and at the ſame time the Marqueſſe of <hi>Monferato,</hi> either prouoked by his owne ambition, or by the <hi>Venetians</hi> requeſt, aſſaulted him on the other ſide, towards <hi>Aleſſandria.</hi> The Duke on the contrary part, had aſſembled eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thouſand horſe, and three thouſand footemen. And hauing furniſhed <hi>Aleſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> and <hi>Lodi,</hi> he likewiſe fortified all thoſe places which the enemie might offend. Then with his ſouldiers he aſſaulted the country of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> where he greatly dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſpoiling that countrey, and ſacking thoſe townes which were not ſtrong. But the Marqueſſe of <hi>Monferato</hi> being broken by the Dukes forces at <hi>Aleſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> the Duke might with the more ſtrength encounter the <hi>Venetians,</hi> &amp; aſſault their country. Thus the war of <hi>Lombardy</hi> proceeding, &amp; therin ſundry accidents (not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie memorie) hapning: it came to paſſe, that the like war begun in <hi>Toſcana</hi> betwixt the King <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Florentines:</hi> which was performed with no more vertue, nor more peril,<note place="margin">Foiano aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Ferran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bardy.

way enter into the territorie of <hi>Florence.</hi> That Caſtle was weakly walled, and of ſmal receipt, therefore with no great number defended, yet thoſe few in the Caſtle were accounted at that time valiant and loyall ſouldiers. The number ſent by the <hi>Senate</hi> to guard that Caſtle, were 200. This Caſtle in that ſort prepared, was by <hi>Ferrando</hi> beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and the vertue of thoſe within ſo great, and ſo litle the value of them without, that till the end of 36. dayes it was not wonne. The protract of which time, gaue the Cittie commoditie to prouide to defend other places of more moment, to aſſemble their forces, &amp; put them in readineſſe. The enemy hauing take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Caſtle, paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Chianti,</hi> where they ſet vpon two ſmall towns belonging to priuate men, &amp; could not win them; but marched from thence, and beſieged <hi>Castellina,</hi> a fortreſſe ſeated vpon the confines of <hi>Chianti,</hi> within ten myles of <hi>Siena</hi>; which place both by Art and Nature is exceeding weake: notwithſtanding (ſo baſe was the courage of this Campe) as it could not conquere that Caſtle of no force at all. For after they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged it 44. dayes, they departed thence with ſhame. So ſmal terror was in thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſo litle peril in thoſe wars, as thoſe townes which at this day are abandoned as impoſsible to be kept, at that time, as places impregnable, were defended. During that <hi>Ferrando</hi> remained with his Camp in <hi>Chianti,</hi> he made many roades into the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> country, ſpoiling that Prouince within ſixe miles of the Cittie, to the great loſſe and terror of the <hi>Florentine</hi> ſubiects. Who hauing by that time prepared forces to the number of eight thouſand, vnder the conduct of <hi>Aſtore di Faenza,</hi> and <hi>Giſmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Malatesti,</hi> held the enemie aloofe towards the Caſtle of <hi>Colle,</hi> fearing alwaies they ſhould be forced to fight, and thought, that if they loſt not that day, they could not loſe the warre. Becauſe the ſmall Caſtles being loſt, might be recouered by peace, and the great townes were aſſured, by reaſon the enemie was not able to aſſaile them. The King had alſo vpon the ſea neare to <hi>Piſa,</hi> twentie ſaile of Gallies and Foyſts. And while <hi>La Castellina</hi> was aſſaulted, that Nauie battered the fortreſſe of <hi>Vade,</hi> which through the ſmall diligence of the Captaine was taken.

This <hi>Steffano</hi> was perſwaded, that Poettes many times were inſpired with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſpirite of propheſie: Whereof hee conceiued, that fortune would aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14349:89"/>
happen vnto him, which <hi>Petrarcha</hi> had in his verſes prophecied, and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was the man, that ſhould be the executor of ſo glorious an enterpriſe: imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that for eloquence, for learning, for fauour, and friends, there was no <hi>Romane</hi> to him comparable. This conceipt poſſeſsing him, he reſolued to execute the ſame; yet could he not ſo ſecretly practiſe, but by words, by conuerſation, and his manner of life, ſomewhat was diſcouered, and by that mean became ſuſpected to the Pope: who (to remooue him from the commoditie of doing harme) confined him to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> and commaunded the Gouernor of that Citie euerie day to ſee him. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Steffano</hi> for this firſt diſgrace, diſmaied not; but with the more endeuour followed his enterpriſe: and by all ſecret &amp; ſubtill meanes practiſed with his friends, going to <hi>Rome,</hi> and returning with ſuch ſpeed, as he might at times neceſſarie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe to the Gouernour. And ſo ſoone as hee had drawne a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men to be of his minde, determined without further delaie to attempt the enterpriſe: giuing order to his friends in <hi>Rome,</hi> that at a time prefixed, they ſhould prepare a ſolemne ſupper, where all the conſpirators ſhould meete, and euerie man bring with him his aſſured friends, and hee himſelfe before the ſupper were ended, would be there alſo. All things were done according to appointment, and <hi>Steffano</hi> arriued at the feaſt. After ſupper, apparrelled himſelfe in cloath of gold, and other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, which gaue him Maieſtie and reputation. In that ſort, he came forth to the conſpirators, embracing them, &amp; perſwading them with long ſpeech to be reſolute, and readie to performe ſo glorious an attempt. Then he deuiſed the order therof, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing part of them, the next morning to ſurprize the Popes Pallace, &amp; the reſt to call the people to armes. The ſame night (as ſome ſay) through infidelitie of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, the matter was reuealed to the Pope. Others affirme, that it came to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by thoſe that ſawe <hi>Steffano</hi> come into <hi>Rome.</hi> But howſoeuer it were, the ſame night after ſupper, the Pope cauſed <hi>Steffano,</hi> with the moſt part of his companions to be apprehended,<note place="margin">Steffano put to death.</note> and according to their merits put to death. Such was the end of this his enterpriſe. It may be, that ſome wil commend his intention, yet wil his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all men be reproued. Becauſe this and ſuch like enterpriſes, although they carry with them a ſhadow of glorie, yet in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bring (almoſt euer) aſſured miſaduenture. The war had now continued in <hi>Toſcana</hi> almoſt one whole yeare, and the armies were returned to the field, in the yeare 1454. At which time, <hi>Aliſandro Sforza</hi> was come to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> with ſupply of two thouſand horſe. Wherby the <hi>Florentine</hi> army was wel encreaſed, and the Kings Camp diminiſhed. The <hi>Florentines</hi> thought good to recouer ſome things by them loſt, &amp; ſo with ſmall labor gained the poſſeſsion of certaine Townes. Afterwardes they incamped before <hi>Foiano,</hi> which through negligence of the Commiſſaries, was ſacked: and the inhabitans being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed, wold not willingly return thither, til ſuch time as by priuiledges &amp; rewards they were allured. The fortreſſe of <hi>Vada,</hi> was alſo recouered: For the enemies ſeeing they could not defend it, did preſently abandon &amp; burn it. During the time that theſe things were done by the <hi>Florentine</hi> army, the Kings ſouldiers fearing to come neare their enemies, retired themſelues towards <hi>Siena,</hi> many times ſpoiling the <hi>Florentines</hi> country, committing robberies, tumults, and exceeding great diſpleaſures. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe that King omitted not to deuiſe ſome other way to aſſault the enemies, to cut off their forces, or by new troubles &amp; aſſaults to keep them occupied. <hi>Gherardo Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacorti</hi> was Lord in the vale of <hi>Bagno.</hi> He and his aunceſtors either by friendſhip or by obligation, had alwaies in times paſt, either as hired, or as recommended, ſerued the <hi>Florentines.</hi> With him the King <hi>Alfonſo</hi> practiſed to haue that countrey, and offred in recompence therof, an other in the kingdome. This practiſe was diſcouered at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> yet to ſound the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Gherardo,</hi> they ſent an Embaſſador to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber him
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14349:89"/>
of the obligation of his anceſtors, and his owne alſo, and therewith to perſuade him to continue his fidelitie towards that Commonweale. <hi>Gherardo</hi> ſeemed to meruaile much at this meſſage, &amp; with great othes proteſted, that neuer any diſloiall thought had entred his minde; and that he would come vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> and make his owne perſon a pledge of his fidelitie: neuertheleſſe, being at that preſent ſick, he could not goe thither, but with the Embaſſador would needs ſend his ſonne to remaine in <hi>Florence</hi> as an hoſtage. Theſe words, &amp; this demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration brought the <hi>Florentines</hi> to beleeue, that <hi>Gherardo</hi> had ſaid troth, and his accuſer being accounted a lier, was not regarded, nor the accuſation any more thought vpon. Notwithſtanding, <hi>Gherardo</hi> being ſtill ſollicited by the King, at length conſented to the practiſe. And hauing concluded the ſame, the King ſent to the Vale of <hi>Bagno</hi> a Knight of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> called <hi>Puccio,</hi> and with him diuerſe bands of ſouldiers, to take poſſeſsion of the Caſtles and Townes belonging to <hi>Gherardo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Vale of Bagno reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Florentines.</note> But thoſe people of <hi>Bagno</hi> being affectionate to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> verie vnwillinglie promiſed their obedience to the Kings Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. <hi>Puccio</hi> hauing taken poſſeſsion of all that ſtate, wanted onely to poſſeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the fortreſſe of <hi>Corzano.</hi> When <hi>Gherardo</hi> deliuered this poſſeſsion, there was preſent among many others, one called <hi>Antonio Gualandi</hi> of <hi>Piſa,</hi> a yong man verie valiant, and ſuch a one, as was with the treaſon of <hi>Gherardo</hi> greatly diſcontented. He conſidering the ſcite of the fortreſſes, and finding by the countenance of thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who guarded it, that they were likewiſe diſpleaſed. While <hi>Gherardo</hi> ſtood at the gate to let in the Kings ſouldiers, <hi>Antonio</hi> came betwixt him and the Caſtle, and with both his hands forcibly thruſt him out, commaunding the Guard to ſhut the gates againſt ſo wicked a Traytor, and keepe the ſame to the vſe of the <hi>Florentines.</hi> This rumor being heard in the Vale of <hi>Bagno,</hi> and other places neare vnto it, all the people tooke armes againſt the King, and followed the <hi>Florentines</hi> enſigne. This matter aduertiſed to <hi>Florence,</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> cauſed the ſonne of <hi>Gherardo</hi> (remaining with them in hoſtage) to be put in priſon: and ſent ſouldiers to <hi>Bagno</hi> to defend the countrey for them, changing that gouernment from a principalitie into a <hi>Vicariato.</hi> But <hi>Gherardo,</hi> hauing thus betraied both his Lords and his owne ſonne, with great difficultie fled, leauing his wife, his daughter, and his ſubſtance, at the diſcretion of the enemy. This accident ſtood the <hi>Florentines</hi> greatly in ſtead: For if the King had poſſeſſed that Countrey, he might with ſmall charge, and eaſily haue gotten the Vale of <hi>Teueri,</hi> and ſpoiled <hi>Caſentino,</hi> whereby he ſhould haue ſo much troubled the ſtate, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> could not haue bene able to encounter the forces of <hi>Arragon</hi> which remained at <hi>Siena.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> beſides their owne preparation in <hi>Italy,</hi> the rather to oppreſſe their enemies,<note place="margin">Rinato de Angio called into Italy by the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> had ſent <hi>Agnolo Acciaiuoili</hi> Embaſſador to the French King, to perſwade him to licence <hi>Rinato de Angio,</hi> to come in the aide of the Duke and them. By which meanes he ſhould defend his friends, and afterwards being in <hi>Italy,</hi> attend the ſurprizing of the Kingdome: whereunto they offered him aide both of men and money. During the warres in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and in <hi>Toſcana</hi> (as is before ſaid) the Embaſſador concluded with King <hi>Rinato</hi> of <hi>Angio,</hi> that before the end of Iune, he ſhould come into <hi>Italy</hi> with two thouſand and foure hundred horſe: and that at his arriuall in <hi>Aleſſandria,</hi> the League ſhould giue him thirtie thouſand Florins readie paiment: and euery moneth after, during the warres, tenne thouſand. The King then by vertue of this league, comming into <hi>Italy,</hi> was by the Duke of <hi>Sauoia,</hi> and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Monferato</hi> impeached: for they being friends to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> would not permit him to paſſe. Whereupon the King was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Embaſſador of <hi>Florence,</hi> to returne to <hi>Prouenza</hi> with certaine of his army, and from thence to paſſe into <hi>Italy</hi> by ſea. And on the other ſide, to perſwade with the French King to procure ſo much fauour of that Duke, that the reſt of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14349:90"/>
might come through <hi>Sauoia.</hi> According to this counſell the matter was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the King <hi>Rinato</hi> went by Sea into <hi>Italy,</hi> conueying the reſt of his Army through <hi>Sauoia</hi> by the French Kings mediation. The King <hi>Rinato</hi> was by the Duke <hi>Franceſco</hi> moſt honorably receiued, and hauing ioyned the <hi>Italian</hi> forces with the Kings, they aſſaulted the <hi>Venetians</hi> with ſo great furie, that within ſhort ſpace they recouered all thoſe Townes in <hi>Cremoneſi</hi> which they had before loſt: and not ſo content, they ſurprized almoſt all the countrey of <hi>Breſcia.</hi> The <hi>Venetian</hi> army fearing to tarry in the field, retired to the walles of <hi>Breſcia.</hi> But the winter being come, the Duke thought good to withdraw his ſouldiers to their lodgings, appointing for the Kings aboad, the Cittie of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> where he remained all that winter, in the yeare 1453. without any other action performed. So ſoone as the time of yeare ſerued, and that the Duke was going to the field, in hope to diſpoſſeſſe the <hi>Venetians,</hi> of the reſt of their Countries vpon the firme land, the King <hi>Rinato</hi> ſignified vnto him, that of neceſsitie he was to returne into <hi>Fraunce.</hi> This intention of the Kings, ſeemed to the Duke not onely ſtrange, but alſo vnlooked for, and therefore greatly offended him: and albeit he went in perſon preſently to diſſwade him, yet neither his intreatie nor promiſes could take effect; but onely promiſed to leaue behinde him part of his forces, and to ſend his ſonne <hi>Giouanni</hi> to ſupplie his place in ſeruice of the League. This reſolution grieued not the <hi>Florentines,</hi> for they hauing recouered their Caſtles, feared not the King any longer. And on the other ſide, they deſired that the Duke ſhould not recouer more, then the townes in <hi>Lombrdy</hi> to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. The King <hi>Rinato</hi> being gone, ſent according to promiſe his ſonne into <hi>Italy,</hi> who ſtayed not in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> but went preſently vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> where he was very honorably receiued. The matter thus handled by the King, did occaſion the Duke to be content with peace, and the <hi>Venetians, Alfonſo,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> being likewiſe wearied, deſired the ſame. The Pope alſo by all meanes laboured to bring it to paſſe, bicauſe the ſame yeare <hi>Mahumetto</hi> the great Turk had taken <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and made himſelfe Lord of all <hi>Greece:</hi> which victorie terrified greatly all Chriſtians, but chiefely the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Pope, who thought <hi>Italy</hi> was thereby in great danger. The Pope therefore deſired the Potentates of <hi>Italy</hi> to ſend Embaſſadors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, with authoritie to eſtabliſh an vniuerſall peace; which commiſsion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: and notwithſtanding that altogither they ioyned, and ſeemed all to allow of the motion, they found neuertheleſſe therein great difficultie. The King requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſhould pay his charges in the warre paſt, and the <hi>Florentines</hi> would be paid themſelues. The <hi>Venetians</hi> demaunded <hi>Cremona</hi> of the Duke, and the Duke asked of them <hi>Bergamo, Breſcia,</hi> and <hi>Crema</hi>; ſo that theſe difficulties ſeemed impoſsible to be remoued: notwithſtanding, that which at <hi>Rome</hi> ſeemed hard to be concluded, at <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> prooued eaſie. For when at <hi>Rome</hi> the peace vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall was practiſed,<note place="margin">Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Venetians and the Duke.</note> the Duke and the <hi>Venetians</hi> betwixt themſelues made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the ninth of Aprill, in the yeare 1451. By vertue whereof, euery of them ſhould repoſſeſſe thoſe townes which were theirs before the warre. And it was graunted to the Duke, that he might recouer his townes taken from him by the Lords of <hi>Monferato</hi> and <hi>Sauoia.</hi> And to the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> one moneth was allowed to ratifie the ſame. The Pope, the <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tines,</hi> the <hi>Saneſi,</hi> and the leſſer Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, within the time appointed, made their ratification. Moreouer, betwixt the <hi>Florentines,</hi> the Duke, and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> a peace was concluded for fifteene yeares. Onely the King <hi>Alfonſo</hi> among all the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes ſeemed therewith diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, bicauſe he thought it was contrary to his reputation to be named in the contract of peace, not as a principall, but as an adherent. For which conſideration, he pawſed long, before he would lay downe his reſolution. But being ſollicited by ſundrie
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14349:90"/>
ſolemne Embaſſages of other Princes, he was at length content (and chiefely by the Pope) to be perſwaded, and with his ſonne entred this league for thirtie yeares: confirming the ſame with alliances and croſſe marriages betwixt the Duke and the King, their ſonnes marrying one the others daughters. Notwithſtanding, to the end that ſome ſeeds of the warre might remaine in <hi>Italy,</hi> he conſented not to make the peace, before ſuch time as thoſe of the League would giue him leaue without their iniurie, to make warres vpon the <hi>Genoueſi, Giſmondo, Malateſti,</hi> and <hi>Aſtor</hi> Prince of <hi>Faenza.</hi> This concluſion made, <hi>Ferrando</hi> his ſonne then being at <hi>Siena,</hi> returned to the Kingdome, hauing ſithence his arriuall in <hi>Toſcana</hi> not gained any dominion, but loſt great numbers of ſouldiers. This vniuerſall peace being concluded, it was onely feared, leaſt King <hi>Alfonſo</hi> for the diſpleaſure he bare to the <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> would diſturbe the common quiet: but the matter came otherwiſe to paſſe, for the King did not openly moue any diſturbance, but (as it hath alwaies happened by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of mercinarie ſouldiers) the peace was by them interrupted. The <hi>Venetians</hi> had (as their manner is) the warres being ended, diſcharged their Generall <hi>Giacopo Piccinino,</hi> who taking vnto him certaine other Captaines (likewiſe diſcharged) went into <hi>Romagna,</hi> and from thence to the countrey of <hi>Siena:</hi> where <hi>Giacopo</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, begun the warre, and ſurprized certaine Townes belonging to the <hi>Saneſi.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Troubles mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Giaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po Piccinino, and ſupported by King Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo.</note> At the beginning of theſe troubles in the yeare 1455. died Pope <hi>Nicholo,</hi> and to him ſucceeded <hi>Caliſto tertio.</hi> This Pope, to repreſſe the new warre, aſſembled all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he was able, making <hi>Giouanni Ventimiglia</hi> his Generall; who with certaine <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> and other ſouldiers ſent from the Duke for that purpoſe, went againſt <hi>Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copo,</hi> and fought with him neare vnto <hi>Bolcena</hi>: where notwithſtanding that <hi>Venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miglia</hi> was taken priſoner, yet <hi>Giacopo</hi> had the worſt, and was forced to retire to <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lione della Piſcaia,</hi> and had he not bene by <hi>Alfonſo</hi> relieued with money, he ſhould then vtterly haue bene ouerthrowne; which reliefe, diſcouered that <hi>Giacopo</hi> had taken that enterpriſe in hand, with the priuitie and direction of that King. <hi>Alfonſo</hi> finding himſelfe diſcouered, to be reconciled to the other Princes conſenting to the peace, (whoſe fauour by meanes of this weake warre he had almoſt loſt) procured that <hi>Giacopo</hi> ſhould reſtore to the <hi>Saneſi</hi> all the townes he had taken from them, and they to giue him twentie thouſand Florins. And this agreement made, the King receiued <hi>Giacopo</hi> with his ſouldiers into the Kingdome. In thoſe dayes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Pope intended to bridle <hi>Giacopo Piccinino,</hi> yet was he mindfull alſo of the defence of Chriſtendome, likely to be oppreſſed by the Turks. For which purpoſe, he ſent into all Chriſtian Countries Embaſſadors and Preachers, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade with Princes and people, to arme themſelues for the aide of Religion,<note place="margin">Pope Caliſto perſwadeth a generall war againſt the Turks.</note> and to giue money and perſonall ſeruice to this enterpriſe, againſt the common enemy. He cauſed alſo ſolemne proceſsions to be made, declaring both publiquely and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, that he himſelfe would be among the firſt of the Chriſtians that ſhould aſsiſt that action, with counſell, money, and men. But the heate of this <hi>Crociata</hi> was coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with aduertiſements that the Turke and his army being at <hi>Bellgrado</hi> (a Caſtle of <hi>Hungary</hi> vpon the riuer of <hi>Danubio</hi>) was by the <hi>Hungarians</hi> hurt in his perſon, and his Camp broken, ſo that the Popes and Chriſtians feare, conceiued by the loſſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> was thereby ceaſed, and the preparation they made for the warre procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded coldly. In <hi>Hungary</hi> likewiſe by the death of <hi>Giouanni Vaiuoda,</hi> Captaine of that victorie, the warre was diſcontinued. But returning to the matters of <hi>Italy,</hi> I ſay, that in the yeare 1456. the tumults moued by <hi>Giacopo Piccinino</hi> were ended: ſo that euery man hauing laid aſide armes, it ſeemed as though God had taken them in hand. For there happened in <hi>Toſcana</hi> moſt tempeſtuous windes,<note place="margin">A meruailous rempeſt in Toſcana.</note> ſuch as neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had bene heard of, nor ſhall be, which wrought moſt meruailous and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14349:91"/>
effects. Vpon the 24. of Auguſt, one houre before day, there aroſe from the Sea towards <hi>Ancona</hi> a great and darke clowd, croſsing <hi>Italy,</hi> and entering the Sea towards <hi>Piſa,</hi> ſtretching two miles in compaſſe. This ſtorme was furiouſly carried, (and whither by naturall or ſupernaturall force) diuided into many parts, as it were fighting amongſt themſelues. And of thoſe broken clowds, ſome were hoiſed vp towards heauen, ſome violently caſt downe, and ſome with wonderfull ſpeed were turned round; but alwaies before them came a winde, with lightnings and flaſhing of fire, ſo terrible, as cannot be expreſſed. Of theſe broken and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed clowds, and of thoſe furious winds, and great flames, there grew ſo ſtrange a noiſe, as moued the people to greater feare, then any Earthquake or thunder euer had done: in ſo much as euery man thought the world was ended, and that the earth, the water, and the heauen, ſhould haue returned to the old <hi>Chaos.</hi> This fearefull ſtorme, whereſoeuer it paſſed, wrought meruailous and wonderfull effects. But the moſt notable of all, happened about the Caſtle of <hi>S. Caſsiano.</hi> This Caſtle is builded vpon the hill which parteth the Vales of <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Grieue,</hi> eight miles diſtant from <hi>Florence.</hi> Betwixt that ſaid Caſtle, and the towne of <hi>S. Andrea,</hi> builded vpon the ſame hill, this furious tempeſt paſſed, not comming to <hi>S. Andrea,</hi> but at <hi>S. Caſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi> threw downe certaine turrets and chimneys: and neare thereunto ſubuerted whole houſes euen to the ground, and carried away whole roofes of the Churches of <hi>S. Martino a Bagnolo,</hi> and <hi>S. Maria della pace</hi>; bearing them from thence vnbroken, the ſpace of more then one mile. One man alſo a Carrier, was taken vp, and in the valley next vnto the way, both he and his Moyles found dead. Moreouer, all the greateſt okes and ſtrongeſt trees which would not bend at the furie of the tempeſt, were not onely broken, but alſo with violence borne farre from the place where they grew. Whereat, the next day, when the tempeſt was ceaſed, and men retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to thoſe places, they were greatly aſtonied, for they found the Countrey deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and ſpoiled, the houſes and the temples ouerthrowne, the people lamenting and beholding their houſes caſt downe, and vnder them their goods, their cattle, and their parents ſlaine: Which thing, both in the beholders and hearers thereof, moued a maruellous compaſsion. By this meane, it pleaſed God rather to threaten, then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Toſcana.</hi> For if ſo great a tempeſt had fallen vpon any Citie full of houſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as it fell vpon theſe oakes, trees, and ſmall houſes, one farre from the other, without all doubt, the deſtruction would haue bene greater, then the mind of man could haue conceiued. But it pleaſed God, by that ſmall example to reuiue in mens mindes, the memory of his power. But now to returne to our matter. The King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo</hi> (as is before ſaid) diſcontented with the peace, and ſeeing that the warre which he cauſed <hi>Giacopo Piccinino</hi> to make vpon the <hi>Saneſi</hi> without any reaſonable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had wrought no effect, he thought to moue an other with the allowance of the league.<note place="margin">The Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſi aſſaulted by King Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo.</note> And in the yeare 1456. he aſſaulted the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> both by ſea and land, as deſirous to giue that ſtate to the <hi>Adorni,</hi> and depriue the <hi>Frigoſi</hi> who then gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Beſides that, he cauſed <hi>Giacopo Piccinino</hi> to paſſe <hi>Tronto,</hi> and aſſault <hi>Giſmondo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateſti,</hi> who hauing well manned his townes, regarded not much the aſſault of <hi>Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copo,</hi> ſo as the enterpriſe of the King on this ſide tooke no effect at all. But that warre of <hi>Genoua</hi> occaſioned more warre to him and his Kingdome, then himſelfe looked for. At that time <hi>Pietro Fregoſo</hi> was Duke of <hi>Genoua</hi>; he fearing himſelfe to be of force vnable to withſtand the Kings aſſault, determined to giue that to an other which himſelfe could not hold: and yeeld it into the hands of ſuch a one that would (at the leaſt in that reſpect) defend him; ſo might he alſo hope in time to come, to be reacquited.

But notwithſtanding this ouerthrow, the Cittie of <hi>Naples,</hi> with a fewe other townes, and ſome Princes, continued faithfull to <hi>Ferrando,</hi> though all the reſt of the Realme, and Nobilitie, yeelded their obedience to <hi>Giouanni. Giacopo Piccinino</hi> perſwaded <hi>Giouanni</hi> to follow the victorie, and preſently to marche to <hi>Naples,</hi> thereby to poſſeſſe himſelfe of the chiefe Cittie of the Kingdome; which <hi>Giouanni</hi> refuſed to do, ſaying he would firſt ſpoile all the countrey, and then it would be more eaſie to ſurprize the Cittie, which was the cauſe, he failed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that enterpriſe: for he knew not, that the parts do more willingly follow the head, then the head doth follow them. After this ouerthrow, the King <hi>Ferrando</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fled into <hi>Naples,</hi> thither reſorted vnto him diuerſe of his ſubiects, who were driuen from their countreys: then by all curteous meanes he leuied men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to make a new Camp, ſending againe for aide to the Pope and Duke. From the one and the other of whome he was aided more ſpeedily and abundantly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time he had bene, bicauſe they greatly feared, he ſhould otherwiſe loſe his Kingdome. King <hi>Ferrando</hi> in this ſort growne ſtrong, marched out of <hi>Naples,</hi> and hauing gotten ſome reputation, recouered alſo part of his loſt townes. During theſe warres in the Kingdome, a chance happened, that vtterly depriued <hi>Giouanni de Angio</hi> of reputation and meane to haue victorie in that enterpriſe. The <hi>Genoueſi</hi> being wearie of the French inſolent and couetous gouernment, tooke armes againſt the Kings Gouernour there, and forced him to flee to the little Caſtle of <hi>Genoua.</hi> The <hi>Fregoſi</hi> and the <hi>Adorni</hi> were content to ioyne in that action, and by the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> they became furniſhed of money and men, both for the winning, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Cittie. So that the King <hi>Rinato</hi> with his nauie came to the ſuccour of his ſonne, and hoping to recouer <hi>Genoua,</hi> by meane of the ſmall Caſtle, in landing his ſouldiers, was ouerthrowne; and forced with ſhame to returne vnto <hi>Prouenza.</hi> Theſe newes being carried to the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> greatly diſmaied <hi>Giouanni de Angio:</hi> notwithſtanding, he ſtill followed his enterpriſe, and continued the warre, being ſerued by thoſe Barons who were rebelled, and could not looke for fauour of <hi>Ferrando.</hi> In the end, after many accidents, thoſe two royall armies ioyned battell,<note place="margin">Giouanni de Angio vanquiſhed in battell.</note> wherein, neare vnto the Cittie of <hi>Troia, Giouanni</hi> was vanquiſhed, the yeare 1463. This ouerthrow did not ſo much hinder the ſucceſſe of the King <hi>Giouanni,</hi> as did the reuolt of <hi>Giacopo Piccinino,</hi> who left him, and ioyned with King <hi>Ferrando:</hi> whereby being ſpoiled of his forces, he retired into <hi>Hiſtria,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Fraunce.</hi> This warre continued foure yeares, and was in the end loſt by his owne negligence, for it was many times in good way of victorie by the vertue of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Therein the <hi>Florentines</hi> intermedled not apparantly, yet were they deſired by Embaſſadors of the King <hi>Giouanni</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> (newly come to that Kingdome by the death of <hi>Alfonſo</hi>) to aſsiſt the enterpriſe of <hi>Ferrando</hi> his nephew, as they had

The Embaſſadors being thus to the requeſt of their King anſwered, proteſted the execution of their band, and the Kings preiudice, ſo in great diſpleaſure with that Cittie, departed.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O thoſe that haue read the former Booke, it may ſeeme in writing of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the proceedings of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> we haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſpoken of ſuch accidents as hapned in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and the Kingdome. Neuertheleſſe, as heretofore I haue, ſo am I hereafter to continue with the like diſcourſes. For albeit I did not promiſe to write of matters concerning <hi>Italy,</hi> yet haue I thought good to ſpeake of thoſe, that were in that countrey moſt notable. For if I ſhould not make mention of them, our hiſtorie would be with more difficultie vnderſtood, and to the Readers leſſe pleaſing. Chiefely, bicauſe the actions of other people and Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> did occaſion the warres, wherein the <hi>Florentines</hi> were forced to intermeddle, as of the warre of <hi>Giouanni de Angio,</hi> and King <hi>Ferrando</hi> great enimitie grew, which was after betwixt <hi>Ferrando</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly with the houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> continued. For the King complained, that the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> did not onely leaue him in that warre vnaided, but alſo that his enemies were by them fauoured: which anger, was the occaſion of exceeding many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenients, as ſhall be hereafter declared. And for as much as I haue written at large thoſe matters which happened without the Cittie, till the yeare 1463. it behoueth me for the declaration of ſuch troubles as happened in thoſe daies within, to looke back many yeares paſſed. Yet firſt by way of diſcourſe (as is my cuſtome) I ſay, that whoſoeuer doth thinke, that any Common-weale can continue vnited, he greatlie deceiueth himſelfe. But true it is, that ſome diuiſions be preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to Common-weales, and ſome others be profitable. Thoſe be preiudiciall, which are with factions and followers accompanied. And thoſe are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which without factions and followers bee mainteined. Seeing then, it is a thing impoſsible, for that man who frameth a Common-weale, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that no enimitie ſhall therein ariſe, he ought (at the leaſt) foreſee, that no
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14349:93"/>
factions be permitted. It is then to be conſidered, that the Citizens in euerie ſtate do win reputation, either by publike or priuate meanes. Publike reputation is gotten by victorie in the field, by ſurprizing of townes, by wiſe and diſcreet performing of Embaſſages, or by counſailing the State grauely and fortunately. By priuate meanes men attain to reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by pleaſuring particuler citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by ſauing them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by relieuing them with money, by aduancing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnworthily to honors and offices, and by enterteining the common people with ſports &amp; publike gifts. From theſe cauſes, faction, following, and partaking do proceed. And as reputation thus gotten is hurtful, ſo the other not being intermedled with faction, is the occaſion of great good, bicauſe it is grounded vpon no priuate, but common commoditie. And albeit among ſuch Citizens, ſo great diſpleaſures wil grow, as the wiſdome of man is not able to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting partakers to follow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for proper profit, they cannot by any way hinder the common-weale, but ſhal rather help it: for in aſpiring to that they would come vnto, it behoueth them to indeuor the aduancement of the ſtate, and particularly one to reſpect the other, ſo much, as the lawes &amp; ciuil orders be not infringed. The enimities of <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> were alwaies followed with factions, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hurtfull to the ſtate, neither was any victorious faction longer vnited, then the contrary part continued in force: for ſo ſoone as the enemies were extinguiſhed, the faction remaining no more in awe of the enemy, nor hauing order to bridle it ſelfe, became diuided. The faction of <hi>Coſimo de Medici</hi> in the yeare 1434. remained with victorie. Neuertheleſſe, bicauſe the partie oppreſſed was ſtil great, and full of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men, it continued vnited and tollerable, ſo long, as among thoſe of the factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no error was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, and the people for no euill deſert did hate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and whenſoeuer that gouernment had need of the people to reeſtabliſh their authoritie, they found them readie to giue vnto the chiefe of the faction the <hi>Balia,</hi> and whatſoeuer elſe they deſired. Thus fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 1434. till the 55. being 21. yeares, they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in office 6. times,<note place="margin">Coſimo de Medici. Neri Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni.</note> ordinarily elected by the Councels. There were in <hi>Florence</hi> (as we haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe times ſaid) two moſt mightie Citizens, <hi>Coſimo de Medici,</hi> and <hi>Neri Capponi,</hi> of whome, <hi>Neri</hi> had gained his reputation by publike meanes: by ſeaſon whereof, he had many friends, but few followers. <hi>Coſimo</hi> on the other ſide being aſpired both by publike and priuate waies, had not onely many friends, but alſo many followers. Theſe two men continuing vnited, during their liues, eaſily obteined of the people whatſoeuer they deſired, bicauſe they had loue mixed with authoritie. But the yere 1455. being come, <hi>Neri</hi> dead, &amp; the aduerſe part extinguiſhed, <hi>Coſimo</hi> found no ſmall difficultie to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, and his own friends being moſt mightie in the ſtate, were cauſe therof: bicauſe they feared no more the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary faction put downe, &amp; deſired to decreaſe the power of <hi>Coſimo</hi>; which was the beginning of thoſe diuiſions which followed after in the yeare 1466. So as they vnto whome the offices apperteined, in their councels, where the publike gouernment of that ſtate was debated, did alleage it was not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the authoritie of <hi>Balia</hi> ſhould be reſumed, but that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of election ought proceed, as it was wont, by lots, and not according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Squittini. Coſimo,</hi> to quallifie this humor, had to determine vpon one of theſe two remedies, either by force with the aide of his friends and followers to poſſeſſe himſelfe of the State, and therewith to compell the contrarie faction, or elſe to ſuffer the matter proceed, and in time let his friends know, that not his honor, but their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation was by the enemy taken away. Of theſe two remedies, he made choiſe of the laſt: for hee knew well, that the <hi>Squittini</hi> being fulleſt of his friends, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe could not incurre any perill, and might alſo at his pleaſure reſume the State. The Cittie then determined to create the Magiſtrates by lot: the greateſt number thought the libertie recouered, and that the offices ſhould not after be allotted,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14349:93"/>
according to the will of the moſt mightie men, but as ſeemed beſt to themſelues. Whereupon, the followers of the great Cittizens began to be diſeſteemed, and by the people were in ſundrie places beaten downe and oppreſſed. So as they who were wont to haue their houſes full of ſuters and preſents, were now become emptie, and without any reſort at all. They alſo ſawe themſelues made equall with thoſe who were before time farre vnder them, and their equals were become their ſuperiors. They were not regarded nor honored, but rather many times mocked and derided. Alſo in the ſtreets, the people without reſpect, ſpake their pleaſures both of them, and of the Common-weale. Whereof was conceiued, that they, and not <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo,</hi> had loſt the gouernment. All which things <hi>Coſimo</hi> diſsimuled, and whenſoeuer any thing plauſible to the people was propounded, he was euer the firſt that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereof. But that which moſt terrified the great men, and made <hi>Coſimo</hi> to looke about him, was the reuiuing of the <hi>Cataſto</hi> the yeare 1427. Whereby was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, the Impoſition ſhould proceed by the order of lawe, and not the pleaſure of men. This lawe made, and Magiſtrates for execution thereof choſen, occaſioned the great Citizens to aſſemble, goe vnto <hi>Coſimo,</hi> and deſire him be pleaſed to concurre with them in their, and his owne deliuery from the people: whereby he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer reputation to the State, make himſelfe mightie, and them honored. Thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Coſimo</hi> anſwered, he was content, ſo that the lawe were made orderly with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people, and without force; otherwiſe no ſpeech to be thereof. Then went they about in the Councels to make a new <hi>Balia,</hi> whereby they might create new Officers, but that intention preuailed not: then the great Cittizens returned to <hi>Coſimo,</hi> deſiring him moſt humblie to conſent to the Parliament, which <hi>Coſimo</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſed to do: meaning thereby to bring to paſſe, that they ſhould finde the error they committed. And bicauſe <hi>Donato Cochi,</hi> being <hi>Gonfaloniere di Giustitia,</hi> would in any wiſe without his conſent call the Parliament, <hi>Coſimo</hi> procured him by the reſt of the <hi>Senators,</hi> (who ſate with him in office) to be ſo mocked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, as thereby he became mad, and was as a man ſenceleſſe, ſent home to his houſe. Notwithſtanding, bicauſe he thought it not fit to ſuffer matters to runne further out of order, then that they might be at his pleaſure reformed:<note place="margin">Lucca Pitti.</note> 
               <hi>Lucca Pitti</hi> become <hi>Gonfaloniere di Giustitia</hi> (a ſtout and ſelfe-willed man) <hi>Coſimo</hi> thought good to leaue the gouernment to his diſcretion, to the end, that if any thing were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, the fault might be to <hi>Lucca</hi> and not to himſelfe imputed. <hi>Lucca</hi> then in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Magiſtracie, propounded many things to the people, touching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of the <hi>Balia,</hi> but not obteining his deſire, with iniurious words full of pride, he threatned thoſe of the councels: Which threatnings, ſhortly after he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed indeed. For in Auguſt vpon the eue of <hi>S. Lorenzo,</hi> the yeare 1458. he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſecretly within the Pallace many armed men, called the people thither, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to conſent to that, which voluntarily they had before denied. By this means being againe in poſſeſsion of the State, the <hi>Balia</hi> was created, and the chiefe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates according to the pleaſure of a fewe, were appointed. Then to begin that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment with terror, which was gotten by force,<note place="margin">Girolamo Machiauelli.</note> they confined <hi>Girolamo Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelli,</hi> with ſome others, and depriued many from their offices, which <hi>Girolamo</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing afterwards paſſed the bounds of preſcription, was proclaimed a Rebell. Then went he from place to place in <hi>Italy,</hi> to perſwade the Princes againſt his countrey, till at length in <hi>Lunigiana,</hi> through the treaſon of one of that <hi>Senate,</hi> he was taken, brought to <hi>Florence,</hi> and there in priſon died. This forme of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t continuing eight yeares, was violent and inſupportable. For <hi>Coſimo</hi> being old, weake, vnheal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, and vnable to be preſent as he was wont, at the affaires of the Common-weale, a fewe Cittizens at their pleaſures did rob and ſpoyle the Cittie. <hi>Lucca Pitti</hi> for his

good ſeruice was made Knight, and he to declare himſelfe no leſſe thankfull to the State, then the State had bene to him, cauſed that the Officers called <hi>Priori delli Arti,</hi> hauing paſſed their authoritie, ſhould be called <hi>Priori della Liberta.</hi> He ordeined alſo, that whereas the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> was woont to ſit on the right hand of the <hi>Rettori,</hi> that after he ſhould be placed in the middeſt of them. Moreouer, to the end that God might ſeeme partaker of this action, they made publique proceſsions and prayers, thanking him for the reſtauration of their honors. <hi>Lucca</hi> was by the <hi>Senate,</hi> and by <hi>Coſimo</hi> richly preſented. To him alſo euerie other Cittizen reſorted, and gaue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, ſo that it was ſuppoſed that the ſumme of his preſents amounted vnto twentie thouſand duckets. In concluſion, he aſpired to ſuch greatneſſe of reputation, as <hi>Lucca,</hi>

Thereupon he conceiued ſo great confidence, that he began to build two houſes, the one in <hi>Florence,</hi> the other in <hi>Rucciano,</hi> a mile diſtant from the Cittie, both ſtately and kingly buildings. But that in <hi>Florence</hi> was much larger then by any priuate Cittizen had euer bene buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For performance thereof, he ſpared not to vſe all extraordinarie meanes. For not onely priuate Cittizens and particuler men did preſent him, and help him with things neceſſarie for his building, but the whole comminaltie and people did put their hands to his works. Moreouer, all baniſhed men, and euerie other perſon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing committed murther, theft, or other offence, whereof he feared publique pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment (if he were abled to his ſeruice any way) might without all danger reſort thither. The other Cittizens, although they builded not like vnto him, yet were they no leſſe violent, and inclined to oppreſsion: ſo as, albeit <hi>Florence</hi> had no warre abroad to hinder it, yet was it by the Cittizens within oppreſſed. In thoſe dayes (as is before ſayd) happened the warre in the Kingdome: and ſome warres were alſo made againſt the houſe of <hi>Malateſti,</hi> by the Pope, being deſirous to take from them <hi>Rimino</hi> and <hi>Ceſena:</hi> ſo that in this enterpriſe, and his ſtudie to moue the warre againſt the Turke, Pope <hi>Pio</hi> conſumed his Papacie. But <hi>Florence</hi> continued ſtill in diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and troubles. For then began the faction of <hi>Coſimo</hi> to be diuided within it ſelfe, the yeare 1455. which happened by the occaſions before ſaid. Yet were they (for that time) by his wiſedome appeaſed. But the yeare 64. being come, <hi>Coſimo</hi> fell againe ſick,<note place="margin">The death of Coſimo di Medici.</note> and dyed. At his death, both friends and foes lamented: for they, who in reſpect of the State loued him not, ſeeing what extortion was vſed by the Cittizens in his life, doubted (leaſt <hi>Coſimo</hi> being dead whome all men reuerenced) they ſhould be vtterly ruined, and of his ſonne <hi>Piero</hi> they hoped not much. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he were of diſpoſition a good man, yet being ſickly, and new in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they thought he ſhould be forced to reſpect others, who without any bridle, would become ſtrong and incorrigible. Euerie man therefore feared to find great want of <hi>Coſimo.</hi> This <hi>Coſimo</hi> was the moſt eſteemed, and moſt famous Cittizen (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no man of warre) that euer had bene in the memorie of man, either in <hi>Florence,</hi> or any other Cittie, bicauſe he did not onely excell all others (of his time) in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and riches, but alſo in liberalitie and wiſedome. For amongſt other qualities which aduanced him to be chiefe of his Countrey, he was more then other men, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall and magnificent. Which liberalitie appeared much more after his death then before. For his ſonne <hi>Piero</hi> found by his fathers Records, that there was not any Cittizen of eſtimation, to whome <hi>Coſimo</hi> had not lent great ſummes of money: and many times alſo vnrequired he did lend to thoſe Gentlemen, whome he knewe to haue need. His magnificence likewiſe appeared by diuerſe his buildings. For within <hi>Florence,</hi> he builded the Abbaies and Temples of <hi>S. Marco, S. Lorenzo,</hi> and the Monaſterie of <hi>S. Verdiana.</hi> And in the Mountaines of <hi>Fieſole, S. Gero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lano,</hi> with the Abbey thereunto belonging. Alſo in <hi>Mugello,</hi> he did not onely
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14349:94"/>
repaire the Church for the Friers, but tooke it downe, and builded it a new. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe magnificent buildings in <hi>S. Croce,</hi> in <hi>S. Agnoli,</hi> and <hi>S. Miniato,</hi> he made Altars, and ſumptuous Chappels. All which Temples and Chappels, beſides the buildings of them, were by him paued, and throughlie furniſhed with all things neceſſarie. With theſe publique buildings, we may number his priuate houſes, whereof one within the Cittie meete for ſo great a perſonage, and foure other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out at <hi>Carriaggi,</hi> at <hi>Fieſole,</hi> at <hi>Cafaggiuolo,</hi> and at <hi>Trebio,</hi> all Pallaces fitter for Princes then priuate perſons. And bicauſe his magnificent houſes in <hi>Italy</hi> did not in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion make him famous ynough, he builded in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> an Hoſpitall to reciue poore and diſeaſed Pilgrims. In which worke, he conſumed great ſummes of money. And albeit theſe buildings, and euery other his actions were princely, and that in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> he liued like a Prince, yet ſo gouerned by wiſedome, as he neuer exceeded the bounds of ciuill modeſtie. For in his conuerſation, in riding, in marrying his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and kinſfolks, he was like vnto all other diſcreet and modeſt Citizens: bicauſe he well knew, that extraordinarie things which are of all men with admiration behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, do win more enuie, then thoſe which without oſtentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be honeſtlie couered. Whenſoeuer therefore he married his ſonnes, he neuer ſought to match them with the daughters of Princes, but wedded his ſonne <hi>Giouanni,</hi> to <hi>Cornelia Aleſſandri,</hi> and <hi>Piero,</hi> to <hi>Lucretia Tornabuoni.</hi> Alſo of his graund children begotten of <hi>Piero,</hi> he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Bianca</hi> to <hi>Guglielmo de Pazi,</hi> and <hi>Nannina</hi> to <hi>Barnardo Ruſſellai.</hi> Theſe his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings cauſed, that in ſo great change of fortune, and in ſo variable a Cittie, among ſo inconſtant Cittizens, he continued a Magiſtrate 31. yeares. For being a wiſe man, he diſcouered all inconuenients a farre, and therefore might in time preuent them, or if they did grow, be ſo prepared, as they could not offend him. Whereby he did not onely ſuppreſſe all domeſticall and ciuill ambition, but alſo bridled the inſolencie of many Princes with ſo great happineſſe and wiſedome, that whoſoeuer ioyned in league with him and his countrey, became either equall or ſuperior to his enemies. And whoſoeuer oppoſed themſelues againſt them, either they loſt time, money, or ſtate. Whereof the <hi>Venetians</hi> can beare witneſſe, who being ioyned with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke <hi>Philippo,</hi> were alwayes victorious: and being diſioyned, were firſt by <hi>Philippo,</hi> and after by <hi>Franceſco</hi> victored and oppreſſed. Alſo when they ioyned with <hi>Alfonſo</hi> againſt the ſtate of <hi>Florence, Coſimo</hi> with his credit, made both <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> ſo ſcarce of money, as they were conſtrayned to take what peace himſelfe was pleaſed with. Whatſoeuer difficultie or contradiction was moued againſt <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo,</hi> either within or without the Cittie, the end thereof was to his glorie, and the diſaduantage of his enemies. Therefore all ciuill diſcords increaſed his authoritie in <hi>Florence,</hi> and forraine warres augmented his power abroad. He annexed to the dominion of his Countrey <hi>Borgo</hi> at <hi>S. Sepolcro, Monteuoglio, Caſentino,</hi> and the Vale of <hi>Bagno.</hi> Thus his vertue and fortune, oppreſſed all enemies, and aduanced his friends. He was borne in the yeare 1389. on the feaſt day of <hi>S. Coſimo</hi> and <hi>Damiano.</hi> The firſt part of his life was full of troubles, as appeareth by his exile, his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and his dangers of death. Alſo at the Councell of <hi>Conſtanza</hi> (whither he went with the Pope <hi>Giouanni</hi>) after the Popes oppreſsion, he was forced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe himſelfe, and flee. But hauing paſſed the fortie yeare of his age, hee liued moſt happily: in ſo much, as not onely they which ioyned with him in publique actions, but all other men alſo that maneged his treaſure in euerie place of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> did perticipate of his felicitie. Alſo many exceſsiue rich houſes in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> had their beginning from him, as <hi>Tornabuoni, Benchi, Portinari,</hi> and <hi>Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetti.</hi> Beſides all theſe, euerie man depending vppon his counſell, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, became wealthie. And albeit that his building of Temples, and giuing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14349:95"/>
of almes, was knowne throughout the world, yet would he to his friends many times lament, that he had not ſpent and beſtowed ſo much to the honor of God, but that he found himſelfe ſtill in his booke a debtor. He was of meane ſtature, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion browne,<note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Coſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his wit.</note> and of preſence venerable: vnlearned, yet eloquent, and full of naturall wiſedome; friendlie to his friends, and pittifull to the poore. In conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was frugall, in counſell aduiſed, in execution ſpeedie, in ſpeech and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, wittie, and graue. <hi>Rinaldo de gli Albizi</hi> in the beginning of his exile ſent him a meſſage, ſaying that the hen did ſit: whereunto <hi>Coſimo</hi> anſwered, that ſhe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hatch, being farre from her neſt. To other Rebels who ſent him word they ſlept not: he anſwered, that he beleeued the ſame, bicauſe there, ſleepe was taken from them. Vnto the Pope <hi>Pio,</hi> perſwading Princes to take Armes againſt the Turke, <hi>Coſimo</hi> ſaid, An old man taketh in hand a yong enterpriſe. To the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Venice,</hi> who came with the meſſengers of <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> to complaine of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> he ſhewed his head bare, and asked of what colour it was? they anſwered white. Then he replying, ſaid, that ere it belong, your <hi>Senators</hi> will alſo haue white heads like vnto mine. His wife, a few houres before his death, ſeeing him ſhut his eyes, asked him for what cauſe he ſo did? He anſwered, to bring them in vſe. Some Citizens ſaying vnto him after his returne from exile, that he hindered the Cittie, and offended God, in baniſhing ſo many honeſt men? To them hee anſwered, It was better to haue a Cittie hindered, then loſt; and that the State was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with beades in mens hands. Which words, gaue his enemyes matter to ſpeake euill of him, as a man that loued himſelfe more then his Countrey, and that eſteemed more this world, then the world to come. Many other ſayings, as things not neceſſarie, I, omit. <hi>Coſimo</hi> was alſo a louer and preferrer of learned men, for he brought vnto <hi>Florence Argiropolo,</hi> a Grecian borne, and in that time of ſinguler lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to the end that the youth of <hi>Florence</hi> might be by him inſtructed in the Greeke toong, and other his good learnings. He enterteyned in his houſe <hi>Marſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio Ficino,</hi> a ſecond father of the Philoſophie of <hi>Plato,</hi> and him he entirely loued. Alſo, to the end he might with commoditie exerciſe the ſtudie of learning, and more aptly vſe his help therein, he gaue him certaine land neare vnto his houſe of <hi>Careggi.</hi> This his wiſedome, theſe his riches, this manner of life, and this fortune, were the cauſes, that in <hi>Florence</hi> he was both feared and loued, and of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not onely of <hi>Italy,</hi> but alſo of all <hi>Europe</hi> eſteemed: ſo as he left vnto his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie ſuch a foundation, as they might with vertue equall him, and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune farre excell him. Whatſoeuer authoritie <hi>Coſimo</hi> had either in <hi>Florence,</hi> or elſewhere in Chriſtendome, he deſerued the ſame: notwithſtanding, in the end of his life, he had great ſorrowes. For of two onely ſonnes, <hi>Pietro,</hi> and <hi>Giouanni,</hi> the one (of whome he had moſt hope) dyed: the other was continually ſick, and therefore vnable either for publique or priuate function. In ſo much as his ſonne being dead, he cauſed him to be carried about the houſe, and he following the Coarſe, ſighed, and ſaide, this houſe is ouer great for ſo ſmall a familie. It alſo offended the greatneſſe of his minde, that he had not (in his owne opinion) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the <hi>Florentine</hi> dominion with ſome honorable conqueſt. And it grieued him the more, knowing that <hi>Franceſco Sforza</hi> had deceiued him, who being but Earle, promiſed, that ſo ſoone as hee was poſſeſſed of <hi>Milan,</hi> hee would winne the Cittie of <hi>Lucca</hi> for the <hi>Florentines.</hi> Which was not performed, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Earle with his fortune changed his minde, and being become Duke, determined to enioy that ſtate with peace, which he had gotten by warre. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would neither keepe touch with <hi>Coſimo</hi> nor any other, neither would he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was Duke, make anie more warres then thoſe that for his owne defence hee
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14349:95"/>
was enforced vnto. Which grieued <hi>Coſimo</hi> greatly, finding that he had endured great paines, and ſpent much, to aduance a man vnthankfull and perfidious. Moreouer by the weakneſſe of his bodie, he found himſelfe vnfit to follow either priuate or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique affaires, whereby the one, and the other, miſcarried. Becauſe the Citie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Citizens, and his owne ſubſtance by his confidents and children conſumed. All theſe things in the later end of his age, did greatly diſquiet his minde: Notwithſtanding he died with glorie. And all the principall Citizens, and all the Chriſtian Princes did condole his death with <hi>Pietro</hi> his ſonne, and accompanied his coarſe to the Temple of S. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> where with great pompe it was buried: and by publique conſent was written vpon his Tombe, <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi> If in this diſcourſe of <hi>Coſimo,</hi> I haue imitated thoſe, which haue written the liues of Princes, and not thoſe which write vniuerſall hiſtories: let no man marueile thereat. For hee being a rare man in our Citie, deſerued I ſhould affoard him extraordinary commendation. In thoſe dayes, that <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> ſtood in the conditions aforeſaide, <hi>Lewes</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> was with greeuous warres aſſaulted. For the Lords of his owne Countrey, aſsiſted by the Dukes of <hi>Bretagne</hi> and <hi>Burgogne,</hi> made the war ſo great vpon the King, that he had no meane to aide the Duke <hi>Giouanni de Angio,</hi> in his enterpriſe of <hi>Genoua</hi> and the kingdome. But iudging that he had neede of ayd whatſoeuer, he gaue the Citie of <hi>Sauona</hi> (then in his hand and kept by French men) to <hi>Franceſco</hi> Duke of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan:</hi> letting him vnderſtand, that (if he ſo pleaſed) he might alſo with his fauour, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault <hi>Genoua.</hi> Which offer was accepted by <hi>Franceſco,</hi> and either through the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings friendſhip, or the fauour of the <hi>Adorni,</hi> he became Lord of <hi>Genoua.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of Milan, Lord of Genoua.</note> Then to declare himſelfe thankfull for the benefit receiued of the King, he ſent into <hi>France</hi> to the Kings aide, a thouſand fiue hundreth horſe, conducted by <hi>Galiazzo</hi> his eldeſt ſonne. Thus <hi>Ferrando</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Franceſco Sforza,</hi> were become, the one Duke of <hi>Lombardy</hi> and Prince of <hi>Genoua:</hi> the other, King of all the kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> And hauing married their children, the one, to the other, they deuiſed by what meanes they might, during their liues, maintaine their countries with ſecuritie: and after their deaths, ſo leaue the ſame to their heires. For which purpoſe, they thought it neceſſarie, that the King ſhould aſſure himſelfe of thoſe Barons, which in the war of <hi>Giouanni de Angio,</hi> had diſobeyed him: and that the Duke ſhould endeuour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to extinguiſh thoſe that had bene brought vp in the warres by the <hi>Bracci,</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall enemies to his houſe, and growne vp in great reputation vnder <hi>Giacopo Piccinino,</hi> who was the chiefeſt Captaine in all <hi>Italy</hi>; and ſuch a one as euerie Prince ought to beware of: chiefly the Duke who could not account his dominion aſſured, nor leaue the ſame to his ſonnes, if <hi>Giacopo</hi> did ſtill liue. The King therfore by all meanes ſought to make peace with his Barons, handling the matter cunningly to aſſure him ſelfe of them, which fell out very happily. Becauſe the Barons did thinke, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the warre againſt their King, the ſame would be in the end their vndoubted ruine: and yeelding to the peace, they ſhould ſtand at the kings diſcretion. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men do moſt willingly eſchue that euill which is moſt certaine, it commeth to paſſe, that Princes may eaſily deceiue others of leſſe power: and ſo theſe Lords gaue credit to the King. For they ſeeing the manifeſt danger of the warre, yeelded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into his hands, and were vppon ſundrie occaſions by him oppreſſed: which greatly diſmaied <hi>Giacopo Piccinino,</hi> at that time remaining with his forces at <hi>Salmona.</hi> And to remoue occaſion whereby the King might oppreſſe him, he practiſed by his friends, to be reconciled to the Duke <hi>Franceſco,</hi> who hauing made him great and honourable offers, <hi>Giacopo</hi> reſolued to put himſelfe into his hands: and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with one hundreth horſe went to <hi>Milan</hi> to preſent himſelfe vnto the Duke. <hi>Giacapo</hi> had long ſerued his father, and with his brother; firſt for the Duke
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14349:96"/>
               <hi>Philippo,</hi> and after for the people of <hi>Milan.</hi> Whereby he gained great acquaintance in that Citie,<note place="margin">Giacopo Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinino, ſupec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Duke.</note> and the good will of the multitude, which was encreaſed by the preſent condition of the Citie. For the good fortune, and great power of the houſe of <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> had kindled great enuie: And <hi>Giacopo</hi> for his aduerſitie and long abſence, was greatly by the people pitied, who deſired much to ſee him. All which things appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at his comming. For welneare all the Nobilitie went to meet him, and the ſtreets were full of thoſe which deſired to ſee him. Beſides that, great honour was ſpoken of him and his ſouldiers. All which things, did haſten his deſtruction, becauſe they encreaſed ſuſpition, and the Dukes deſire to oppreſſe him. For the more couert per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, the Duke deuiſed, that the marriage with his daughter <hi>Druſiana,</hi> who had bene long before contracted vnto him, ſhould now be ſolemnized. Then he practiſed with <hi>Ferrando,</hi> to entertaine him, for Generall of his Army, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him a hundreth thouſand Florins in preſt. After this concluſion, <hi>Giacopo,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Dukes Embaſſador, and <hi>Druſiana</hi> his wife, went vnto <hi>Naples,</hi> where he was ioyfully and honourably receiued: and for diuerſe dayes enterteined with all ſorts of triumph and feaſting. But at length deſiring to go vnto his Campe (which he left at <hi>Salmona</hi>) he was by the King conuited to dinner in the Caſtle. The dinner being ended,<note place="margin">Giacopo Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinino, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</note> both he and his ſonne were impriſoned, and ſhortly after put to death. Whereby may be perceiued, that our <hi>Italian</hi> Princes haue feared that vertue in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which was not to be found in themſelues: and did ſmother the ſame ſo long, as no vertue at all being left, our country became ſhortly after, afflicted and ruined. In theſe dayes the Pope <hi>Pio</hi> hauing ſetled all things in <hi>Romagna,</hi> thought the time ſerued well, in reſpect of the vniuerſall peace, to moue the Chriſtians to make warre againſt the Turke: according to the plot ſet downe by his predeceſſors. To the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this exployt, all Princes did contribute mony or men. And in particuler <hi>Mathia</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Carlo</hi> Duke of <hi>Borgogna,</hi> promiſing to go in perſon, were by the Pope made Captaines generall of that iourney. The Pope had ſo great hope of proceeding in this enterpriſe, that he went from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Ancona,</hi> where all the Armie were appointed to aſſemble: and the <hi>Venetians</hi> did promiſe to ſend veſſels to paſſe the ſouldiers into <hi>Schiauonia.</hi> After the Popes arriual in that Citie, the concourſe of people there was ſo great, that within fewe dayes all the victuall of that citie, and that could be brought thither from other places thereabouts, did not ſuffice. In ſo much as euerie man began to taſte of famine. Moreouer, there wanted mony to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ſouldiers of things needfull, and arme thoſe that were diſarmed. <hi>Mathia</hi> and <hi>Carlo</hi> appeared not, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſent thither one onely Captaine with a fewe Gallies, rather to ſhewe their pompe, and ſeeme to haue kept promiſe, then to paſſe the Armie. So as the Pope being old and ſicke, in the middeſt of theſe buſineſſes and diſorders, died. After whoſe death, euerie man returned home. This Pope being dead, the yeare 1465. <hi>Paulo ſecundo,</hi> borne in the Cittie of <hi>Venice,</hi> aſpired to the Papacie. About that time, many other ſtates of <hi>Italy</hi> chaunged their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.<note place="margin">The death of the Duke Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco.</note> For the ſame yeare following, died <hi>Franceſco Sforza,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> hauing vſurped that Dukedome ſixteene yeares. And <hi>Galiazzo</hi> his ſonne, was proclaimed Duke. The death of this Prince, was the occaſion that the diuiſions of <hi>Florence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Piero di Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici.</note> became of more force, and wrought their effects with the more ſpeed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Coſimo di Medici, Piero</hi> his ſonne being left in poſſeſsion of the goods and lands of his father, called vnto him, <hi>Diotiſalui Neroni,</hi> a man of great authoritie, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the other citizens of moſt reputation: and one in whom <hi>Coſimo</hi> repoſed ſo great truſt, as at his death he willed <hi>Piero</hi> both in his ſubſtance &amp; ſtate, to be by his counſel gouerned. <hi>Piero</hi> accordingly declared vnto <hi>Diotiſalui</hi> the truſt which <hi>Coſimo</hi> had in him: And becauſe he would ſhewe himſelfe as obedient to his father after death, as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14349:96"/>
he was in his life: he deſired <hi>Diotiſalui</hi> to aſsiſt him with his counſell, both for the order of his patrimonie, and the gouernment of the Citie; and to begin with his own priuate buſineſſe, he commaunded all his Officers to reſort vnto him with their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and leaue the ſame with <hi>Diotiſalui,</hi> to the end that he might finde out the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſorder of their doings, and ſo counſell him what was beſt afterwards to be done. <hi>Diotiſalui</hi> promiſed to vſe diligence, and performe the truſt in him repoſed. The Officers being come and examined, were found to haue committed many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. And thereupon (as a man that more reſpected his owne ambition, then the loue he bare to <hi>Piero,</hi> or the benefits he had receiued of <hi>Coſimo</hi>) imagined it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to deceiue <hi>Piero</hi> of the reputation, and liuings left him by his father.<note place="margin">Diſsimulation of Diotiſalui Neroni.</note> 
               <hi>Diotiſalui</hi> came vnto <hi>Piero</hi> offering him counſaile, which ſeemed verie honeſt and reaſonable, yet vnder the ſame laie hidden the deſtruction of <hi>Piero.</hi> Hee told him what diſorder he found in his affaires, and how it behoued him to prouide great ſummes of mony for the holding of his credit, and reputation in the ſtate; and therfore ſaid, he could not more honeſtly repaire his diſorders and loſſes, then by calling in thoſe debtes which many ſtraungers and Citizens did owe vnto his father. For <hi>Coſimo</hi> to gaine himſelfe followers in <hi>Florence,</hi> and friends abroad, was exceeding liberall of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and had for that occaſion lent out ſummes of great importance. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile to <hi>Piero</hi> ſeemed good, and honeſt, ſuppoſing he ſhould by execution thereof, without perill, repaire himſelfe with his owne. Notwithſtanding ſo ſoone as hee called for theſe debts, the Citizens grew no leſſe offended, then if hee ſhould haue deſired their owne goods, and without reſpect they ſpake euill of him, ſlaundering him to be a man vnthankfull and couetous. <hi>Diotiſalui</hi> ſeeing this common and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puler diſgrace, which <hi>Piero</hi> had gotten by his counſaile,<note place="margin">A practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Piero di Medici.</note> ioyned himſelfe with <hi>Lucca Pitti, Agnolo Acciaiuoli,</hi> and <hi>Nicholo Soderini,</hi> determining to take from <hi>Piero,</hi> reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and gouernment. Theſe men were moued thereunto for diuerſe reſpects. <hi>Lucca</hi> deſired to ſucceed in the place of <hi>Coſimo,</hi> for hee was aſpired to ſuch greatneſſe, as he diſdained to await vpon <hi>Piero. Diotiſalui,</hi> knowing that <hi>Lucca</hi> was not fit to be chiefe of the gouernment, thought if <hi>Piero</hi> had loſt his reputation, it would in ſhort time fall vpon himſelfe. <hi>Nicholo Soderini,</hi> deſired that the Cittie might liue more at libertie, and that the Magiſtrates might gouerne at their diſcretion. Alſo betwixt <hi>Agnolo</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> remained particuler diſpleaſures. The occaſion whereof was this. <hi>Rafaello</hi> his ſonne, had long before,<note place="margin">Offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaiuoli and the Medici.</note> taken to wife <hi>Aleſſandra de Bardi,</hi> and receiued with her a great dowrie. She, either through her owne default, or the mallice of others, was by her father in lawe and her huſband, euill handled. Whereupon <hi>Brenzo de Illarione</hi> her kinſman, being moued with compaſſion, went in the night accompanied with many armed men, and tooke her out of the houſe of <hi>Agnolo. Agnolo</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Acciaiuoli,</hi> complained of this iniurie done them, by the <hi>Bardi.</hi> The matter was committed to the hearing of <hi>Coſimo,</hi> who iudged that the <hi>Acciaiuoli</hi> ſhould reſtore the marriage money receiued with <hi>Aleſſandra,</hi> and ſhee after to return to her huſband, or not, as her ſelfe was diſpoſed. <hi>Agnolo</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this iudgement not friendly handled by <hi>Coſimo,</hi> of whom, becauſe hee could not be reuenged, he thought to execute the reuenge vpon his ſonne. Theſe conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators notwithſtanding the diuerſitie of their humors, pretended all one occaſion, ſaying they would haue the Citie gouerned by the magiſtrates, and not by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of a fewe. The diſpleaſure towards <hi>Piero,</hi> and the euill ſpeech of him was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by many marchants, who at that time became bankerout, and laide the fault thereof vpon <hi>Piero,</hi> for that he calling home his money haſtily, had hindered their credit, and forced them with the preiudice of the Citie to be vndone. Beſides that, they did ſurmiſe, that he practiſed to marry his ſonne with <hi>Clariſe Orſini.</hi> Whereof
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14349:97"/>
the Citizens conceiued that he did diſdaine to make alliance with any Citizen: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared to vſurpe the ſtate, and make himſelfe Prince. For whoſoeuer diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his owne Citizens to be of his kindred, deſireth to haue them his ſubiects. In theſe reſpects they had no reaſon to be his friends. The leaders of this ſedition, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded themſelues to haue the victorie in their own hands, becauſe the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Citizens (deceiued with the name of libertie, whereby they vſed to make their enterpriſes, ſeeme more honeſt) followed them. Theſe humours then boyling in the breaſts of the Cittizens, it was thought good to them, whome ciuill diſorder diſpleaſed, to aſſaie, if by ſome new found mirth or feaſt, the mindes of men might be ſetled. For moſt commonly the idle people be inſtruments for thoſe that deſire alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Then to remoue this idleneſſe, and giue ſome occaſion to alienate the minds of men from conſideration of the ſtate, the yeare of <hi>Cosimo</hi> his death being paſſed, they tooke occaſion to make the Citie ſome mirth, ordeining two tryumphs more ſolemne then was the cuſtome. The one made repreſentation how the three <hi>Magi</hi> came from the Eaſt, following the ſtarre that ledde them to the place where Chriſt was borne: which was performed with ſo great ſolemnitie, as enterteined the Citie diuerſe moneths. The other was a torniament, wherein the principall yoong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Citie exerciſed Armes againſt all the chiefe men of Armes in <hi>Italy.</hi> And of the <hi>Florentine</hi> youth, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Piero</hi> gained moſt honor: for not by fauour, but in deed by his owne valour, he wanne the beſt prize. Theſe triumphs being ended, the Citizens returned to thinke of the ſtate, and euerie man with more care then before, ſtudied to maintaine his owne opinion, whereof great diuerſitie of conceits, and troubles enſued. The one was, that the authoritie of <hi>Balia</hi> tooke no effect.<note place="margin">League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Duke Galii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azzo and the Florentines.</note> The other, by the death of <hi>Franceſco</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan.</hi> Whereuppon the newe Duke <hi>Galiazzo</hi> ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Florence,</hi> to confirme the capitulations made by <hi>Franceſco</hi> his father: wherein among other things it was concluded, that yearely the Duke ſhould receiue from them certaine ſummes of money. Vpon this Article, the Gouernours of the ſtate, tooke occaſion to hold opinion contrarie to the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> publiquely in theſe Councels, inueying againſt that payment, alleaging that pencion to be promiſed, not to <hi>Galiazzo,</hi> but vnto <hi>Franceſco.</hi> For <hi>Franceſco</hi> being dead, there was no cauſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue it. Becauſe in <hi>Galiazzo</hi> there was not that vertue, which was in <hi>Franceſco:</hi> and ſo conſequently, that good was not, nor could not be looked for at his hand, which was found at his fathers. And although of <hi>Franceſco</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued not much, yet were they to looke for leſſe of <hi>Galiazzo:</hi> and if any Cititzen would entertaine him, to mainteine his owne priuate power, that were a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to ciuill life, and the libertie of the Citie. <hi>Piero</hi> on the contrary, alleaged, that it were not well done, through couetouſneſſe, to loſe a friendſhip ſo neceſſarie: and that there was nothing ſo meete, for the Common-weale, and all <hi>Italy,</hi> as to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in league with the Duke. To the ende that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſeeing them vnited, might not hope either by fained friendſhip or by open warre, to oppreſſe the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For if they ſhould perceiue, the <hi>Florentines</hi> to haue forſaken the Duke, they would preſently take Armes, and the rather, knowing he was yoong, newly come to the gouernment, and without friends. Wherof they might hope either by fraud or force to win his countrey, which would be alſo the vtter ruine of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Common-weale. Theſe reaſons were not allowed, and ſecret hatred began openly to ſhewe it ſelfe. For the ſame night, either partie, in diuerſe companies aſſembled. The friends of the <hi>Medici,</hi> met at <hi>Crocetta,</hi> and their aduerſaries in <hi>La Pieta,</hi> who ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to oppreſſe <hi>Piero,</hi> had gotten their enterpriſe ſubſcribed with the hands of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Citizens.<note place="margin">Conſultation to oppreſſe the Medici.</note> Alſo, being among many other times, one night aſſembled, they held a particuler Councell for the maner of their proceeding; when euerie man conſented
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14349:97"/>
to diminiſh the power of the <hi>Medici:</hi> yet in the order how to bring the matter to paſſe, they concurred not. Some, that were of moſt modeſt nature, thought that the authoritie of the <hi>Balia</hi> being ended, it were beſt to finde meanes, that the ſame might not be reuiued: for if the Councels and Magiſtrates did gouerne the Cittie, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of <hi>Piero</hi> would be in ſhort ſpace extinguiſhed; and with loſſe of his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the ſtate, he ſhould alſo loſe his credit in merchandize. For being no more in place, where he might imploy the publique treaſure, he ſhould of neceſsitie grow weake; which being brought to paſſe, there would not be after any cauſe to feare him: and all this practiſe might bee performed without baniſhment of anie man, and the libertie without bloud recouered, which euery good Cittizen ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. But if they proceeded by force, many perils might be incurred: for whoſoeuer is readie to fall alone, if he be forced by others, will labour to ſtaie himſelf vp. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, when nothing is done extraordinarily againſt him, he ſhall not haue any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to Arme himſelfe, or ſeeke friends; or if he ſhould, the ſame would turne to his great reproach, and breede ſuſpition in euerie man: ſo as his ouerthrow ſhall be the more eaſie, and others take occaſion the rather to oppreſſe him. Many others of that aſſembly liked not this delaie: affirming the time fauoured him, &amp; not them. For if they were contented with ordinary proceedings, <hi>Piero</hi> was in no danger at all, and they in great perill: Becauſe the Magiſtrates (notwithſtanding they were his enemies,) would ſuffer him in the Citie, and his friends, with their ruine (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the yeare 58.) would make him Prince; and as the former counſell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from good men, ſo this was the opinion of wiſe men. It was therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that while men be diſpleaſed, to make him ſure. The meane to bring the ſame to effect, was to be armed both within and without, and alſo to enterteine the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Farrara,</hi> to be the better defended. Which done, when a <hi>Senate</hi> happened to be for the purpoſe, then to make all aſſured. In this reſolution they ſtaied till the next <hi>Senate,</hi> and proceeded according to the quallitie thereof. Among the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, was <hi>Nicholo Fedini,</hi> whom they imployed as Chauncellor, he perſwaded with a hope more certaine, reuealed to <hi>Piero,</hi> all the practiſe agreed vpon by his enemies, and deliuered him a note of all their names; which <hi>Piero</hi> peruſed, and ſeeing the number and quallitie of the Citizens who had conſpired againſt him, tooke coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of his friends, and made a note likewiſe of them. Then he committed this rolle of friends to be made by one whom he moſt truſted, who conſidering therof, found ſo great varietie, and inſtabilitie, in the mindes of the Citizens, that many who had bene written for his enemies, were alſo inrolled among the reſt, who were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his friends. During the ſpace that theſe matters, with theſe alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the time was come to chuſe two ſupreame Officers, and <hi>Nicholo Soderini</hi> was elected <hi>Gonfaloniere de Giustitia.</hi> It was a maruellous thing to ſee, with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe not onely of honourable Citizens, but of all ſorts of people, he was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied to the Pallace, and paſsing vppon the waie, they ſet on his head a garland of Oliffe, to ſhewe that of him depended the welfare and libertie of the Countrey. By this and many like experiences, it is proued, that men ſhould not take vppon them any Office or principallitie with extraordinarie opinion. For not being able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch expectation (men deſiring more then can be) doth in time breed his own diſhonour and infamie. <hi>Thomaſo</hi> and <hi>Nicholo Soderini</hi> were brethren: <hi>Nicholo</hi> was the bolder and more couragious, but <hi>Thomaſo,</hi> the wiſer, and friend to <hi>Piero.</hi> Who knowing his brothers humour, that he deſired onely the libertie of the Cittie, and that the ſtate might be ſetled without harme of any, perſwaded <hi>Nicholo</hi> to make new <hi>Squittini,</hi> whereby the <hi>Borſi</hi> might be filled with ſuch Cittizens as loued to liue in libertie. By doing whereof, the ſtate ſhould be at his will ſetled without tumult or
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14349:98"/>
iniury to anie. <hi>Nicholo</hi> gaue credit to the counſell of his brother, and in theſe vaine imaginations conſumed the time of his office, till by the chiefe of the conſpirators his friends, he was ſuffered to ſincke: as they that would not for enuie, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment ſhould be with the authoritie of <hi>Nicholo</hi> renued, and hoping euer they might in time, vnder ſome other <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> worke the ſame effect. The end of the magiſtracie of <hi>Nicholo</hi> come, and many things by him begun, but nothing ended, he yeelded vp his authoritie with more diſhonour, then with honour, he had entered the ſame. This matter made the faction of <hi>Piero</hi> glad, and confirmed his friendes in the hope they had of his good ſucceſſe. And thoſe that before ſtood neutrall, ioyned with <hi>Piero,</hi> and matters being thus in a readineſſe, for diuerſe months without other tumult, they temporized. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the part of <hi>Piero</hi> ſtil encreaſed in ſtrength, wherof the enemies tooke knowledge and ioyned themſelues togither, to performe that by force, which by meane of the Magiſtrates they might eaſily haue done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and ſo concluded to kill <hi>Piero</hi> lying ſicke at <hi>Careggi:</hi> for which purpoſe, they ſent to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara,</hi> to come vnto the Citie with his forces, and <hi>Piero</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaine, they determined to march armed into the Market place, and cauſe the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> to ſettle the gouernment according to their will. For albeit all the Citizens were not their friends, yet they that were their enemies would for feare giue place. <hi>Dioti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalui</hi> (the rather to cloake his intent) oftentimes viſited <hi>Piero,</hi> and reaſoned with him of the vniting of the Citie. All theſe practiſes had bene reuealed to <hi>Piero,</hi> and <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico Martegli</hi> alſo gaue him intelligence, that <hi>Franceſco Neroni,</hi> brother to <hi>Diotiſalui,</hi> had perſwaded him, to be of his conſpiracie: alleaging the victorie was certain, and aſſured. Thereupon <hi>Piero</hi> determined to be the firſt that ſhould take armes, and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an occaſion vppon the practiſes of his enemies, with the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara.</hi> He pretended therefore to haue receiued a Letter from <hi>Giouanni Bentiuogli,</hi> Prince in <hi>Bologna,</hi> whereby he was aduertiſed, that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara</hi> was with his forces marched to the Riuer of <hi>Albo,</hi> and (as was commonly thought) intended to come to <hi>Florence.</hi> Vpon theſe aduertiſements <hi>Piero</hi> tooke armes, and with a great multitude of men armed, came to <hi>Florence,</hi> where all others that followed him ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelues. The contrary partie did the like: but <hi>Piero</hi> his followers were the better prepared, becauſe the others had not ſo great warning therof. <hi>Diotiſalui</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling neare vnto <hi>Piero,</hi> thought not himſelfe aſſured at home, but ſometimes he went to the Pallace, to perſwade the <hi>Senate</hi> to cauſe <hi>Piero</hi> to laie downe his armes, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he reſorted to <hi>Lucca,</hi> to intreate him to ſtand firme to his faction. But of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Nicholo Soderini</hi> ſhewed himſelf of moſt courage; for he preſently tooke arms, and being followed of all the common people of his quarter, went vnto the houſe of <hi>Lucca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Perſwaſions of Nicholo Soderini a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Medici.</note> deſiring him to mount on horſebacke, and come to the Market place in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the <hi>Senate,</hi> which fauoured them, and therefore might hope of victorie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. But if he remained in his houſe, hee ſhould be either by the armed men op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, or by thoſe that were diſarmed ſhamefully deceiued. Or if he ſhould after repent that he did not take armes, that repentance were too late. But if he wold with the warre oppreſſe <hi>Piero,</hi> he might eaſily do it: and after if he liked to make peace, it was better for him to giue, then to receiue the conditions therof. Theſe words mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not <hi>Lucca,</hi> hauing alreadie ſetled his mind, and promiſed to <hi>Piero</hi> new alliances, and new conditions. For he had alreadie married vnto <hi>Giouanni Tornabuoni,</hi> one of his neeces, and therefore perſwaded <hi>Nicholo</hi> to laie downe armes, and returne to his houſe. For it ought to ſuffice him, that the Cittie ſhould be gouerned by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and it would come to paſſe, that euerie man would laie downe armes: and the <hi>Senators</hi> being the ſtronger partie, ſhould be Iudge of the controuerſie. <hi>Nicholo</hi> then ſeeing he could not otherwiſe perſwade him, returned home. But firſt ſaid vnto
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14349:98"/>
               <hi>Lucca,</hi> I cannot alone worke the well doing of our Citie, but I alone can prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the euil whereinto it is falling. This reſolution you haue made, will breed loſſe of libertie to our country, your depriuation of gouernment and wealth, and my ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. The <hi>Senate</hi> in this tumult ſhut vp the Pallace, and the Magiſtrates kept themſelues therin, not ſeeming to ſauour any part. The Citizens (and chiefly thoſe who had followed <hi>Lucca</hi>) ſeeing <hi>Piero</hi> armed, and his aduerſaries diſarmed, began to deuiſe, not how to offend <hi>Piero,</hi> but how to become his frends. Wherupon the chief citizens &amp; leaders of the factions, went to the Pallace, &amp; in the preſence of the <hi>Senate,</hi> debated many things touching the ſtate of the Cittie, and pacification thereof. And for that, <hi>Piero</hi> by reaſon of his infirmitie could not come thither, they determined by conſent to go all vnto him, (<hi>Nicholo Soderini</hi> except) who hauing firſt recommended his children &amp; familie to <hi>Tomaſo,</hi> went to his owne houſe in the country, aſpecting there the euent of theſe matters, accounting himſelfe vnhappie, and for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey infortunate. The other Cittizens being come to the preſence of <hi>Piero,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſpeech of the Citizens to Piero di Medici.</note> one of them appointed to ſpeake, complained of the tumults in the Cittie, declaring that they, who firſt tooke armes were moſt too blame: they not knowing what <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> (who indeed did firſt take armes) would doo. They were come therefore to vnderſtand what was his intent, which (being for good of the Cittie) they would follow the ſame. Whereunto <hi>Piero</hi> anſwered, that hee who taketh armes firſt,<note place="margin">The anſwer<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Piero.</note> is not euer the cauſe of diſorder, but he that giueth firſt occaſion: and if they would conſider what their behauiours had bene towards him, they ſhould maruaile leſſe at that he had done for his own ſafetie. For therby they ſhould ſee, that their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in the night, their ſubſcriptions, &amp; their practiſes to take from him his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; life, were the occaſions why he tooke armes: which not vſed but in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his owne houſe, and not the offence of them, ſufficiently proued his intent was to defend himſelfe, and not to harme others. Neither would he any thing, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired more then his own ſecuritie &amp; quiet, nor had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſe, that they ſhuld think he ſought for other. For the authoritie of <hi>Balia</hi> diſcontinued, he neuer laboured by extraordinarie meane to reuiue it; and was well content that the Magiſtrates ſhould gouern the citie if they ſo pleaſed: aſſuring them, that <hi>Coſimo</hi> and his children could liue in <hi>Florence</hi> honorably both with and without the <hi>Balia</hi>; and that the yeare 58. the ſame had bene, not by his houſe, but by them renued; and if now they wold not haue it more, he ſhould alſo be ſo contented. But this ſufficed not for them: for he found that his aduerſaries beleeued, they could not dwell in <hi>Florence,</hi> if he alſo there dwelled. A thing which he neuer thought that the friends of his father &amp; him wold feare to liue in <hi>Florence</hi> with him, hauing euer born himſelfe among them, as a quiet and peaceable man. Then (turning his ſpeech to <hi>Diotiſalui</hi> &amp; his brethren there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) he reproued them with words of much grauitie &amp; offence: putting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mind what benifits they had receiued of <hi>Coſimo,</hi> how much he had truſted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfully they had vſed him. Which words wrought ſuch effect in ſome that were preſent, that if <hi>Piero</hi> had not ſtaied them, they ſodenly wold haue ſtriken <hi>Diotiſalui.</hi> In concluſion, <hi>Piero</hi> ſaid he wold maintein euery thing, that they &amp; the <hi>Senat</hi> had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. And that he deſired nothing, but to liue quiet &amp; aſſured. After this ſpeech was ended, many matters were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned of, yet nothing don: but in general was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it was neceſſary to reunite the citie &amp; reform the ſtate. At that time <hi>Barnardo Lotti</hi> was <hi>Gonfaloniere d'Giustitia,</hi> a man not truſted by <hi>Piero,</hi> wherefore thought not good to attempt any thing during his Magiſtracy: but the end of his authority draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neare, election was made by the <hi>Senators</hi> of a <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> to ſit in September and October 1466. And they elected <hi>Roberto Lioni:</hi> who was no ſooner in office, (all other thinges beeing prepared) but hee aſſembled the people in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14349:99"/>
the Market place, and made a new <hi>Balia,</hi> all of the faction of <hi>Piero</hi>; which ſhortly created the Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">The enemies of the Medici vanquiſhed.</note> according to the will of the new gouernment, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the heads of the enemies, and <hi>Agnolo Acciaiuoli</hi> fled to <hi>Naples, Diotiſalui Nero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> and <hi>Nicholo Soderini</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Lucca Pitti</hi> remained in <hi>Florence:</hi> truſting to the promiſes of <hi>Piero,</hi> and the newe alliance with his houſe. All the fugitiues were proclaimed Rebels, and all the familie of <hi>Neroni</hi> diſperſed. Alſo <hi>Giouanni Nero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Florence,</hi> to auoide a worſe miſchiefe, voluntarily confined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to <hi>Rome.</hi> Many other likewiſe baniſhed themſelues to diuers places, neither did this ſuffice: but a publike proceſsion was ordeined to giue God thanks for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, and vniting the ſtate. In the ſolemnization wherof, ſome citizens were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended &amp; tormented. Afterwards part of them put to death, &amp; the reſt confined. In this variation of fortune,<note place="margin">The fall of Lucca Pitti.</note> there was nothing ſo notable, as the example of <hi>Lucca Pitti:</hi> who ſodeinly ſaw the difference of victorie, and loſſe of honor, and diſhonor. For his houſe, whereunto was wont be great repaire, became vnfrequented; himſelf that had bin accuſtomed to paſſe the ſtreets folowed with many friends &amp; kinsfolks, could neither be accompanied, nor ſcarcely ſaluted: becauſe ſome of them had loſt their offices, ſome their goods, &amp; al the reſt threatned. His ſtately houſes in building, were by the workmen abandoned. Thoſe that were wont to preſent him, did now offer him iniury &amp; deſpite. Some who had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him preſents of great value, did now demand them again as things lent. Others that were wont with praiſes to extoll him to the skies, did as a perſon vngratefull and violent, blame him. So that ouerlate he repented his not giuing credit to <hi>Nicholo Soderini,</hi> and that he did not with ſword in hand rather die honourably, then among his victorious enemies, liue diſhonored. Theſe that were baniſhed, ſought by ſundrie meanes to recouer the Citie, they had loſt. Yet <hi>Agnolo Acciaiuoli</hi> being at <hi>Naples,</hi> before hee attempted any thing, thought good to feele the diſpoſition of <hi>Piero,</hi> and what hope remained of reconciliation: writing vnto him,<note place="margin">The letter of Agnolo Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaiuoli, to Piero di Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici.</note> as followeth. I ſmile to ſee, what ſports fortune doth make her ſelf, and how at her pleaſure ſhe frameth of foes friends, and of friends foes. You can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that at the baniſhment of your father (eſteeming more his iniury then mine own danger) I loſt my country, &amp; was like to haue alſo loſt my life. Neither (in al his time) did I euer omit, to honor and fauour your houſe, nor after his death haue had any intent to offend you. True it is, that your own vnhealthie diſpoſition, &amp; the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeares of your children, brought me into ſuch feare, as I thought it behoued me to take order, that after your death, our countrey ſhould not be ruined. For which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue done diuers things, not againſt you, but for the good of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Wherein, if I haue committed error, the ſame ought be, for my good intent, and paſſed ſeruice, pardoned. Neither can I beleeue other, but that (in reſpect of ancient loue to your houſe) I ſhal at this occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> find mercy, &amp; my manifold merits, ſhal not be, by one onely fault cancelled. <hi>Piero</hi> hauing peruſed this letter, aunſwered thus.

In thoſe daies <hi>Giouan Franceſco</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Palla Strozzi</hi> liued in <hi>Farrara,</hi> and had bene togither with his father, baniſhed in the alteration of the ſtate, the yeare 34.

The newe Rebelles declared vnto him, the great facilitie they found to recouer their countrey, if the <hi>Venetians</hi> would take the enterpriſe in hand: which he thought they would be eaſily perſwaded vnto, if part of their charges might be borne. <hi>Giouan Franceſco,</hi> who deſired to reuenge himſelfe of the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries receiued, eaſily gaue credite to their counſaile: and promiſed with all his wealth, to furniſh the enterpriſe.

For <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> with others his followers, accuſtomed to liue tyrannically, had by deceit taken armes, and by deceit cauſed them to diſarme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and afterwards by deceit expulſed them out of their Citie. Neither were they ſo content, but they would alſo therein pretend deuotion to God, and by that colour oppreſſe others. For at the aſſemblie of the Citizens, and at publike and ſacred cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (to the intent God ſhould be partaker of their treaſons) they apprehended, impriſoned, and ſlewe manie Cittizens: which was an example of great impietie and wickedneſſe.

This maner of proceedings, greatly offended the Gouernors in <hi>Florence,</hi> finding themſelues charged by a warre, wherein they ſpent much, and could hope for litle. And the Magiſtrates complained of thoſe Cittizens who were made
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14349:100"/>
Commiſſaries in that enterpriſe. They anſwered, that Duke <hi>Galiazzo</hi> was occaſion thereof, for hee hauing moſt authoritie and leaſt experience, knewe not what was profitable, nor would not beleeue others of more skill: and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible, ſo long as hee remained in the armie, that anie thing ſhould be done with honour and commoditie. Wherefore the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſaide vnto the Duke, albeit for their profit it was beſt he ſhould be perſonally in their aide, becauſe the reputation of his preſence was the fitteſt meane to terrifie the enemie; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for that they eſteemed more his ſafetie, then their ſtate, or proper commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, they thought not fit he ſhould remaine long from <hi>Milan,</hi> being newly come to his gouernment, and hauing there diuerſe ſtrong enemies to be ſuſpected: ſo that, if any of them ſhould practiſe againſt him, they might eaſily in his abſence, do it. For which reſpects they perſwaded him to returne home, and leaue part of his forces for their defence. This counſell contented <hi>Galiazzo,</hi> and without further conſideration, returned to <hi>Milan.</hi> The <hi>Florentine</hi> Captaines disburthened of this let, to declare the ſame was the true occaſion of their ſlow proceeding, drew ſo neare to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that they ioyned battle: which continued one half day, neither partie yeelding to other. Notwithſtanding there was not anie man therein ſlaine, but ſome horſes hurt, and a fewe priſoners on either part taken. The winter now being come, and the ſeaſon of the yeare no longer ſeruing for the fielde, they retired to their lodgings. <hi>Bartolomeo</hi> went to <hi>Rauenna,</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> into <hi>Toſcana:</hi> the Kings ſouldiers and the Dukes, reſorted home to their maiſters Countries. But ſo ſoone as this aſſault beganne to be forgotten, and no diſorder made in <hi>Florence,</hi> as the <hi>Florentine</hi> Rebels promiſed, and the other ſouldiers wanting paie, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to entreate of peace,<note place="margin">Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Florentines and Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> which with ſmall difficultie was concluded. The Rebels then diſpairing of all hope, to diuerſe places diſperſed themſelues. <hi>Diotiſalui</hi> went to <hi>Farrara,</hi> where he was by the Marqueſſe <hi>Borſo,</hi> receiued, and relieued. <hi>Nicholo Soderini</hi> fledde to <hi>Rauenna,</hi> where liuing long vppon a poore pencion giuen him by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in the ende there died.

The peace concluded, the Citizens who remained in <hi>Florence</hi> with victorie, thinking themſelues not aſſured, vnleſſe they did as well oppreſſe thoſe they ſuſpected, as their apparant enemies, perſwaded <hi>Bardo Alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiti,</hi> then <hi>Gonfaloniere d'Giustitia,</hi> to remoue more Cittizens from their offices, and to baniſh many others.

Of which doings, <hi>Piero</hi> knew little, and that litle, he could not (being afflicted with ſickneſſe) remedie. For his diſeaſes were ſo great) as he could not vſe any member ſaue only his tongue: wherwith he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and praied them to liue ciuilly, and enioy their natiue country, rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> broken. And for the comfort of the Citie, he determined with magnificence to celebrate the marriage of <hi>Lorenzo</hi> his ſonne, who was alreadie contracted to <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> diſcended of the houſe of <hi>Orſini:</hi> which marriage was performed with great pompe, as to ſo magnificent a feaſt apperteined.

While theſe matters were doing in <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> the reſt of <hi>Italy</hi> liued quiet, but yet in great ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of the Turke, who proceeded ſtill in his enterpriſe againſt the Chriſtians, and had wonne <hi>Negroponti,</hi> to the great infamie and diſhonour of the Chriſtian name. Then died <hi>Borſo</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara,</hi> to whom ſucceeded his brother <hi>Hercule.</hi> Euen then died alſo <hi>Giſmondo da Rimino,</hi> a perpetuall enemie to the Church: who left to inherit that ſtate, <hi>Roberto</hi> his naturall ſonne; afterwards accounted the moſt excellent Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Italy.</hi> Then likewiſe died the Pope <hi>Pagolo:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pope Siſto.</note> in whoſe place was created <hi>Sisto quarto,</hi> called before his creation <hi>Franceſco da Sauona,</hi> a man of baſe and vile condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet for his vertue made Generall of the order of <hi>S.

This Pope was the firſt that beganne to ſhewe of what great force the Papacie was, and that manie things before time accounted faults, might be by Papall authoritie, couered. This Pope had amongſt many others in his houſe, two men, the one called <hi>Piero,</hi> and the other <hi>Gerolamo:</hi> who (as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man thought) were his vnlawfull ſonnes: notwithſtanding men called them by other names more honeſt. <hi>Piero</hi> being made a Frier, was preferred to the dignitie of Cardinall, and called Cardinall of <hi>S. Siſto.</hi> To <hi>Gerolamo</hi> he gaue the Cittie of <hi>Furli,</hi> and tooke it by force from <hi>Antonio Ordelaffi,</hi> whoſe aunceſtors had bene long time Princes there. This ambitious manner of proceeding, made him the more eſteemed by the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and euery of them ſought which way to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his friend. The Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> gaue his daughter <hi>Catterina</hi> in marriage to <hi>Gerola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> and with her the Citie of <hi>Imola,</hi> which by force he had taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Taddeo Alidoſsi.</hi> Betwixt this Duke, and the King <hi>Ferrando,</hi> was alſo made new alliance. For <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> daughter to <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> eldeſt ſonne of the King, was married to <hi>Giouan Galiazzo,</hi> eldeſt ſonne to the Duke. Thus <hi>Italy</hi> continued quiet, and the greateſt care of the Princes was, one to honor the other: and with new alliances, friendſhips, &amp; leagues, one to aſſure himſelfe of the other. But notwithſtanding ſo great a peace, <hi>Florence</hi> was by the Citizens thereof greatly afflicted. And <hi>Piero</hi> being troubled with ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Citizens, and his own diſeaſes, could not procure remedie: yet to diſcharge his conſcience, and laie before them their miſdemeanor, he called to his preſence the chiefe <hi>Florentines,</hi> and ſaid vnto them as followeth.<note place="margin">The Oration of P. di Medici to the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> I neuer thought that anie time could come, when the maner &amp; behauior of friends would proue ſuch, as to make me loue &amp; deſire my enemies: or that I might wiſh victory to be conuerted to loſſe. Becauſe I thought my ſelfe accompanied with men, whoſe appetites were confined to meaſure; &amp; that it ſufficed them to liue in their country aſſured &amp; honoured, and (that which is more) vpon their enemies reuenged. But now I know my ſelf far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as he that knew little the ambition of men, and leaſt of all yours. For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth you not to be Princes of ſo great a Cittie, and among you a few to haue the honors, offices, and commodities, wherewith many Citizens were wont to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored. It contented you not to haue the goods of your enemies among you diuided. It contenteth you not, to burthen others with publike charges, &amp; you free from all paiments, to take the publike profit: but you wil alſo with euery kind of iniury mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt them. You ceaſe not to rob your neighbors; you feare not to ſell iuſtice; you flie ciuill iudgement; you oppreſſe peaceable men, and aduance thoſe that be inſolent. Neither do I beleeue that there is in all <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo many examples of violence &amp; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, as be in this cittie. But ſith it hath giuen you life, why do you take life from it? If it hath made you victorious, why ſhould we deſtroy it? If it hath honored vs, why haue we diſdained it? I promiſe you by that faith, which ought to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and receiued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if you behaue your ſelues ſo, as I ſhal repent me of my victory, I wil ſo do, as you ſhal alſo repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that you haue abuſed it. Thoſe citizens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time anſwered reſonably. Notwitſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they continued ſtill in their inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doings. Inſo much as <hi>Piero</hi> ſent ſecretly to <hi>Agnolo Acciaiuoli</hi> (who came vnto
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14349:101"/>
him at <hi>Cafaggiuolo</hi>) and there they reaſoned at length touching the eſtate of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And ſurely had he not bene by death preuented, he would haue called home all the baniſhed men, to bridle the inſolencie and oppreſsion of thoſe that liued in the Citie. But death ſuffered him not to performe ſo honeſt an intent: for diſeaſes of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and trouble of minde,<note place="margin">Death of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro di Medici.</note> ſo greeuouſly handled him, that hee died the fiftie and three yeare of his age. His vertue and bountie, could not be to his Countrey ſo well knowne, as they deſerued: partly becauſe his father liued (welneare as long) and partly, for that thoſe fewe yeares hee ouerliued him, were in ciuill contentions and ſickneſſe conſumed. This <hi>Piero</hi> was buried in the Church of <hi>S. Lorenzo,</hi> neare vnto his father: and his funerall performed with honour and pompe, worthie ſo great a Cittizen. Of him there remained two ſonnes, <hi>Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> and <hi>Giuliano,</hi> of whome there was good hope, that they would prooue men fit for the ſtate: yet their youth was ſuch as made all men doubt thereof. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other chiefe Cittizens in the gouernment of <hi>Florence,</hi> there was one farre excelling the reſt,<note place="margin">Tomaſo So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derini.</note> called <hi>Tomaſo Soderini:</hi> whoſe wiſedome and authoritie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Florence,</hi> but alſo to all the Princes in <hi>Italy</hi> was knowne. Hee, after the death of <hi>Piero,</hi> was of all the Cittie reuerenced: and manie Cittizens did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie viſite him, as chiefe man of the ſtate. Alſo diuerſe Princes did write vnto him. Neuertheleſſe being wiſe, and knowing what fortune followed him and his houſe, hee would neuer anſwere the Princes Letters: and perſwaded the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens they ſhould not reſort to his houſe, but to the houſes of the <hi>Medici.</hi> Alſo to ſhewe in deedes, that which by words was by him perſwaded, hee aſſembled all the chiefe Gentlemen of euerie family, at the Monaſtery of <hi>S. Antonio</hi>; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee procured that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>Giuliano di Medici</hi> ſhould come: and there after a long and graue Oration by him made, they diſputed the eſtate both of that Cittie, of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the humours of the Princes. Therein concluding, that to continue <hi>Florence</hi> vnited in peace, aſſured from diuiſion within, and from warre without, it behooued them to honor thoſe two yoong men, and mainteine the reputation of their houſe: Becauſe men do not repine to do ſuch things as they haue bene accuſtomed vnto, but new houſes, as they are eaſily honored, ſo are they quickly abandoned. For it hath bene euer more eaſie to maintaine that reputation, where length of time hath extingniſhed enuy, then to raiſe a new eſtimation, which by many occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be oppreſſed. After him ſpake <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who notwithſtanding his youth, vttered words with ſo great grauitie &amp; modeſtie, as gaue euery man hope he would become ſuch a one, as indeed afterwards he proued. And before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted that place, the Citizens praied the brethren, to receiue them as children, they offring to honor them as fathers.<note place="margin">Giuliano and Lorenzo di Medici.</note> This concluſion ſet downe, <hi>Giuliano</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> were honoured as Princes of the Citie, and thoſe that were of counſell with <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> did not intermeddle. Thus the <hi>Florentines</hi> liued both within &amp; without ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, as nothing diſturbed the Common quiet, till a trouble not looked for aroſe, which did prognoſticate future miſchiefe. Among other families (which <hi>Lucca Pitti</hi> ruined) was that of <hi>Nardi.</hi> For <hi>Saluestro</hi> and his brethren being heads of that houſe, were firſt ſent into exile, and after by the warre which <hi>Bartolomeo Coglione</hi> moued, made Rebels. Of theſe <hi>Barnardo</hi> brother of <hi>Saluestro,</hi> was a yoong man of great ſpirit and courage.<note place="margin">Conſpiracy of the Nardi.</note> Hee being poore could not endure baniſhment: and finding that the peace made had not prouided for his returne, determined to make proofe of ſomewhat, whereby might grow occaſion of warre. For many times of a ſmall beginning, great effects doe followe. Becauſe men bee more willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, then beginne anie enterpriſe. This <hi>Barnardo</hi> had much acquaintance in <hi>Prato,</hi> and muche more in the Countrey about <hi>Pistoia</hi>: chiefely with the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14349:101"/>
the houſe of <hi>Palandra:</hi> who albeit they were but countrey people, yet was their number great, and the men (according to the manner of that countrey) practiſed in armes, and much vſed to bloud. He knew likewiſe they liued diſcontented, and by reaſon that ſome of their enemies were Magiſtrates in <hi>Florence,</hi> they had bene euill handled. He knew moreouer the humor of the <hi>Prateſi,</hi> who accounted themſelues proudly and hardly gouerned, and had particuler knowledge of the euill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome towards the State. All which things brought him in hope to kindle fire in <hi>Toſcana,</hi> by making <hi>Prato</hi> to rebell, whereto ſo many would put hands, as they that would quench it, ſhould not be able. Then he imparted this matter to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſalui Neroni,</hi> and asked of him, what aide might be by his meanes procured among the Princes, if he ſhould happen to ſurprize <hi>Prato. Diotiſalui</hi> thought the enterpriſe dangerous, and as impoſsible to take effect: notwithſtanding, conſidering he might thereby with the perill of others make new proofe of fortune, perſwaded him to proceed, and promiſed to bring him aſſured aide from <hi>Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Farrara,</hi> ſo that he were able to defend <hi>Prato</hi> at the leaſt fifteene dayes. <hi>Barnardo</hi> then incouraged with this promiſe, and conceiuing great hope of happie proceeding, went to <hi>Prato,</hi> and there communicating the matter to diuerſe, found them verie willing. The like diſpoſition he perceiued in the familie of <hi>Palandra,</hi> and hauing agreed togithers of the time and manner of the enterpriſe, <hi>Barnardo</hi> imparted all to <hi>Diotiſalui.</hi> At that time, was <hi>Ceſare Petrucci, Podeſta</hi> of <hi>Prato,</hi> for the <hi>Florentines.</hi> The cuſtome was, that the <hi>Podeſta</hi> ſhould haue the keies of the towne brought vnto him: And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer any of the towne (chiefely in times of no ſuſpition) deſired to goe out or come in by night, that fauour was graunted. <hi>Barnardo</hi> knowing this cuſtome, being accompanied with thoſe of the houſe of <hi>Palandra,</hi> and 100. others armed men, in the morning when the gate towards <hi>Piſtoia</hi> ſhould open, preſented himſelfe: and thoſe whome he had made priuie within, did likewiſe arme. One of them went to the <hi>Podeſta,</hi> ſaying, a friend of his deſired to come into the towne. The <hi>Podeſta</hi> not doubting any ſuch accident, ſent with him a ſeruant of his to carrie the keies: from whome, (being a little on the way) the keies were taken, the gates opened, and <hi>Barnardo</hi> with his followers came in. Then they diuided themſelues in two parts. The one led by <hi>Salueſtro</hi> of <hi>Prato,</hi> tooke poſſeſsion of the <hi>Cittadell.</hi> The other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Barnardo,</hi> ſurprized the Pallace, and committed the <hi>Podeſta</hi> with all his familie, to the cuſtodie of one of his companie. Which done, they walked the ſtreets, proclaiming the name of libertie. By that time it was day, and many people by meane of the noiſe, came to the market place, where vnderſtanding that the <hi>Cittadell</hi> and Pallace were taken, the Gouernor alſo with his familie impriſoned, they meruailed much. The eight Cittizens (chiefe Officers of the towne) aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in their Pallace, to conſult what was to be done. But <hi>Barnardo</hi> and his men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing awhile walked the towne, and finding himſelfe not well followed, hearing where the eight were, went vnto them, declaring that the occaſion of his enterpriſe was to deliuer them and their countrey from bondage: and that they ſhould gaine great glorie to take armes, and accompanie him in that glorious action, whereby they ſhould win perpetuall quiet, and eternall fame. He alſo laid before them the memorie of their auncient libertie, comparing it with their preſent condition. He likewiſe told them what aide they ſhould be aſſured to haue of others, if they would but for a fewe daies defend themſelues from the <hi>Florentine</hi> forces. He infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them moreouer, that he had intelligence in <hi>Florence,</hi> whereby he was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Cittie would wholie follow him. The eight not moued with theſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, anſwered, that they knew not whether <hi>Florence</hi> liued in libertie or bondage, as a thing they deſired not to vnderſtand. But well they knew their owne deſire
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14349:102"/>
was not to enioy other libertie, then to obey thoſe Magiſtrates that gouerned in <hi>Florence:</hi> of whome, they had not receiued any ſuch iniurie, as might moue to take armes againſt them. Wherefore they perſwaded him to reſtore the <hi>Podeſta</hi> to his libertie, ſend his men out of the towne, and ſaue himſelfe ſpeedily from that danger, whereinto he was vnaduiſedly fallen. Theſe ſpeeches diſmaied not <hi>Barnardo,</hi> for he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to ſee if feare might moue the <hi>Prateſi,</hi> to that which with intreaty could not. Therefore to terrifie the Cittizens, and determining to put the <hi>Podeſta</hi> to death, he tooke him out of priſon, and commanded him to be hanged at the Pallace window. The <hi>Podeſta</hi> being brought to the window, the halter vpon his neck, and ſeeing <hi>Barnardo</hi> to ſollicit his death, turned himſelfe towards him, and ſaid. <hi>Barnardo,</hi> thou putteſt me to death, hoping the rather to be followed of the <hi>Prateſi,</hi> but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie will come to paſſe. For the reuerence which this people doth beare to the Gouernors ſent by the <hi>Florentines</hi> is ſo great, that ſo ſoone as they ſhall ſee this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie done to me, they will hate thee, ſo much, as the ſame will prooue thy ruine: wherefore not my death, but my life, may be the occaſion of thy victorie. For if I commaund them that which thou wouldſt haue done, they will more willinglie obey me, then thee. Thus I following thy direction, thou mayſt become owner of thy deſire. This counſell ſeemed to <hi>Barnardo</hi> (being a man irreſolute) verie reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and therefore willed him at a window to commaund the people to yeeld their obedience to <hi>Barnardo.</hi> Which being done, the <hi>Podeſta</hi> was lead back to priſon. By this time, the weakeneſſe of the conſpirators was diſcouered, and many <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> inhabiting that towne, were aſſembled: among whome, was <hi>Georgio Ginori,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> He being the firſt that tooke armes againſt the Rebels, aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Barnardo</hi> in the ſtreets, ſometimes intreating, and ſometimes threatning the people to follow him,<note place="margin">The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</note> till at length by <hi>Georgio,</hi> and many others (who tooke armes) <hi>Barnardo</hi> was hurt and taken. Which done, it was no hard matter to deliuer the <hi>Podeſta,</hi> and vanquiſh the reſt. For they being fewe, and diuided into ſundrie parts of the towne, were welneare all taken or ſlaine. In the meane ſpace, the fame of this accident was come to <hi>Florence,</hi> and reported to be much greater then it was. For the aduertiſements were, that <hi>Prato</hi> was ſurprized, the <hi>Podeſta</hi> with his houſhold put to death, <hi>Piſtoia</hi> in armes, and many of the Cittizens of the conſpiracie, in ſo much as many Cittizens ſodeinly came to the Pallace to conſult with the <hi>Senate.</hi> At that time, <hi>Roberto Sanſeuerino</hi> happened to be in <hi>Florence,</hi> who being a man of great experience in warre, was ſent with certaine forces to <hi>Prato,</hi> commaunded, that he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the towne, and ſend back particuler aduertiſements in what ſtate the ſame ſtood; and do there, what by his wiſedome ſhould be thought good. <hi>Roberto</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching on his way, and paſsing the Caſtle of <hi>Campi,</hi> a meſſenger came vnto him from <hi>Ceſare Petrucci,</hi> declaring, that <hi>Barnardo</hi> was taken, his companions fled, or ſlaine, and all the tumult pacified. Whereupon <hi>Roberto</hi> returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſhortly after <hi>Barnardo</hi> being brought thither a priſoner, and demaunded why he tooke that enterpriſe in hand, aunſwered, bicauſe he determined rather to die in <hi>Florence,</hi> then liue in exile: and thought good to accompanie his death with ſome memorable action. This tumult begun and ended (as it were in one inſtant) the Cittizens of <hi>Florence</hi> returned to their wonted order of life, thinking to enioy that ſtate without ſuſpition, which they had lately eſtabliſhed, and ſetled: whereof inſued thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, which many times be ingendred by peace, for the youth became more prodigall then they were wont, ſpending their money in apparrell, feaſting, and other like vanities, and (being idle) conſumed their ſubſtance in play, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Their whole ſtudie was to be brauely apparrelled, and to ſeeme wittie, or ſubtile; for he that could moſt cunninglie mock and deride others, was holden the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14349:102"/>
wiſeſt and moſt eſteemed. Theſe and ſuch like diſorders, were by the Courtiers of <hi>Milan</hi> increaſed. For at that time, thither came the Duke, with his wife, and Court,<note place="margin">The Duke of Milan in Florence.</note> to performe (as he ſaid) a certaine vowe, and was there receiued with pompe, meete for ſo great a Prince, and friend to the <hi>Florentines.</hi> In that time alſo, was ſeene a thing in <hi>Florence,</hi> neuer before vſed, which was, that the Courtiers of <hi>Milan,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the time of Lent, did without reſpect of the Eccleſiaſticall order, eate almoſt none other meate, but fleſh. Albeit the Duke found the Cittie of <hi>Florence</hi> full of courtlie delicacie, and cuſtomes contrarie to all well ordered ciuilitie, yet his comming increaſed the ſame. Wherefore the good Cittizens thought fit and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to bridle the exceſſe with new lawes, for apparrell, for funerals, and feaſtings. In the midſt of this great peace, there happened in <hi>Toſcana</hi> a new and vnlooked for tumult. In the Prouince of <hi>Volterra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tumults in Volterra.</note> certaine Cittizens happened to finde a Mine of Allum, whereof, knowing the commoditie, to be helped with money, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with authoritie, they ioyned with them ſome Cittizens of <hi>Florence,</hi> making them partakers of ſuch profit as ſhould thereof ariſe. This matter at the beginning (as it happeneth for the moſt part in all new actions) was by the people of <hi>Volterra</hi> little eſteemed. But the commoditie thereof afterwards knowne, they deſired too late, and without effect, that which at the firſt they might eaſilie haue obteined. Then began they to propound the matter in their councels, ſaying, it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient that a commoditie found in the common lands, ſhould be conuerted to a priuate vſe. Thereupon, they ſent vnto <hi>Florence</hi> certaine Embaſſadors. The cauſe was committed to a few Cittizens, who either bicauſe they were corrupted, or for that they ſo thought beſt, gaue ſentence, that the requeſt of the people of <hi>Volterra</hi> was not reaſonable, bicauſe they deſired to depriue the Cittizens of their labour and induſtrie, and therefore iudged, that thoſe Alums apperteined to priuate men, and not to the Citie. Yet was it conuenient, that thoſe priuate perſons ſhould giue yearly vnto the people certaine money, in ſigne they acknowledged them for ſuperiors. This anſwere did nothing diminiſh, but augment the tumults and diſpleaſures in <hi>Volterra,</hi> ſo that nothing was ſpoken of ſo much in their councels, and in euerie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place in the Cittie, as the requeſt of the multitude, which was, to recouer that which they thought loſt. The priuate men on the other ſide, ſtill laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that which they had gotten, and had bene confirmed by iudgement of the <hi>Florentines.</hi> This matter remained ſo long in diſputation, that one Cittizen, a man of eſtimation in that Cittie, called <hi>Pecorino,</hi> with diuerſe others that tooke part with him, was ſlaine, their houſes ſpoiled and burnt. In that furie alſo, the <hi>Rettori</hi> for the <hi>Florentines</hi> with difficultie eſcaped. This firſt tumult being paſſed, they determined in all haſte to ſend Embaſſadors to <hi>Florence,</hi> who informed the <hi>Senators,</hi> that if they would obſerue their auncient conditions, they would alſo continue in their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient obedience. The anſwere of theſe meſſengers was long diſputed. <hi>Tomaſo Sode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> was of opinion, that it behoued to receiue the <hi>Volterani</hi> with what condition ſo euer, thinking the time ſerued not, to kindle a fire ſo neare hand, that might burne their owne houſe: for he feared the diſpoſition of the Pope, the power of the King, and miſtruſted the <hi>Venetians</hi> friendſhip and the Dukes, not knowing what fidelitie was in the one, nor what vertue in the other, alleaging that prouerb which ſaith, <hi>Better a leane peace, then a fat victorie.</hi> Of a contrarie minde was <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> thinking he had now occaſion to make ſhew of his wiſedome and counſell, and the rather being thereto perſwaded by thoſe that enuied the authoritie of <hi>Tomaſo.</hi> And therefore determined by armes to puniſh the inſolencie of the <hi>Volterani,</hi> affirming, that if they were not corrected, as a memorable example, all others (vpon euerie light occaſion) without reuerence or reſpect, would dare to do the like. This reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14349:103"/>
made, the <hi>Volterani</hi> were anſwered, that they could not require the keeping of thoſe conditions, which they themſelues had broken, and therefore either they ſhould referre themſelues to the diſcretion of the <hi>Senate,</hi> or preſently looke for warre. The <hi>Volterani</hi> returned with this anſwere, prepared for the defence of their towne, and ſent to all Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> for aide, but were aided by fewe: for onely the <hi>Saneſi,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Piombino</hi> did promiſe to helpe them. The <hi>Florentines</hi> on the other ſide, iudging that the victorie would be gotten by making of ſpeed, aſſembled tenne thouſand footemen, and two thouſand horſe, whome vnder the conduct of <hi>Federigo,</hi> Lord of <hi>Vrbino,</hi> they ſent into the countrey of <hi>Volterra</hi>: all which, they eaſily poſſeſſed. Then they brought their Camp before the Cittie, which being builded vpon an hill, could not be aſſaulted, but on that ſide, where the Church of <hi>S. Aliſandro</hi> ſtandeth. The <hi>Volterani</hi> had for their defence enterteined a thouſand ſouldiers, or thereabouts, who ſeeing how brauely the <hi>Florentines</hi> aſſailed them, fearing they could not defend the towne, were in the ſeruice ſlowe, but in doing iniurie to the <hi>Volterani</hi> readie ynough: ſo that thoſe poore Cittizens were by the enemies aſſaulted without, and by friends oppreſſed within. In ſo much as (diſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be ſaued) thought good to make peace, and forwant of better meane, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelues to the <hi>Florentines</hi> Commiſſaries: who cauſed them to open the gates, and the greater part of the armie being entred, they went vnto the Pallace where the <hi>Priori</hi> were, whome they commanded to returne to their houſes, and by the way, one of them was by a ſouldier reuiled and robbed. Of this beginning (for men be more readie to euill then good) grew the deſtruction and ſack of this Cittie, which continued one whole day. The houſes were robbed, and the people ſpoiled, neither did the women and Churches eſcape, but all ſouldiers, aſwell they that had cowardlie defended the towne,<note place="margin">Volterra ſacked.</note> as the others that fought, were partakers of the ſpoiles. The newes of this victorie, was with much reioycing receiued at <hi>Florence,</hi> for the ſame was wholie the enterpriſe of <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who thereby gained great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And thereupon one of his deareſt friends reprooued <hi>Tomaſo Soderini</hi> for his counſell, ſaying vnto him, What ſay you now, that <hi>Volterra</hi> is taken? To whome, <hi>Tomaſo</hi> anſwered, me thinks it is loſt: for if you had taken it by compoſition, you might haue made profit and ſuretie thereof; but hauing it by force, in time of warre it will weaken and trouble you, and in time of peace, charge and hinder you. In thoſe dayes, the Pope deſiring to hold in obedience the townes belonging to the Church, cauſed <hi>Spoleto</hi> to be ſacked: which by meane of inward faction, had rebelled.<note place="margin">Caſtello be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by Pope Siſto.</note> After, for the like offence, he beſieged the Cittie of <hi>Caſtello.</hi> In that towne, <hi>Nicholo Vitelli</hi> was Prince. He being in great friendſhip with <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> refuſed not in that neceſsitie to aide him: yet was that aide not ſufficient to defend <hi>Nicholo,</hi> but ynough to ſowe the firſt ſeeds of enimitie betwixt <hi>Siſto</hi> and the <hi>Medici,</hi> which afterwards brought forth fruite of much miſchiefe: and the ſame ſhould quickly haue ſhewed it ſelfe, had not the death of Frier <hi>Piero,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Siſto,</hi> happened. For this Cardinall, hauing trauelled about all <hi>Italy,</hi> went alſo to <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> (pretending to honor the marriage of <hi>Hercole,</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara</hi>) to practiſe with the Princes, and ſound their diſpoſition towards the <hi>Florentines.</hi> But being returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> he died: not without ſuſpition to haue bene poiſoned by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who feared the greatneſſe of <hi>Siſto,</hi> ſo long as he might be counſelled and incouraged by Frier <hi>Piero.</hi> For albeit nature had made this Frier of baſe bloud, and was alſo bred vp baſely in a Monaſterie, yet ſo ſoone as he had aſpired to be Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, there appeared in him ſo great pride and ambition, as might not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Cardinall, but alſo ſeeme fit ynough for any Pope. For he feared not to make a feaſt in <hi>Rome</hi> with ſo great charge, as ſeemed ſuperfluous for any King: for therein
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14349:103"/>
he ſpent more then twentie thouſand Florins. Pope <hi>Siſto</hi> bereft of this agent, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his enterpriſes more coldly. Notwithſtanding, the league being renewed betweene the <hi>Florentines,</hi> the Duke, and <hi>Venetians,</hi> and place left for Pope <hi>Siſto,</hi> and the King, who made an other contract; therein alſo, leauing places for other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to enter, if they would. By this meane, <hi>Italy</hi> became diuided in two factions:<note place="margin">Italy diuided into ſactions.</note> for daily betwixt theſe two leagues, there grew diſpleaſure, as it happened, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Ile of <hi>Cipres,</hi> which the King <hi>Ferrando</hi> challenged, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, whereupon, the Pope and the King became more willing one of the others friendſhip. In thoſe daies, <hi>Federigo</hi> Prince of <hi>Vrbino,</hi> was accounted the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Captaine of <hi>Italy,</hi> and had long ſerued for the <hi>Florentines.</hi> The King and the Pope (to the end our league ſhould not haue the ſeruice of ſuch a leader) determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to win the good will of <hi>Federigo.</hi> To that end both the Pope and the King deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to come vnto <hi>Naples. Federigo</hi> performed their deſire, to the great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpleaſure of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> beleeuing it would become of him, as it did to <hi>Giacopo Piccinino.</hi> Yet the contrarie came to paſſe: for <hi>Federigo</hi> returned from <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Romagna</hi> with great honor, and ſtill Generall for their league. Neuertheleſſe, the King and Pope ceaſed not, to ſound the diſpoſition of the Lords in <hi>Romagna,</hi> and the <hi>Saneſi,</hi> hoping to make them his friends, and by their meanes, be able to offend the <hi>Florentines,</hi> whome they perceiued by all conuenient waies armed, to incounter their ambition: and hauing loſt <hi>Federigo</hi> of <hi>Vrbino,</hi> they enterteined <hi>Roberto</hi> of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</hi> They alſo renewed the league with the <hi>Perugini,</hi> and drew thereunto the Lord of <hi>Faenza.</hi> The Pope and King alleaged, that their diſpleaſure to the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> was, bicauſe they ſought to drawe the <hi>Venetians</hi> from them: and the Pope thought that the Church could not mainteine the reputation thereof, nor the Earle <hi>Girolamo</hi> his ſtate in <hi>Romagna,</hi> if the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> were vnited. On the other ſide, the <hi>Florentines</hi> feared they would be enemies to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> not to win their friendſhip, but the rather thereby to iniurie them: ſo as <hi>Italy</hi> liued two yeares in theſe ſuſpitions, and diuerſities of humors, before any tumults were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But the firſt (although but ſmall) happened in <hi>Toſcana. Braccio</hi> of <hi>Perugia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Trouble in Toſcana.</note> a man (as hath heretofore bene often ſaid) of great reputation in the warre, had two ſonnes, called <hi>Oddo,</hi> and <hi>Carlo.</hi> This <hi>Carlo</hi> was a child, and <hi>Oddo</hi> was by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Vale of <hi>Lamona</hi> ſlaine, as hath bene declared. <hi>Carlo</hi> being atteined to age, and able for armes, was for the memorie of his father, and the good hope of himſelfe enterteined by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and made among others, a leader for that ſtate. The time of his conduct ended, he refuſed to ſerue longer, determining to make proofe, if with his owne fame, and the reputation of his father, he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his owne countrey of <hi>Perugia.</hi> Whereto the <hi>Venetians</hi> eaſily conſented, as they that were wont in alterations to increaſe their dominion. <hi>Carlo</hi> then came into <hi>Toſcana,</hi> and found the enterpriſe of <hi>Perugia</hi> hard, by reaſon that the <hi>Perugini</hi> were in league with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> yet deſirous that this motion might take ſome effect worthie memorie, he aſſaulted the <hi>Saneſi,</hi> alleaging they were debtors of money, due to his father, for ſeruice done to that ſtate, whereof he required ſatisfaction: and vpon that demaund, aſſaulted them with ſo great furie, as that dominion became diſordered. The Cittizens of <hi>Siena,</hi> ſeeing themſelues ſo furiouſly charged (being readie to ſuſpect the worſt of the <hi>Florentines</hi>) thought all was done by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. They alſo complained much to the Pope and the King; and ſent Embaſſadors vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> to expoſtulate the iniurie, and couertlie alleaged, that without aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Carlo</hi> could not with ſo great ſecuritie haue offended them. The <hi>Florentines</hi> excuſed themſelues, promiſing in what ſort the Embaſſadors thought good, they would commaund <hi>Carlo,</hi> no more to offend the <hi>Saneſi.</hi> Whereof <hi>Carlo</hi> complained,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14349:104"/>
that they by not aiding him, ſhould loſe a great conqueſt, and he miſſe the meane, to aſpire to much glorie. For in ſhort ſpace he promiſed them poſſeſsion of that Cittie, where he found ſo great cowardice and diſorder, as with poſsibilitie it could not be defended. Then <hi>Carlo</hi> departed from thence, and returned to his old enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinement of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Albeit the <hi>Saneſi</hi> were by the <hi>Florentines</hi> deliuered from ſo great danger, yet remained they towards them offended, and iudged their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion not to be any thing, hauing ſaued them from an euill, whereof they had bene the occaſion. During that theſe matters betwixt the King and Pope were handled in <hi>Toſcana,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conſpiracie againſt the Duke of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</note> there happened in <hi>Lombardy</hi> an accident of much more moment, and did prognoſticate greater euils. There was in <hi>Milan</hi> a Scholemaiſter, called <hi>Cola</hi> of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> a man well learned, but ambitious, and ſuch a one, as inſtructed the chiefe children of the Cittie. This <hi>Cola,</hi> either bicauſe he hated the life and manners of the Duke, or for ſome other occaſion, in all his ſpeeches ſeemed to diſdaine thoſe men that liued vnder an euill prince, calling others glorious and happie, whome nature and fortune graunted to be borne, and liue in common-weales. Declaring how all famous men had bene brought vp in common-weales, and not vnder Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For the common-weales (ſaid he) did nouriſh vertuous men, but Princes did oppreſſe them: for the one doth cheriſh vertue, the other doth feare it. The yong men with whome he had gained moſt familiaritie, were <hi>Giouandrea Lampugnano, Carlo Viſconti,</hi> and <hi>Girolamo Olgeato,</hi> with them he oftentimes reaſoned of the euill nature of the Duke, and their owne misfortune, being gouerned vnder ſuch a one: and at length hee began to be in ſo great confidence of theſe yong men, that hee brought them to ſweare, that ſo ſoone as they atteined to mans eſtate, they would deliuer their countrey from the tirannie of that Prince. Theſe youths perſwaded to performe what they had promiſed, waying therewith all the Dukes behauiour, and the particuler iniuries he had done, did haſten their intent to put the matter in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The Duke <hi>Galiazzo</hi> was in his diſpoſition laſciuious and cruell, which two things had made him odious: for it ſufficed him not to entice Ladies to diſhonor, but he would alſo take pleaſure in publiſhing the ſame. Neither was he content to put men to death, but he would alſo execute them with ſome cruell manner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was moreouer ſlandered, or truely ſuſpected, to haue murthered his owne mother for hee perſwading himſelfe not to be Prince (ſhe being preſent) found meanes to remoue her to <hi>Cremona,</hi> which was the place of her dowrie, and in that iourney ſhe became ſodeinly ſick, and died: and many men iudged her ſonne was cauſe of her death. This Duke, had in matter touching women, diſhonored <hi>Carlo,</hi> and <hi>Gerolamo,</hi> and denied <hi>Giouandrea</hi> to haue the poſſeſsion of the Abbey of <hi>Miramondo,</hi> being graunted vnto him of the Pope, vpon reſignation of a kinſman of his. Theſe priuate iniuries increaſed the deſire of the yong men, by reuenge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer their countrey of ſo great miſchiefes: hoping, that if they might murther the Duke, they ſhould be not onely eſteemed of the nobilitie, but alſo of the people fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Thus determined of the enterpriſe, they oftentimes met together, and by reaſon of their auncient familiaritie, no meruaile made of their meeting. Being togithers (to make their minds more prepared for that action) they alwaies talked thereof, and with the ſheathes of daggers made for that purpoſe, one of them in the breaſt and belly ſtrake the other. Then they deuiſed of the time and place. In the Caſtle they thought it not fit to be performed. In hunting they feared it would proue incerteine &amp; perilous. When the Duke walked in the ſtreets for pleaſure, they imagined it would be hard, and vnlikely to be done. And at feaſts, they doubted the places would not ſerue. Wherefore they reſolued, at ſome publique pompe and triumph, where they were certaine of his being, to kill him, for thither they might
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14349:104"/>
vnder diuerſe coulours aſſemble their friends. They concluded alſo, that if any of them vpon occaſion were by the officers apprehended, the reſt ſhould with their ſwords in the middeſt of his enemies ſley him. This happened in the yeare 1476. The feaſt of Chriſtmas then being at hand (at which time, on <hi>S. Stephens</hi> day, the Duke was woont with great pomp to viſit the Church of that holie Martir) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued that place and time would beſt ſerue for the execution of their intent. The morning of <hi>S. Stephens</hi> day being come, they cauſed certaine of their moſt aſſured friends and ſeruants to arme themſelues, ſaying, they would go to aide <hi>Giouandrea,</hi> who contrarie to the mind of ſome his euill willers, would make a conduct for water in a certaine ground of his. They being thus armed, went to the Church, pretending, that they would before their departure, take leaue of the Prince. They procured alſo diuerſe other their friends and kinsfolks, for ſundrie conſiderations to come thither, hoping, that the deed being done, euery one would follow them to performe the reſt of the enterpriſe. And their intent was, (the Duke being ſlaine) to ioyne with thoſe armed, and goe to that place of the Cittie, where they might more eaſily raiſe the people, and perſwade them to arme themſelues againſt the Ducheſſe, and Princes of the State; ſuppoſing the people by meanes of the famine wherewith they were then grieued, would eaſily fauour the enterpriſe: and vnto the people they determined to giue leaue to ſpoile the houſes of <hi>Ceco Simonetta, Giouanni Botti,</hi> and <hi>Franceſco Lucani,</hi> all Magiſtrates of the gouernment, whereby they ſhould be aſſured of them, and gaue the people libertie. This reſolution was ſet downe, and the execution thereof firmely agreed vpon in their minds. <hi>Giouan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea</hi> with the reſt met earely in the Church, and there altogithers heard Maſſe; which being ended, <hi>Giouandrea</hi> turning towards the image of <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> ſayd, O <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Lord of our Cittie, thou knoweſt our intention, and the end wherefore we will aduenture our ſelues to ſo many perils: Be fauourable to this our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and by fauouring of iuſtice, ſhew how greatly iniuſtice doth diſpleaſe thee. To the Duke on the other ſide, before he came to the Church, many ſignes happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to prognoſticate his death at hand. For the day being come, he put on his priuie armour (as euerie other day for the moſt part he did) yet ſodeinly before he went from his houſe, either bicauſe he thought it not ſightly, or that it did hurt his bodie, he tooke it off. Then thought he to haue heard Maſſe in the Caſtle, but his Chapleine was gone to <hi>S. Steffano.</hi> Then commaunded hee that the Biſhop of <hi>Como</hi> ſhould ſay the Maſſe, but he alleaged certaine reaſonable lets, ſo the Duke was (as it were by neceſsitie) occaſioned to goe to the Church. But firſt, he called for his two ſonnes, <hi>Giouangaliazzo,</hi> and <hi>Hermes,</hi> whome he embraced, and kiſſed often, as though he had no power to depart from them: yet in the end, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to goe; and comming out of the Caſtle, betwixt the Embaſſadors of <hi>Farrara</hi> and <hi>Mantoua,</hi> rode to the Temple. The conſpirators in the meane while, to giue the leſſe ſuſpition, and keepe them from the cold, were retired into a chamber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the chiefe Prieſt of the Church, their friend, and vnderſtanding that the Duke did come, they came from the chamber into the Church. <hi>Giouandrea</hi> and <hi>Girolamo</hi> placed themſelues on the right hand of the Church doore, and <hi>Carlo</hi> on the left hand. Then thoſe that went before the Duke, entered the Churche doore, and after the Duke himſelfe, inuironed with a greate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, as it alwaies happeneth, in time of ſuch a princelie pompe. The firſte of the Conſpirators that went towardes him, were <hi>Lampugnano,</hi> and <hi>Girolamo.</hi> They pretending to make place and roome for the Prince, came hard vnto his perſon, and aſſaulted him with ſhort and ſharpe daggers, which they had hidden in their ſleeues. <hi>Lampugnano</hi> gaue him two woundes, the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14349:105"/>
one in the bellie, the other in the throate. <hi>Girolamo</hi> likewiſe in the throate, and in the breſt ſtrake him. <hi>Carlo Viſconti</hi> ſtanding neare vnto the doore, and the Duke paſt him, at ſuch time as his companions gaue the aſſault, could not hurt him before, but gaue him two other wounds, one on the ſhoulder, the other in the back: and theſe ſixe wounds were all ſo ſodeinly and ſpeedily giuen,<note place="margin">The Duke murdered.</note> that the Duke was fallen to the ground before any man knewe what the matter meaned. Neither could he do, or ſay any thing that was knowne, but in falling, one onely time he cried, O Ladie helpe me. The Duke thus laid on the ground, the rumor grew great, many ſwords were drawne out, and (as it hapned in like caſes vnlooked for) ſome fled out of the Church, and ſome ranne thither, without any certaine knowledge, or occaſion of the matter. But thoſe who were next vnto the Duke, ſeeing him ſlaine, and knowing the murtherers, purſued them. Of the conſpirators, <hi>Giouandrea</hi> intending to get out of the Church, went amongſt the women, who being many, and according to their cuſtome ſet on the ground, was ſo troubled and ſtaied with their garments, that he was by a Moore (one of the Dukes footmen) ouertaken, and ſlaine. <hi>Carlo</hi> was likewiſe by thoſe that were preſent, killed. But <hi>Girolamo Olgiato</hi> eſcaped out of the Church, ſeeing his companions ſlaine, and not knowing whither to flee, went home, where he could be neither by his father nor brothers receiued. But his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely, hauing compaſsion of her ſonne, did recommend him to a Prieſt, an auncient friend of that houſe, who put him in Prieſtlike garments, and remooued him to his houſe, where he remained two daies, hoping that ſome tumult in <hi>Milan</hi> would ariſe, and thereby he might be ſaued. But that not comming to paſſe, and fearing to be found there, he aſſaied to flee diſguiſed; yet being knowne, was brought before the Magiſtrates, and there he confeſſed all the order of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie. This <hi>Girolamo</hi> was twentie three yeares of age, and died with no leſſe courage, then he had executed the enterpriſe. For being brought to his death, ſtript naked, and prepared for the hangman, who with his knife in hand, ſtood readie to cut him in pieces, he ſpake theſe Laten words, <hi>Mors acerba, fama perpetua, ſtabit vetus memoria facti.</hi> This enterpriſe was by theſe vnhappie yoong men ſecretly practiſed, and reſolutely executed. The cauſe of their deſtruction was, that they were not followed and defended of them, to whome they truſted. Let Princes therefore learne to make themſelues ſo much honored and loued, as no man can hope to hurt them, and ſaue himſelfe. And let all priuate perſons know, how vaine it is to thinke, that the multitude (notwithſtanding it be diſcontented) will in their perils follow or accompanie them. This accident amazed all <hi>Italy,</hi> but much more trouble proceeded of other chances, that ſhortly after happened in <hi>Florence.</hi> For thereby the peace which had continued in <hi>Italy</hi> the ſpace of twelue yeares, was broken, as in the Booke following ſhall be declared. Which Booke, as it beginneth with bloud and terror, ſo doth it end with ſorrow and miſerie.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE beginning of this Booke, placed amidſt two conſpiracies, the one in <hi>Milan</hi> alreadie declared, the other happened in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and to be ſpoken of; it may be thought fit, that (according to my cuſtome) I ſhould ſomewhat ſaie, touching the quallitie of conſpiracies, and of what importance they are. Which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly I would do, had I not in other places diſcourſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or that ſuch a matter might be briefelie paſſed ouer. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it requireth great conſideration, and is alreadie ſpoken of, we will proceed, and tell how the <hi>Medici,</hi> hauing ouercome all enemies, that openly oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, being deſirous their houſe alone might haue authoritie in the Cittie, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed them to oppreſſe all others that ſecretly practiſed againſt them. For ſo long as they contended againſt other families but with equall authoritie, the Cittizens enuying their greatneſſe, might openly and without feare affront them. Bicauſe, the Magiſtrates being free, neither partie before loſſe of victorie, had any occaſion to feare it ſelfe. But after the victorie, in the yeare 66. the State became ſo much in the hand and power of the <hi>Medici,</hi> as all men diſcontented, were inforced, either patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to abide the condition wherein they liued, or elſe by way of conſpiracie, and ſecret practiſe, to amend their fortune. But ſith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracies are with difficultie performed, for the moſt part, they procure the ruine of the conſpirators, and the greatnes of him againſt whome they be conſpired. So that, a Prince by conſpiracie aſſaulted, if he be not therein ſlaine, as was the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> (which ſeldome hapneth) becommeth thereby the ſtronger, and being before good, becommeth euill. Bicauſe conſpiracies do giue him occaſion to feare, feare counſaileth him to ſeeke aſſurance, and in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aſſurance, he doth iniure others, whereby he gaineth hatred, and many times procureth his own deſtruction. So as in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, treaſons do ſodeinly ouerthrow thoſe who attempt them, and trouble him many times againſt whome they be attempted. <hi>Italy</hi> was (as hath bene before declared) diuided into two factions, the Pope and the King on the one ſide, and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the Duke, and <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> on the other ſide. And albeit there was not betwixt them any warre mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, yet was there dailie occaſion giuen thereof, and the Pope chiefelie in all his actions ſtudied to offend the ſtate of <hi>Florence. Philippo de Medici</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa,</hi> then dying, the Pope, (contrarie to the will of the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi>) gaue that Biſhopprick to <hi>Franceſco Saluiati,</hi> whome hee knewe to bee enemie to the houſe of <hi>Medici.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diſpleaſure betweene the Pope and the Medici.</note> But the <hi>Senate</hi> denying to deliuer poſſeſsion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there followed great diſpleaſure betwixt the Pope and the <hi>Medici.</hi> Beſides that, the Pope did great fauours in <hi>Rome</hi> to the familie of <hi>Pazzi,</hi> and in euerie
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14349:106"/>
acte, disfauoured the houſe of <hi>Medici.</hi> In thoſe daies, the houſe of <hi>Pazzi</hi> liued aboue other the <hi>Florentine</hi> families, in moſt riches and glorie. The chiefe of them was called <hi>Giacopo,</hi> who for his riches and Nobilitie, was made Knight. He hauing no children but one onely daughter, had for heires diuerſe nephews, ſonnes of <hi>Piero</hi> and <hi>Antonio</hi> his brethren. The chiefe of whom were <hi>Guglielmo, Franceſco, Rinato,</hi> and <hi>Giouanni.</hi> After them, <hi>Andrea, Nicholo,</hi> and <hi>Galeotto. Coſimo de Medici</hi> ſeeing their riches and nobilitie, gaue his neece <hi>Biancha</hi> in marriage to <hi>Guglielmo,</hi> hoping that alliance would make thoſe houſes more vnited, and remoue all occaſion of diſpleaſures and ſuſpitions, which many times hapned betwixt them. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding (ſo incertaine and fallible are the expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of men) the matter came otherwiſe to paſſe, for thoſe that counſelled <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> told him, it was perilous, and contrary to his authoritie, to ſuffer the Citizens to increaſe their riches and ſtate: which was the cauſe that thoſe degrees of honor were not graunted to <hi>Giacopo</hi> and his nephews, which (as other Citizens thought) they deſerued. Hereof grew the firſt diſpleaſure of the <hi>Pazzi,</hi> and the firſt feare of the <hi>Medici.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Enimitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Pazzi, and Medici.</note> The increaſing of the one, was cauſe that the other alſo increaſed: in ſo much as the <hi>Pazzi</hi> in all actions, whereat other Citizens did meete, were not to the Magiſtrates welcome. Alſo the officers of eight men, vpon a like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion (without ſuch reſpect, as was wont to be borne towards the great Citizens) conſtrained <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> to returne to <hi>Florence.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Pazzi</hi> in all places with iniurious words, and full of offence complained: which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, cauſed others to ſuſpect, &amp; think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be iniured. <hi>Giouanni de Pazzi,</hi> had married the daughter of <hi>Giouanni Barromei</hi> a man of great riches, which riches after his death for want of ſonnes, ſhould come vnto her. Neuertheles, <hi>Carlo</hi> his nephew toke poſſeſsion of part of thoſe goods, and therby the matter being brought to triall and ſute, an order was made, by vertue wherof, the wife of <hi>Giouanni de Pazzi</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited, and the poſſeſsions giuen to <hi>Carlo</hi>: which iniurie, the <hi>Pazzi</hi> did altogither impute to the <hi>Medici.</hi> Of this matter, <hi>Giuliano de Medici</hi> did many times lament, and complaine to his brother <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> ſaying, he feared leaſt they deſiring too much, ſhould loſe all. But <hi>Lorenzo</hi> being full of youth and authoritie, would needs take all vpon him, and make euery man know, that all things were done by him. The <hi>Pazzi</hi> being noble and rich, could not indure ſo great iniuries, but deuiſed by what means they might procure reuenge. The firſt that moued ſpeech againſt the <hi>Medici,</hi> was <hi>Franceſco.</hi> He being of more courage and life then the others, determined to get that which he wanted, or loſe that which he had. And bicauſe the gouernment of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> was hatefull vnto him, he liued for the moſt part in <hi>Rome,</hi> and there (according to the cuſtome of <hi>Florentine</hi> Merchants) occupied great ſummes of money. Being alſo of familier acquaintance with the Earle <hi>Girolamo,</hi> one of them often complained to the other of the <hi>Medici.</hi> In ſo much as after many conſultations, they concluded, that to make the one of them aſſured of his lands, and the other of his Cittie, it was neceſſarie to alter the gouernment of <hi>Florence,</hi> which they thought could not be done,<note place="margin">Conſpiracie againſt Giuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo di Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici.</note> without the death of <hi>Giuliano,</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> They alſo ſuppoſed, that the Pope and the King, would eaſily thereto conſent, if the facilitie of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe were laid before them. They then thus minded, imparted all their intent to <hi>Franceſco Saluiati,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa,</hi> who being ambitious, and lately iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Medici,</hi> willinglie condiſcended. And examining among themſelues what was to be done, they agreed (for the more ſpeedie performing of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to drawe thereinto <hi>Giacopo de Pazzi,</hi> without whome, they thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be performed. It was then ſuppoſed good, that for this purpoſe <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco de Pazzi</hi> ſhould goe to <hi>Florence,</hi> and the Archbiſhop and the Earle remaine at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſollicite the Pope when need required. <hi>Franceſco</hi> being come to <hi>Giacopo,</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:14349:106"/>
found him more reſpectiue, and hard to be perſwaded, then they would haue him, and aduertiſing the ſame to <hi>Rome,</hi> it was thought fit to draw him with more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Whereupon the Archbiſhop and the Earle opened all the matter to <hi>Giouanbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta da Monteſecco,</hi> one of the Popes Captaines. He being a man of warre well eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was alſo beholding to the Pope and the King. Neuertheleſſe, he iudged the matter hard, full of danger and difficulties, which the Archbiſhop laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue, by telling him what aide the Pope and King would giue to the enterpriſe. Alſo he alleaged, that the Citizens of <hi>Florence</hi> did hate the <hi>Medici,</hi> and the <hi>Saluiati</hi> and <hi>Pazzi</hi> would help to kill them, which was the more eaſie to do, by reaſon they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the Cittie vnaccompanied, and without ſuſpect. Therefore if <hi>Giuliano</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> were dead, the State might eaſily be changed. All which reaſons, <hi>Giouanbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta</hi> beleeued not, hearing many <hi>Florentines</hi> affirme the contrarie. While theſe matters were in conſideration, it happened <hi>Carlo</hi> of <hi>Faenza</hi> fell ſo ſick, as euerie man feared his death. It was then thought good to the Archbiſhop and the Earle, to take occaſion to ſend <hi>Giouanbattiſta</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Romagna,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to recouer certaine Townes, which the Lord of <hi>Faenza</hi> had taken from them. The Earle therfore commaunded <hi>Giouanbattiſta</hi> to ſpeake with <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and in his name deſire counſell how the matters of <hi>Romagna</hi> might be handled: after to deale with <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi,</hi> and then they togither, to perſwade <hi>Giacopo di Pazzi</hi> to be of their mind. And bicauſe he ſhould carrie with him the authoritie of the Pope, they procured him to ſpeake with his holineſſe, who offered to further the enterpriſe with all his power. <hi>Giouanbattiſta</hi> arriued at <hi>Florence,</hi> went vnto <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> of whome he was curteouſly receiued, and in all his demaunds wiſely and friendly counſelled. Whereof <hi>Giouanbattiſta</hi> meruailed, finding him an other man, then he was reported to be: for he perceiued him to be curteous, wiſe, and a friend to the Earle: notwithſtanding he thought fit to talke with <hi>Franceſco,</hi> but (he being gone to <hi>Lucca</hi>) communed with <hi>Giacopo,</hi> whome at the firſt he found farre from the matter, yet before they parted, with the authoritie of the Pope ſomewhat moued; and ſaid to <hi>Giouanbattiſta,</hi> that he ſhould goe into <hi>Romagna,</hi> and in the meane ſpace <hi>Franceſco</hi> would become home: and then more particulerly they would reaſon how all things ſhould be handled. <hi>Giouanbattiſta</hi> went and returned, and ſtill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued to enterteine <hi>Lorenzo</hi> with his diſsimuled buſines for the Earle: and after conferred with <hi>Giacopo</hi> and <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi,</hi> with whom he perſwaded ſo farre, that they conſented to the enterpriſe. Then they reaſoned of the manner how to performe it, and <hi>Giacopo</hi> thought it vnpoſsible, both the brethren being in <hi>Florence,</hi> and therfore thought beſt to tarry til <hi>Lorenzo</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was thought he would, and then to execute the matter. <hi>Franceſco</hi> liked well that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſhould goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> but if he did not go thither, yet either at ſome wedding in the Church, or at the time of ſome ſport, they might be both ſlaine. And touching forreine aide, he thought the Pope might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble forces, pretending the enterpriſe of the Caſtle of <hi>Montone,</hi> hauing iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to take it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Carlo,</hi> bicauſe he had moued rebellion in the countries belonging to <hi>Siena</hi> and <hi>Perugia.</hi> Yet was nothing fully concluded, but that <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi,</hi> and <hi>Giouanbattiſta</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there with the Earle and the Pope deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all things. This matter was againe practiſed in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the end a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſet downe (the enterpriſe of <hi>Montone</hi> being determined) that <hi>Ciouan Franceſco da Tolentino</hi> the Popes ſouldier, ſhould goe to <hi>Romagna,</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo di Caſtello</hi> to his countrey, and either of them with their men be readie to do, whatſoeuer by the Archbiſhop <hi>Saluiati,</hi> &amp; <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi</hi> ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded: who, with <hi>Giouan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battiſta de Monteſecco</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> and make prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all things for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the enterpriſe; whereunto the king <hi>Ferrando</hi> by his Embaſſador promiſed

ſome aide. The Archbiſhop, and <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi</hi> arriued at <hi>Florence,</hi> perſwaded vnto the conſpiracie <hi>Giacopo di Poggio,</hi> a yong man well learned, but ambitious, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in change. They perſwaded alſo the two <hi>Giacopi Saluiati,</hi> one was brother, the other nephew to the Archbiſhop. They perſwaded likewiſe <hi>Barnardo Bandini,</hi> and <hi>Napolione</hi> (two valiant yong men borne in <hi>Fraunce</hi>) yet affectionat to the family of <hi>Pazzi.</hi> Of ſtrangers (beſides thoſe we haue named) they perſwaded <hi>Antonio di Volterra,</hi> and one other called <hi>Steffano,</hi> a Prieſt, who taught the latin toong to the daughter of <hi>Giacopo. Rinato de Pazzi,</hi> being a wiſe and graue man (and ſuch a one as knew the inconuenients that followed like enterpriſes) would not conſent to the conſpiracie, but by all honeſt meanes he could, impeached the ſame. The Pope had in the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Piſa,</hi> mainteined <hi>Raffaello de Riario</hi> (nephew to the Earle <hi>Girola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi>) to learne the Cannon lawes, where he continued till the Pope aduanced him to the dignitie of Cardinall. The conſpirators thought fit to bring this Cardinall to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, ſhould couer the conſpiracie, hoping to harbour in his houſe thoſe conſpirators, whom they had need of, and thereby take occaſion to performe their inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The Cardinall being deſired, came, and was by <hi>Giacopo de Pazzi</hi> receiued at <hi>Montughi</hi> his towne, neare vnto <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> The conſpirators deſired by his occaſion to aſſemble <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>Giuliano,</hi> and ſo to kill them. They found meanes then that they ſhould feaſt the Cardinall at their towne of <hi>Fieſole,</hi> whither <hi>Giuliano</hi> either by hap or purpoſe came not, ſo as that appointment failed. Then determined they to conuite them in <hi>Florence,</hi> whither of neceſsitie they muſt come, and ſo they tooke order to make the feaſt on Sund<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y the 26. of Aprill 1478. The conſpirators thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to murther them at the feaſt, on Saterday night they met togither, to take order for the execution of the murther the next day. The day being come, <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco</hi> was aduertiſed, that <hi>Giuliano</hi> would not be there. For which conſideration, the conſpirators met againe, and concluded, that it ſtood them vpon to bring the matter to execution, bicauſe it was impoſsible (being knowne to ſo many) but it would be reuealed, wherefore they determined to kill him in the Cathedrall Church of <hi>S. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parata,</hi> where the Cardinall being, both the bretheren (according to their cuſtome) would not faile to be. They ordered, that <hi>Giouanbattiſta</hi> ſhould take in hand to kill <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi,</hi> with <hi>Barnardo Bandini,</hi> ſhould ſley <hi>Giuliano. Giouan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battiſta,</hi> refuſed to performe his charge, either bicauſe the curteous vſage of <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had mollified his mind, or elſe for ſome other occaſion which moued him, ſaid, he durſt not commit ſo great a ſinne in the Church, as to execute treaſon with ſacrilege. Which conceit of <hi>Giouanbattiſta,</hi> was the firſt ruine of their enterpriſe; for the time drawing on, they were forced to commit that charge to <hi>Antonio</hi> of <hi>Volterra,</hi> and <hi>Steffano</hi> the Prieſt: two men, both for experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and nature, farre vnfit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, bicauſe there is no action which requireth more reſolution and conſtancie of mind, then this. And it behoueth him that ſhould take ſuch a matter in hand, to be a man accuſtomed to be preſent at the death of others. For it hath oft bene ſeene, that ſome men, vſed to armes and bloud, haue notwithſtanding in like caſes, let fall their courage. This determination ſet downe, they agreed that the time of the execution ſhould be at the ſacring time of Maſſe, and in the ſame inſtant, the Archbiſhop <hi>Salui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ati,</hi> with <hi>Giacopo,</hi> ſhould take poſſeſsion of the publique Pallace, to the end that the <hi>Senators</hi> either by conſent or force (ſo ſoone as the yong men were ſlaine) ſhould fauour the conſpirators. This courſe being agreed of, they went to the Temple, where they found the Cardinall, and <hi>Lorenzo de Medici.</hi> The Church was full of people, and the ſeruice begun, but <hi>Giuliano</hi> not come. Wherfore <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi,</hi> with <hi>Barnardo</hi> (who had the charge of his death) went vnto his houſe, and there by intreatie and cunning, perſwaded him to come to the Church. And truly it is a thing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14349:107"/>
worthy memorie, to know how ſo great hatred would be ſo couertly kept ſecret in the minds of <hi>Franceſco</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnardo.</hi> For both by the way going to the Church, and in the church, they enterteined <hi>Giuliano</hi> with pleaſant ſpeech and youthful daliance. Alſo <hi>Franceſco</hi> vnder colour of familier and friendly curteſie, tooke <hi>Giuliano</hi> in his armes, to feele whether he had on anie armour or garment of defence. <hi>Giuliano</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> knew well inough they were not beloued of the <hi>Pazzi,</hi> and that they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to remoue them from their authoritie in the ſtate: yet feared they not their own liues, ſuppoſing that whenſoeuer the <hi>Pazzi</hi> would attempt anie enterpriſe againſt them, they would do it ciuilly and not by violence. Therefore not miſtruſting anie ſuch meaſure, they likewiſe feined themſelues to be their friends. The murtherers thus prepared, thoſe that were appointed for ſlaughter of <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> thruſt in among the multitude: where they might ſtand without ſuſpition. The others, togithers with <hi>Giuliano,</hi> being come to the Church, at the time appointed, <hi>Barnardo Bandini</hi> with a ſhort dagger made for the purpoſe, ſtabbed <hi>Giuliano</hi> to the heart, who moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a ſtep or two, fell to the ground: and vpon him went <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his bodie in many places ſo furiouſly, that he ſtrake himſelfe alſo a great wound in one of his owne legs. <hi>Antonio</hi> and <hi>Steffano</hi> aſſaulted <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> at whom they ſtrake diuerſe times, but hurt him onely a litle in the throate. For either their negligence, his reſiſtance, or the helpe of thoſe that ſtood by, ſaued him from further harme. So that the conſpirators fled, and hid themſelues. But being afterwards founde, they were ſhamefully put to death, and their bodies drawne through all the ſtreetes of the Citie. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ioyning with thoſe friends he had about him, retired himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the veſterie of the Temple, and there ſhut vp the doores. <hi>Barnardo Bandini</hi> ſeeing <hi>Giuliano</hi> dead, ſlew alſo <hi>Franceſco Nori</hi> a great friend to the <hi>Medici,</hi> either becauſe hee hated him before, or becauſe <hi>Franceſco</hi> had gone about to ſaue <hi>Giuliano.</hi> Alſo not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with theſe two murthers, he went towards <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> hoping by his courage and quickneſſe to ſupplie that, which others for their ſloth and cowardice had left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. But <hi>Lorenzo</hi> being in the veſtry, he could not performe his intent. In the midſt of this great and terrible accident (which was ſuch as made all men to feare, that the Church would haue fallen downe) the Cardinall retired to the altar, where he was with great difficultie by the Prieſts ſaued, till ſuch time (as the tumult ceaſed) the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> could conuey him to his Pallace, and there till his deliuerie, with great feare he remained. At that time there were in <hi>Florence,</hi> certaine Citizens of <hi>Perugia,</hi> who by the factions, (enemies to their houſes,) had bene baniſhed. Theſe <hi>Perugini</hi> being promiſed by the <hi>Pazzi</hi> to be reſtored to their country, were alſo of this conſpiracie. Whereupon the Archbiſhop <hi>Saluiati,</hi> (who was gone to ſurpriſe the Pallace accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Giacopo,</hi> the two other <hi>Saluiati,</hi> and other his friends and followers) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come thither, left certaine of them below, charging them, that ſo ſoone as they ſhould heare anie noyſe, to take poſſeſsion of the gate, and he with the greater part of the <hi>Perugini</hi> went vp, where he found the <hi>Senate</hi> at dinner, and was preſently let in by <hi>Ceſare Petrucci Gonfaloniere di Giustitia.</hi> The Archbiſhop thus entred with a fewe, leauing the reſt without, they of their owne accord went into the Chancery, where they ſhut themſelues in. For the locke of that doore was by ſuch deuiſe made, as neither within, nor without, could be but with the key opened. The Archbiſhop in the meane ſpace being with the <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> pretending to ſpeake with him of matters by the Popes commandement, began to vtter ſome ſpeech fearefully, and as though he were amazed. In ſo much as the alteration of his countenance &amp; words, wrought ſo great ſuſpition in the <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> that ſodeinly he thruſt him out of the chamber: and ſeeing <hi>Giacopo</hi> there alſo, tooke him by the haire of the head, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him to the hands of the Serieants. The reſt of the <hi>Senators</hi> perceiuing theſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:14349:108"/>
tumults: with thoſe weapons which were next hand, aſſaulted the others which were come vp with the Archbiſhop. Part of them being ſhut vp, the reſt were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, all whom they ſodeinly ſlew, or cauſed aliue to be caſt out of the Pallace win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Of this number, the Archbiſhop with the other two, <hi>Saluiati</hi> and <hi>Giacopo de Poggio</hi> were hanged. The other conſpirators which were left below, had wonne the gate from the guard, and gotten poſſeſsion of all the lower roomes, ſo that the Citizens who reſorted vnto the Pallace vpon this rumor, could neither with their counſell nor their force aſsiſt the <hi>Senators.</hi> In the meane ſpace, <hi>Franceſco de Pazzi,</hi> and <hi>Barnardo Bandini</hi> ſeeing <hi>Lorenzo</hi> eſcaped, and one of them in whom the chiefe hope of the enterpriſe depended, to be ſore hurt, were therewith diſmaied. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Barnardo</hi> hoping with that courage to eſcape, wherewith he had iniured the <hi>Medici,</hi> ſeeing the enterpriſe failed, fled away and ſaued himſelfe. <hi>Franceſco</hi> being come home to his houſe hurt, offered to mount on horſebacke (for the order was, that certaine armed men ſhould be placed about the towne, and the people called to libertie and armes) but he could not: So deep was the wound, and ſo much bloud had he loſt. Wherefore he put off all his cloathes, and laide himſelfe naked in bed; deſiring <hi>Giacopo</hi> that he would performe that which himſelfe could not: albeit <hi>Giaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po</hi> were old, and vnpractiſed in ſuch tumults, yet to make the laſt proofe of fortune, mounted on horſebacke, followed with a hundreth horſemen or thereabouts (who were laid readie for the like enterpriſe) and with thoſe he went to the Market place of the Pallace, calling the people to aide him, and recouer their libertie. But the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the fortune and liberallitie of the <hi>Medici</hi> made deaffe, gaue no eare to helpe him, and the <hi>Florentines</hi> had ſo much forgotten their libertie, as he receiued no aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere at all. Onely the <hi>Senators</hi> (who commaunded the higheſt place in the Pallace) ſaluted them with throwing downe of ſtones, and with threatenings by all wayes they could deuiſe, terrified them. <hi>Giacopo</hi> ſtanding then doubtfull what to doo, was met by <hi>Giouanni Saristori</hi> his brother in lawe, who firſt reprooued him and the reſt, for the troubles they had begun, and then perſwaded him to returne to his houſe, ſaying that the welfare of the people, and the libertie, touched other Citizens aſwel as him. Thus <hi>Giacopo</hi> voyd of all hope, ſeeing the <hi>Senators</hi> his enemies, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> aliue, <hi>Franceſco</hi> hurt, and himſelfe not followed of anie, determined to flee and ſaue his life, if poſsibly he could. For which purpoſe, with that companie which was with him in the Market place,<note place="margin">The euent of this conſpiracie.</note> he went out of <hi>Florence</hi> towards <hi>Romagna.</hi> In the meane time all the Citie were in armes, and <hi>Lorenzo di Medici</hi> accompanied with many armed men, returned home to his houſe. The Pallace was recouered by the people, and all the conſpirators taken and ſlaine. Alſo throughout the Citie, the name of <hi>Medici</hi> was proclaimed, and the members of the dead men, either carried vppon the pointes of ſwordes and launces, or drawne through the ſtreets: moreouer euerie man, both by wordes and deeds, irefully and cruelly perſecuted the <hi>Pazzi.</hi> Their houſes were by the people taken, and <hi>Franceſco</hi> (naked as he laie in bed) drawne out and brought to the Pallace, where he was hanged faſt by the Archbiſhop and others his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But he would not in any wiſe, for any iniurie done vnto him by the way, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſpeak any word at all: but looked euery man earneſtly in the face, and ſo without other lamentation tooke leaue of life. <hi>Guglielmo di Pazzi,</hi> brother in lawe to <hi>Lorenzo</hi>) by his owne innocencie and the help of his wife <hi>Bianca,</hi> ſaued himſelfe in his houſe. There was no Citizen either armed or diſarmed, but in that neceſsitie went vnto <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo,</hi> offering him their ſeruice and ſubſtance. So great was the fortune and fauour, which that houſe, by his wiſedom and liberallitie had gained. <hi>Rinato de Pazzi,</hi> when this chaunce happened, retired to his houſe in the countrey: where vnderſtanding therof, he diſguiſed himſelfe and fled. Notwithſtanding, being knowne by the way,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14349:108"/>
hee was taken and brought to <hi>Florence. Giacopo</hi> in paſsing the Alpes was alſo taken. For thoſe mountaine people hearing what had happened in <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſeeing him fleeing, ſtaied him, and brought him back to <hi>Florence.</hi> Neither could he intreat them to kill him by the way, although he earneſtly deſired them ſo to do. <hi>Giacopo</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato</hi> were brought to their death, foure daies after this accident happened: &amp; among ſo many murthers and executions done all thoſe foure daies, by meanes whereof the ſtreets were filled with dead men; yet was there no compaſsion taken of any, but onely of this <hi>Rinato</hi>; becauſe he was accounted a wiſe man, honeſt, and free from that pride, whereof the reſt of that houſe were noted. And to the end that this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might proceed for an extraordinarie example, <hi>Giacopo</hi> being buried among his aunceſtors, was (as a man excommunicate) taken vp, and by the haulter wherewith he was hanged, drawne naked throughout the Citie: and thoſe that drew him, not voucthſauing him a graue, threw his bodie into the riuer of <hi>Arno.</hi> A rare example of fortune, to ſee a man of ſo great riches, and happie eſtate, to fall into ſo great infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and be ruined with ſo much crueltie. Some haue reported him, to be delighted in vices, and that he tooke great pleaſure in gaiming and ſwearing, as one that was careleſſe and deſperate. Theſe vices he couered with liberallitie and almes: for he largely releeued many poore men, and gaue mony to places of deuotion. This good alſo may be ſaid of him, that the night before the Sunday appointed for the murther (to the end no friend ſhould be partaker of his misfortune) hee paide all his debts, and deliuered all the merchandiſe he had of other mens to the propper owners, with marueilous care and diligence. <hi>Giouanbattista de Monteſecco,</hi> after many examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was beheaded. <hi>Nappolione</hi> the Frenchman, ſcaped away, and by that meanes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe. <hi>Guglielmo de Pazzi,</hi> was baniſhed, and his brother in lawes left aliue, were put in priſon in the bottome of the Caſtle at <hi>Volterra.</hi> The tumults thus pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the conſpirators puniſhed, the funerall of <hi>Giuliano</hi> was celebrated with much lamentation of all Citizens: becauſe there was in him ſo great liberallitie and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as might be wiſhed in any man borne to like fortune. Of <hi>Giuliano</hi> there remained one ſonne, who was borne a fewe moneths after his death, and was called <hi>Giulio</hi>: who became of that vertue and fortune, which at this preſent all the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and I will (when occaſion ſhall be offered if God graunt me life) ſpeake of him at large. Thoſe ſouldiers which were conducted by <hi>Lorenzo da Castella</hi> in the vale of <hi>Teuere,</hi> and thoſe which ſerued vnder <hi>Giouanfranceſco da Tolentino</hi> in <hi>Romagna,</hi> were ioyned togither to aide the <hi>Pazzi:</hi> and were comming towards <hi>Florence.</hi> But hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the enterpriſe was miſcarried, they returned backe. And the alteration of the ſtate not being brought to paſſe (as the Pope and King deſired) they determined to do that by open warre, which by ſecret conſpiracie they could not.<note place="margin">The Pope and King moue warre againſt the Florenti<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> (becauſe the warre was ſaid to be made onely againſt him) deſired before all other things, to aſſemble in the Pallace with the <hi>Senate</hi> all the principall Cittizens, to the number of three hundreth or more: vnto whom he ſpake as followeth.<note place="margin">The ſpe<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch of Lorenzo de Medici to the Florentines.</note> I know not (right noble Lords and magnificent Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens) whether I ought lament or reioyce with you, for theſe matters lately happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For when I conſider with what fraud and deſpight I was aſſaulted, and my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14349:109"/>
ſlaine; I cannot but bee ſorrie, and with all my heart and ſoule lament. Yet when I remember with what readineſſe, what loue and vniuerſall conſent of all this Citie, my brothers death was reuenged and I defended, I muſt of force be glad, and greatly eſteeme my ſelfe. For as experience hath now taught me to know, that I haue more enemies in the Cittie then I thought, ſo hath it enformed mee, that I had alſo more earneſt and affectionate friends then I looked for. I am then to condole with you for the iniurie of others, and reioyce with you, for your owne merits: yet muſt my ſorrow be the more, becauſe the iniuries were rare, neuer ſeene, and not of vs deſerued. Conſider (right noble Cittizens) to what point frowarde fortune had brought our houſe, that among our friends, our kinsfolks, and in the Church, it was not aſſured. Such as ſtand in feare of their liues, were wont to reſort to their friends for aide, and flee to their kinsfolk for ſuccour: both whom we found readie armed to our deſtruction. Such as either miſtruſted priuate or publique perſecution, haue found refuge in Churches: but the ſame hauing ſaued others, hath bin made a place for our murder. For where murderers &amp; theeues haue found refuge, the <hi>Medici</hi> haue met with miniſters of their death. But God (who hitherto did neuer abandon our houſe) hath ſaued vs, and taken vpon him the defence of our iuſt cauſe. For what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie haue we done, that might of any man merit ſo great deſire of reuenge? Truly we neuer offended priuately any of theſe, who haue prooued themſelues ſo much our enemies. For if we had offended them, they ſhould not haue had ſo great meane to offend vs. Or if they attribute to vs the publique iniuries (whereof I am not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie) they offend rather you then vs; rather this Pallace, and maieſtie of gouernment then our houſe: ſeeming that for our cauſe you do vndeſeruedly iniure them, and the reſt of your Citizens, which is farre from all troth. For we, though we could, and you (though we would) did neuer conſent they ſhould be done. Whoſoeuer doth looke well into the truth, ſhall finde, that our <unclear>houſe</unclear> hath bene by you, with ſo vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall conſent, aduaunced for nothing more, then for that it hath ſtudied to excell others in curteſie, liberallitie, and well dooing. If then we haue honoured ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, how haue we iniured our kinsfolke? If this motion proceeded of deſire to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne (as it ſeemeth to do, by taking the Pallace and leading armed men to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place) thereby appeareth, how euill, ambitious, and reprooueable it is. If it be done, for the mallice and enuie they beare to our authoritie, therein they offend you, not vs to whom you haue giuen it. For ſurely thoſe authorities deſerue hate, which men vſurpe, not thoſe which with curteſie, liberallitie, and magnificence be gained. You know alſo that our houſe neuer aſcended to any degree of greatneſſe, but by order of this Pallace, and your vniuerſall graunt. <hi>Coſimo</hi> my graundfather, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not from exile by force of armes or violence, but by your allowance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. My father being aged and ſicke, could not defend his authoritie againſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies, but you with your authoritie did it. I my ſelfe after my fathers death (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were a childe) haue not mainteined the eſtimation of my houſe, but by your counſels and fauour. Neither could our houſe haue gouerned this common-weale, had you not ioyned, and doo ioyne in the gouernment thereof. I cannot therefore imagine, what cauſe of mallice they haue againſt vs, or what iuſt occaſion to enuie vs. For ſith their owne aunceſtors with their pride and couetiſe, haue loſt thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, why ſhould they enuie vs, if by contrarie deſert we haue gained them? But admit the iniuries done them by vs be great, and that they iuſtly deſired our ruine, yet why ſhould they offend this Pallace? Why make they league with the Pope and King againſt the libertie of this ſtate? Or why do they diſturbe the long peace of <hi>Italy?</hi> Hereof they haue no excuſe at all, for they ought to offend thoſe, who offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; and not mixe priuate diſpleaſures, with publique iniuries: which is the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14349:109"/>
reaſon that they being extirped, our miſerie is the more. For by their meanes the Pope and King are comming towardes vs in armes: and that warre (they ſay) to be made onely againſt me and my houſe. Which would God were true, becauſe then the remedie is readie and certain. For I am not ſo bad a Citizen, as to preferre my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate welfare, before your publique weldooing: but would willingly quench your fire, with my own deſtruction. Yet ſith the iniuries which great men do, be alwaies couered with ſome pretence leſſe diſhoneſt, they haue choſen this quarell, to cloake their ſhamefull enterpriſe. But if it ſo be, that you beleeue the contrarie, I am in your hands to be holden, or let looſe, as your ſelues ſhall thinke beſt. You are my fathers, you are my defenders, whatſoeuer you commaund, I obey and will performe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I euer refuſe (if it ſhall pleaſe you) to end this warre with my bloud, which by the bloud of my brother hath bene begun. While <hi>Lorenzo</hi> thus ſpake, the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens could not refraine weeping: and with ſuch compaſsion as they heard him, he was by one of them, anſwered, ſaying; The Cittie did acknowledge to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo much good of him and his, as hee might aſſure himſelfe they would be no leſſe readie to preſerue his reputation and authoritie, then they had bene willing to reuenge his brothers death, and ſaue his life. And before he ſhould loſe either the one or the other, they would hazard the loſſe of their countrey. And to the end their deeds might be anſwerable to thoſe words, they appointed a certain number of men to guard his perſon from domeſticall treaſons: and after tooke order for the warre, leuying both men and money by all meanes conuenient. Then by vertue of the league, they ſent for aide to the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> and the <hi>Venetians.</hi> And ſith the Pope had ſhewed himſelfe a wolfe and no ſhepheard, fearing to be deuoured, by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes they iuſtified their cauſe, letting all <hi>Italy</hi> know the treaſon practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſtate: declaring the wickedneſſe of the Pope, and his iniuſtice; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by indirect meanes aſpired to the Papacie, would alſo with mallice exerciſe the ſame. For he had not onely firſt ſent a Prelate of his to accompanie traytors, and cut-throates to commit murther in the Temple, euen in the time of diuine ſeruice, and at the inſtant of celebration of the Sacrament, (and ſo by the death of the Citizens to chaunge the gouernment, and ſacke the Cittie at his pleaſure) but had alſo excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated them, and with his papall curſes threatned and offended them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding if God were iuſt, and that the iniuries of men were to him offenſiue, it could not be, but that the actions of this Pope were to him diſpleaſing, and would be content that men iniured (not hauing any other refuge) might reſort vnto him. Wherefore the <hi>Florentines</hi> did not onely refuſe to obey this excommunication,<note place="margin">The Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines careleſſe of the Popes curſe.</note> but alſo the ſame notwithſtanding, inforce their Prieſts to celebrate diuine ſeruice. They alſo aſſembled a Councell in <hi>Florence,</hi> wherunto all the Prelates of <hi>Toſcana</hi> repaired, and appealed from the Pope to the next Councell. On the other ſide, the Pope wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not reaſons to iuſtifie his cauſe: and therefore alleaged it was the office of a chief Biſhop, to remoue tyrants, oppreſſe the wicked, and aduaunce the good. All which things, it behoued him by all waies to procure. For it was not the office of ſeculer Princes to impriſon Cardinals, hang vp Biſhops, to kill, cut in peeces, and drawe the Prieſts through the ſtreets, murthering both guiltie and vnguiltie people, without reſpect. Notwithſtanding all theſe quarrels and accuſations, the Cardinall (whom the <hi>Florentines</hi> kept priſoner) was releaſed, and ſent home to the Pope: which was the cauſe that the Pope without reſpect, with all his and the Kings forces,<note place="margin">The Pope and King aſſault the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> aſſailed them. And thoſe two armies conducted by <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Ferrando</hi> Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> and by <hi>Federigo</hi> Earle of <hi>Vrbino)</hi> entred <hi>Chianti,</hi> by leaue of the <hi>Saneſi</hi> (who fauoured the enemie) and ſurprized <hi>Radda</hi> with diuerſe other Caſtles, and ſpoyled the countrey: which done, they encamped at <hi>Castellina.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> ſeeing theſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14349:110"/>
aſſaults, were much afraid, being without men, and ſlowly aided by friends. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Duke had ſent a ſupplie, yet the <hi>Venetians</hi> denied they were bound to helpe them in priuate cauſes. And the warre being againſt priuate men they were not to aide them; becauſe priuate quarrels are not publiquely to be defended. Wherefore the <hi>Florentines</hi> thought good by Embaſſadors to perſwade the <hi>Venetians</hi> to a better opinion: and ſent <hi>Tomaſo Soderini</hi> vnto the <hi>Senate.</hi> In the meane ſpace ſouldiers were enterteined, and <hi>Hercole</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara</hi> appointed Generall. While this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was in making, the enemy diſtreſſed <hi>Castellina,</hi> and the people there diſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of reſcue, after fortie daies defence, yeelded. From thence the enemie marched towards <hi>Arezzo,</hi> and laid ſiege to <hi>Monte S. Souino.</hi> By this time the <hi>Florentine</hi> armie was readie, and being come within three miles, the enemie ſeemed therewith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. For <hi>Federigo de Vrbino</hi> deſired truce for a fewe daies: which was graunted with ſo great diſaduauntage to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> that they who deſired it, did much meruaile. For if that requeſt had not bene obteined, they had bene forced to depart with ſhame. But hauing thoſe daies to repaire them, in the ende of the truce, they tooke that Caſtle, before the faces of our men. Yet the winter at hand, the enemy to lodge himſelfe with more commoditie, retired into the countrey of <hi>Siena.</hi> The <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> likewiſe beſtowed themſelues, where with moſt commoditie they could. And the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara</hi> hauing litle profitted himſelfe, and done leſſe good to others,<note place="margin">Genoua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled from the Duke of Milan.</note> returned to his owne. In thoſe daies <hi>Genoua</hi> rebelled from the Duke vppon theſe conſiderations. After the death <hi>Galeazzo</hi> (hauing left his ſonne yoong and vnfit to gouerne) their grew diſcention betwixt <hi>Lodouico, Octauiano,</hi> and <hi>Aſcanio</hi> his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and the Ladie <hi>Bona</hi> his mother: for euerie of them, deſired the tuition of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Duke. In which contentions the Ladie <hi>Bona</hi> Ducheſſe (by counſell of <hi>Tomaſo Soderini</hi> Embaſſador there for the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and <hi>Cecco Simonetti</hi> (who had bene Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie to <hi>Galeazzo</hi>) gat the vpper hand. Whereupon the <hi>Sforzi</hi> fled from <hi>Milan.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were to ſundrie places confined; for <hi>Roberto</hi> in thoſe troubles had abandoned the Duches, and ioyned with them. After happened ſome tumults in <hi>Toſcana,</hi> by which new accidents, thoſe Princes hoping of new fortune, euerie of them attempted ſomewhat, whereby to returne to his country. The King <hi>Ferrando,</hi> who ſaw that the <hi>Florentines</hi> were in their neceſsitie, ſuccoured onely by the ſtate of <hi>Milan,</hi> to take alſo from them that aide, found meanes that the Ducheſſe ſhould ſo be ſet a worke in her country, as of her, they could not be aided. And by <hi>Proſpero A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorno,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Roberto</hi> (who were rebelled) found meanes to make <hi>Genoua</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt from the Duke.

They perſwaded the <hi>Florentines</hi> alſo to ſend vnto him, promiſing to make ſome end of the war, and procure a good peace. The <hi>Florentines</hi> refuſed not to make this trial, and the rather that therby they ſhould let the world know, they were deſirous of peace. Theſe Embaſſadors diſpatched, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again without any thing done. Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tines,</hi> to honor themſelues by the reputation of the French King (being by the <hi>Italians</hi> partly offended, &amp; partly abandoned) ſent vnto him <hi>Donato Acciaiuoli,</hi> a man well learned in the Greek &amp; Latin toongs, &amp; one whoſe anceſtors had alwaies born office in the citie: but being on his way, at <hi>Milan</hi> he died. Then the ſtate to reward his heires,<note place="margin">The Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their ſeruants.</note> and honor the memory of him being dead, with publike expence honorably buried his bodie, aduancing his ſons, and giuing portions of mony to his daughters marriages. In his place, they ſent Embaſſador to the King, <hi>Guidantonio Veſpucci,</hi> a man alſo learned in the Emperial and Papall lawes. The aſſault of <hi>Roberto</hi> vpon the country of <hi>Piſa,</hi> troubled much the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> for being alreadie occupied in a great war towards <hi>Siena,</hi> they ſaw not how to make prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for <hi>Piſa.</hi> But to hold the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> faithfull, and that they ſhould not releeue the enemie with mony or victual, ſent Embaſſador vnto them <hi>Piero Capponi:</hi> who was (by reaſon of the auncient hate which that citie beareth to the <hi>Florentines</hi>) receiued with ſo great ſuſpition, as hee feared many times to haue bene populerly ſlaine. Inſomuch as this iourney did rather breede occaſion of new diſpleaſure, then new friendſhip. The <hi>Florentines</hi> then reuoked the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara,</hi> enterteined the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and with great ſute, required of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to haue the Earle <hi>Carlo,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Braccio,</hi> and <hi>Deifebo,</hi> ſonne of the Earle <hi>Giacopo.</hi> Which requeſt, after many cauillations, was by the <hi>Venetians</hi> graunted. For they hauing made truce with the Turke, had no colour to deny them, and were aſhamed to break their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to the League. The Earles <hi>Carlo</hi> &amp; <hi>Deifebo,</hi> came with a good number of men at armes, &amp; ioyning to them all other the men of armes they could ſpare, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the army which ſerued vnder the Marques of <hi>Farrara,</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> went towards <hi>Piſa</hi> to encounter <hi>Roberto:</hi> who with his men was neare to the riuer of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio.</hi> And albeit he made ſhew to tarry for our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet did he not, but retired into <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigiana,</hi> to thoſe lodgings from whence he came, when he entred into the country of <hi>Piſa.</hi> After his departure, all thoſe towns were recouered by the Earle <hi>Carlo,</hi> which the enimies had before taken in the country of <hi>Piſa.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> deliuered of the enemy towards <hi>Piſa,</hi> cauſed all their forces to be brought betwixt <hi>Colle</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Gimiano.</hi> But by reaſon of the Earle <hi>Carlo</hi> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, there were in that camp both the folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Sforza</hi> &amp; <hi>Braccio</hi>: which was the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that (moued with old enuy) they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mutiny: &amp; was feared, that if they had bin long togither they would haue come to blows. It was therfore thought fit for eſchuing a worſe miſchief, to diuide the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, &amp; ſend one part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the country of <hi>Perugia,</hi> vnder the Earle <hi>Carlo:</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtay at <hi>Piggibonzi,</hi> there to entrench themſelues ſtrong, &amp; procure that the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhuld not enter the <hi>Florentines</hi> land. By this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they alſo hoped to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrain the enimies to diuide their forces: for they thought either that the Earle <hi>Carlo</hi> ſhuld ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize <hi>Perugia,</hi> where they ſuppoſed he had many partakers, or that the Pope ſhuld be inforced to ſend great forces to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it. They practiſed moreouer (to bring the pope in more neceſsity) that <hi>Nicolo Vitelli</hi> (being come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the city of <hi>Caſtello,</hi> where <hi>Lore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:14349:111"/>
Nicholo Vitelli</hi> alſo, although he entred into <hi>Castello,</hi> yet he and his were ſtrongeſt in the field, and without any reſiſtance, ſpoiled about the Citie at his pleaſure. Likewiſe the forces left at <hi>Poggibonzi,</hi> went euery day to the walles of <hi>Siena.</hi> Notwithſtanding all theſe hopes became vaine. Firſt died the Earle <hi>Carlo</hi> in the chiefe hope of his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: whoſe death had bettered the eſtate of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> if the victorie which grew thereof, had bene well vſed. For ſo ſoone as the Earles death was knowne, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly the Popes ſouldiers (who were altogither at <hi>Perugia</hi>) hoped to ouerthrow the <hi>Florentines:</hi> and comming forth into the field, lodged themſelues vpon the lage, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant three miles from the enemie. On the other ſide, <hi>Giacopo Guicciardini</hi> (who was Commiſſary of that camp) with the counſel of <hi>Roberto da Rimino</hi> (Chieftain after the death of the Earle <hi>Carlo</hi>) knowing the occaſion of the enemies pride, determined to ſtaie for them. So as, ioyning battle vppon that lage (where in old time <hi>Anniball</hi> gaue that memorable ouerthrow to the <hi>Romanes</hi>) the Popes forces were broken.<note place="margin">The Popes forces diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired by the Florentines.</note> Which victory was in <hi>Florence</hi> receiued with commendation of the captaines, &amp; comfort of all others. And the ſame had proued the honor &amp; profit of the enterpriſe, if the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which grew in the army at <hi>Poggibonzi</hi> had not vndone all. And thus the good ſucceſſe of the one camp was vtterly marred by the other. For the ſouldiers of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hauing gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a bootie in the country of <hi>Siena,</hi> in the diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, the Marques of <hi>Farrara</hi> &amp; <hi>Mantoua</hi> fell in debate. Inſomuch as they came to armes, either iniuring the other by all meanes they could. Whereby the <hi>Florentines</hi> finding they could no more imploy them togither, were pleaſed that the Marques of <hi>Farrara</hi> with his men ſhould be diſcharged. That army thus weakned &amp; left without a gouernor, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in euery thing diſorderly: the Duke of <hi>Calauria</hi> (who was with his camp near to <hi>Siena</hi>) tooke courage to approach, &amp; ſo did. The <hi>Florentins</hi> ſeeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues likely to be aſſailed, neither truſted to their force, nor their number, which was greater then the enemies, nor in their place where they were, being of great force: but without reſpect, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at ſight of the enemy, &amp; the duſt, fled; leauing the munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the cariages &amp; artillary. So beaſtly &amp; cowardly were thoſe camps, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the charge or retire of one horſe, might make the loſſe, or winning of an enterpriſe. This diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fit filled the kings ſouldiers with ſpoile, &amp; the <hi>Florentines</hi> with feare. For their citie was not onely affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with war, but alſo with peſtilence: which was ſo great, that all the Cittizens to ſhun death, were retired to their country houſes. This ouerthrow was the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, becauſe thoſe Cittizens who had land in the vales of <hi>Piſa</hi> &amp; <hi>Delſa,</hi> being come thither, (the ouerthrow performed) with all poſsible ſpeed returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with them not only their children &amp; goods, but alſo their labourers. For euerie houre it was feared, the enemy would preſent himſelf before the citie. The officers for the war, ſeeing this diſorder, commanded thoſe forces which were victorious in the country of <hi>Perugia,</hi> to ſurceaſe their enterpriſe againſt the <hi>Perugini,</hi> &amp; come to the vale of <hi>Delſa,</hi> to encounter the enemy there: who after the victory, did without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſpoile the country. And albeit they had ſo greatly diſtreſſed the citie of <hi>Perugia,</hi> as they might euerie houre looke for victorie, yet the <hi>Florentines</hi> reſolued rather to defend their own, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take from others. Thus that army remoued from the place of happy ſucceſſe, was brought to <hi>S. Caſsiano,</hi> a Caſtle diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Florence</hi> 8. miles: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they could not ſtaie in any other place, till ſuch time as the broken Camp were ſupplied. The enemies on the other ſide at <hi>Perugia</hi> being free by the departure of the <hi>Florentine</hi> ſouldiers, become audacious, did daily take great booties in the countries of <hi>Arezzo</hi> &amp; <hi>Cortona:</hi> and the others who had victory vnder <hi>Alfonſo</hi> Duke of <hi>Calau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> at <hi>Poggibonzi,</hi> got the poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt of <hi>Poggibonzi,</hi> &amp; then of <hi>Vico,</hi> &amp; ſacked <hi>Certal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> Hauing won theſe towns, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted theſe ſpoils, they incamped before the caſtle of <hi>Colle,</hi> which in thoſe daies was accounted a place of great ſtrength, and the people
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14349:111"/>
of that country, being faithfull to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> were of force ſufficient to hold the enemie off, till the armie was aſſembled. The <hi>Florentines</hi> then hauing gathered all their forces at <hi>S. Caſsiano,</hi> and the enemies furiouſly beſieging <hi>Colle,</hi> determined to draw neare vnto them, to encourage their friendes to defend themſelues: ſuppoſing alſo that the enimy wold offend with more reſpect, for hauing his aduerſary at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. This reſolution ſet downe, they remoued the Campe from <hi>S. Caſciano,</hi> and brought it to <hi>S. Giminiano,</hi> within fiue myles of <hi>Colle</hi>: from whence with light horſes and other ſuddeine meanes, they daily moleſted the Dukes Camp. Notwithſtanding, this ſupplie ſufficed not thoſe of <hi>Colle:</hi> for wanting neceſſarie prouiſion, on the thirteenth day of Nouember they yeelded, to the great griefe of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the ioy of the enemies: and chiefly of the <hi>Saneſi,</hi> who beſides their hate to the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> beare alſo priuate grudge to the <hi>Collegiani.</hi> By this time the winter was great, and the ſeaſon vnfit for warre, ſo that the Pope and King (either becauſe they would giue hope of peace, or that they deſired to enioy the paſſed victorie quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) offered to the <hi>Florentines</hi> truce for three moneths, and gaue them ten dayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to make anſwere: which was preſently accepted. But as a wounde when the bloud therein groweth colde, grieueth the bodie more, then when it was receiued, ſo this ſmall reſt, cauſed the <hi>Florentines</hi> to knowe the trauailes they had endured: and the Cittizens without reſpect accuſed one an other, of the errors committed in the laſt warre, for the charges in vaine ſpent, and the Impoſitions vniuſtly put vppon them. Which matters were not only ſpoken of among priuate men, but the ſame was alſo boldly propounded in the Councels. And one of them tooke courage, turning his face towards <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> ſayd vnto him. This Citie is wearied, and refuſeth to haue longer warre. It behoueth therefore that we deuiſe which way to make peace. Then <hi>Lorenzo</hi> knowing the neceſsitie, conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe friends whom he knew moſt faithfull and wiſe, and concluded (firſt perceiuing the <hi>Venetians</hi> coldneſſe and inconſtancie, the Dukes infancy and trouble of ciuill warres) that it was neceſſarie with new friends to ſeeke new fortune. Yet ſtood they doubtfull whether they were beſt truſt vnto the Pope, or the King. The matter being well examined, they preferred the Kings friendſhip as moſt ſtable and ſure. Becauſe the ſhortneſſe of the Popes liues, the chaunge of their ſucceſsion, the ſmall feare which the Church hath of Pinces, and the fewe reſpects which it vſeth in reſolution, are the cauſes why a ſeculer Prince cannot aſſuredly truſt vnto a Pope, nor ſafely paſſe one fortune with him. For whoſoeuer is friend vnto the Pope in warres and daungers, ſhall be by him accompanied in the victorie, but in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities left alone: becauſe the Pope is by ſpirituall power and reputation,<note place="margin">The Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines ſeeke the King Ferran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do his fauour.</note> ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and defended. This reſolution made, that to gaine the Kings friendſhip was beſt: they thought the ſame by no meane better procured, nor with more aſſurance, then by the preſence of <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> For the more liberallitie were vſed to him, the more they thought he would forget former diſpleaſures. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> determined vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this iourney, reaccommended the Citie and ſtate vnto <hi>Tomaſo Soderini,</hi> then <hi>Gonfaloniere di Giustitia,</hi> and in the beginning of December he departed from <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:</hi> and being arriued at <hi>Piſa,</hi> wrote vnto the <hi>Senate</hi> the occaſion of his departure; and the <hi>Senate</hi> to honor him, and that he might with more reputation conclude the peace with the King, made him Embaſſador for the people of <hi>Florence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lorenzo de Medici, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador for the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> with full authoritie to proceed, as by his diſcretion ſhould be thought good. In the meane time <hi>Roberto da San Seuerino,</hi> togither with <hi>Lodouico</hi> and <hi>Aſcanio</hi> (for their third brother <hi>Octaniano Sforza</hi> was dead) aſſaulted againe the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to winne the gouernment thereof. And hauing ſurprized <hi>Tortona, Milan</hi> alſo with the whole countrey was in armes. Then the Ducheſſe <hi>Bona</hi> was counſelled to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:14349:112"/>
admit the <hi>Sforzi</hi> into the State, and by that meane appeaſe the ciuill diſcention. The chief of thoſe Counſellors,<note place="margin">Antonio Taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino.</note> was <hi>Antonio Taſsino</hi> of <hi>Farrara:</hi> who being bacely born, came to <hi>Milan,</hi> and was by the Duke <hi>Gale<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>o</hi> and the Ducheſſe receiued to ſerue in their chamber. He either for the bewtie of his perſon, or for ſome other ſecret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, after the death of the Duke, aſpired to ſo great fauour with the Ducheſſe, as almoſt alone hee gouerned the ſtate: which greatly diſpleaſed <hi>Cecco,</hi> being a man both for learning and long experience excellent. So as he both to the Ducheſſe and others, laboured to decreaſe the credit of <hi>Taſsino.</hi> Wherof <hi>Taſsino</hi> being aware, to be reuenged, &amp; haue ayd at hand to defend him from <hi>Cecco,</hi> perſwaded the Ducheſſe to receiue home the <hi>Sforzi:</hi> which ſhe did without making <hi>Cecco</hi> priuie. But <hi>Cecco</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowing thereof, ſaide vnto her; Madame, you haue made a reſolution which will take my life from mee, and the ſtate from you: As ſhortly after came to paſſe. For <hi>Cecco</hi> was by the <hi>Lodouico</hi> put to death: and <hi>Taſsino,</hi> within a ſhort ſpace (being driuen out of the Duchie) the Ducheſſe tooke therat ſo great offence, that ſhe went from <hi>Milan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lodouico Sforza, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of the Duke of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</note> and renounced the gouernment of her ſonne vnto <hi>Lodouico.</hi> Thus <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douico</hi> become onely gouernour of <hi>Milan,</hi> was (as ſhall be declared) the occaſion of the ruine of <hi>Italy. Lorenzo de Medici</hi> was now on his way towardes <hi>Naples,</hi> and the peace betwixt the enemies in communication: when beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Lodouico Fregoſo</hi> hauing practiſed with ſome <hi>Serezanaeſi,</hi> by ſtealth entered with armed men into <hi>Serezana,</hi> taking poſſeſsion of that Towne, and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe that gouerned then for the <hi>Florentines.</hi> This accident greatly offended the princes of the <hi>Florentine</hi> ſtate, who thought the matter was brought to paſſe by direction of the king <hi>Ferrando.</hi> And complained to the Duke of <hi>Calauria</hi> (who was at the Campe before <hi>Siena</hi>) ſaying they were notwithſtanding the truce, aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with newe warre. He both by Letters, Embaſſages, and euerie other way, declared the ſame was done without the conſent of his father. The <hi>Florentines</hi> neuenheleſſe thought themſelues in hard eſtate, wanting money; the chiefe of their Common-weale in the Kings hand: A new warre mooued by the <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> and without friendes. For in the <hi>Venetians</hi> they truſted not: and feared leaſte the gouernement of <hi>Milan</hi> was vnaſſured. Their onely hope was vppon that which <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> was to conclude with the King. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> arriued at <hi>Naples</hi> by ſea,<note place="margin">Lorenzo de Medici, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Naples</note> was there both by the King and all that Cittie, honourablie and with great expectation receiued. Becauſe ſo great a warre being made onely to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe him, his enemies thereby did make him more great. For being come to the Kings preſence, hee debated with him the eſtate of <hi>Italy,</hi> the humors of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and people thereof, and what might be hoped of the peace, and feared by the warre. Which the King hearing, grew into more admiration, to finde in him ſo noble a minde, ſo readie a wit, and ſo great a iudgement, then that he could endure ſo long a warre. In ſo much as the King doubled the honours before done vnto him, and beganne to deuiſe rather how hee might winne him for a friend, then continue him an enemie. Notwithſtanding for diuerſe cauſes hee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined him from December till Marche, not onelie to make the more triall of him, but alſo of his Cittie. For <hi>Lorenzo</hi> wanted not enemies in <hi>Florence,</hi> who deſired that the King would haue holden him, and enterteined <hi>Giacopo Piccini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no:</hi> and vnder colour of lamenting, they ſpeake their mindes. Alſo in publique Councelles, they oppoſed their opinions againſt <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> By theſe deuiſes; It was bruted, that if the King woulde keepe <hi>Lorenzo</hi> long at <hi>Naples,</hi> the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in <hi>Florence</hi> ſhould be chaunged. Whiche was the onely cauſe that the King deferred his diſpatch ſo long, hoping there might ſome tumult ariſe in <hi>Florence.</hi> But ſeeing that all thinges paſſed quietly, on the ſixt day of March, in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14349:112"/>
the yeare 1479. he had leaue to depart, and before his departure was by the King ſo bountifully preſented, &amp; louingly vſed, that betwixt <hi>Lorenzo</hi> &amp; the King their grew a perpetual amity, &amp; preſeruation of both their ſtates. Thus <hi>Lorenzo</hi> returned to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> with greater reputation &amp; honor then he went thence, &amp; was with ſo great ioy of the citie receiued, as his great vertues &amp; new merits deſerued: hauing put his own life in hazard to recouer peace to his country. For within two daies after his arriuall,<note place="margin">Peace and league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King &amp; the Florentines.</note> the treaty betwixt the common weale of <hi>Florence</hi> &amp; the King was proclaimed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were both both bound to defend one the others country: &amp; that the townes taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Florentines</hi> in the war, ſhuld be by the King reſtored. And that the <hi>Paz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi</hi> impriſoned in the town of <hi>Volterra,</hi> ſhuld be deliuered. And that mony ſhould be for a certaine time paide vnto the Duke of <hi>Calauria.</hi> This peace being publiſhed, did much offend the Pope &amp; the <hi>Venetians,</hi> becauſe the Pope thought he was litle eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the King, &amp; the <hi>Venetians</hi> as litle regarded of the <hi>Florentines:</hi> who being their companions in the war, thought themſelues il vſed, not to be partakers of the peace. This indignation vnderſtood and beleeued at <hi>Florence,</hi> did ſodeinly breed ſuſpition in euerie man, that of the peace wold ariſe a greater war. Wherupon the Magiſtrates of the ſtate, determined to reſtraine the gouernment, and that the affaires of moſt importance ſhould be reduced into the hands of a leſſe number: and ſo ordeined a Councell of 70. Citizens, with authoritie that they might proceed in matters of moſt importance. This new ordinance ſtaied the minds of thoſe that deſired innouation, and to giue thereto countenance, firſt of all they accepted the peace, which <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had made with the King, and ſent vnto the Pope <hi>Antonio Ridolphi,</hi> and <hi>Piero Naſi.</hi> Neuertheles <hi>Alfonſo</hi> Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> did not remoue his army from <hi>Siena,</hi> ſaying he was ſtaied by the diſcord of the citizens there, which was ſo great, that he being lodged without the citie was called in and made iudge of their differents. The Duke taking theſe occaſions, puniſhed many of thoſe citizens in mony, impriſoning &amp; ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing others, and ſome alſo were iudged to death. In ſo much as by this meanes he became ſuſpected not only to the <hi>Saneſi,</hi> but the <hi>Florentines</hi> alſo miſtruſted he would make himſelf Prince of that citie. Wherof they knew no remedy, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the new friendſhip of <hi>Florence</hi> with the King, &amp; the enmitie of the Pope &amp; King. Which ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition, not only in the people of <hi>Florence</hi> generally (who miſtruſtfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of all things) but in the chief gouernors of the ſtate, appeared: euery man imagining, that our citie had neuer bin in ſo great danger to loſe the liberty therof. But God who had euer a particuler care therof, cauſed an accident to happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnlooked for, which made the King, the Pope, &amp; the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to think of greater matters the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe of <hi>Toſcana.</hi>

But notwithſtanding his forces were great, and his reſolution to win the town greater, yet was the vertue of thoſe that defended the ſame, greateſt of all.

the rather to ſhun thoſe perils, which made them to feare the loſſe of their libertie. Which opinion was encreaſed by the vnwilling departure, and lamentation of the Duke, at his going from <hi>Siena,</hi> accuſing fortune, that ſhe by an vnlooked for and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable accident, had taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the dominion of <hi>Toſcana.</hi> The ſelfſame chance did alter the Popes mind: for where before, he refuſed to giue audience to all <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> he was now become ſo curteous, as he refuſed not to hear any that wold ſpeak vnto him of the vniuerſal peace. Whereupon the <hi>Florentines</hi> were aduertiſed, that if they would deſire pardon of the Pope, they might obteine it. It was then thought good, not to omit this occaſion: and 12. Embaſſadors were ſent to the Pope, who being arriued at <hi>Rome,</hi> were by his holineſſe before they had audience, enterteined with diuers practiſes. In the end it was betweene the parties concluded, how either of them ſhould afterwards liue, &amp; in what ſort either of them both in peace and war, were to make contribution. After this concluſion, the Embaſſadors were admitted to preſent themſelues at the Popes feete: and he ſitting in the midſt of his Cardinals, with exceeding great pomp,<note place="margin">The ſpeech of the Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine Embaſſadors to the Pope.</note> receiued them. Theſe Embaſſadors excuſed all matters paſſed, ſometimes blaming neceſsitie, ſometimes the euil diſpoſition of others, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the populer furie, and the iuſt offence thereof, ſaying they were moſt vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, being forced either to fight, or die. And becauſe all things are endured to eſchue death, they had ſuffred war, excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; all other troubles, which the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters paſſed had brought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And all to the end, that their common weale might auoyd bondage, which is the death of all free Cities. Neuertheles if any error or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced fault were committed, they were ready to make ſatisfaction: euer hoping in his goodnes, (who following the examples of the almightie Redeemer) he would receiue them,<note place="margin">The Popes anſwere.</note> rather for his mercie, then their merits. To which excuſes, the Pope anſwered with great pride and anger; reprouing them of all things done againſt the church; notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for Gods ſake, he was pleaſed to grant them the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they deſired: yet therwith affirming they were to obey him, &amp; if they ſhal faile of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their libertie which now ſhould haue bin loſt, ſhall then be iuſtly taken from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For they deſerue libertie, who take in hand good actions, &amp; not they that in euil enterpriſes employ themſelues. Becauſe libertie abuſed, offendeth it ſelf and others. Alſo to eſteem God litle, &amp; the church leſſe, is not the office of good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but of vain perſons, enclined to euil. The correction of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apperteineth not onely to Princes, but to euery chriſtian: ſo as they were for matters paſſed to blame their own euil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which was the firſt occaſion of war, &amp; by their worſe doings it was noriſhed. But all anger was now extinguiſhed, rather by the goodnes of others, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own deſerts. After publication of the peace, the Popes bleſsing was read. Whereunto his holineſſe by word of mouth added, that if they would enioy the benifit of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, they ſhould during the Turks war in the kingdom, maintein at their charge 15. gallies wel paid. The Embaſſadors complained much of this burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impoſed ouer and aboue the contract. Yet by no meanes they could make, or by any lamentation they vſed, the Pope would diminiſh any part of that penance. But the Embaſſadors being returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> for confirmation of this peace, ſent Embaſſador to the Pope, <hi>Guidantonio Veſpucci,</hi> who was lately ariued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>France.</hi> He by his wiſdom brought all matters vnto reaſonable termes, &amp; obteined many fauours of the Pope, which was a token of greater reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The <hi>Florentines</hi> hauing ended their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines with the Pope, and <hi>Siena</hi> with themſelues being deliuered from feare of the King by the departure of the Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> and the Turkes warre continuing, conſtrained the King to reſtore all the Caſtles which the Duke of <hi>Calauria</hi> at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture left in the handes of the <hi>Saneſi.</hi> Wherby that King hoped, that the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> in ſo great neceſsitie would not ſhrincke from him, or by moouing of warre
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:14349:113"/>
againſt the <hi>Saneſi,</hi> impeach the aide which hee hoped of from the Pope and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Italian</hi> Princes. And therefore was content that the Caſtles ſhould bee reſtored, and bound the <hi>Florentines</hi> by a new obligation. So as thereby we ſee, that force and neceſsitie, but not writings or obligations, do make Princes to obſerue their faith. The Caſtles thus receiued, and the new confederacie made, <hi>Lorenzo di Medici</hi> recouered that reputation, which the warre firſt and after the peace (when the King was feared) had taken from him. For there wanted not thoſe that openly ſlaundered him, and ſaid, that for ſauing himſelfe, he had ſould his countrey, and that by the warre they loſt their townes, and by the peace they ſhould loſe their libertie. But the townes recouered an honorable peace made with the King, and the Cittie returned to the auncient reputation. For in <hi>Florence</hi> (a Cittie free of ſpeech, and therein matters iudged by their ſucceſſe, and not by counſell) the caſe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> commended to the skies, euerie man ſaying, that he with his wiſedome had found meanes to recouer that by peace, which euill fortune had taken from them in warre: and that his counſell and iudgement, had preuailed more then the enemies armes, or their money. The aſſault of the Turks had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that warre, which by offence of the Pope and <hi>Venetians</hi> would haue bene moued. But as the beginning of that aſſault was vnlooked for, and occaſion of much good, ſo was the end thereof vnlooked for, and the cauſe of much euill: for <hi>Mahumetto</hi> great Turke, beyond all expectation died, and diſcord growing betwixt his ſonnes, thoſe Turks that were in <hi>Puglia,</hi> being abandoned of their Lord, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition yeelded <hi>Ottranto</hi> to the King. This feare remoued, which held the Pope and <hi>Venetians</hi> firme, euery man doubted new tumults. On the one ſide, the Pope and the <hi>Venetians</hi> were in league, and with them the <hi>Genoueſi, Saneſi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">New leagues in Italy.</note> and other leſſe Potentates. On the other, were the <hi>Florentines,</hi> the King, and the Duke, with whome, the <hi>Bologneſi,</hi> and many other Lords ioyned. The <hi>Venetians</hi> deſired to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Lords of <hi>Farrara,</hi> ſuppoſing they had reaſonable occaſion to begin that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and certaine hope to performe it. The occaſion was, bicauſe the Marqueſſe affirmed, he was no longer bound to receiue the <hi>Viſdomine</hi> and their ſalte, bicauſe the contract was, that after ſeauentie yeares, the Cittie ſhould be disburthened of thoſe charges. The <hi>Venetians</hi> to the contrarie anſwered, that ſo long as he did hold the <hi>Poleſine,</hi> ſo long he ought to receiue the <hi>Viſdomine</hi> and the ſalte. But the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe not conſenting thereto, the <hi>Venetians</hi> thought they had iuſt occaſion to take armes, and time fit for the ſame, ſeeing the Pope much offended with the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the King, whoſe fauour they hoped the rather to haue, bicauſe the Earle <hi>Giro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamo</hi> being at <hi>Venice,</hi> was there receiued moſt honorablie: and the <hi>Venetians</hi> beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on him the title of a Gentleman of that ſtate, which is the greateſt token of honor, which they will, or can giue. They had alſo for preparation of the warres, impoſed a new Subſidie, and choſen <hi>Roberto de Sanſeuerino</hi> for their Generall: who being offended with <hi>Lodouico,</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Milan,</hi> was fled to <hi>Tortona,</hi> and there hauing made ſome tumults, went to <hi>Genoua</hi>; from thence he was called by the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> and made Chiefetaine of their armie. Theſe preparations and new motions being knowne to thoſe of the contrarie league, was the cauſe that they alſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the warre. The Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> made <hi>Federigo</hi> Lord of <hi>Vrbino,</hi> his Generall, and the <hi>Florentines Coſtanzo de Peſaro.</hi> Alſo, to ſound the diſpoſition of the Pope, and to diſcouer whether the <hi>Venetians</hi> with his conſent did make the warre againſt <hi>Farrara,</hi> the King <hi>Ferrando</hi> ſent <hi>Alfonſo</hi> Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> with his armie to the riuer of <hi>Tronto,</hi> and there deſired leaue of the Pope to paſſe into <hi>Lombardy</hi> to aide the Marqueſſe, which was by the Pope vtterly denied. Whereupon, the King, and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> being reſolued, thought to conſtraine him by force, ſo as thereby he
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:14349:114"/>
ſhould either become their friend, or at the leaſt, they would ſo trouble him, as he could not be able to aide the <hi>Venetians:</hi> for they were in the field, and had alreadie begun the warre with the Marqueſſe, ſpoyled his countreys, and beſieged <hi>Figarolo,</hi> a Caſtle of much importance, for the countrey of that Prince. Thus the King and the <hi>Florentines</hi> determined to aſſaile the Pope. <hi>Alfonſo</hi> Duke of <hi>Calauria</hi> ſpoiled the countrey towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and with aide of the <hi>Colonni,</hi> who were on his ſide (bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Orſini</hi> were ioyned with the Pope) did great dammage to that countrey on the other ſide of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> on the other ſide vnder <hi>Nicholo Vitelli,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the Cittie of <hi>Caſtello,</hi> ſurprized it, and draue out <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who kept that Caſtle for the Pope, and <hi>Nicholo</hi> remained a Prince thereof. By theſe actions, the Pope was greatlie diſtreſſed, bicauſe <hi>Rome</hi> within the Cittie was troubled with factions, and the countrey without ſpoiled by enemies. Notwithſtanding, as a man of courage, he would not giue place to the enemie, but enterteined <hi>Roberto da Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi> and calling him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where all his men of warre were aſſembled, told him, how great honor he might win, if he could againſt the force of a King, deliuer the Church from thoſe troubles wherewith it was occupied: and how great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſhould thereby haue not onely of him, but alſo of all other Popes his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and that both God and men would reacquite the ſame. <hi>Roberto</hi> firſt viewing the Popes men of armes, and other his preparations, perſwaded him to make all the footmen he was able, which with all ſpeed and diligence was performed. By this time the Duke of <hi>Calauria</hi> was neare vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſpoiled the countrey euen to the walls of the Cittie, which offended the people ſo much, as many of them vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily offered themſelues to ſerue with <hi>Roberto,</hi> and recouer the libertie of <hi>Rome</hi>: who were all by that Lord thanked and receiued. The Duke hearing of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, retired a little from the Cittie, thinking, that if he were further off, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto</hi> would not ſeeke him: and he alſo looked, that <hi>Federigo</hi> his brother, ſhould come with freſh men, ſent from the King their father. <hi>Roberto</hi> ſeeing himſelfe equall with the Duke for men of armes, and in footmen aboue him, marched out of <hi>Rome</hi> without order, and lodged his Camp within two miles of the enemie. The Duke ſeeing his enemies at hand, not looking for them, thought it ſtood him vpon, either to fight or flee. Wherefore as conſtrained, and for not doing a thing vnworthie the ſonne of a King, determined to fight, and turning his face to the enemy, either camp put their men in order, and brought them to battell, which continued from the morning till noone: and the ſame was performed with more vertue, then any had bene in <hi>Italy</hi> fiftie yeares before; for therein were ſlaine on both ſides more then a thouſand men,<note place="margin">The Duke of Calauria diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited by the Pope.</note> and the end was glorious to the Church. For the great multitude of the Popes footmen, ſo much offended the Dukes horſemen, as they were forced to turne their backs: and the Dukes perſon had bene taken priſoner, had he not bene ſaued by many Turks, who were left at <hi>Ottranto,</hi> and ſerued vnder him. <hi>Roberto</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this victorie, returned to <hi>Rome</hi> with triumph: which he enioyed not long, for that by drinking of much water at the day of battell, he fell into a flixe, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fewe dayes brought him to death. His bodie was by the Pope, with great honor buried. The Pope hauing this victorie, ſent the Earle preſently towards the Cittie of <hi>Caſtello,</hi> to ſee that towne reſtored vnto <hi>Lorenzo</hi>; and beſides to prooue, how the Cittie of <hi>Rimino</hi> was enclined. For after the death of <hi>Roberto,</hi> (who had onely one yong ſonne, and the Cittie left to the gouernment of his mother) the Pope imagined it was eaſie for him to ſurprize it. And in deed it would haue ſo come to paſſe, had not that woman bene by the <hi>Florentines</hi> defended, who tooke her part with ſuch forces, as the enemie could not worke his will, either againſt <hi>Caſtello,</hi> or <hi>Rimino.</hi> While theſe matters were a doing in <hi>Romagna</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſurprized
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14349:114"/>
               <hi>Figarolo,</hi> and with their men had paſſed the Riuer of <hi>Po,</hi> and in the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> his campe, and the Marqueſſe alſo, there was diſorder, bicauſe <hi>Federigo,</hi> Earle of <hi>Vrbino,</hi> being ſick, cauſed himſelfe to be carried to take phiſick at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and there died: whereby the affaires of the Marqueſſe proceeded ſlowlie, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> hoped dailie more and more to ſurprize <hi>Farrara.</hi> On the other ſide, the King and the <hi>Florentines</hi> laboured to make the Pope of their ſide, which not brought to paſſe by armes, they threatned by a Generall Councell to make him yeeld, which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, was by the Emperours commaundement, appointed at <hi>Baſelia:</hi> whereupon, by perſwaſion of the Emperours Embaſſador at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the chiefe Cardinals, who deſired peace, the Pope was perſwaded and conſtrained to allow of peace, and the vniting of <hi>Italy.</hi> Then the Pope for feare, and alſo for that he found the greatneſſe of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to be the ruine of the Church and all <hi>Italy,</hi> reſolued to come into the league, and ſent his <hi>Nuncii</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">New leagues in Italy.</note> where a league was concluded for fiue yeares, betwixt the Pope, the King, the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a place for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> if they were pleaſed to enter. This done, the Pope commaunded the <hi>Venetians</hi> to ſurceaſe the warre of <hi>Farrara,</hi> which they not onely refuſed to do, but alſo made the preparation greater: and hauing alreadie broken the Dukes and Marqueſſe forces at <hi>Argenta,</hi> they at <hi>Farrara</hi> were ſo neare diſtreſſed, as the Dukes forces were lodged in the Marqueſſe Park. Then the League thought good no longer to deferre the aiding of that Prince, and cauſed the Duke of <hi>Calauria</hi> with his and the Popes men to goe to <hi>Farrara.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> likewiſe ſent all their forces thither, and for the better ordering of the warre, the League appointed a Councell to be holden at <hi>Cremona,</hi> where the Popes Legat, the Earle <hi>Girolamo,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lodouico, Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> with many other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> met. In this Councell, the Princes deuiſed the order of the future warre. And bicauſe they iudged that <hi>Farrara</hi> could not be better relieued any way, then by ſome braue aſſault, they ordered that <hi>Lodouico</hi> ſhould begin a warre vpon the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> for the countreys belonging to the Duke of <hi>Milan.</hi> But thereunto that Lord would not conſent, fearing to begin a warre which he could not end at his pleaſure. Wherefore it was determined they ſhould go with all their footmen to <hi>Farrara,</hi> and with foure thouſand men of armes, and eight thouſand footmen, aſſault the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> who had two thouſand and two hundred men of armes, and ſixe thouſand footmen. And the League thought good firſt to aſſaile the nauie which the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> had lying vpon the riuer of <hi>Po,</hi> and the ſame being aſſaulted, was broken at <hi>Bondeno,</hi> with the loſſe of two hundred veſſels, and <hi>Antonio Iuſtiniano,</hi> the Prouedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the nauie was taken. Then the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſeeing all <hi>Italy</hi> vnited againſt them, to win ſome reputation, enterteined the Duke of the <hi>Rhene</hi> with two thouſand men of armes. But hauing receiued this ouerthrow of their nauie, they ſent this Duke with part of their armie to frunt the enemie, and commaunded <hi>Roberto de Sanſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino,</hi> with the reſt of their camp, to paſſe the riuer of <hi>Adda,</hi> and approching to <hi>Milan,</hi> to proclaime the name of the Duke, and of the Ladie <hi>Bona</hi> his mother: for by that meanes, they hoped to make ſome Innouation in the Cittie, ſuppoſing that the Lord <hi>Lodouico</hi> and his gouernment was hated. This aſſault at the beginning brought therewith ſome terror, and moued all the Cittie to take armes: but in the end, it wrought an effect contrarie to the <hi>Venetians</hi> expectation. Bicauſe <hi>Lodouico</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this iniurie, was content to allow of that which before he would not. And therefore, leauing the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara</hi> to the defence of his owne countrey, he with foure thouſand horſe, and two thouſand footmen, and the Duke of <hi>Calauria</hi> with twelue thouſand horſe, and fiue thouſand footmen, entred the countrey of <hi>Pergamo, Breſcia,</hi> and <hi>Verona,</hi> ſpoiling almoſt all the countrey belonging to thoſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14349:115"/>
three Citties, before the <hi>Venetians</hi> knew thereof, for the Lord <hi>Roberto</hi> with his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, could ſcarcely defend that Cittie. On the other ſide, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara</hi> had recouered a great part of his poſſeſsions, by meane whereof, the Duke of the <hi>Rhene</hi> who came againſt him, was not able to make head, hauing onely two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe, and one thouſand footemen. Thus all that ſummer, in the yeare 1483. the League proceeded in their warres moſt proſperouſlie. The next Spring being come (for in all the winter was nothing done) the armies were againe brought to the field, and the League, (to the end it might the more ſpeedily oppreſſe the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>) had ioined all the whole army togither: but if they had proceeded as they did the yeare before, they ſhould aſſuredly haue taken from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> all the lands in <hi>Lombardy</hi> to them belonging: for they had not left vnto them, more then ſixe thouſand horſe, and fiue thouſand footmen. And on the other ſide, were twelue thouſand horſe, and ſixe thouſand footmen. Alſo the Duke of the <hi>Rhene</hi> hauing ended the yeare of his enterteinement, was returned home. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as it often happeneth) where diuerſe Gouernours be of equall authoritie, there groweth diuiſion, and the enemie winneth victorie, ſo <hi>Federigo Gonzaga,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> being dead (who with his authoritie continued the Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lodouico</hi> vnited) betwixt them grew diuerſitie of opinions, and ielouſie. For <hi>Giouangaliazzo</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> being atteined to age, and abilitie to gouerne his owne ſtate, and hauing alſo married the daughter of the Duke of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauria,</hi> the Duke deſired, that his ſonne in lawe, and not <hi>Lodouico,</hi> might gouerne the ſtate. This ſuſpition of <hi>Lodouico</hi> being knowne to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> was made by them an occaſion, ſuppoſing they might as they had euer done, recouer by peace, that which they had loſt by warre: and ſecretly they practiſed a pacification betwixt them and <hi>Lodouico,</hi> which was concluded in Auguſt, the yeare 1484. That being knowne to the other confederates, diſpleaſed them much, chiefely when they knew, that all the townes taken from the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould be reſtored, and they ſtill to inioy alſo <hi>Rouigo,</hi> and <hi>Policene,</hi> which townes they had taken from the Marqueſſe of <hi>Farrara.</hi> And moreouer, that they ſhould haue againe all thoſe prerogatiues which in times paſſed they had. Euerie man then thought, they had made a warre with great charge, and as therein they had gained ſmall honor, ſo in the end it was compounded with ſhame: bicauſe the townes taken, were reſtored, and the townes loſt, were not recouered. Yet were the confederates forced to accept the peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearie of charges, and fearing the ambition and defects of others, would make no more triall of their fortune.

In this ſiege, thoſe that within the towne were partarkers with <hi>Nicholo,</hi> came forth to fight with the enemies, and did vanquiſh them; whereupon, the Pope reuoked the Earle <hi>Girolamo</hi> from <hi>Lombardy,</hi> to repaire his force at <hi>Rome:</hi> that done, to returne to his enterpriſe. But afterwards, thinking it better to gaine the good will of <hi>Nicholo</hi> by peace, then to aſſaile him with a new warre, grew to agreement with him, and by all meanes reconciled him to <hi>Lorenzo</hi> his aduerſarie: whereupon, he was allured rather by ſuſpition of new tumults, then by the loue he bare his countrey. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Colonneſi</hi> and <hi>Orſini,</hi> there appeared much diſpleaſure: bicauſe the King of <hi>Naples</hi> in the warre betwixt him and the Pope, had taken from <hi>Orſini</hi> the Earledome of <hi>Tagliacozzo,</hi> and giuen it to the <hi>Colonneſi</hi> his followers.

the Pope, would agree thereunto, but ſtill with iniuries, and ſpoiling of the <hi>Orſini,</hi> did diſpleaſure them, which the Pope could not indure: and therefore aſſembled all his forces, and ioyning with them the <hi>Orſini,</hi> ſacked all the houſes of the <hi>Colonni</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſlaying and taking all thoſe that made reſiſtance,<note place="margin">The Co<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

Likewiſe, the <hi>Venetian</hi> nauie had aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Kingdome, ſurprized <hi>Galipoli,</hi> and moleſted other places thereabouts. But the peace of <hi>Lombardy</hi> concluded, all tumults did ceaſe, ſaue onely in <hi>Toſcana</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> for the Pope within fiue daies after the peace was proclaimed, died: either bicauſe the end of his life was come, or for ſorrow that a peace was made to his diſaduantage. This Pope at his death left <hi>Italy</hi> in peace, though during his life he had alwaies therein made warre: and the <hi>Romanes</hi> preſentlie after his departure tooke armes. The Earle <hi>Girolamo</hi> with his ſouldiers retired vnder the Caſtle, and the <hi>Orſini</hi> did feare, leaſt the <hi>Colonneſi</hi> would be reuenged of the freſh iniuries done them.

The <hi>Florentines</hi> hauing their artillerie in the plaine, made a bulwarke vpon the mountaine, hoping from thence to batter it. <hi>Giacopo Guicciardino</hi> was Commiſſarie of the <hi>Florentine</hi> forces.

In ſo much as they retired foure miles from the towne, and the officers of the Camp
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14349:116"/>
thought good, that the moneth of October being come, it was time to lodge the army, and deferre that ſiege till the next Spring. This diſorder being knowne in <hi>Florence,</hi> made the Magiſtrates much offended, and therefore to repaire the Camp in force and reputation, made choiſe of new Commiſſaries, <hi>Antonio Pucci,</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo del Nero,</hi> who with great ſummes of money went vnto the Camp, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Captaines the indignation of the <hi>Senate</hi> and the people, and how great a ſhame it ſhould be, vnleſſe the army did againe returne to the ſiege: for it were an infamie, ſo great a Camp, to be repulſed by ſo ſmall a guard, and ſo weake a towne. They alſo ſhewed the preſent and future commoditie that would inſue of that victorie. Which perſwaſion, moued the ſouldiers to returne to the walls, and firſt of all to recouer the Bulwarke. For the performance whereof, they knowing how much curteſie, affabilitie, and good vſage might do to incourage the minds of men, <hi>Antonio Pucci,</hi> by comforting, promiſing, and imbracing the ſouldiers, procured the Bulwarke to be aſſaulted ſo furiouſly, as euen in a ſodeine it was taken,<note place="margin">Pietraſanta taken.</note> yet not without loſſe: for in that aſſault, the Earle <hi>Antonio de Marciano</hi> with a peece of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, was ſlaine. This victorie terrified thoſe of the towne ſo much, as they began to offer compoſition: whereupon, to the end the concluſion might be made with the more reputation, <hi>Lorenzo di Medici</hi> thought good to come to the Camp, and within a few daies after his arriuall, the Caſtle was yeelded. The winter now come, the Captaines liked not to proceed further in the warre, but attend the Spring: and the rather, bicauſe the Autumne paſt, by meanes of euill aires, ſicknes was brought into the Camp, wherewith many of the Captaines and leaders were diſeaſed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whome, <hi>Antonio Pucci,</hi> and <hi>Bongianni Gianfigliazzi,</hi> were not onely ſick, but alſo dead, to the great griefe of all the army: ſo great was the honor and loue that <hi>Pucci</hi> had wonne in the exploite of <hi>Pietraſanta.</hi> After the taking of <hi>Pietraſanta,</hi> the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Florence,</hi> to demaund that towne, as a thing belonging to their common-weale. For they alleaged, that among other things it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted betwixt them, that the towne firſt wonne by any of them, ſhould be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the auncient owner. The <hi>Florentines</hi> directlie denied not that couenant, but anſwered, that they doubted whether in the peace made betwixt them and the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noueſi,</hi> it was meant the towne to be deliuered, and therefore they could not till then determine: and if it were reſtored, then the <hi>Luccheſi</hi> ought of neceſsitie to pay the charge, and make ſatisfaction, for the loſſe of ſo many great Citizens: which if they would do, they might hope to haue it againe. All that winter was ſpent, in the communication of this peace betwixt the <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines.</hi> And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Pope was a doer therein, the matter was handled at <hi>Rome:</hi> but not being concluded, the <hi>Florentines</hi> would the next Spring haue aſſaulted <hi>Serezana,</hi> had they not bene by the ſickneſſe of <hi>Lorenzo di Medici,</hi> and the warre which grew betwixt the Pope, and the King <hi>Ferrando,</hi> impeached. For <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was not onely diſeaſed of the gowt, which infirmitie, ſeemed to diſcend from his father, but was alſo ſo grieuouſlie tormented with griefe of the ſtomack, that he went vnto the Bathes to be cured: but the warre was the chiefe occaſion of his ſickneſſe, and the originall thereof. The Citie of <hi>Aquila</hi> was ſubiect to the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> yet the people therein liued as free. In this Citie, the Earle <hi>Montorio</hi> had great reputation.<note place="margin">Aquila rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the K. of Naples.</note> The Duke of <hi>Calauria</hi> with his men of armes being neare vnto <hi>Tronto,</hi> pretending to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie certaine tumults among the people of that countrey, and intending to reduce <hi>Aquila</hi> wholie vnder the Kings obedience, ſent for the Earle <hi>Montorio,</hi> as though he would imploy him in thoſe matters he made ſhew of. The Earle without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came, and was preſently by the Duke ſent to <hi>Naples</hi> priſoner. Theſe newes being aduertiſed to <hi>Aquila,</hi> altered the minde of the Cittie, and the people po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulerly

tooke armes, and ſlewe <hi>Antonio Concinello,</hi> Commiſſarie for the King, and with him certaine other Citizens, who were knowne affectionate to the King. Alſo, to the end the <hi>Aquilani,</hi> might haue ſome friend to defend them in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, they diſplaied the Enſigne of the Church, and ſent Embaſſadors to giue the Cittie to the Pope: deſiring him, as his owne ſubiects, to defend them from the tyrannie of the King.<note place="margin">The Pope defendeth the rebels of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila.</note> The Pope manfully tooke in hand their defence, as one that both for priuate and publique occaſion hated the King. And <hi>Roberto da Sanſeuerino,</hi> enemy to the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> hapning to be out of pay, the Pope enterteined him for Generall, and cauſed him with great expedition to come vnto <hi>Rome:</hi> and beſides that, ſollicited all the friends and kinſmen of the Earle <hi>Montorio,</hi> to become Rebels to the King; in ſo much as the Princes of <hi>Altemura, Salerno,</hi> &amp; <hi>Biſignano,</hi> tooke armes againſt him. The King ſeeing himſelfe by ſo ſodeine a warre aſſaulted, prayed aide of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Milan.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> ſtood doubtfull what to do, bicauſe it ſeemed hard to leaue their owne enterpriſe for others: and to take armes againſt the Church, was perilous. Notwithſtanding, being in league, they preferred fidelitie, before commoditie or perill, and enterteined the <hi>Orſini,</hi> and ſent all their owne men towards <hi>Rome</hi> to the aide of the King, vnder conduct of the Earle of <hi>Pitigliano.</hi> Then the King made two camps, and ſent the one towards <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder the Duke of <hi>Calauria,</hi> who with the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſhould incounter the Popes army. The other camp himſelfe did leade, and marched toward the Barons that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled. This warre with variable fortune was mannaged, and at the end, the King in all places hauing aduantage,<note place="margin">Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the K. of Naples, and the Pope. 1486.</note> by mediation of the Embaſſadors of <hi>Spayne,</hi> a peace was concluded in the moneth of Auguſt 1486. whereunto the Pope (being beaten with euill fortune, and loth to aduenture more) conſented. Alſo, all the Potentates of <hi>Italy</hi> were included (onely the <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> as rebels to the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the <hi>Florentines</hi> lands) were left out. <hi>Roberto da Sanſeuerino,</hi> the peace made, hauing bene in this warre no faithfull friend to the Pope, and nothing terrible to the enemy, departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> as driuen out by the Pope: and being followed by the Dukes and <hi>Florentines</hi> ſouldiers, ſo ſoone as he had paſſed <hi>Ceſena,</hi> ſeeing himſelfe not followed, fled away, and with leſſe then one hundred horſe, came to <hi>Rauenna.</hi> Of the reſt of his men, ſome were receiued by the Duke, and ſome by the countrey people, were cut in pieces. The King hauing made peace, and reconciled his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, put to death <hi>Giouanni Coppola,</hi> and <hi>Antonello de Anuerſa,</hi> with his ſonnes, and thoſe which had in the warre reuealed his ſecrets vnto the Pope. By meanes of this warre, the Pope knew what readineſſe and care the <hi>Florentines</hi> had to keepe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and therefore, albeit that for the loue of the <hi>Genoueſi,</hi> and the aiding of the King, he before hated them, yet now he began to loue them, and ſhew more fauour vnto their Embaſſadors then he was wont. Which diſpoſition knowne to <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> was by all honorable meanes increaſed: for he thought it much for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, if to the fauour which the King bare him, he might alſo ioyne the Popes friendſhip. This Pope had one ſonne called <hi>Franceſco,</hi> and being deſirous to honor him with lands and friends, wherewith he might after his death, mainteine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he knewe not any in <hi>Italy</hi> with whome he could more ſafely be matched, then with <hi>Lorenzo:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lorenzo di Medici his daughter, married vnto the Popes ſonne.</note> and therefore ſo handled the matter, that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> married a daughter of his vnto <hi>Franceſco.</hi> This marriage being made, the Pope deſired that the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> might by compoſition deliuer <hi>Serezana</hi> to the <hi>Florentines:</hi> perſwading them, that they ſhould not hold that which <hi>Agoſtino</hi> had ſold, nor <hi>Agoſtino</hi> could giue vnto <hi>S.

But the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> while theſe matters were practiſing at <hi>Rome,</hi> armed certaine of their Ships, and before the <hi>Florentines</hi> knew any thing thereof, ſet three thouſand

This new aſſault was vnlooked for of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> neuertheleſſe preſently they aſſaulted their forces at <hi>Piſa,</hi> vnder <hi>Virginio Orſino.</hi> They alſo complained vnto the Pope, that whileſt he practiſed the peace, the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> had begunne this warre. They ſent like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Piero Corcini</hi> to <hi>Lucca,</hi> to continue the amitie with that Citie: and <hi>Pagolantonio Soderini,</hi> was ſent vnto <hi>Venice,</hi> to feele the diſpoſition of that ſtate. They praied aide alſo of the King, and of the Lord <hi>Lodouico Sforza:</hi> but failed thereof at both their handes. For the King ſaide hee feared the Turkes Nauie, and <hi>Lodouico</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other cauillations deferred to ſend anie. Thus the <hi>Florentines</hi> (being for the moſt part left alone in their warres) did not finde anie ſo readie to helpe them, as they were readie to aide others. Neither were they diſmaied being now abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their confederates (which was no new thing) but aſſembling a great armie vnder <hi>Giacopo Guicciardini,</hi> and <hi>Piero Vittori,</hi> ſent them againſt the enemie, who lodged one night vppon the Riuer <hi>Magra.</hi> In the meane time, <hi>Serezanello</hi> was ſtraightly diſtreſſed by the enemie, who by vndermining and euerie other meanes, beſieged it. In ſo much as our Commiſſaries marched towardes the reliefe thereof. Yet the enemie refuſed not to fight, but ioyning battle with the Commiſſaries, the <hi>Genoueſi</hi> were ouerthrowne: and <hi>Lodouico Fieſco,</hi> with many other Captaines of the enemies were taken priſoners. This victory diſcouraged not ſo much the <hi>Serezaneſi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Genoueſi diſcomfited.</note> that they would therefore yeeld, but with more obſtinacie they prepared for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: and the <hi>Florentine</hi> Commiſſaries ſtill continued to offend them. In ſo much as that towne was both manfully aſſaulted, and ſtoutly defended. This ſiege continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long, cauſed <hi>Lorenzo di Medici</hi> to go himſelfe into the field. He being come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, greatly encouraged our ſouldiers, and diſcouraged the <hi>Serezaneſi.</hi> For they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſolution of the <hi>Florentines</hi> to diſtreſſe them, and the coldneſſe of the <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſi</hi> to relieue them, freely, and without conditions, yeelded themſelues to the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> hands. And were all receiued to mercie, excepting a fewe who had bin the authors of the rebellion. <hi>Lodouico</hi> during this ſiege, had ſent his men of armes to <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremoli,</hi> ſeeming to haue aided vs. But hauing intelligence with ſome in <hi>Genoua,</hi> that faction tooke armes againſt thoſe that gouerned, and with the aide of theſe forces, deliuered that Cittie to the Duke of <hi>Milan.</hi> At that time the <hi>Almanes</hi> had mooued a war againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Boccolino de Oſimo</hi> in <hi>La Marca,</hi> cauſed the towne of <hi>Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> to rebell againſt the Pope, and made himſelfe Prince thereof. He, after many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, at the perſwaſion of <hi>Lorenzo di Medici,</hi> was contented to deliuer that Citie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto the Pope, and went himſelfe to <hi>Florence,</hi> where vnder the protection of <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> he liued long in great honour. After he went from thence to <hi>Milan,</hi> where not finding the like fidelitie, was by <hi>Lodouico</hi> put to death.<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans broken, and their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſlaine.</note> The <hi>Venetians</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by the <hi>Almanes,</hi> were neare vnto the Citie of <hi>Trento</hi> broken, and <hi>Roberto da Sanſeuerino</hi> their Generall, ſlaine. After which loſſe, the <hi>Venetians</hi> (according to the order of their fortune) made peace with the <hi>Almanes,</hi> not as victored, but as victorious) ſo honourable was the concluſion for their ſtate.<note place="margin">Tumults in Romagna.</note> In thoſe dayes alſo there happened in <hi>Romagna,</hi> tumults of great importance. <hi>Franceſco de Orſo</hi> of <hi>Furli,</hi> was a man of great authoritie in that Citie. He being ſuſpected to the Earle <hi>Girolamo,</hi> was many times by the Earle threatned. Whereupon <hi>Franceſco</hi> liuing in great feare, was perſwaded by his friends and kinſmen, to preuent the miſchief. And ſith he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſlaine by the Earle, was aduiſed to ſley him firſt: and ſo by the death of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſcape his owne daunger.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14349:118"/>
comming then thither, he thought to haue their aide without ſending for them. This conſpiracie hapned in the moneth of May, in which time (and all the ſommer) the <hi>Italians</hi> do vſe to ſup by day-light. The conſpirators thought the fitteſt inſtant to commit this murther, ſhould be immediatly after ſupper, when all his familie were at meate, and he left almoſt alone in his chamber. Thus determined, and that houre appointed, <hi>Franceſco</hi> went vnto the Earles houſe, and leauing his companions in the Hall, himſelfe went vp to the Chamber, where the Earle was, and ſaid to one of his men,<note place="margin">The Earle Girolamo murdered.</note> that he deſired to ſpeake with the Earle. <hi>Franceſco</hi> being called in, enterteined the Earle awhile with ſome feined ſpeech, and ſo ſodeinly ſlew him. Then he called vnto him his companions, and ſlew alſo the Earles man. By chance the Captaine of the towne alſo came in the meane time to ſpeake with the Earle, and being arriued in the Hall, followed with a fewe, was likewiſe ſlaine by thoſe that came to murther the Earle. Theſe murthers executed, the Earles bodie was caſt out of the window: and the murtherers proclayming the Church and libertie, cauſed all the people to arme, who hated greatly the couetiſe and crueltie of the Earle. The conſpirators hauing ſacked the Earles houſes, tooke the Counteſſe <hi>Caterina</hi> his wife, with all her children. Then remained onely the Caſtle (which being ſurprized) ſhould happilie finiſh the enterpriſe. But thereunto the Captaine would not conſent: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, this Counteſſe promiſed to deliuer it, if ſhe were let looſe to goe into the Caſtle, and for hoſtages of her promiſe, ſhe left with the enemyes her children. The conſpirators belieued her words, and gaue her leaue to depart. But ſo ſoone as ſhe was within the Caſtle, ſhe looked ouer the walls, and threatned the enemyes to be reuenged of her husbands death. Then they threatning to ſley all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, anſwered, that ſhe had meane to beget others. The conſpirators diſmaied, ſeeing they were not aided by the Pope, and hearing that the Lord <hi>Lodouico,</hi> Vnkle to the Counteſſe, did ſend men in her aide, taking vp all the goods they could carrie awaie, went vnto the Cittie of <hi>Caſtello,</hi> whereby the Counteſſe recouered her ſtate, and reuenged her husbands death by all manner of cruelties.<note place="margin">The Earles wife reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> The <hi>Florentines</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Earles death, tooke occaſion to repoſſeſſe the fortreſſe of <hi>Piancal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doli,</hi> which the Earle had before taken from them: for ſending thither their forces, they ſurprized it, and ſlew therein <hi>Ciecco,</hi> the famous Architetture. To this tumult of <hi>Romagna,</hi> followed one other of no leſſe moment. <hi>Galeotto</hi> Lord of <hi>Faenza,</hi> tooke to wife the daughter of <hi>Giouan Bentiuogli,</hi> Prince of <hi>Bologna.</hi> She either for ielouſie, or bicauſe her husband vſed her not well, either elſe through her owne euil nature, hated him ſo much, as ſhe determined to take from him his principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and life. Then diſſembling a ſickneſſe, laid her ſelfe in bed, and when <hi>Galeotto</hi> ſhould come to viſit her, ſhe determined he ſhould be by certaine men hidden in the Chamber, ſlaine. Of this intent, ſhe had made her father priuie, who hoped by the death of his ſonne in lawe, to become Lord of <hi>Faenza.</hi> The time deſtined for this murther being come, <hi>Galeotto</hi> repaired to his wiues Chamber, as he was woont, and hauing a little talked with her, the murtherers came foorth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie mercie,<note place="margin">Galeotto, Lord of Faen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za murdered.</note> there preſentlie ſlew him. So ſoone as the murther was knowne, great tumults aroſe. His wife, with one little ſonne, called <hi>Astore,</hi> fled to the Caſtle. The people tooke armes, and <hi>Giouan Bentiuogli,</hi> togither with a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Milan,</hi> called <hi>Bergamino,</hi> prepared for the purpoſe, with many armed men entred into <hi>Faenza,</hi> where was alſo <hi>Antonio Baſcoli,</hi> a Florentine Commiſſarie. All theſe leaders aſſembled, and reaſoning of the gouernment of that towne. The men of the Vale of <hi>Lamona</hi> (who were come populerly to the rumor) aſſaulted <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanni,</hi> and <hi>Bergamino,</hi> ſleying the one, and taking the other priſoner. Then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed the name of <hi>Aſtore,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> reacommending the Cittie to the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14349:118"/>
               <hi>Florentine</hi> Commiſaries. This chance knowne at <hi>Florence,</hi> grieued euery man much: notwithſtanding they cauſed <hi>Giouanni</hi> and his daughter to be ſet at libertie, and the tuition of <hi>Astore,</hi> by conſent of the people was giuen vnto them. Beſides theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe other tumults happened in <hi>Romagna, la Marca,</hi> and <hi>Siena:</hi> after the warres were compounded betwixt the greater Princes; which being of leſſe importance, I iudge ſuperfluous to report. True it is, that the troubles of <hi>Siena</hi> (after the departure of the Duke of <hi>Calauria</hi> in the yeare 88.) were more in number: and after many alterations, ſometimes the people gouerned, and ſometimes the nobilitie, but in the end, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie was victorious. Among whom, <hi>Pandolfo</hi> and <hi>Giacopo Petruccio,</hi> were of moſt authoritie. The one for his wiſedom, the other for courage, became as Lords of that Citie. But the <hi>Florentines</hi> after the warre of <hi>Serezana,</hi> till the yeare 1492. (at which time <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> died) did liue in great felicitie.<note place="margin">Lorenzo de Medici.</note> For <hi>Lorenzo</hi> hauing by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome appeaſed the armes of <hi>Italy,</hi> endeuoured to make himſelfe and his Citie great; and married his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Piero</hi> to <hi>Alfonſina,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Cauallier Orſino:</hi> and <hi>Giouanni</hi> his ſecond ſonne, was aduanced to the dignitie of Cardinall. Which honor was the more notable, becauſe at the time of his calling to that honour, he paſſed not the age of foureteene yeares: which was the way to make his houſe (as after it came to paſſe) to be exalted to the skies. For <hi>Giuliano</hi> his third ſonne, by reaſon of his yong age, and the ſmall time <hi>Lorenzo</hi> liued, he could not prouide anie extraordinarie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Of his daughters he married one to <hi>Giacopo Saluiati,</hi> an other to <hi>Franceſco Cibo</hi>; the third, to <hi>Piero Ridolfi</hi>: the fourth (whom he beſtowed to hold his houſe vnited) was wedded to <hi>Giouan di Medici,</hi> but ſhe died. In his other priuate affaires, and chiefly in marchandize he was verie infortunate.<note place="margin">Lorenzo in marchandize infortunato.</note> For by the diſorder of his miniſters (who liued liker Princes, then priuate men) a great part of his ſubſtance in ſundrie places was conſumed: enforced thereby to borrow great ſummes of his countrey. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, not to runne in daunger of like fortune, leauing marchandize, he employed himſelfe in the purchaſe of lands: as riches of more aſſurance. In the countries of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, Prato,</hi> and in the vale of <hi>Peſa,</hi> he compaſſed poſſeſsions both for profit and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of houſes, more fit for a King then a priuate perſon. After that time, he enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and bewtified his owne Cittie, to the end he might liue therein with the more quiet, and ſecuritie. And therefore in many voide places hee built newe houſes and ſtreetes: whereby the Citie became more bewtifull and large. Alſo to the end hee might reſt the more aſſured at home, and encounter his enemies farre of: towards <hi>Bologna</hi> in the midſts of the Alpes, he fortified the Caſtle of <hi>Firenzuola.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>zo mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent.</note> Towards <hi>Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> he began to reedifie <hi>Poggio Imperiale,</hi> and make it exceeding ſtrong. Towardes <hi>Genoua</hi> by winning of <hi>Pietraſanta</hi> and <hi>Serezana,</hi> hee ſhut that paſſage vp againſt the enemies. Moreouer, by giuing pentions, and prouiſions, he made friends, the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioni</hi> in <hi>Perugia,</hi> the <hi>Vitelli</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Castello,</hi> and in <hi>Faenza,</hi> he had particuler gouernment. All which things were as Bulwarkes to defend <hi>Florence.</hi> In times of peace, he feaſted the Citie, making many times triumphs, Iuſts, and publike ſhewes. For his intent was to keepe the Citie plentifull, the people vnited, and the nobilitie in honour. He greatly eſteemed men that excelled in any Art. He alſo fauoured lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, as <hi>Agnolo da Montepulciano, Christofero Landini,</hi> and <hi>Demetrio Greco,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lorenzo a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> can beare witneſſe. Inſomuch as the Earle <hi>Giouanni de Mirandola</hi> (a man accounted almoſt diuine) forſaking all other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> which hee had traueiled, moued by the magnificence of <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> ſetled his habitation in <hi>Florence.</hi> He maruellouſly delighted in Muſick, <hi>Architecture</hi> and Poetry, as many of his owne verſes, and Commentaries yet extant do teſtifie. Alſo to the end that the <hi>Florentine</hi> youth might be exerciſed in learning, he erected an Vniuerſitie in <hi>Piſa,</hi> whither he brought the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men of all <hi>Italy.</hi> He likewiſe builded a Monaſtery neare vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> chiefly for
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14349:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Friar <hi>Mariano da Chinazano,</hi> of the order of <hi>S. Austen,</hi> being accounted an excellent Preacher.<note place="margin">Lorenzo vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> He was greatly loued both of God and fortune. All his enterpriſes had good ſucceſſe, and his enemies miſaduenture: for beſides the <hi>Pazzi, Battista Freſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldi,</hi> and <hi>Baldinotto</hi> practized to ſley him: but either of them with others guiltie of the treaſon, were rewarded with the paines of their merit. This his manner of life, this his wiſedome and fortune, cauſed the Princes not onely of <hi>Italy,</hi> but others fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of to know him: and with admiration to eſteeme him. <hi>Mathia</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> made many teſtimonies of the loue he bare him. The <hi>Soldan</hi> by his Embaſſadors and preſents, did viſit him. The great Turke deliuered to his hand <hi>Barnardo Bandini,</hi> that murthered his brother.<note place="margin">Lorenzo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored of prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces.</note> Which things made him highly honoured in <hi>Italy.</hi> And that reputation was daily by his owne wiſedome encreaſed. For in diſcourſe, he was eloquent, in councell wiſe, in execution quicke and couragious: neither was there in him any vices to blemiſh thoſe vertues, although he were greatly delighted with loue of women, and tooke pleaſure in ieſting and taunting: and would alſo plaie at childrens games, vnſeemly in ſo great a perſonage. For ſo much he pleaſured in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that he was often ſeene to plaie with his ſonnes, and litle daughters. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer would conſider his lightneſſe with his grauitie, ſhould thinke there were in him two perſons of diuerſe compoſition, (as it were) by impoſsible coniunction coupled. In the laſt end of his life, he liued ful of ſorrow, cauſed by extreme ſicknes: for he was troubled with intollerable paines of the ſtomacke,<note place="margin">The death of Lorenzo di Medici.</note> and died in Aprill the yeare 1492. and the three and fortie yeare of his age: neither was there anie man that died either in <hi>Florence,</hi> or elſewhere in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo famous for his wiſedome, or ſo much lamented of his countrey. In ſo much as the heauens made euident ſignes of great miſaduentures that ſhould follow. Amongſt others, the Temple of <hi>Santa Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parata,</hi> was with ſo much furie ſtriken by thunder, that the greater part of the ſteeple was throwne downe, to the admiration and terrour of all men. All the inhabitants of <hi>Florence,</hi> and all the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> lamented his death, and made manifeſt ſhewe thereof. For there was not any of them, that ſent not Embaſſadors to condole the death of <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> And for triall that they had iuſt cauſe to lament, the effect follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prooued.
