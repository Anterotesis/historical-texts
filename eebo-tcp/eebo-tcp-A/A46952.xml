            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe most of us are so exceeding slow of heart to believe <hi>The great Doctrine of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all mankind in the world to come, either in happiness or</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40654:6"/>
               <hi>misery,</hi> and so extream backward, to provide for our own eternal condition, as that thereby, it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly appear how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it is, that this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental <hi>Point</hi> of Divinity should be plainly proved, clearly explained, and powerfully applied unto us.</p>
            <p>But before I handle the particulars of it, I shall make an entrance to it by laying down six received Principles, concerning the <note place="margin">Six Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</note> estate of all mankind until the end of the world; for this purpose that we may all know our selves, and that we may clearly see how this infallible Truth shall be fulfilled, wherein we are all so nearly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>First, That every one of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
               </note>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40654:6"/>
mankind doth consist of a body and a soul joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>The Exhortation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul,</hi> doth plainly prove, that every one of us have both a body and a soul. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28.</p>
            <p>And these words of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. 12. 9.</note> 
               <hi>We have had fathers of our flesh, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of Spirits?</hi> do clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imply, that we had our bodies originally from our parents, the <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 132. 11.</note> 
               <hi>fruit</hi> of whose bodies, our bodies are: and that we had our souls originally from our God, who is said in Holy Scripture to be the <hi>giver of them, and the God of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40654:7"/>
               <hi>of all flesh.</hi> Numb. 16. 22. Eccles. 12. 7.</p>
            <p>It is probable, that the Lord doth create every particular soul, and that he infuseth it into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of an Infant, when in all essential parts it is a perfect body, as <hi>Adams</hi> was, when God gave him his Soul. This is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of Modern <note place="margin">See Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> of the Passions, <hi>c.</hi> 32.</note> Writers about the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the soul, and it is grounded upon those Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, where God is said to be the <hi>Creator of the soul,</hi> and where the Lord is sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>God, which formeth the Spirit of man within him;</hi> Isai. 57. 16 Zach. 12. 1. 1 Pet. 4. 19.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of every one of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
               </note> is mortal, subject to die dayly, and that many

waies; some are no sooner <note n="*" place="margin">Job 14. 2. Gen 5. 5, 20. 27.</note> born, but they die, and they who have lived the longest lives, have died: as sure as we live in the body, so sure we must die in the body, and God knows how soon and how suddenly! <hi>What man is he that liveth</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>David</hi>) <note place="margin">Psal. 89. 48</note> 
               <hi>and shall not see death? For what is our life? It is even a vapour</hi> (saith the Apostle <hi>James</hi>) <hi>that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</hi> Jam. 4. 14.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40654:8"/>
Thirdly, That the soul <note place="margin">3. <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
               </note> of every one of mankinde, is immortal, and no way lyable to be killed; it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dieth with the bodle, nor sleepeth in it: but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the death of the body, the soul go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God that gave it, to give its particular account, and to be adjudged either to go to heaven to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, or else to go to hell to be tormented; so as that presently after death and particular judgement, the soul doth enter into its endless Eternity, either of comfort or torment.</p>
            <p>

            <p>HAving hitherto proved the Doctrine <hi>Of mans future Eternity,</hi> I shall in the next place explain it; and first of all I shall mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look downward, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards—the <hi>misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eternity</hi> of such as shall be damned, and shew you (so far as I know it by <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Revelation</hi>) wherein
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40654:20"/>
the misery of their everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing punishment, which is the punishment of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth chiefly consist, namely in these three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In their punishment of loss.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In their pain of sense.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the everlastingness of both these kinds of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
            <p>First, The misery of that everlasting cursed, and <note place="margin">1 Their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loss.</note> damned condition that the wicked shal go into at the end of this world, doth consist in their punishment of loss, and that in these four respects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They shal be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the loss of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and beatisical presence of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40654:21"/>
               <hi>They shall depart and go away from the Lord,</hi> in such a sort as that they shal never have any savour, nor any refreshing from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the ever-blessed and glorious Trinity.</p>
            <p>God being the chief <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 113. 68. Math. 19. 17. Psal. 36. 9. Psal. 63. 3.</note> good, and the greatest fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness being better then life, therefore to be punished with the loss of his favour will be as it were the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting death of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and their greatest loss, and saddest misery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They shal be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the loss of heaven, that place of celestial rest and blessedness, where God is said to dwell, whither Christ is ascended, and where the Lord will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest himself unto his people to their everlasting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40654:21"/>
and happinesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, &amp; all the Prophets in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and you your selves thrust out.</hi> Luke 13. 28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They shall be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the loss of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Communion of all the holy Angels in heaven; for seeing they shal be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the loss of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable presence of God, &amp; with the loss of heaven, it follows that they shal be punished with the loss of the joyful fellowship of all the holy angels, <hi>who do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies behold the face of God in heaven.</hi> Mat. 18. 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They shal be punished with the loss of the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table company of all the Saines in heaven, and of all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40654:22"/>
their glorious perfections, &amp; heavenly priviledges; for sith they shal <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 13. 25, 27, 28. Ioh. 8. 24.</note> depart from the Lord, and shal be shut out of heaven, and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, where they shal for ever remain unpardoned and unsanctified, retaining their vile hearts and sinful natures: therefore it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follows, that they shal be deprived of the happy society of all the Saints, and of all those ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial perfections and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed priviledges, that they shal enjoy, when they shall be ever with the Lord in the kingdome of heaven. <hi>Luko</hi> 16. 22, to 27.</p>
            <p>We think their loss to be very great, who are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with the loss of the temporal good things of this life; but alas! What is that, to the loss of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

good things of the life to come?</p>
