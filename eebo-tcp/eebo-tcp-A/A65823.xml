            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Wisest of Men, and Princes too, after he had summ'd up all the Delights, the Glories, the Treasures which the Great Ones possess, the Wise pretend to, and all the World pursue; upon a due Estimate pronounces them all, to be neither of the right <hi>Stamp,</hi> nor <hi>Weight;</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns as the only Solid Good, the sound practice of <hi>True Religion.</hi> An endless multiplying of Books he does expressly censure as Greivous to the <hi>Writer,</hi> and perhaps not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beneficial to <hi>Reader,</hi> in order to that end which the <hi>Preacher</hi> propounds. How the <hi>Press</hi> has since that time been taken up, and still is, with Books of all sorts, is not unknown to any man, that can claim the least share in the <hi>Muses;</hi> with Books of Modern Experimental Philosophy, Books of Arts, Books Historical, Polemical, Theological, yes and Theologico-political too; for all whose sakes, and many more, it is still <hi>sweating,</hi> and yet Labour and Oyle is often lost. For my own part, had I not a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62249:7"/>
to stay upon, had I not the <hi>Rock of Ages</hi> for my Foundation Stone, I had utterly been discouraged in this <hi>Essay,</hi> since the <hi>Purity of the Subject</hi> may engage Adversaries, with whom it may be accounted Criminal, even to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagle to Virtue; in which, if the Lemmata, or Symbols above, are not all punctually adequate and suitable to the <hi>Hexastichs</hi> beneath, (in all which let the long rigor of the Season speak in the Printers defence, if any <hi>Errata</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) yet however it may mind us what wholsom Precepts and excellent Rules are left behind, even by <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves, which some amongst them liv'd up to. I had not quoted <hi>Juvenal</hi> so often, but that 'tis to be doubted there are those upon whom a tolerated Satyrist would work so, as to shame them into Morality, when an Higher Authority would fail of it; and this through a daring disrespect and undervaluing of the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> by which they must one day be try'd. And indeed, if we seriously, and in cool Blood, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what Subject is, or can be more Amiable? In the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> the World and the Church have their beginning; in <hi>Joshua</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> as in the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> are Worthys whose Memorable Acts have been a Pattern to after ages for <hi>Rulers</hi> and Commanders in Chief; Who more Rhetorical than <hi>Job</hi> in his true Grief? Who more Pathetical than the <hi>Psalmist?</hi> What more Ravishing than the <hi>Canticles?</hi> Who more Powerful in their Reproofs, or Comforts, than the <hi>Prophets</hi> both Great and Small? (the predictions of the Sibylls we leave at large) and so for the rest, as to each Books respective Transcendency. And if it be thus with the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> what Tongue of Man or Angel can set out the <hi>New</hi> to its worth? Now <hi>Reader,</hi> when our main aim and drift is to be concise and plain, in Scripture Phrase, in order to the Training up of Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Youth, according to the Wise Mans Rule, of <hi>Fearing God, and keeping his Commandements,</hi> as their whole Duty, which without good in-sight into both Testaments is unattainable, and we having some reason from the customs abroad, to believe that the more Generous Striplings of this our Age, will be
