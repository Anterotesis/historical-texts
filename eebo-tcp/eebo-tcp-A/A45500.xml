            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Deſign of the following Sermon is to give the true Notion, (tho not a perfect Deſcription,) of a <hi>Religious Faſt.</hi> The frequent Return of theſe Days, I have fear'd ſhould occaſion our degenerating into a Formal and meet Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Obſervance of the Externals of them. <hi>To</hi> prevent this, and more fully to explicate and preſs the Duty of a Eaſt-day, my thoughts were exercis'd upon this Subject. And when the Diſcourſe had ſerv'd you in this, it was laid up among its fellows; it being no part of my intention, in either the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing or Preaching of it, that it ſhould be more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And there it had ſtill continued, if the joynt

The Lord grant it may be ſo, to whoſe blesſing for that purpoſe I now commit it. And for you, my Heart's deſire and Prayer is, that ye, may ſtand perfect and compleat in all the Will of God: <hi>Walking in all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs.</hi>

            <p>THeſe words are the <hi>Prophet's</hi> anſwer to a ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous queſtion that the <hi>Jews</hi> did propound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.

            <p>
               <hi>The Lord had a controverſie with his People, <note place="margin">ver 2.</note> and ſaid that he would plead with Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>that</hi> that He <hi>charges</hi> them with, was their <hi>Ingratitude</hi> and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to Him for his many <hi>favours</hi> and benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them: Two of which, as more <hi>ſignal,</hi> He does particularly recount; <note place="margin">ver. 4.</note> his delivering them from the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi>

            <p>And having ſuch <hi>evidence</hi> to produce in his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> He might well <hi>challenge</hi> them, as He does, <hi>ver. 3. oh my People, what have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee?</hi> q. d. what have I <hi>commanded</hi> you, that you ſhould count <hi>my</hi> ſervice a <hi>Burden?</hi> or wherein can you fault my conduct and <hi>providence</hi> towards you? have I been unmindful of you or wanting to do you good? if I have, come forth and <hi>plead</hi> it, and <hi>teſtifie againſt me.</hi> But on the contrary does not the whole

How ſhall we make our appearance before this <hi>high</hi> God, or what ſhall we ſay unto him, or who ſhall <hi>direct</hi> us what to do, that we may get the Lord to be at peace with us?</p>
            <p>My <hi>Text</hi> contains an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this queſtion, only before the <hi>Prophet</hi> comes to <hi>that,</hi> He repreſents this People as ſuggeſting ſome <hi>methods</hi> to themſelves which

they thought might ſerve to attone the anger of God and to procure his favour towards them. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether a punctual obſervance of the outward Inſtitutions of God's <hi>Worſhip</hi> might not avail to that end, and proffer to addreſs themſelves to him with <hi>burnt Offerings and Calves of a year old,</hi> as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd. And if more than the <hi>ordinary</hi> Sacrifices were neceſſary in their <hi>Caſe,</hi> they'll ſpare no coſt, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they were willing to do more than indeed it was either poſſible or lawful for them to do. <hi>Thouſands of Rams</hi> they are ready to offer;<note place="margin">ver. 7.</note> would <hi>ten thouſand Rivers of Oil</hi> ſuffice, could ſo many be procur'd, they would pour them all out before Him; and whereas nothing could be dearer to them than their <hi>Children,</hi> and amongſt them the <hi>firſt born,</hi> yet if God would <hi>accept</hi> of the death of a Child, they were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cauſe it <hi>to paſs through the fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 32.35.</note> Provided that they might retain their <hi>ſins,</hi> their injuſtice, unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and proud diſobedience to the commands of God, they will be as bountiful, expenſive and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the <hi>externals</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> as God would have them to be. They will load his Altar with their <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi> provided they may ſtill go on to load God with their <hi>ſins,</hi> they will devote all their <hi>ſubſtance</hi> to the <hi>Temple</hi> if they may be excus'd the dedicating <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God as a living and holy Sacrifice,</hi>

will not pleaſe God, there is ſomething elſe God looks for from a People that would humble themſelves aright before Him, and meet God in his Worſhip with acceptation; and if you <hi>ask</hi> what that is? <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly and to love mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> q. d. you inquire <hi>how</hi> you may come before the Lord, how you may <hi>humble</hi> your ſelves in a right manner, ſo as that the <hi>anger</hi> of the Lord may be turned away from you, and you may eſcape his <hi>impendent</hi> judgments. You ſeem to be very deſirous to have the Lord ſtill to be <hi>your God,</hi> and that He would continue you to be his <hi>People,</hi> that He would ſtill go on to deliver and to defend you, as He has done in times paſt: then know that it is not <hi>ſacrifices only</hi> that God deſires, but that which in conjunction therewith he does principally and ultimately require, is, that you do Juſtly, and love Mercy, and walk humbly with your God: theſe things are <hi>good</hi> and acceptable to God, and indiſpenſibly <hi>incumbent</hi> upon you, as the Lord has <hi>ſhewed</hi> them to be his mind and will concerning you; And tho' there are other things that God does <hi>require,</hi> which in their <hi>place</hi> and time are to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, yet nothing comparatively with theſe, as <hi>to do juſtly, to love mercy and walk humbly with thy God.</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109049:6"/>
of Real holineſs and Obedience to the will of God in what he commands and requires of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed to prove and improve this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition it will be needful to premiſe this in the firſt place, namely, that the <hi>anſwer</hi> that the <hi>Prophet</hi> in the <hi>text</hi> gives to this Peoples queſtion, and the <hi>concluſion</hi> I have now formed from it, does not reſpect the way of <hi>Atonement</hi> or making <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God for <hi>ſin.</hi> For as to <hi>that</hi> there is the ſame inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in the higheſt acts of Evangelical obedience as there is in the performing the duties of Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>The payment of one <hi>debt</hi> cannot diſcharge us of another: now we ſtand ingaged to God in a twofold Debt; a Debt of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> that is the conſequent of ſin, whereby we become obnoxious to the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law, <hi>the Wages of ſin is death:</hi> And a Debt of <hi>Duty</hi> which is our obligation to the <hi>Precept</hi> of the Law,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> and the payment of the Debt of Duty cannot <hi>diſcharge</hi> us from the debt of ſin. When we do our duty we do but what we <hi>ought,</hi> and the doing what we ought cannot be a <hi>compenſation</hi> for the doing of what we ought <hi>not</hi> to have done. If we come <hi>ſhort</hi> in our duty that further <hi>increaſe</hi> the Debt of ſin, but tho' we <hi>perform</hi> our duty that does not, <hi>leſſen</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer debt. We are debters ſtill to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, becauſe we have <hi>violated</hi> his holy Law; the <hi>Sanction</hi> of which was, <hi>the Soul that ſins ſhall die,</hi> and are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>inſolvent</hi> or uncapable to pay this debt by the moſt exact and continued obedience that we can yield to the <hi>commands</hi> of it, <note place="margin">Gal. 2.16.</note> 
               <hi>for by the works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore the Queſtion be in what way is the juſtice of God <hi>ſatisfied</hi> for ſin? in what way and upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109049:6"/>
what account is God <hi>reconcil'd</hi> to Sinners? What is the <hi>meritorious</hi> and procuring cauſe of the <hi>Grace</hi> and favour of God to a Perſon or People that have provoked his Anger againſt them by their ſins? <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, Oh Man,</hi> in his word, that it is not any Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>thine,</hi> that thou doſt or <hi>canſt</hi> perform unto God, but the obedience, the ſufferings, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his own <hi>Son</hi> our Lord Redeemer, that is the onely meritorious procuring cauſe of God's being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to Sinners.<note place="margin">Heb. 7 22.</note> He is the <hi>Surety of that better Covenant</hi> that has paid the <hi>debt of ſin</hi> for us and in our place; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.21.</note> that was <hi>made Sin for us</hi> by offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, <note place="margin">Heb. 9.26.</note> and did <hi>appear to put away ſin by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Queſtion be, what it is that God requires of man according to the terms of the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> that would have the benefit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s mediation, ſo as to have God <hi>actually</hi> reconcil'd to him, and the Anger of God turned away from him? <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, Oh man,</hi> that it is not ſome ſlight exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>devotion:</hi> An outſide <hi>faſting,</hi> or confeſſing of ſin, and humbling your ſelf for a <hi>day;</hi> but that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with a Serious and Hearty performance of <hi>theſe</hi> duties, you <hi>do juſtly, and Love mercy, and walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with God.</hi> Our Prophet does ſuppoſe God's <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of the <hi>atonement</hi> for ſin made by our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> but lets them know that without a Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the neceſſary duties of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> their claim to that atonement would be fruitleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. As there was ſomething that God required of Chriſt when He ſubſtituted himſelf in our Room to anſwer for our ſins which was his dying for us, ſo there is ſomething that God Requires of us, if we would have the benefit of the death of Chriſt. The Goſpel does not make void, but eſtabliſh the Law in

            <p>This premis'd, I now proceed to <hi>confirm</hi> the truth of the Propoſition, and the proof of it will depend upon ſhewing theſe two things; 1. The <hi>inſufficiency</hi> that there is in a bare performance of the duties of Religious Worſhip ſeparate from the duties of juſtice, mercy and humble walking with God, to procure the favour of God to a People. 2. The <hi>neceſſity</hi> that there is of ſuch a People's attending to the practice of thoſe things that are expreſſive of real holineſs and Obedience to God in conjunction with the duties of God s worſhip, in order to that end.</p>
            <p>And firſt let us conſider <hi>the inſufficiency that there is in a bare performance of the duties of Religions worſhip ſeparate from the duties of juſtice mercy, and humble walking with God, to procure the favour of God</hi> to a People, to comprimiſe the difference between God and them, to pacifie his Anger and to avert his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And becauſe this People in the <hi>text</hi> talk'd ſo much of their <hi>burnt-Offerings,</hi> their <hi>Calves</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109049:7"/>
their <hi>Rams,</hi> I ſhall to make this branch of the <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> more plain and convincing, preſent you with the <hi>judgment</hi> of God in his word concerning theſe things, whilſt this <hi>way</hi> of worſhip was in uſe and ſhew you of how little <hi>account</hi> with God theſe Sacrifices were, when ſeparated from the duties of juſtice, mercy and humble Obedience.</p>
            <p>The Ancient <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are to be conſidered two ways, 1. as they were <hi>typical</hi> Repreſentation of that <hi>real</hi> Sacrifice which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt offered to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of his offered to when <hi>through the enternal Spirit he offer'd himſelf to God.</hi> Much of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as it was Reveal'd in that time, was wrap'd up in thoſe Sacrifices. They did all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to and prefigure <hi>him that was to come.</hi> For whereas the holy and righteous <hi>Law</hi> of God had threatned Sin with <hi>Death,</hi> it could not be reaſonably, ſuppoſed, <note place="margin">Heb. 10.4</note> 
               <hi>that the blood of Bulls and of goats ſhould take away ſin.</hi> And therefor, the Heathens to ſupply that defect, <note place="margin">Quod pro vitâ bominis ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrvitd bominis reddatur, nonpoſſe aliter Deorum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalium numen plat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> arbitrantur.</note> having ſome natural, or rather traditional knowledge of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiry of ſacrifices to make Atonement for ſin, did conclude that nothing leſs than the Life of a <hi>Man</hi> offered in Sacrifice, was ſufficient to appeaſe God. But indeed this man, is no other than the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is brought in ſpeaking to his Father to this purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>When he cometh into the world, he ſaith, acrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, ſecondly, <hi>they</hi> are to be conſidered as acts of Homage and Worſhip performed by that People, to God, and in which they generally reſted in a neglect of the <hi>weightier</hi> matters or the Law. And however they though to pleaſe God thereby we <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

The neceſſity of practical Obedience in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the duties of Divine Worſhip does appear from the conſideration of <hi>the goodneſs of it.</hi> Whatever the Lord requires of man, to be done it is <hi>good:</hi> Good in it <hi>ſelf,</hi> good for <hi>him</hi> and good for <hi>others.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Abſolutely</hi> good, <hi>Perſonally</hi> good and <hi>Relatively</hi> good. To do juſtly is <hi>good,</hi> to love mercy is <hi>good,</hi> to walk humbly with God is <hi>good.</hi> And what an attractive is this to come up to our <hi>duty,</hi> that is ſo good in the <hi>whole</hi> and good in every <hi>part</hi> of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are <hi>good in themſelves,</hi> not only becauſe they are <hi>commanded,</hi> as all the <hi>poſitive</hi> inſtitutions of worſhip are good, but they have an <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi> goodneſs, and commend themſelves to us from their very <hi>nature,</hi> they are ſuch things as flow from the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as well as bear a conformity to the <hi>Will</hi> of God. So that it is impoſſible they ſhould be otherwiſe than good, or that what is contrary to them ſhould be <hi>ſo.</hi> Injuſtice, unmercifulneſs and diſobedience to God cannot be good, they are <hi>Evil,</hi> and <hi>altogether</hi> Evil, and will be ſo for <hi>ever, Deut.</hi> 30.15. <hi>ſee, I have ſet before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.</hi> Holineſs is <hi>good,</hi> and ſin is <hi>evil;</hi> and it is impoſſible that either of them ſhould be other than what they <hi>are.</hi> Sin cannot become <hi>Good,</hi> holineſs cannot become evil: the <hi>difference</hi> betwixt holineſs and ſin is as great as betwixt good and evil; that except good could become evil, and evil good, the nature of good and evil be alter'd and confounded, it is impoſſible that Holineſs thould be any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than good, and ſin any other thing than the worſt and the pureſt evil.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are alſo <hi>Good for us,</hi> ſo that we cannot more directly ſeek and promote our own good and <hi>happineſs</hi> than in the practiſing of them. Is that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109049:11"/>
good that is <hi>amiable</hi> and lovely? what ſo lovely as ho lineſs? That is the <hi>glory</hi> of the Divine <hi>Being,</hi> and the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of God in Man. Is that good that is <hi>pleaſant</hi> and delightful? the ſweeteſt pleaſures are to be found in the <hi>ways</hi> of God. None injoy ſuch <hi>peace</hi> and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility in their mind, <note place="margin">Pſ. 119.165.</note> are ſo free from fears and <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences</hi> as thoſe who have the ſtricteſt regard to God's commands. Or is that good that is <hi>profitable?</hi> we are aſſur'd that <hi>godlineſs is profitable to all things, having a Promiſe of the life that now is, <note place="margin">1.

            <p>And theſe things <hi>are good for others</hi> too; how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious and beneficial to the World are <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy?</hi> how much do they conduce to the good order of it? how ſweet are the influences that they diffuſe amongſt all perſons? who is not the better for them? The godly are refreſhed with them, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Goſpel, and commend Religion to others as a real ſubſtantial thing that is worthy their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and choice. The Religion that lies only in forms and diſcourſe is an airy, unaffecting thing, and gets no ground in the World, but <hi>that</hi> that is opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and powerful commends it ſelf to the Conſciences of Men; theſe things are good for the bodies, and good for the Souls of others, and that is one Reaſon of the ſtrict charge that is laid upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel to be frequent in the urging and preſſing of them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to maintain good works: theſe things are good and profitable unto men.</hi> And this is further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd by,</p>

And as his willing of theſe things to be duties incumbent on Man is that that is highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous and agreeable to his own glory, that the reaſonable creature ſhould be juſt and merciful as he is, and be always mindful of that infinite diſtance that there is between him and it, and the higheſt deference that upon that account is due to him; ſo the regular ſubordination that there ought to be in <hi>our</hi> Wills to <hi>His,</hi> the relation we ſtand in to Him as the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the intire ſubjection we owe to Him in that Relation; lays us under the ſtricteſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obſerve and obey all his requirements.

            <p n="3">3. The laſt conſideration that the Lord who hath required theſe things <hi>hath ſhewed and made known the ſame,</hi> has promulg'd and declared his <hi>will</hi> very plainly and expreſsly, in theſe things, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and capacity of all perſons. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, Oh man, what is good, and what the Lord doth require of thee.</hi> He requires nothing of thee but what He has <hi>ſhewed</hi> thee.

            <p>Partly by the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> that ſome of theſe things, at leaſt, as to do juſtly and to Love mercy, are pleaſing and acceptable to him. He has ingrav'd them upon thy very <hi>Heart,</hi> ſo that reflecting upon the Original principles of thy Nature, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with thy ſelf, asking thy Conſcience queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and harkning to the Anſwers and dictates of it, this thou mayſt know and underſtand, that to do juſtly is good; and injuſtice is evil; to love mercy is

pleaſing to God, and the contrary to it as diſpleaſing to him. Did the Heathens of old, and do they ſtill at this day know it and art thou a ſtranger to it? Read what is ſaid of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>the Gentiles which have not the</hi> written <hi>Law, do by nature the things contained in the law, theſe having not the Law, are a law unto themſelves, which ſhews the work of the Law written in their hearts.</hi>

               <head>The APPLICATION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. This Doctrine yields, at all times a uſeful, but on this day a very ſeaſonable caution to us, <hi>to take heed that we reſt not in mere outward duties of Worſhip,</hi> as if that were all that God required; and as it is to be feared many perſons do, to the deceiving of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They are very exact, very frequent and very punctual in theſe things, but guilty of a woful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the moral duties of Religion, and ſo are but partial, and conſequently unſincere in their obedience. Let us take heed that we deceive not our ſelves in the ſame way. If we halve it with God in the matter of our duty, He will cut us ſhort in the matter of his mercy. What if ſuch a Religion ſhould obtain a temporal reward, 'tis inſufficient to evidence a real intereſt in the ſaving love of God.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but God has requir'd theſe things of us. All the <hi>true</hi> methods, means and ways of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> are of God's appointment. Praying and Hearing and Faſting are his <hi>Ordinances;</hi> but he never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we ſhould reſt in theſe and go no further: To do this and no more: to attend unto theſe and neglect other things, is a Badge of loathſom <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> in the ſight of God, and branded in Scripture as the guiſe of an unſound Heart. Hypocrites and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Profeſſors know they muſt do <hi>ſomething</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Something they would do to <hi>appeaſe</hi> God when He is Angry; ſomething, to continue His <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:109049:14"/>
when Providence is eaſie and comfortable to them; ſomething, to keep up a <hi>Credit</hi> and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with others for Religion; and ſomething to quiet the importunities of their own <hi>Conſcience;</hi> but then they reſolve to do as little as they can, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſlight and heedleſs performance of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God is the <hi>eaſieſt</hi> part of Religion, and moſt conſiſtent with their unmortified luſts, they pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this courſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis indeed much eaſier to confeſs a hundred ſins, than to <hi>forſake one:</hi> 'tis eaſier to ſpend a whole day in publick Worſhip, than to deny the enticement of a Luſt, or to withſtand a Temptation when it oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely preſents; becauſe the one is only the labour of the body, the other requires the exerciſe of the Soul; the one may be a wearineſs to the Fleſh, but the other is croſs and oppoſite to the beloved intereſts of it; and carnal Hearts may make ſhift to brook the one, tho' they cannot bear the other. A little outward Pennance and Mortification of the body they can undergo, but a true <hi>Repentance</hi> of ſin, that conſiſts in deſerting the practice and mortifying the principle of ſin is utterly diſtaſteful to them. Oh then as we would acquit our ſelves of the charge and guilt of Hypocriſie, let us take heed of reſting in the outward duties of Worſhip. Tho' your Eyes be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Heaven, if your affections be fix'd upon Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objects; tho you bow your knee before God, if your Hearts do Rebel againſt Him: if you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your tranſgreſſion, but do ſtill retain and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it; if you make many Prayers but don't endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live anſwerably to 'em; if you vow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to lead a new life, but as ſoon as you go from this place forget what you have been doing: What is

all this but a mere mockery? <note place="margin">Gal. 6.7.</note> And be not deceived, God is not mocked.</p>
               <p>This part of the Worſhip of God that we are now ingaged in is no doubt a very neceſſary duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon us. God has commanded it, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al providences call us to it. Who does not ſee what need there is of Faſting, of Prayer and Humbling our ſelves before the Lord? But Remember this is but one part of what God requires of you. The true Faſt does not conſiſt in a bare obſervance of thoſe things that outwardly relate to ſuch a day. A man may be very <hi>Formal</hi> in them, forbear all ſervile work, put on meaner apparel, attend the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick duties of God's Houſe, and outwardly ſeem to be very ſubmiſs and ſerious therein, and yet if this be all, God does diſown ſuch a Faſt from being the day that he has choſen and appointed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.5. <hi>Is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen? A day for a man to afflict his Soul! Is it to how down his head as a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſh, and to ſpread ſackcloth and aſhes under him? wilt thou call this a Faſt, and an acceptable day unto the Lord?</hi> No, this is not the day that God has choſen: And yet this is the only Faſt that many keep, that is fill'd up with corporal geſtures and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. What then is the Faſt that God has choſen? He himſelf deſcribes it in the following verſes, <hi>to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, <note place="margin">ver. 6.7</note> to undo the heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, —to deal thy bread to the hungry, to bring the poor that are caſt out to thy houſe, to cover the naked, and hide not thy ſelf from thy own fleſh,</hi> i. e. turn not away from relieving thy poor Brother: This is the true Faſt, the Faſt that God has choſen, to break off from our ſins, and to do juſtly, and to love mercy.</p>
               <p>And, Oh that this may be the Faſt that we may

keep, a day that God may accept, and accept us in it! we ſeem to be ſenſible that the Juſt and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God has a controverſy with this Nation, that He is come forth to plead with <hi>England.</hi> We have like the <hi>Jews,</hi> been unthankful for mercies, do ſoon forget our wonderful deliverances and refuſe to be reform'd by the various methods God has us'd with us to that end, and now we think God is Angry with us, and we fly to theſe duties of Faſting and Prayer, and hope theſe will appeaſe God; and is this all that we will do? God will upbraid us with ſuch Faſts, ſoon grow weary of them, and break in through ſuch Faſts with his judgments upon us. He looks for more, he requires more, and more than this we muſt do, if we would prevail with God, and obtain a bleſſing from Him, and that now leads me to the</p>

Be as juſt in your word, as true to your promiſe, as exact in your dealings as you would have others to be? This is the thing that is juſt, and that this Juſtice God does require of you, Appears by the reproof the Prophet gives the violaters of it in the words that follow the text, <hi>Are there yet the treaſures of wickedneſs in the houſe of the wicked, <note place="margin">v. 10.</note> and the ſcant meaſure that is abominable? <note place="margin">v. 11.</note> ſhall I count them pure with the wicked balances and with the bag of deceitful weights?</hi> Theſe uneven balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, deceitful weights and ſcant meaſures, that are the Inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs, are hateful to God, and tho' for a time they may ſerve a covetous humour, and men may heap up treaſures to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereby, yet there is a <hi>curſe</hi> that attends ſuch perſons, and a <hi>moth</hi> that will conſume their riches; thoſe treaſures of wickedneſs will not always continue in the houſe of the wicked.</p>
               <p>To do juſtly is a thing that moſt perſons know, but too few make Conſcience of, but juſtice is a thing that muſt be <hi>done.</hi> 'Tis not enough to have the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it in our Mind, but the practice of it muſt be in our <hi>hand.</hi> To be juſt and not to do juſtly in our particular actions is a contradiction. <hi>He that doth Righteouſneſs is Righteous.</hi>

A merciful man is ſuch a one as <hi>Job,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:109049:16"/>
who was <hi>Eyes to the blind, and Feet to the Lame, and a Father to the poor, Job</hi> 29.15. The all-wiſe God has ſo order'd it in his Providence that we ſhould always have objects and occaſions for the exerciſe of this Grace. Some are poor, ſome are ſick, ſome are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into captivity, ſome are bereav'd of their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that others that are healthful and rich and proſperous in the World might ſuccour them in their diſtreſſes: And ſome left to fall into ſin, that thoſe that ſtand by Grace, might reſtore ſuch with a <hi>ſpirit of meekneſs.</hi> Think it not enough that you are ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt, but remember that you muſt be merciful too. Yea you cannot be truly juſt except you be merciful, to deny to others ſome part of our own, when the providence of God calls us to give it, is injuſtice, as well as not to give them what is their own, and the higheſt injuſtice, injuſtice to God, in not uſing the goods of this World, to the end for which he has intruſted us with them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And as Divine <hi>Love</hi> is the general Principle of all good actions, ſo it is the immediate Fountain from whence all the Streams of Mercy do iſſue. They that love Mercy, will be ready to ſhew Mercy, and think it no coſt, no burden, no wearineſs to do it. That that proceeds from Love we do freely and chearfully, and that puts a luſtre upon every act of Mercy. And to excite this Principle in you, conſider, that ſhewing Mercy to others does aſſimilate and make you like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God himſelf, who delights in Mercy; who when he does proclaim his Name, does it eſpecially by the diſplay of his Goodneſs and Mercy; <note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> and ſhould we not affect the neareſt Union with God, and the higheſt Reſemblance of him? <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. <hi>Be ye therefore mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, as your heavenly Father is merciful.</hi> Alſo conſider that the Love of Mercy is a ſpecial evidence
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109049:17"/>
of the Sincerity of your Love to God, to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful for God's ſake does proceed from the love of God: But, <hi>whoſo hath this worlds goods and ſeeth his Brother hath need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of compaſſion how dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Love of God in him?</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17. And let us often ſeriouſly think of the great day of the Lord, when nothing but Divine Mercy can ſtead and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend us, and that they are merciful men who are particularly deſcrib'd in Scripture that ſhall have the benefit of the Divine Mercy. The Apoſtle's prayer for <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. does import ſo much, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>the Lord give Mercy unto the houſe of Oneſiphorus for he oft refreſhed me, <note place="margin">Mat. 25.24. ad ſin.</note> —the Lord grant that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.</hi> And it is expreſly ſaid on the contrary, <hi>that He ſhall have judgment without mercy that hath ſhewed no mercy, Jam.</hi> 2.13. How rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing then ſhould we be to embrace all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſhewing Mercy. In which, as well as in the former duty of doing juſtly, we ſhould have reſpect unto God, his glory as the end, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as the reaſon of all that we do, which is the fumm of the laſt duty, that you</p>

Endeavour that your whole life may be as much as poſſibly you can a continued walk with God. Set him always before your Face, have your Eye conſtantly to him: keep up your Hearts with God, in a frame fit for Communion with God at all times. Obſerve his Providence, follow the Guidance of it, receive the Inſtructions of it, and comply with all the Calls of it. Be led by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109049:17"/>
the Spirit of God, and be obſequious to all his holy motions: let your converſation be in Heaven. Be followers of the Lord Jeſus, and walk as you have Him for an Example.</p>
               <p>And be very <hi>Humble</hi> in your walking with God, depend upon him for Divine aſſiſtance and <hi>ſtrength</hi> in all that you do for his name. Be Humble and Reverent in your <hi>Worſhiping</hi> of God. Aſcribe all the <hi>Glory</hi> to him of all the <hi>good</hi> you receive and do. Be Low, be vile in your own ſight, and exalt the Lord in your Soul: Let him be your firſt and your laſt: Begin all your works with God, and end them in Him.

To make light and little account of them, is to caſhier all practical Obedience, for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be done by you, if doing juſtly, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, and walking humbly with God, be not your duty? Yea theſe are the great and weighty duties of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that claim our primary regard and attendance to them. And yet how many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Chriſtian Religion, act as if <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were nothing at all concern'd therein; which is and ought to be for a <hi>Lamentation?</hi> Perſons that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and unmerciful to men, and diſobedient to God, and that oftentimes without finding any Remorſe or Regret in themſelves, whoſe Religion has nothing of ſubſtance in it, but lies in ſome ſpeculative notions only, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.5.</note> which they have taken up; theſe <hi>have a form of Godlineſs, but deny the power thereof; from ſuch,</hi> they that would walk with God in a courſe of Obedience, muſt <hi>turn away.</hi>

ſuch an Intereſt in, and <hi>Union</hi> with the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> by a Faith that is of the Operation of God, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to a right diſcharge of any and every duty. For tho' ſome of the things that God requires, may be done as to the external part, and what is ſo done may be <hi>materially</hi> good, without any ſuch <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace</hi> received and exerted in the doing of them, yet are they <hi>formally</hi> defective, as not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>from a pure Heart, and a good Conſcience, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.5.</note> and Faith unfeigned,</hi> which are the declared Principles, neceſſary to conſtitute and denominate an action Evangelically good. Humane Nature indeed, refin'd from the more dreggy and ſenſual part of it, by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>Morality,</hi> may raiſe it ſelf to a practice of That that is purely moral in theſe things. So ſome of the Heathens have not only been ſtrictly juſt, but largely beneficent, and have done much good both in their publick capacities and private ſtations. But in as much as our Evangelical Walking and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God is concern'd in theſe actions, that they be done thro' a Divine Strength, and directed to the Glory of God, this the Mind of Man is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of, whilſt eſtranged from the Light and Power of that Faith, whereby we come to be in Chriſt, and to be one with him: For as it is thro his <hi>Mediation</hi> only, that we are, and can be accepted in any good we do; ſo there is a Divine <hi>Grace</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from him to us, that alone can ſtrengthen us to do, and perſevere in the doing theſe things, and alſo direct our hearts to intend the Glory of God therein: And which is that Qualification that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificates duties of <hi>Evangelical</hi> Obedience from acts of <hi>Moral</hi> Virtue. Thus the fruit ever anſwers the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and kind of the Tree it grows upon, <note place="margin">Mat. 7.17.</note> is <hi>corrupt</hi> or <hi>good</hi> according as that is; and nothing leſs than
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109049:19"/>
ſuch a ſupernatural Grace receiv'd in Union with Chriſt, is ſufficient to make this Evil Tree good, ſo to alter the Corrupt Nature of Man, to dethrone the Dominion of Sin, and to bring the Soul under the power of a Principle of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs whereby it becomes diſpoſed, <hi>ſanctified and meet for the Maſter's uſe, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.21.</note> and prepared unto every good work.</hi> Then think it not enough that you are Chriſtians by <hi>Name,</hi> by an outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and viſible <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> but make ſure of a real ſpiritual In-being in Jeſus Chriſt, in whom only it is that we can do any thing that is good, ſo as to be accepted with God in it; <note place="margin">Joh. 15.5.</note> and <hi>without whom we can do nothing,</hi> that is a bringing forth fruit unto God.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Poſſeſs your ſelves with as lively apprehenſions as you can get of the worth and excellency of the things God requires of you.</hi> And theſe, to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God, are all of them things that have a real and tranſcendent worth in them; ſuch things as do approve themſelves to be <hi>Good</hi> and excellent to an enlightened mind, and a well-diſpoſed heart. They are ſuch things, wherein the Perfection of our Nature, as it lies in a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, and ſubjection to him, does conſiſt; They are alſo Lovely in the Eyes of others, and things of good <hi>Report,</hi> that cauſe Religion to be well ſpoken of.

                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.2.</note> will open their mouths againſt them; to all others, that have any ſense of Humanity, and Conſcience left, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves, as things that are good and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, worthy to be practis'd and imitated by others. Having ſuch a lively apprehenſion of the worth of theſe things, we ſhall not look upon them as a task
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109049:19"/>
and impoſition upon us, but do them with delight as things that are moſt ſuitable and agreeable to us.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Read, ſtudy and in all things conſult the Word of God, to regulate your doings to God, and dealings with Men.</hi> This written Word is the Revealed Will of God. This <hi>ſhews</hi> us all things we are commanded, and all we are forbidden. This Word is <hi>able to make the Man of God perfect, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.17.</note> throughly furniſh'd unto all good works.</hi> And what can more commend it to us to be the Book of our daily Converſe and Meditation?

How much is it then our wiſdom to have a conſtant Regard to this Word, to ſee that warranting our actions, guiding us in our difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and reclaiming us when we go aſtray. Such is the promiſe for our direction, conſulting with the Word, and ſeeking God to enable us by his Spirit to underſtand it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Thine Ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</hi>
