            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Lords and Commons <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Juſtifications</hi> for the Deprivation and Depoſal of <hi>JAMES II.</hi> From the Imperial Throne of <hi>England.</hi> Being in full ſatisfaction to all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in Anſwer to all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, Domeſtick and <hi>Foraign.</hi>
            </head>
            <argument>
               <p>Allowed to be Printed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen the greateſt Changes in States, ſuch as the Mutations of Imperial Princes, are made; the greateſt Reaſons and moſt potent Arguments ought to be furniſht for ſuch important Counſels and Decrees, but as the Reaſoning part of Mankind are ſo different and oppoſite in their Judgments and Determinations given in ſo weighty a Cauſe; the grounds of ſuch irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable Diſſent in their Opinions, ariſe only from their various Fixation of the Original of Government. For whilſt ſome are combating for <hi>Jure Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and others for the Humane Conſtitution of Monarchy, thoſe nicer and remoter Speculations lead 'em ſo high, to ſuch different Fountain-Heads of Regal Power, till they ceaſe to be matter of Argument, and terminate in meer Matter of Faith. And when it comes up thither, and Men, as generally, in the tendereſt points of Faith, believe only, becauſe through the Impulſe of ſome unaccountable Conviction, they cannot but believe, Reaſoning is then ſtr ck Mute; and all beyond is taken up only upon Truſt.</p>
            <p>Where Argumentation therefore, as in this Caſe, will be altogether vain, becauſe unconvincing, the greateſt and ſtrongeſt, (publickly viſible,) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and Authority we muſt repair to, muſt be that laſt Refuge both of Law and Equity PRECEDENT. What has been done upon Mature Deliberation, and the Conſent of whole Kingdoms, in the like Caſe before, ſtands for a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, what may be done now. For Examples of which kind,</p>
            <p>There has been very well urged already, the Caſe of <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> the III. King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> Depoſed by the States of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in ſo many Reſpects ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Parallel to the Late Male Adminiſtration in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as Precedents are leaſt Satisfactory, or leaſt confronting to obſtinate Oppoſers; where they make only for one Party: A Popiſh <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for Male-Adminiſtration in a Proteſtant Kingdom may not perhaps be allowed to carry its ſufficient Juſtification with the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>; and therefore the Tables ought to be turned, and the Ballance made by Parallels of their own ſide; the moſt prudent way of combating, and ſecuring a Victory in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being to lay the Scene of War in the Enemies Country.</p>
            <p>To confute therefore, and ſilence all the Romiſh Pretentions of Diſguſt and Murmure, againſt the Injuſtice of ſuch a Deprivation, from Examples of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Depoſals of Male adminiſtring Proteſtants; we'll begin with <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Famous Holy League enter'd into by the Pope himſelf, and ſo many potent Allies; together, with all the Romiſh Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> againſt that undoubted Heir of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and at that time by Succeſſion their Rightful King, is ſo notoriouſly known to the World, that all the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particulars of the Hiſtory, would be impertinent.</p>
            <p>Let it ſuffice, here was a Prince, the unqueſtion'd Inheritour of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> actually by all Open and Hoſtile means (and all ſuch Hoſtility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and abetted, and his very Birth-right fore-cloſed by the Pope himſelf) oppoſed and denyed his Acceſſion to the Throne, for no other unqualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but being a <hi>Hugonot</hi>; that is, of a perſwaſion contrary to the Eſtabliſht, and Regnant Romiſh Religion in <hi>France</hi>; being in all other reſpects acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a moſt excellent Prince: Inſomuch, that after all other ineffectual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of recovering his Birth-right; he had no means left to repeal his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and Debarrment from the Throne, but by his Abjuration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, and return to the Romiſh Worſhip.</p>
            <p>This Caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. in ſtead of a Parallel to Ours, does not come up to half the Juſtification of the preſent Meaſures of <hi>England.</hi> For here <gap reason="missing" extent="1+ pages">
