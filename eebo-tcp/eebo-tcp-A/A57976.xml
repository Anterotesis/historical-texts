            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

weighing of precious truth. I am grieved that this
should bee put on mee which a Heathen laid on

he loved his countrey because his owne, not
because his countrey. Seeing it's weaknesse to
overlove a Nationall faith, because Nationall, and
not because it's faith. Truth naked and stripped of
all supervenient relations is love worthy. And
there is as great cause of sorrow that all the Lords
people should not mind one thing, and sing one
Song, and joyne in one against the children of
<hi>Babel.</hi>

my witnesse is in heaven, and my record on high,

reverence at once in this Treatise,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> and shall hope,
if any be otherwise minded, God shall even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
this unto them. And it is meet so to doe, since
our Physician Christ can well difference betwixt
weaknesse and wickednesse, and will not have us
cast one straw, before any whose face is towards
Heaven, to cause them to stumble. Love hath a
bosome and armes to carry the weake Lambes,


<pb facs="tcp:98601:6"/>
and is a bridge over the River to keep the weake

good of the whole Church, must have some common sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<hi>viz.</hi> the universall Church, in which it must for orders
cause first reside, before it be given to certaine guides; But
neither Scripture, nature, nor reason requireth such a shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the keyes from hand to hand, seeing Christ can keep
them, and immediately put them in their trust, whom he
liketh best. Hence for the determination of the Question.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Conclusion.</note> The physicall power of the keyes is given
to men as they are professors, that is, men, and not Angels
are capable of that power; for when they are made members
of the visible Church, they are differenced both from <hi>Angels</hi>
and <hi>Infidels,</hi> as <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Turkes,</hi> for Angels according to
Christs humble love and deepe wisedome, are not upon the
list to be office bearers in his house: but this is not formally a
power of the keyes, but a popular power about the keyes,
whereby popular consent may be given to the key-bearers,
for their election.</p>

               <note place="margin">2 Conclusion.</note> There is a power popular, but not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative;

authoritative; but power of authoritative jurisdiction, is

Churches minde, the Baptisme were valid, howbeit there
were an errour in the fact, for power of jurisdiction is given
to the members of the Church scattered, <hi>tanquam subjecto
cuidam materiali &amp; potentiali,</hi> in remote power, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
but as they are met in a Synod in Christs name. 5. The
power of the keyes is given to the Church of believers two
wayes. 1. As to the end, or the small object of the keyes:
and this we acknowledge as truth, for Christ gave officers
for the Church, as his intended end, <hi>Hee gave some to bee
Apostles, &amp;c. for the perfecting of the Saints, for the
worke of the Ministerie, for the edifying of the Body
of Christ.</hi> But 2. The power of the Keyes is not given
to believers as to the formall subject, that they may
authoritatively make and ordaine officers. Hence the,</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Conclusion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. Conclusion.</note> is this. When the Church standeth of
believers, only as contradistinguished from her guides, it
is then <hi>totum homogeneum,</hi> a body consisting of alike parts,
where the denomination of the whole is given to the parts;
as every part of water is water, so every three believers of
five hundred believers, is a Church of believers. Now if a
Church should be in a remote Island, not consociate with
other Churches, and yet wanting guides, our brethren say
in this case, the power of the Keyes should bee seene to
bee in believers, and they might choose and ordaine their
owne officers. I grant they have great Schoolemen to say

is Christs argument for <hi>John Baptists</hi> ministerie. If from
Christ and Heaven, it is either from the law of nature, or
from some divine positive law: from nature it is not. For
1. the power is not naturall, but supernaturall, reaching a

as Watchmen, Fathers, Pastours by the power of the
keyes, that <hi>they would take heed to the ministerie, which they
have received of the Lord,</hi> and this is but private admonition,
that one man, one woman, may give to their Pastours.
Now one man is not the Church bearing the keyes, but this
opinion maketh <hi>Archippus</hi> and all the faithfull at <hi>Colosse</hi> to
beare the keyes, and command by power of the keyes, so
that all are Fathers, Pastours; Pastours by one and the same
power of the keyes. His second answer is. <hi>All are not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:
An incorporation may make a Major or Sheriffs, and
yet the incorporation is not a Major and Sheriffe: So the Church
may make Ministers, and yet the Church it selfe is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Elder, or a Deacon.</hi> Answer, It is not alike, An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation
hath a priviledge, but not any princely or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall
authoritie to create a Major, but the Saints have the
regall power of the keyes from Christ, not only to make
Elders, but also to judge authoritatively with coequall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
with the Elders: by your doctrine, if the whole inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98601:16"/>
of a citie may make a Major, and set themselves down
in the Bench, as collaterall Judges with the Major, then
all the inhabitants indeed were Majors, as all the Saints in
<hi>Corinth</hi> did judicially excommunicate, why are they not
then all Elders and Pastours? Shew us any authoritie that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
have in governing, which the meanest of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
hath not? And this maketh all Ministers, and all, to
be Watchmen, Fathers, Overseers. This I take to have

a calling or power, such as the keyes of his Kingdome, the
not improving and putting the Lords Talent to the bank, is
a sinfull digging of the Lords Talent in the earth. Hence
I desire to know from Gods word, these foure things, 1. If
the power of the keyes be given by Christ to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
this power is a ministeriall calling. Where is there a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
for light, prudence for government, to goe out and in
before the Lords people, made to every one of the Lords
people? 2. Where is the tongue promised to them all in
judgement, that none shall resist, and the consolations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to them, in the discharge of this power of the keyes?
3. Where is the Spirit of the Lord comming upon them
all, and every one, that they may judge the people?
4. Where are the believers condemned for usurping the
keyes, and because being ignorant they cannot discharge
that calling? Where is the carelesse governing of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of the faithfull rebuked in the word of God, as a
digging of the Lords talent in the earth? I adde two things
to confirme this. 1. Our Divines disputing against the
great <hi>Pope,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and against the little <hi>Pope,</hi>
the <hi>Prelate</hi> his god-son, and first born, come out of the <hi>Popes
loynes,</hi> as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Iunius, Zanchius, Sadeel, Pareus,
Vrsine, Whitaker, Reynold, and Amesius, Baines, Parker,
Didoclavius, &amp;c.</hi> They prove, if such power of the keyes
and plenitude of order, and jurisdiction, were in these two
creatures, the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Prelate,</hi> the wisedome of Christ
in his Word, should have set downe the canons for the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of the power, besides the canons that concerneth all
other Bishops or Pastours, for the heads or Monarchs dutie


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98601:17"/>
in the common wealth, is carefully set downe in the word,
as what a man the King should be; but the word hath no
canons for the power of the keyes, and the regulating of
that power, in all and every believer, man and woman.
2. If God set downe a Canon, and requires abilities in the
Church guides, as Elders labou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The believers three or foure may be excommunicated,

believers that are pastours, their pastorall acts of baptizing

no power of the keyes, many shall doubt if they have
beene baptized, because they may happily doubt, yea, too
justly doubt of the beliefe, and so of the pastours power of
the keyes. Yea, six or ten professors and visible Saints are
an independent congregation, and so have the power of the
Keyes to appoint an Eldership, to Excommunicate, and yet
these ten may be faithlesse hyppocrites: hence all their acts of

            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> First, I retort the Argument. Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the actuall exercise of the keyes, the preaching of the

Church of believers: will it hence follow, that believers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

keyes. This is against <hi>Parker</hi> himselfe. 2. Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

as the Subject, and first disposer of these offices,</hi> it is most
false, for the Rulers of the Church or Presbyterie is the

doe ordaine pastours, the Church of believers doth only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and choose them by a popular consent. Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Pastours <hi>(in gift)</hi> to the Church, that is for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

are uncapable of Pastours in the way and manner that


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98601:21"/>
they are given to them. God mocketh not <hi>Israel,</hi> when he
giveth to them <hi>David.</hi> as their King, but it followeth not
the people are the first subject of the Kingly power.</p>

that the keyes are given to the one, that is to believers, as to

the authoritie is given principally to believers as to the

they be Pastours and Elders called lawfully by the

the keyes is given to the eldership, that hath the oversight of
the flocke,</hi> in the Lord, 1 Thessal. 5. <hi>as to the subject,
but yet this power is given to the Church of believers to
gather them in to Christ, and for the reprobate to cleare
Gods justice, and to make them inexcusable, and there is
no reason to aske a cause,</hi> Why both believers and heretikes
exercise the power of the Keyes, seeing Christ gave this power
to believers, and not to heretikes, <hi>for I say Christ hath given
the power of the keyes to both, when he gifteth both with
abilitie to discharge the places, and giveth them authoritie
in his Church; And it is a false ground, and not farre from</hi>
Anabaptisme, <hi>that there is not</hi> Ecclesiasticall power in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes

he teaches the duties of admonition in the degrees thereof, for the
winning of brethren: He speaketh of Brethren and Disciples,

the whole scope and intent aime at Disciples and Brethren,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 15.</note>

to preach and baptize is given to believing women. Christ
speaketh to his Disciples as Disciples, of the dominion of the
Kings and Princes of the Gentiles, of false Prophets, Wolves
in Sheep-skins, <hi>ergo,</hi> he giveth to his Disciples a power to
be Kings, and a warrant to be false Teachers, it followeth no
wayes. 2. By a brother, v. 15. is not meant a true believer,
but a brother in profession, else we are not to labour to gain,
by this text, unbelieving brethren, and to complaine to the
Church of their obstinacie, or to forgive them private of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
done against us to seventie times seven times, which
is against the course of the Text. 3. By this glosse, little
Bairnes, which are not to be offended, are brethren, which
<hi>have power to binde and loose,</hi> and preach and baptize, which
is absurd. 4. It is cleare, by the Church here is meant a
Societie different from the faithfull and brethren, that hee
speaketh of: for he will have the offended brother to rebuke
before two or three brethren in private, and if the offender


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98601:22"/>

for so he saith in that same place, Then Christ biddeth tell

5. Neither doth the hearing of prayers prove a ministeriall
Church, seeing God heareth the prayers of one believer in
the Prison, or the Whales belly: but it is the doctrine of
these, with whom we now reason, that six, professing Christ,
being visible Saints (who may be unseene Divels in heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and so neither Brethren, Disciples, nor little ones) are an
independent visible Church, having power to binde and
loose: and therefore suppose Christ spake here, to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and believers, of the Churches power in excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is a weake collection, that therefore all Disciples
have power to binde and loose: And these words, verse 18.
<hi>Whatsoever ye bind on earth, &amp;c.</hi> must be meant only of the
Apostles, and of the Church, verse 18. yea, and it must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>Peter</hi> and his offending brother, suppose they were
both believers, because parties, by the Law of nature and
Nations, cannot be Judges. But some say that these words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>(What ye shall binde on earth shall be bound in heaven) have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

Therefore private brethren may binde and loose. Answer,</hi>
No private brother can binde on earth, for then one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might excommunicate, for these words, <hi>Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ye bind on earth, &amp;c</hi> is a ratifying in heaven, of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of excommunication, verse 17. 2. Binding in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
must be a not forgiving of private wrongs, which is a
sinfull binding, and forbidden, verse 22. and <hi>Matthew,</hi> 6. 14,

            <p>THe determination of this question, so neare of blood
and kindred to the former two, is of much force to
cleare many doubts in this subject. Hence I propound these
following distinctions, as very considerable.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Church independent is twofold, either a Church of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in a congregation, having originally the power of the
keyes within themselves, to make or unmake their officers.</item>
               <item>2. Or an Eldership of one congregation, including the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
that may from an intrinsecall power, without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to Synods provinciall or nationall, exercise all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
This question is of the former independent Church.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98601:24"/>
2. A Church is considered two wayes, 1. As <hi>totum essentiale,</hi>
this is a mysticall Church, consisting of only b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lievers, or of
persons, as professing faith, a Church of faithfull, of Saints.</item>
               <item>2. The Church is considered as <hi>totum integrale,</hi> made up of
officers, and a flock, this <hi>Ames.</hi> cals an instituted Church,
others a Ministeriall Church, as we consider <hi>John,</hi> as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
or <hi>John,</hi> as an Elder, or minister of a Church.</item>
               <item>3. There is a twofold Primacie answerable, to this,<note place="margin">Primit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a number of believers is the first mysticall body of Christ,
immediately united to Christ, as a mysticall body to the

so) firstnesse or principality.<note place="margin">

               </item>
               <item>2. There is an other primacy or principalitie ministeriall, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
such a number of men are the first subject of the keyes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
power of binding and loosing, first and immediately from
Christ, as is proved, Ch. 1. 4.</item>
               <item>3. Christ hath a twofold influence, as head upon these two bodies,
one influence of speciall and saving grace upon the Church of
believers; An other common influence, communicating to the
ministeriall body the power of the keyes and gifts which hee
gave to men,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11. 12.</note> to be Pastours, and Teachers, and Elders, when
he ascended on high, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they looke right on this question, who will have the power of
the keyes an essentiall propertie of the Church of believers,
for there is no reciprocation here, betwixt the propertie and
the subject; seeing the power of the keyes is in many that are
unbelievers, and not of Christs mysticall body. Many war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
preach Christ to others, and seale the covenant to
others, who are unsaved men: remember the builders of the
Arke: and many are Christs mysticall body, that have not the
power of the keyes: All believers are not Eld<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </list>
            <p>Hence our 1. <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> If wee speake of a Christian
primacie and eminency of grace,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 24.</note> the Church of believers
sincerely professing the faith and believing is the only first
true visible Church.<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> 1. The essence and definition of a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and effectually translated company agreeth to them,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 25.</note> and
they are <hi>the called of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 5.</note> 2.<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> Because the promises made


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98601:25"/>
to the redeemed, saved and washen Church belongeth to
them; they are properly the Church builded on the rock, the
loved and redeemed spouse of Christ. 2. This Church is
the true body of Christ,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 22.</note> which shall infallibly bee glorified
with the head Christ.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> The ministeriall Church is his body
also, on which hee hath an influence bestowing upon them
common gifts: but not a body which shall infallibly be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
but in so far as they are true members of the Church
of believers. And here observe, our brethren have no cause
to object to us, that there is not a place in all the old or new
Testament, where the word <hi>(Church)</hi> signifieth only the
presbyterie or Eldership (the contrary whereof, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
I shall shew) but I desire that they will produce a
place in either the old or new Testament, where the word
Church signifieth a governing multitude, or a ministeriall
company of onely believers having power and use of the
keyes: yet this must be shewed in this dispute, if their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
stand good.</p>
            <p>11. Conclusion. <hi>A multitude of believers sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
the faith, is the first visible mysticall Church, because
the definition of a visible mysticall Church agreeth to them,
being redeemed professors of the Gospell. So the saints at</hi>
Colosse, Corinth, Philippi, <hi>as not including their guides, is a
true uisible Church. Before I come to the third conclusion,
I must shew what our brethren hold anent this present que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi>

believers cloathed with no ecclesiasticall office may ordaine
Pastours, and Elders, deprive and excommunicate them.
5. Give ordinances and lawes to the Eldership. 6. When
Synods or assemblies of office-bearers are met in assemblies,
and cannot agree in their canons, the matter is to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by appeale or reference to a company of believers cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with no ecclesiasticall function, as to the most supreme
ecclesiasticall judicatorie on earth. These are points unknown

            <p>Hence out third <hi>conclusion.</hi> The Church of believers in
eminence and primacie of Christian dignitie is above the
Church ministeriall as ministeriall, 1. In <hi>dignitie. 2. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.
3. Causalitie. Indignitie.</hi> 1. Because the Church
of believers is the redeemed and conquested purchase of our
Lord Jesus, but all the office-bearers, or the ministeriall
Churches of Pastours and Elders on earth, are not his redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ones, in so far as they are no more but officers and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

of the house, except they be believers, and so they fall
in to the redeemed Church which is a better world, than to
be naked pulpit-men. 2. In stabilitie, because the advocation
of Christ <hi>that the gates of hell shall not prevaile against the
Church of believers,</hi> and the promises of the Covenant for
perseverance standeth good for them: But no such promises
of stabilitie are made to naked Church guides, but if they
guide well, they fare the better; only common gifts are
promised to them which cannot take them to heaven. 3. In
causalitie, the Church of believers are superiour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Church of Church-guides, because Rulers and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
are servants and meanes imployed by Christ for the

the Church guides in Christian dignitie and excellency of
grace: for asmuch as the saving grace of faith is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
than the common graces of the power of the keyes, yet in
an other respect the Church guides are a Church ministeriall in
authoritie and jurisdiction above the believers. Therefore <hi>Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
saith, the Pastour and the flock are in divers relations, above,
and inferiour to one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence,</hi> 1. Every one of these two Churches, are first and
highest each in their owne kind, The Church of believers is
the highest and most supreme Church (I speake of a Christian
supremacie and dignitie) in the one kinde. Also a ministeriall
Church is the highest and most supreme Church in its kind, to
wit, in a ministeriall authoritie. But that which we prove is,
that we see not in Gods word a Church of sole believers that is
a governing and ministeriall Church having the keyes and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and exercise of jurisdiction over the Eldership and
Church-guides whatever our brethren say on the contrary.</p>
            <p>Our first Argument is,<note place="margin">1 Argument.</note> Because such a Church, in name or
thing is not in the old and new Testament. Therefore this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Church to us is nothing, for the Antecedent we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
precept, promise, or practice, for such a Church.</p>
            <p>2. We have proved that the power of the keyes is no wayes
given to sole believers,<note place="margin">2 Argument.</note> 
               <hi>ergo,</hi> farre lesse can the exercise of that
power be in them over their guides, except we establish a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
government, where all the members of the Church have
the power of the keyes and doe actively use them, and judge,
ordaine, consttuite, despose, and excommunicate their rulers.</p>
            <p>3. Every lawfull power of jurisdiction is regulated by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
in Gods word,<note place="margin">3 Argument.</note> But this power in believers over their
guides is not so regulated, for Gods word giveth precepts to
regulate the Kings power to his subjects,<note place="margin">Deut. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8 19. 20.</note> that he play not the

rule over the people and the believers, watching for their soules,
and must give an account to God therefore, Heb.</hi> 13. 17. 18. Then
have the Elders by divine right a jurisdiction over the Lords
people in the Lord, and so the Elders in authoritie and jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
are above the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so by no reason can the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be over their overseers in the Lord, and command, watch,
take care for their soules. They say divers wayes one may bee
both a Sheepheard and a Sheep, the King as King is above the
Pastour, and the Pastour being a man owes subjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the King. Againe, as the King is a member of the
Church, he is to heare and obey the pastor as <hi>the messenger of
Lord of losts,</hi> according to that <hi>(he that heareth you, heareth
me)</hi> and so may it be here. But I answer. The case is no way
like; for our brethren make the pastours and the flock to bee
over one another, and subject one to another, with one and the
same kinde of subjection. I grant <hi>Archippus</hi> is over the <hi>Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
to command them in the Lord, but the <hi>Colossians</hi> are not
in the same power of jurisdiction over <hi>Archippus,</hi> they may
only admonish him to fulfill his Ministerie, but they have no
authoritative power of jurisdiction to command, to deprive,
to excommunicate: but by this learning, ten Elders with the
consent of ten believers may excommunicate ten believers,
and these same ten believers may excommunicate these ten
Elders, and his ten believers, for there is an independent
Church of believers on both sides: hence sonnes and servants


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98601:27"/>
may excommunicate those that are over them in the Lord, and
watch for their soules.</p>
            <p>5. That ever in a constitute Church, except where God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

our brethren) to <hi>the Church builded upon the rock,</hi> but this was
the Church of believers, not the Church of Ministers: Hence
have we cause to doubt, whether our brethren acknowledge a

two prime places faile them, whereas Fathers, Doctors, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
our Divines Protestants and Lutherans, popish Writers,
Schoolemen, Canonists, casuists, acknowledge the keyes to bee
given to the Apostles in these places: This doctrine will finde

Christians be on the contrary side. But the Elders with them
being but three or foure believers gathered together in Christs

Answ.</hi> We deny not, but the guides as guides are inferiour to


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98601:28"/>
believers, inferiour in Christian dignitie and eminency, and
this in as far as the guides are believers; for one believer is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to ten believers, because a part of a Church of believers
is inferiour to the whole: but hence is not proved, that the
guides every way that are in authoritie and jurisdiction are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to believers. The eye as a part is inferiour to the whole
body, but as indued with the excellent facultie of seeing is not
inferiour to the whole body. 2. Rulers as Rulers are not parts,
nor members of a Congregation consisting only of believers,
for in so far as they are Rulers, they are members of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
Church, and so they are inferiour in dignitie and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to the whole. The Pope is a part and a base part of the
ministeriall Church, but it followeth not hence, that the body
or communitie of believers may censure him: neither may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
whole, or every body exercise jurisdiction over the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
for then every familie of believers might excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the master of the family, ten believers might excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
five. Every body that hath authoritie, and is a free incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
within it selfe may censure every member, but as a
company of believers cannot ordaine, so neither can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
or excommunicate a Minister.</p>

               <hi>but Church guides are meanes ordained of Christ for

the woman to be subject to the man, because the woman is for the

have majoritie of jurisdiction above the overseers, or that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseers
borrow the power of the keyes from the believers as
from the first subject. The woman is inferiour in dignitie to

Christ the mediator is for the Churches salvation as for

<hi>Bergensis</hi> in the councell of <hi>Basill,</hi> So <hi>Whittaker, proveth the

Church of sole believers is not the Spouse and mother of the
Church guides, but the ministeriall Church of Pastours and
elders <hi>is Queene Mother,</hi> that begetteth the sonnes of <hi>Zion</hi> to

it is from the Fathers and Pastours,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note> that beget children to
God; Other wayes one private Christian that is a meanes of
begeating a pastour to the faith of Christ hath power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction

when Divines subject the Pope to a generall Councell, they
make him with good reason inferiour to a ministeriall Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Parker</hi> reasoneth thus. <hi>If Christ communicate a

the Church of believers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Whittaker.</note> 
               <hi>than to the overseers. Then the most

                  </gap>joritie of power,
there is majoritie of assistance of the Holy Spirit ruling the
Church; many eyes see more than one. (I will be with you to the

against the Pope. Greater is the Temple than the gold that
sanctifieth the Temple, the altar than the sacrifice. The faithfull
cannot fall away, the guides, except they be believers may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
neither is there a promise of salvation, remission of sinnes
made to the guides, which is made to the Church of believers. Ans.</hi>
If the wayes of Christs presence with the believer, and with

some thing, but they are of divers kindes. Therefore I deny
this <hi>(Where Christ is more immediately present, there is the more

ministerie than another, but the difference there is in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and manner of working, not in the essence and nature of
the keyes, as we say a man of thirty yeares is more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of stature and a bigger man than a child of foure years old,
but a man of thirty yeares is not more essentially a reasonable
creature than a child of foure yeares old, for the nature of
man is alike essentially in both. The goodnesse of God and his
good pleasure is the cause why God giveth the power of
the keyes to some persons and not to othersome, the grace
and holinesse of a man is not the cause. It is dangerous to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre
that the power of the keyes is more or lesse in persons,
according as they are more or lesse sanctified and graced of
God, for then <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> hath more power of the
keyes, and hath more ecclesiastick authoritie than <hi>Iudas,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
unbelieving Pastour duely called of Christ, and his Church.
And therefore it is a sickly consequence to reason from the
excellencie of the promises of grace and the measure of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the power of the keyes, or the measure of the power
of the keyes. Our Divines reason well from a greater majoritie
of grace and light pastorall, or of gifts pastorall or ecclesiastick
to inferre the majoritie of power of jurisdiction, and of this
speaketh <hi>Whittaker</hi> and our Divines, There is a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Spirit of prophecy and of grace ministeriall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to the whole representative Church of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
in a Councell Occumenick, than to one man, the <hi>Pope,</hi>
or to a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and they give, but doe not grant that the <hi>Pope</hi>
is a <hi>Prophet,</hi> when they hold him to be a thiefe or a robber.
Hence they prove well the <hi>Pope</hi> to be inferiour in power of
jurisdiction to a generall councell of Pastours and Elders. 2. It


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98601:30"/>
is utterly false that they say, <hi>where there is more stabilitie of
grace and holinesse, there is more authoritie and ecclesiastical
power,</hi> When both the subjects are not capable of ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
power, now the subjects are so here, the Eldership is a
subject capable of the keyes, but the communitie of believers
that are private Christians, and no more, are not capable of this
power, and they beg the question who reason with us in this
argument. It is soule reasoning to say, <hi>the snow is whiter than a
Raven,</hi> because there is more of cold qualities elementarie in
the snow, nor in the Raven because the Raven is not white at
all.<note place="margin">

are not capable of the keyes remaining only believers,

they want both power of order and jurisdiction, except
they be called Pastours and Elders, but then they are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

their power as members of the congregation is chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
popular, private, not authoritative, not a power of the
keyes. Grace true and saving addeth a faire lustre to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the keyes, and doth graciously qualifie and adorn that
power, but where there is no power of the keyes in simple
believers it cannot adorne it: to please and embrouder a

            <p>Answ. If the power bee abused wholly, it ceaseth and
the Pastor before God, <hi>in foro interno,</hi> hath losed his power;
If it bee abused in one or two acts, it is not losed, else a King
doing against judgment and justice, and a Pastor doing against

to affirm. 2. The power authoritative, is given by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery

thinke the Eldership should not excommunicate. 2. But
what if the contagion of the not excommunicated lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the whole lump? I see not how believers have
a negative consent. 3. If the matter be a point of
necessary truth to be determined, and the Pastours and
Elders in the Lord and from his Word command it
as a necessary truth to be obeyed, but the Beleevers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
not, I aske whither or not that which Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
command from Gods Word and authoritatively
and judicially in his name, ought not to stand as an
obliging Mandat and Canon, even when the Beleevers
gain-say? Our Bretheren say, <hi>the Mandat tyeth and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
materially and in it selfe, but not ecclesiastically, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
beleevers doe not consent, it hath not the force of a
Canon, seeing they have the keyes. Ans.</hi> But this Canon
<hi>(Arrianisme is Heresie)</hi> we suppose is all one both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
and Ecclesiastically, according to that <hi>(Hee
that heareth you, heareth me)</hi> and so it tyeth being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by Pastours with others Synodically convee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Shall it oblige the one way Ecclesiastically be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preached, and not the other way being Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
determined, because the people consenteth not?
Certainly if power of preaching be a power of the
keyes, all that are silent to that which is preached give
a consent to what is preached, for silence at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of a vow, when it is lawfull to speake is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<hi>Numb. 30. ver.</hi> 14. Now it is lawfull to any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Congregation, to speake against what is
unfound in Doctrine publickly delivered, so it be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
timously: Hence it must follow that what tyeth
and obligeth as an act of the keyes in preaching, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
also when determined by the Eldership, suppose
all the Congregation doe not judge and determine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially:
I may say that by our Bretherens grounds,
preaching is a publick Ecclesiastick act of the keyes,


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98601:34"/>
and of the whole Church, for the Church preacheth
by her Pastour, as by her mouth and servant receiving
authority, and the keyes to preach from the Church.
Therfore all must give their consent to what is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
els it is not the Word of God or to be judged
and reputed to tye us to faith and obedience, no lesse
then publick acts of the Church, and this were strange,

            <p>
               <hi>THe tenent</hi> of these, with whom we now dispute is
that all the power of the keyes is given by Christ
to the multitude of Believers, as to the first fountaine,
and that this power is derived and gested by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multitude

used and exercised by them, as the servants both of
Christ and the Church: For the clearing of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion

distinctions are to be observed.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The power of the keyes may be thought to come to
the Ministers of the Church three waies, as shall be
cleared, 1. By mediate derivation, the Church recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this power from Christ, and deriving it over to
the friends of the Bridegroome. 2. By immediate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
God immediately giveth the honour of the
keyes to these whom he maketh his Courtyers in this
kinde. 3. By application, the Church only naming
the men to the office.</item>
               <item>2. The power of the keyes, and all sacred offices in Gods
House, are from the immediate wisdome of Christ;
The designation of such men to such offices is by the
ministery of the Church.</item>
               <item>3. The power of the keyes is one thing, the lawfull exercise
of the keyes is another thing.</item>
               <item>4. The Ministers may be thought the servants either of the
Church, or servants of Christ for the Church.</item>
               <item>5. Designation of men by the Church to sacred offices may
be thought either in the Churches free-will, or tyed to the
lawes designed by Christ.</item>

made quate or narrower, as one Pastor and some


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98601:37"/>
ruling Elders of a Congregation: And these have not
the power of all the keyes, as of ordination of Pastors,
and so of deposition; seeing in the Apostolike Church
there were alwayes a number of Pastors at the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Pastors, onely they may performe some acts
of discipline that concerneth that flocke. The adequate
and proper subject of full power of the keyes is the
presbytery of Pastors and Elders, as we shall prove here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> The power of the keyes indirectly
commeth from the Church of beleevers to some select
officers, I say <hi>(indirectly)</hi> not directly, because how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
beleevers by no innate and intrinsicall power of
jurisdiction in them, doe ordaine officers; yet they
are to give a popular consent to the election of their
officers, as the word of God, all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>athers and our
Divines teach against Papists and Prelates, who take
away this power from the people of God. Now by
this popular election men are put in that state, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they may be and are ordained office-bearers by the
laying on of the hands of the Elders. And this our
brethrens arguments prove and no more. Hence the
power of the keyes commeth to the officers three
wayes, whereof we deny one. 1. As if the Church of
beleevers received the keyes first from Christ, then by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from Christ did give over the use of them in
some acts to the officers, and did appoint them her
servants. That this is not according to the Scriptures
of God, I hope by gods grace to prove. 2. The power
of the keyes and all power of jurisdiction and order
is first in Christ, then immediately communicated to
the Apostles and their successors in them, and here the
offices and power is of Christ Jesus onely.<note place="margin">Almain de Dom. natur &amp; civil. &amp; Eccl Concil. 2 par. 1 M. Ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>4. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> The essence and definition of a Church
doth not <hi>ex aequo,</hi> equally, and alike agree to the
Church of beleevers and Ministers, or office-bearers,
or to a company of a visible Church, made up of these
two parts, beleevers and officers, as our brethren speak
of their visible Church. My reason is cleare, Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are essentially and properly the mysticall body of
Christ, and the Church of <hi>redeemed ones, Eph. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25.
Act.</hi> 20. 28. And <hi>the Church builded on a rocke,</hi> which
they say received the keyes from Christ (which I dare
not say) but the Church of officers, that are only officers
and no more, that is called of God and his Church,
and cloathed with a calling to be Pastors and Doctors,
Elders, Deacons, are not the redeemed of God; but
may often be, and are reprobates, and not members of
Christs true body according to the influence of saving
grace, Now from this I inferre, that beleevers and
office-bearers make not one common and true mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
body that hath received equally the keyes from
Christ, and that these predications are unproper and
figurative, and that literally and in rigor of the letter
they are false. <hi>(Sion bringeth good tydings (the Church
giveth sucke and milke to her children) (the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
a man childe)</hi> because the Pastors of the Church
doe these things: For there is no effective influence
or causality comming from the Church of beleevers in
these and the like Pastorall actions, except that they
pray for these fruits of a Ministery, they chuse the
men for the worke, but doe not ordaine them: But
we cannot say that the Church doth formally preach
and beget children to God in and through preachers,
as their servants, as a King speaketh such a businesse by
his Legat and Embassador; and our King doth governe
and reigne in <hi>Ireland</hi> by his Deputy: Here the Kings


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98601:38"/>
authority hath influence in the acts of his Deputy, and
Legat: For where will Scripture beare this <hi>(The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers

how I say, will the holy Spirits stile of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
make these in rigor true? but according to our
brethrens tenents they are most true.<note place="margin">

against <hi>Edwards</hi> saith, <hi>pag. 10, 11. When the hand laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the foot, it cannot be said properly the action of the
hand alone, because the hand is set on worke by the body,
if the body be destitute of the power, for the motion of the
body commeth not from the hand, but the motion of the
hand from the body. So this Argument would say, The
Pastor preacheth as the mouth of the Church, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
is an act of the whole Church performed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
as their servant or mouth; And so the power of
preaching must be first in the Church, and not first in the
Pastors, as motion is first in the body, and not first in the
hand.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The comparison holdeth not, The Pastor is
Gods mouth, <hi>Jer. 15. 19. Luk.</hi> 1. 70. But Pastors are
not the mouth of the Church, and the motion is here
from Christ principally, from the Pastor as the mouth
instrumentally, from the Church objectively and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the comparison of the body naturall halteth in
this.</p>

               <hi>It may be objected,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 5. We preach not our

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Ministers may be thought the Churches ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
two wayes, 1. <hi>Subiectively,</hi> as if they had their

but it is principally and originally from the whole
man, for the whole man seeth by the eye. The authority of
the Church is as the soule in the whole body (as <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
saith) and in every member of the body:<note place="margin">Bridges. <hi>l. 3. p <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>32.</hi>
               </note> Howbeit
it doth not exercise the power in every member, but it seeth
by the eye, and heareth by the eare, so the power of the
keyes is in all, and every one of the faithfull, but it exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
some Acts ministeriall, as preaching, baptizing in
the guides, and other are Acts in other members of the
body, but the power is in all.</p>
            <p>But I answer, That this comparison halteth many
wayes.</p>
            <p>1. The body is a physicall, organicall matter capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the soule, and a kindly or naturall house or shop
for the soule to worke in, and every member may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
some vitall operation by the soules inacting of
it, as hearing, smelling, seeing, moving, growing, &amp;c.


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98601:39"/>
But the Church consisting of beleevers and Ministers,
that are often opposed by way of contradiction, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
and non beleevers, and a beleever that is no
more but a beleever, is not capable of the power of
the keyes, it being <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> a freely given gift
of God, except the Lord be pleased freely to give it
by some Law or promise; And so these that are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleevers, are as the woodden leg, or the eye of
glasse in the body wanting all authoritative power of
the ministery where God hath not gifted and called
them, now every member of the body is inacted by the
soule.</p>
            <p>2. If this comparison hold well, as every member
of the body liveth, and is denominated a living thing
(howbeit every member be not an eye, or an eare)
by the information of the soule: so every toe and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
liveth by the inacting of the soule, <hi>actu primo,</hi> and
moveth and groweth <hi>actu secundo:</hi> so must every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
in the body of Christ, Man and woman be
<hi>actu primo,</hi> and essentially a ministeriall part and office-bearer
having authority from Christ, and also <hi>actu se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundo,</hi>
exercise some ministeriall acts; for such as is
the nature of the act, such is the nature of the power,
and such as is the power, such is the act. If the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
be ministeriall, so is the act: If the act be not
ministeriall (as it cannot be in these onely that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
especially women and children) so neither is the
power.</p>
            <p>3. The whole man seeth by the eye, heareth by the
eare,<note place="margin">3. Arg.</note> but the beleevers see by their owne eyes (as they
must live by their owne faith) and not with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
eyes, neither doe they grow by that soule of grace
by which the Pastor groweth.</p>
            <p>3. The Beleevers must either be the virtuall, or the
formall subject of the keyes, They are not the virtuall
subject or cause, as flint is a cause of fire; for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
say that the beleevers formally performe acts of
the keyes, and that they rebuke, they excommunicate,


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98601:39"/>
they chuse their officers, which is an authoritative
act of the keyes, as they teach. Now a virtuall cause
is not formally the cause of the effect; as fire is the
cause of fire, and doth not formally performe acts of
the formall cause; food doth not formally make mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the body, but onely virtually. But they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to acknowledge that beleevers are the formall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the keyes: It is absurd that one should essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,
and <hi>actu primo,</hi> have the power of the keyes,
and yet he may not preach, nor baptize, that is, as if
one had a reasonable soule, and yet could neither discourse
nor move, nor walke.</p>
            <p>4. The power of the keyes is either in the officers as
officers,<note place="margin">4. Arg.</note> or onely as beleevers; if as officers, then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
borrow the keyes from beleevers, seeing they have
them as officers, suppose they be not beleevers, and
that is against the meaning of this distinction; if they
have the power of the keyes onely as beleevers, then
all Ministers that are non-beleevers want the
keyes.</p>
            <p>5. Office-bearers have either a nearer and more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall
power of the keyes then beleevers,<note place="margin">5. Arg.</note> or onely
that same ministeriall power; if the former be said,
the ministery is but a naked act, that some exercise
at the Churches direction sometimes, and no habituall
power whereby <hi>Paul</hi> is made a Minister, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 25.
and <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> is denominated a faithfull messenger,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 25. for so one shall not be a Minister of Christ;
but when he is in the act of his ministery, against Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and reason. If office-bearers have onely that same
ministeriall power that beleevers have, Then Ministers
cannot ordaine others to be Ministers, except they be
beleevers, and a Minister shall not preach from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
principle, proper to a Minister; but from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
common to him with other beleevers, which
maketh no di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ference betwixt a beleever and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
but in the naked acts; And this is all one, as to
say a man doth walke naked, and yet he is void of life; he


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98601:40"/>
preacheth, and hath no other inward power ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
then any beleeving woman or childe hath.</p>
            <p>6. If the power of the keyes be originally in the
Church of Beleevers,<note place="margin">6. Arg.</note> and the exercise only in officers,
then Pastors in rigor of speech are the Churches ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and so not over them in the Lord. 2. Pastors
are sent by the Church from the inherent and innate
power of the Church, as if the Church had a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and authority over the Pastors, hence will it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that Pastors have their authority from Beleevers,
which is most absurd: For then if Beleevers should
receive the keyes immediately from Christ to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to others, and applyed to men fit and able
therefore, this application is not a making of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or a reason why <hi>Archippus</hi> is a Minister, as the
reason why a fire burneth a dry tree, is not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the tree to the fire, but the nature of the
fire, and drinesse of the timber: If one should bring
out from amongst ten glasses one, and hold it out to
the Sunnes light and beames, this refulgent beauty and
glancing is not from the man that bringeth the glasse
before the Sunne, except occasionally, the glancing
splendor is from the nature of the glasse, and the Suns
light: And the man applyeth not the light of the
Sunne to the glasse, but bringeth out the glasse to the
light of the Sunne: So doe Beleevers but apply the
fit person in their wise election to Gods office, and
they apply not the office to the man, for it is presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
they are tyed to the rules, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. requiring
such a man, <hi>as is of good report, apt to teach,</hi> &amp;c. and
the application is not in the free-will of people or
Pastors, neither hath God left it to Beleevers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

government of the Church to partake of all the three
governments. In respect of Christ the only supreame
King it is an <hi>absolute Monarchy;</hi> but this is the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
government for the most part in respect of the
rulers as Pastors and Elders, it is an <hi>Aristocracie,</hi> the
visible government being in the hands of the Elders,
and in respect of some things that concerneth the whole
members of the visible Church, it is a <hi>Democracie,</hi> or hath
some popular government in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98601:41"/>
We are now to enquire, if the government of the
visible Church be in the collective body of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
as indeed by consequent they teach with
whom we now dispute, or in the Eldership; in Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Synods provinciall and nationall, as it is now
in <hi>Scotland.</hi> We hold that the government popular,
as it is properly taken, when the collective body jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
and governeth to be expresly against the word of
God, <hi>Eph. 4. 11. He gave some (not all) to be Apostles,</hi>
&amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28. And God hath set some in the Church,
first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly teachers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that miracles,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 12. Now we beseech you
brethren, to know them that labour amongst you, and are
over you in the Lord, Heb. 13. 17. Obey them that have
the rule over you, and submit your selves,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim. 5.
17. Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
honour.</hi> Hence it is cleare as the noone-sunne, if
there be some over the people of God, some that are
Elders <hi>that rule well,</hi> some to whom the <hi>people should
submit,</hi> and give obedience, then the whole people are
not rulers, all have not the rod, nor a definitive voice
in that highest censure of excommunication. <hi>All are not
overseers, guides, governours, fathers, stewards, shepheards;</hi>
but some are governed, subject, sons, the flocke ruled,
and fed, then doth not the people governe.</p>
            <p>2. The keyes were only given to the Elders,<note place="margin">2. Arg.</note> as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

<hi>Titus</hi> should behave themselves in Gods house, in the
Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> but no where doth
God give directions how all beleevers should rule,
command and governe, neither hath he promised that

the Spouse and Body of Christ, <hi>Kings and Priests un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God,</hi> and have a like title and interest in him, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Keyes are immediately communicated to
them without the mediation of Rulers interveening:
Hence I inferre, if all have alike right to the keys for
their alike title by Faith, and right of free redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Christ, <hi>ergo,</hi> all are alike Rulers over all in the
Lord: then because believers as believers have a title
and interest in Christ as their redeemer, and office-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
because office bearers have no title in Christ as
Redeemer (for no office giveth a man a claime to
Christ, as a redeemer, but only some generall title
to him as Lord of the house) Hence it shall follow
that the believers are Over-seers and Rulers and Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
and that they should order and moderate all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
actions: So I see no authority or preheminency
given to the Church-guides, but that which is due,


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98601:43"/>
and more due to the believers then to them. As for
<hi>reprooving, convincing, exhorting,</hi> these are common to
all the faithfull, as our Brethren say, and so due to
them by virtue of the keys, and more due then to
office-bearers, who do but borrow the keyes at the
second hand (as they teach) and receive them not
immediately from Christ. Now we all know that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists</hi>

            <p>OVr Brethren hold that the only true publick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

of Believers joyned together by a voluntary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith, and meeting in one place to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

doth ever signifie a Presbytery or Eldership. 2. They
deny that there is any representative <hi>Church,</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so called, or that it hath the title of a <hi>Church</hi> in the

then every Christian Family should be a visible
politick Church, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> offended, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking
his offending brother, before three witnesses,
and gaining his brother to repentance, <hi>v.</hi> 16. is a number
of believers in that same act professing the truth, and
convincing an offender, and so professing Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and yet they are not the judging governing Church,
because if the offender will not heare <hi>Peter,</hi> then he
is to <hi>tell the Church.</hi> Hence visibility of Profession a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
both to a number of believers (if for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ten out of ten particular Congregations confesse


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98601:45"/>
Christ before a persecuting Judge) and also to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
Church of Believers and Elders. Then true
Faith and the visible professing of true Faith is not
enough to constitute a Church that ordinarily hath
power and exercise of the keyes; neither find we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
warrant in Gods Word, that the swearing of an
oath, or making a covenant, by four or five or 10. or
40. believers to worship God together as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in his word doth essentially constitute a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ministeriall Church, 1. Because a ministeriall Church
is a body of Pastor and People, of <hi>eyes, eares, hands,
feet,</hi> wherof Christ is head, <hi>Rom. 12. 4. 1 Cor. 12. v.</hi>
14, 15, &amp;c. but a number of sole and only believers are
not such a body. 2. More is there required an oath and
covenant, but this is and may be where there is no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> We deny that Christ hath given pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of jurisdiction to one particular Church over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particular Church, or to one Church to be a
mother Church to give laws and orders,<note place="margin">Baynes. Dioces. tryall. <hi>q</hi> 1.</note> to little daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-churches

            <p>3. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> A Church may be a visible incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of guides and people meeting for the worship
of God, and exercise of discipline, and yet not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
a Church of believers, for if there be twenty or
thirty visible Saints, who are Saints in profession, they
may meet for the worship of God, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by our Brethrers grounds, independently and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any subordination to Synods or classes exercise
discipline. I proove that they are not necessarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
1. Because to make one or two formall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a visible Church is not required that they be
indeed believers, it sufficeth that they professe Faith,
and be apparantly Saints; and our Brethren teach
they may be Hypocrites, and often are, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was
amongst the <hi>Apostles,</hi> now by that same reason all


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98601:45"/>
the thretty may be heart-hypocrites, and face-professors,
for who seeth the heart? And our Brethren say the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word, and the administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
are not essentiall notes and markes of the
Church, because the word is often preached to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and unbeleevers, and by that same reason the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the keyes and discipline is exercised by hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
and unbeleevers.<note place="margin">Ames. Medul. Theol. <hi>l. 1. c. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> n.</hi> 10</note> 2. <hi>Amesius</hi> saith <hi>it is probable</hi> (he
saith not it is necessary) <hi>where the Word and Sacraments
are that there are some beleevers:</hi> And I say it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
but that at all times there should be beleevers,
especially when it is first founded, it is not necessary.
I say when it is first founded; because we cannot say
it is possible that there should be never any beleevers
there at all; for the Lord sendeth not a ministery to
these where there are none chosen at all; it doth crosse
the wisedome of God, who doth nothing in vaine,
that he should light a candle where he had no lossed
money; and the Shepheard should be sent through
the fields, where there were no lossed sheep at all.
Hence I inferre these consectaries. 1. that the claime
and title that a people hath to Christ is not the ground
why the keyes are given to that people, as to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
subject, because they may have the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
and keyes a long time, and yet want faith
in Christ, and so all title and claime to Christ: All
which time they have the keyes, discipline, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
and I beleeve their acts of discipline, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and Sacraments, are valide, therefore the Church
redeemed and builded on the rocke Christ, is not the
kindly subject of the keyes. 2. The keyes are given
to professors cloathed with a ministeriall calling, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be beleevers or unbeleevers, howbeit God
giveth them for the salvation and edification of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
3. There is nothing required to make a independant
Congregation, but an profession of the truth, covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
and outward worshipping of God, suppose the
members be unbeleevers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:98601:46"/>
4. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> There is a visible governing Church
in the new Testament, whose members in compleat
number of beleevers doth not meet in one place ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
for the worship of God, neither can they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
so meet. 1. The Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was
one Church, under one government, and called one
Church in the singular number, which grew from one
hundred and twenty, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. to three thousand one
hundred and twenty, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 41. and then added to
these, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 4. five thousand men, which is eight
thousand one hundred and twenty. And <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 35. all
that dwelt at <hi>Lydda</hi> and <hi>Saron turned to the Lord,</hi> v. 42.
<hi>many in Joppa beleeved in the Lord,</hi> Acts 20. 21. <hi>many
thousands of the Jewes beleeved,</hi> Acts 5. 14. <hi>multitudes
of beleevers moe were added to the Lord, both of men and
women,</hi> Acts 6. 1. their number were multiplyed. Now
it was not possible they could all meet in one
house, especially seeing that prophecye was to take
its first accomplishment at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 405.</note> where all <hi>flesh
was to see the salvation of God.</hi> And that of <hi>Joel</hi> 2.

<hi>this Church was numerous by accident, at extraordinary
confluences of strangers.</hi> Yet the multitudes of thousands
which I have observed from the story of the <hi>Acts</hi>
(granting the confluence, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. of nations to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary)
<hi>did meet daily,</hi> Acts 2. 46. <hi>from house to
house.</hi> Now so many thousands could not meet daily,
that is, ordinarily. 2. <hi>From house to house in private
houses,</hi> and so it is not possible all that people did
make but one Congregation independent, where 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all
had voices in discipline. 2. all did breake bread, that
is, receive the Sacrament in a private house: so that
their meeting together must be taken <hi>distributively</hi> in
diverse Congregations, not <hi>collectively,</hi> for that were
against edification. 2. against the nature of congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
worship. 2. There was a visible Church in
<hi>Samaria</hi> under one government, that could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene
in all the members, in one place. The nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98601:46"/>
people in <hi>Samaria</hi> converted to the faith is knowne
to all, it being the head City of the ten Tribes: So
huge that all <hi>Israel</hi> was named <hi>Samaria,</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and as <hi>ver. 10. They all gave
heed to</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>from the least to the greatest.</hi> So
<hi>ver. 6. with one accord they gave heed unto these things
which</hi> Philip <hi>spake, hearing and seeing the miracles that
he wrought, ver. 12. they beleeved and were baptized both
men and women.</hi> And that on <hi>Philip</hi> might have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to one single Congregation, who doubteth? but
the number of beleevers were so many, that <hi>ver.</hi> 14.
the Apostles behooved to send <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to help
to hold up the harvest. 3. That the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
could not be one single Congregation that met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
is cleare. 1. There was there a Presbytery of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
or Bishops, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and these preaching or
feeding Pastors, who were to watch and take heed
to false teachers rising up amongst themselves. 1. tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
perverse things. 2. making Disciples to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
the teacher and scholler are <hi>relata,</hi> every one of
them has respect to other. 2. That they were teaching
Elders that did follow the Apostles doctrine is cleare,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. Thou hast tryed them that say they are Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and are not, and hast found them to be lyars,
and Christ termeth them one Church for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
government.<note place="margin">Refut. Tylen. Par. ad Scot. <hi>sect, 11 c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all the Congregation were one Presbyteriall
Church at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> But it is without example in the
word that one single Congregation with one Pastor
onely, and some ruling Elders doth try Ministers gifts,
and finding them false teachers, authoritatively to cast
them out, so that the harvest has been so great, that
false teachers calling themselves Apostles resorted to
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> to help the good number of Pastors who were
there already, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. By this it is cleare that
<hi>Ephesus</hi> had many Congregations in it, and many prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
also, who in a common society fed the flocke,


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98601:47"/>
and exercised discipline, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. neither can we say,
there was but one Angell there, except we make that
one a Prelate contrary to the word of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.
28. 2. The multitude of converts there required a
Presbytery, or a multitude of consociated Pastors, <hi>Acts
19. 20. Paul continued there by the space of two yeares,
so that all they who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord,</hi>
1 Cor. 16. 8. <hi>there was a great doore, and effectuall open
to him at</hi> Ephesus. 2. They were once madly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their great Idoll <hi>Diana,</hi> and had a Temple for
her that all <hi>Asia</hi> wondred at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore <hi>Ephesus</hi> was
no small Towne. This Temple <hi>Herostratus</hi> saith, was
built by all <hi>Asia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Herostratus.</note> and was two hundred and twenty
yeares in building, and had in it (as he saith) <hi>one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty seven pillars, every one of them made by
severall Kings, and every one of them sixty foot high.</hi> Now
ver. 19. <hi>Pauls miracles were knowne to all the Jewes and
Greeks at Ephesus, and feare fell on them all, and the
name of the Lord Jesus was magnified, and many of them
that beleeved, came and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</hi>
v. 19. <hi>And many that used curious arts brought their books,
and burnt them before all men.</hi> And what wonder? it
is said, ver. 20. <hi>so mightily grew the word of God. Paul
fought with beasts at Ephesus,</hi> millions here were mad
upon the Idoll <hi>Diana:</hi> If the beleevers had not been
the manyest, they durst not professe the burning of
their bookes, nor durst <hi>Paul</hi> stay there two yeers.
Hence if there was a setled Church here above two
yeares, a constituted Presbytery in this City, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.
17, 28. that had power of jurisdiction to ordaine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Elders, and reject hirelings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. and so
many thousands of <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Jewes,</hi> such an <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
doore opened</hi> to the Gospell, against so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
opposing, there was not here one onely single
independent Church, that met in one house only but
a Presbyteriall Church. Now they could not all preach
at one time to them, being a number of preachers,
<hi>Acts 20. 36. Paul prayed with them all,</hi> and yet they


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98601:47"/>
were set over that flocke by the Holy-Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi>
20. 28. therefore they had each their owne Church,
and one canot officiate or exercise Pastorall acts amongst
the flock of another Pastor, as our brethren would prove
from this same place, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>4. What, shall we say the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was
onely an independent single Congregation that met in
one place, or house, seeing the <hi>faith and obedience of the
Saints there, was heard through all the world,</hi> Rom. 1. 8.
Rom. 16. 19. so that <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his time saith, <hi>halfe
of the City was Christians.</hi> And <hi>Cornelius</hi> saith, beside
himselfe there was forty and five Presbyters. Consider

three waies.</p>
            <p>1 Properly, as if the Rulers stood in the persons
of believers, judging for them, as if the believers were
there themselves, as a deputy representeth the King:
So <hi>Israel</hi> did sweare a covenant, <hi>Deut:</hi> 9. 14, 15. for
their posterity not borne: this way the Eldership
doe not judge for the Congregations, as if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations

                  <hi>Robinson</hi> in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.</note> because the multitude of believers
should not judge at all, therfore Elders doe not in
governing represent their persons:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bannes.</hi> Tom. 3. in 22. quest. 1. art. 10, conclus. 3.</note> So <hi>Bannes</hi> said

leave</hi> (saith he) <hi>an apostolike spirit in legacy to some
successour:</hi> We acknowledge no representative church
in this sence, as the <hi>authour of presbyteriall government</hi>
examined unjustly imputeth to us.</p>
            <p>2 A representative Church may be thought a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
sent by a community, and elected to give laws,
absolutely tying, as if believers should say, <hi>We resigne
our faith and conscience to you, to held good whatever
you determine without repeale or tryall;</hi> that is blinde
faith, that we disclaime: all our Rulers acts in our
Assemblies do bind, 1 conditionally, if they be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and convenient, 2 matters to be enacted are first to
be referred to the congregations and Elderships of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
congregations before they be enacted.</p>
            <p>3 A representative Church is a number having electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and designation from the Church of believers, but
ordination from the Eldership to voice, determine
and command, as those who are over them in the
Lord, to make constitutions and decrees according to
Gods word, and this way we hold a representative
Church, <hi>Mat:</hi> 18. and 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5. which made acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods word, tying the whole congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

these Epistles; not onely because the matter is the
Canonicke word of God, but also the tye was Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,

were tyed to stand to the election of <hi>Matthias,</hi> the

act of the Church were valid, where one or two dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assenteth,
or where two or three are absent by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and other distractions insuperable: And so here
our brethren (I beleeve) cannot, in reason, deny but
there is a representative Church, whose deed tyeth
the absents. And the reason is cleare, that to make
a Church-constitution oblige in conscience, and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastically,
there is not required as an essentiall
ingredient of obligation, that all, and every one who
are tyed and obliged, be personally present, to voyce
and consent to the constitution; for constitutions
tye Ecclesiastically, as made by the Church, but not
as made by all, and every one of the Church. And
the lawfulnesse of Commissioners to represent the
case of the Church is cleare in Gods Word; as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch
sent Commissioners to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Acts 15. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
sent <hi>Barnabas</hi> their Messenger to <hi>Antioch,</hi>
11. 22. But <hi>Titus, Timotheus, Epaphroditus,</hi> and others

Commissioners, and Embassadours of the Church of
Christ.</p>

a way how to remove private offences done betwixt
brother and brother onely. 1. Because the words then
should not prove the lawfulnesse of excommunicating
for publike and scandalous sinnes. 2. The scope is as
large, as binding and loosing on earth, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
in heaven. But our Saviours ayme is, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
a Church consistory, for removing all scandals
and offences out of the Church, private and publike,
betwixt brother and brother, and betwixt Church and
Church. Neither is there ground for the foresaid scope,
because he saith <hi>(If thy brother offend)</hi> in the singular
number; for what if three, sixe, tenne brethren
offend, is not this course of our Saviours to be taken,


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98601:52"/>
if sixe offend sixe? Hence it followeth that the Church
here signifieth not onely the Eldership of a particular
Congregation, but it signifieth respectively all Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Synods, Provinciall, Nationall, and Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicke;
for seeing Excommunication and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
binding and loosing is Christs remedy, against

That the Church of Elders is here understood I
prove. Christ here alludeth to the Synedry and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory
of the Jewes, with which his hearers were
well acquainted; for he was now speaking to the
Jewes, who knew his language well, and knew these
termes. <hi>Brother, witnesses, Sunedry, Assembly, Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
Heathen, Publicane,</hi> and knew what Church
had power to cast out and repute men <hi>for Publicanes

questions about <hi>false prophets, the High-priest, and of

punishment of an offending brother amongst the

            <p>5. These to whom the essence and definition of a
Ministeriall Church having power to excommunicate
(as this Church hath that power, <hi>Mat. 18. 17.)</hi> doth
necessarily and essentially belong, these, and these only
are here understood under the name of the Church.
But so it is, that the essence and definition of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall
Church having power to excommunicate,
agreeth not necessarily and essentially to a company of
true beleevers assembled Church-wayes, <hi>ergo,</hi> by the
name of a Church here is no wayes understood the
Church of true beleevers assembled Church-wayes.
The proposition is undenyable, for out of the words
may be gathered a definition of a Ministeriall Church,
to wit, an Assembly that has power of preaching
and binding and loosing, and so of all Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
I prove the assumption, To have power to
preach, convene before them, and judicially cognosce
and sentence, and excommunicate a contumacious mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
doth agree to these that by no necessity are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
because to have power to preach and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
essentially require no more, but that persons
be, 1. professors of the truth. 2. that they be gifted
to preach and governe. 3. that they be duely called
thereunto by the Church, as <hi>Judas</hi> and others are;
but all these three are, and may be in a company in
whom is no saving faith, as the word and experience
cleare: For howbeit to be a called Pastor (the like I

Eph. 2. 20. <hi>builded on the rocke Christ.</hi> I deny
not but the word Church is very sparingly taken for
the overseers onely; yet it is taken in that sense, and
there is reason why it cannot bee otherwise taken
in this place; for <hi>Revelation. 2. The Angell of
the Church of Ephesus, Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. standeth for the
whole Church, and the whole Church is written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
under the name of the Angell of such a Church:
Which may be demonstrated thus, 1. because not only
the Ministers, but the people <hi>that have eares to heare,
are all and every</hi> one of them commanded to heare.
2, <hi>The promise of eating the tree of life,</hi> v. 7. <hi>of giving the
hidden Manna, and the white stone, and the new name,
and they shall be cloathed in white, and their names not
blotted out of the booke of life who overcommeth, agreeth
not to Ministers onely. 3. The</hi> command of being
<hi>faithfull to the death, of holding fast what they have, that
none take away their crowne, of strengthening what remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
of being zealous, and of repenting, are not given to
Ministers only. 4. The rebukes of falling from the first
Love, of not watching, of lukewarmnesse are not laid upon
Ministers onely;</hi> therfore to the <hi>Angell of the Church

have this meaning, <hi>Vnto the Church of Ephesus, of

for not hearing and obeying the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of believers, who are not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, over him
in the Lord.</p>
            <p>3. By grant of M. <hi>Parker</hi> the Church of believers
hath not power from this place <hi>Mat:</hi> 18. to ordaine
pastors to themselves, when they want pastors, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
their own Eldership in case of scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
sins, which is against his grounds and our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
principles, who ascribe this authority to the
Congregation of believers, because a number of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
is not an <hi>Aristocraticall part</hi> and a select Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
and Eldership, as he saith is meaned in this
word <hi>(tell the Church.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. The Church here cannot well mean a visible
Congregation of believers and Elders conveened to
heare the Word preached,<note place="margin">14. Ar.</note> so as he who contemneth
two private admonitions should be accused and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
in the face of the Congregation conveened to hear
Gods Word. Because the Church meeteth in Christs
name for Gods worship, if they meet in faith and
humble sense of sinne, with purpose of heart to


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98601:57"/>
worship <hi>God in spirit and truth,</hi> but there is some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing required, that the excommunicating Church,
meet for the actuall exercise of discipline, for beside
meeting in Christs name, there is required that the
Church meet with <hi>Pauls</hi> spirit, and the rod of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
1 Cor: 5. 4. <hi>That yee meet in the name of our
Lord Iesus Christ, and my spirit with power of our
Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Then <hi>Pauls spirit</hi> as an Elder, who hath
power of the rod, a spirit and power of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is required to this meeting. But I doubt not
but the Church of believers did meet at <hi>Corinth, 1 Cor:</hi>
11. for hearing the Word and receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and for ordinary wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hip and praying and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
when it was not needfull that <hi>Paul</hi> should write,
<hi>That yee meet together in the name of our Lord Iesus
and my spirit to heare the Word and to receive the Lords
Supper:</hi> There was no need of <hi>Pauls spirit</hi> for that,
therfore I conclude that this meeting of the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
Church requireth another spirit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative
power to deliver to Satan (such as was
in <hi>Paul)</hi> then is required in ten believers meeting in
faith, without <hi>Pauls</hi> authoritative power, to heare Gods
Word. For <hi>Paul</hi> saith of his authoritative meeting,
<hi>I verily absent in body but present in spirit, have judged,</hi>
&amp;c. but <hi>Paul</hi> knew that they might meet as a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of believers to heare the Word, whither <hi>Paul</hi> be
absent or present in spirit, and this I observe for their
mistake who teach that <hi>two or three agreeing together
upon Earth and praying for one thing,</hi> are heard of God,
as it is said, <hi>Mat:</hi> 18. 19, 20. is an independent
Church having the power of the Keyes, for first,
Christ then hath not provided a sure way, for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
scandals. And when he saith <hi>(tell the Church)</hi>
this <hi>(tell the Church)</hi> must be a definite, visible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuously
known Church; now in one congregation,
one province, one nation there be three hundreth, six
or ten hundreth threes or fours of professed believers,
if every three and every foure be an independent Church,


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98601:57"/>
to which of all these many threes and fours, shall the
plantiffe addresse himselfe, for they be all equally inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Churches, the plantiffe is left in the midst,
and knoweth not his ordinary judge, there be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tribunals in one Congregation, yea in one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>2. How many key-bearing Churches shall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one independent Congregation, who may all meet
in publike in one house, for the joynt worshiping of God
together?</p>
            <p>3. Christ in these words, where he is said to <hi>heare
two who shall agree together upon earth as touching one
thing,</hi> hath no purpose to erect visible Churches with
the full power of the keyes, consisting only of three
or foure believers, but he doth argue here from the

sessions in <hi>Scotland</hi> very well, where there is often
but one Pastor, and some few ruling Elders, but Christ
cannot promise a Church-presence of his Spirit and
grace, or such a presence wherby he ratifieth the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Church, but where there is a Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of Elders and people, but if the words be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
according to the letter and definite number, then
it shall follow that every two believers; yea suppose

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The word <hi>(Ecclesia)</hi> the called of God, proveth
this: For those are a true visible Church, where God
hath set up a <hi>Candlestick,</hi> and whom God calleth to

to deny ungodlinesse,</hi> &amp;c. Tit. 2. v. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Conclusion</note> But, <hi>de facto,</hi> as the visible <hi>Church</hi> is in
the <hi>field</hi> of the world, all the members of the visible
Church are not effectually called, justified, sanctified, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it needfull by a phisicall obligation for the true
nature and essence of a visible Church, that all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it be inwardly called and sanctified, every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
is obliged to beleeve,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 18, 36.</note> 
               <hi>else the wrath of God abideth
on him, and he is condemned already.</hi> But to make a man
a visible professor, and a member of the true visible
Church as visible, saving faith is not essentially required,
so as he should be no member of the Church visible, if he
beleeve not.</p>
            <p>That this may be right taken; observe that the visible
<hi>Church</hi> falleth under a two-fold consideration. 1. <hi>In
concreto,</hi> as a <hi>Church. 2. In abstracto,</hi> as visible. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church considered <hi>in concreto,</hi> is a part of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall,
Catholike and unvisible Church which partaketh
of the nature and essence of a true Church, and Christs
misticall body, in which consideration we deny repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and unbelevers to be members of the visible
Church. 1. Because there is no reall communion (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> and Papists say on the contrary) betwixt
<hi>righteousnesse and unrighteousnesse, light and darkenesse, the
seed of the woman, and the seede of the Serpent,</hi> so as they
can make up one true Church. 2. Because these who are
not Christs, are not members of Christ, and so no part
of his misticall body. 3. Because they are not <hi>bought
with a price;</hi> nor his purchased flock in the blood of God,
as <hi>Acts</hi> 20. the true Church is, nor builded upon a rock,
as <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. 4. Christ is not their Redeemer, head,
High-priest, King and Saviour, and so neither are
they his redeemed, his members, his people,


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98601:60"/>
subjects and saved ones. 5. Because the promises made
to the chos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n and beleevers, to give them a new heart,
regeneration, sanctification, remission of sinnes are made
to them only, and in Gods gratious intention, and not
to reprobates. Whence I inferre these conclusions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sepera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ists</hi> arguments must be weake, for they all
conclude that which we deny not, and no other thing,
to wit, that haereticks, adulterers, forcerers, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
be no parts of Christs visible Church, as it is a
Church. Yea we say that as the tree leg, and the eye
of glasse, and the teeth of silver by art put in the body,
are no members of the living body, so neither are these
members of the true <hi>Church,</hi> and so much doe all our
Divines, as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Junius, Whittaker, Tilen,
Piscator, Pareus, Vrsine, Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

prove against <hi>Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Preaching of the Gospell is called a note of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and profession of faith a note of the <hi>Church</hi>
both, the former is a no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the teaching Church or
minsteriall Church called, <hi>Ecclesia docens.</hi> The latter
is a note of the professing <hi>Church,</hi> who professeth the
faith, which we may call <hi>Ecclesia utens,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesia pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticè
consideram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Profession of the faith is thought to be true, either
Subjectively. 2. Objectively. Or 3. Both Subjectively
and Objectively. Profession subjectively is true when
the professor doeth indeed professe and avow the truth,
and doth not only seem to avow &amp; professe the truth, and
this is no note of a true Church, because it may be in
hypocrites, who really goe to Church, really heare the
word and partake of the Sacraments, but not sincerely.
Profession true objectively is when the professor doth
professe that faith which is indeed sound and orthodox.
And this is a marke of the true teaching or ministeriall
<hi>Church,</hi> and may be in a visible company of professors
who for the time are not sincere beleevers. But a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the faith both objectively true and subjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is, when the object is orthodox and sound truth, and


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98601:60"/>
the professor sincerely and gratiously, and with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
heart beleeveth and professeth the truth, and this
way profession of the truth is a true and essentiall note
of a visible Church as it is a true Church and body of
Christ, and so are our Divines to be expounded in this
doctrine about the notes of the visible Church. But
withall, the visible Church is to be considered <hi>in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracto,</hi>
under the notion of visibility, and as visible,
and as performing all the externall acts of professing,
governing, hearing, preaching, praising, administrating
the seales of the covenant, binding and loosing in the
externall and visible court of Christ, and under this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplication
as obvious to mens eyes, and therefore in
this notion all externall professors who are not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
and openly scandalous are to be reputed members
of the true visible Church, and therefore this tearme,
would be considered, <hi>a true visible Church.</hi> For the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
<hi>(true)</hi> may either be referred to the subject
<hi>(Church)</hi> and so signifieth the true misticall body of
Christ visibly, and with all sincerely professing the
sound faith. Or it may be referred to the other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
<hi>(visible)</hi> and so it is no other but a company
of professors visible to our senses, and so truely visible,
whose members may be unsound and false professours:
Then the question is, <hi>whither visible Saints 1. forsaking
all knowne sinnes. 2. Doing all the knowne will of God.
3. Growing in grace,</hi>

               </gap>ciety: Or is this sufficient for the nature, and right

The pure word of God purely preached, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98601:61"/>
duely administred, with discipline according
to Gods word, and withall a people externally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
the fore-said faith, suppose they cannot give to
us manifest tokens and evidences that they are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
called, and partakers of the divine nature, and
translated from death to life, and are elected, called and
justified; This latter we hold as the truth of God; these
of the <hi>Separation</hi> hold the former. Now we must care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
distinguish here what are to be distinguished; for
there are many questions infolded here of divers natures:
For 1. The question is if the society have the word,
seales and right discipline, and they professe the truth,
suppose their lives be wicked; whether they should
not be answerable to that which they professe? I
<hi>Answer.</hi> No doubt they ought to be answerable to their
light, and obey the holy calling. 2. What if many
of them leade a life contrary to that which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
and yet the governours use not the rod of discipline
to censure them: then whether should the members
separate from that <hi>Church?</hi> They ought to separate, (say
the <hi>Separatists,)</hi> They ought not to separate from the
Church and worship, say we; they are to stay with their
Mother, but to plead with her; and modestly and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
say, that <hi>Archippus</hi> and others doe not fulfill
their Ministry, <hi>which they have received of the Lord.</hi>
3. What if there be purity of doctrine, but extreame
wickednesse, contrary to their doctrine; whether is
that company a true <hi>Church</hi> or not? I answer, it is a
true, visible and a teaching or right ministeriall <hi>Church,</hi>
but for as farre as can be seene, not a holy, not a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<hi>Church,</hi> and therefore must not be deserted and
left. 4. What if the guides receive in as members of
the <hi>Church,</hi> those who are knowne to be most scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and wicked, and not such Saints as <hi>Paul</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
unto at <hi>Rome, Corinth, Ephesus Colosse. Answ.</hi> The
faults of the guides are not your faults who are private
members, you are to keepe publike communion in the
publike ordinances of Christ, but not to take part with


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98601:61"/>
               <hi>their unfruitfull workes, but rather to reprove them.</hi> 5. What
if the members of the Church can give no reall proofes
that they are inwardly called, sanctified, and justified,
and yet you see no scandalous out-breakings in them,
to testifie the contrary. I answer, for as much as grace
may be under many ashes, as a peece of gold amongst
mountaines of earth: If they professe the sound faith,
they are a true visible Church, and we are to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them as such, and to joyne our selves as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to such a society, or being already members, we
are to remaine in that society, and not to separate from
it in any sort.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Separation</hi> doth complaine that in our <hi>Church</hi>

our Church is a false Church, not right constitute, no
Spouse of Christ, no royall generation, not a people who
hath Christ for King, Priest, and Prophet.</hi> We on the
contrary hold this as our fourth conclusion, That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
openly and grossely prophane wicked persons, as
knowne atheists, and mockers of Religion, Idolaters,
papists, heretickes, sorcerers, witches, theeves, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
&amp;c. are not to be keeped in the Church; but to
be excommunicated, nor yet to be received into the
Church as members thereof, untill they give eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their repentance: Yet we say that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
required more as touching the essentiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and nature of being members of a Church, as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
but that they professe before men the faith, and
desire the seales of the Covenant, and crave fellowship
with the visible Church, which I prove:</p>
            <p>1. From the manner of receiving members in the


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98601:62"/>
Apostolike Church, where nothing is required but a
professed willingnesse to receive the Gospell, howbeit
they receive it not from their heart, Act. 2. 41.
<hi>then they that gladly received his word</hi> (Peters word)
<hi>were baptized, and the same day were added to the Church
about three thousand soules,</hi> v. 45. <hi>And they sold their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
and parted them to all men.</hi> Now amongst these glad
receivers of the Gospell were <hi>Ananias and Saphira,</hi> ch. 4.
v. 34, 35, 36, 37. chap. 6. v. 1, 2, 3. It is true they are all
charged by <hi>Peter</hi> to repent, ere they be <hi>baptized,</hi> and
added to the <hi>Church;</hi> but the Apostles require no more
to make members of the visible Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut 1. professed
willing receiving of the word and this receiving expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by an outward act of selling their goods, which
was but hypoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isie in <hi>Ananias and Saphira,</hi> as the event
declared; yet were <hi>Ananias and Saphira,</hi> for that time
members of the Churches as truly visible, and their acts
of electing and chusing a Pastor, and consenting to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
scandalous persons in that time valid in
Christs cout: Yea suppose <hi>Ananias</hi> had been a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
his preaching and baptizing should have been
valid, by grant of <hi>Separatists.</hi> Also there is no more
required by the Church of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Act 8. v. 13.
but beleeving historically at the sight of miracles, and
he was baptized and received into the <hi>Church</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Now this beleeving was not seene to be saving
faith to <hi>Peter</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> we know no wayes they
had to know it, seeing they know not the heart, but what
is said, v. 13. <hi>he continued with Philip, and wondred,</hi> which an
hypocrite might doe, and he had been not long since
an abhominable sorcerer, and usurped the honour of
God like a sacrilegious robber of the Almighty of his
glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10, 11. And the like we may see of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
who forsooke <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10 <hi>and followed the
present world:</hi> There was nothing to make him a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the visible Church then, but that for a while he
followed <hi>Paul</hi> in his journeyes, and professed the faith.
And the like must be said of <hi>Hymeneus and Alexander,</hi>


               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:98601:62"/>
who for a time were members of the true Church,
as it is visible, and a professing <hi>Church;</hi> and this was
knowne onely by their profession; yet that they had
but a bare profession is cleare, seeing afterward they
made shipwracke of faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19, 20. Now our
brethren cannot deny but all these might, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
Ecclesiasticall Acts that were valid and ratified
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea of binding and loosing, and so nothing
is required to make men members of a visible Church,
but such an outward profession of faith as may befall,
and hath been found in the fairest broidered and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hypocrites, who have been in the Apostolike
Church. Also what more was in <hi>Judas,</hi> even after
Christ had said <hi>(Have not I chosen you twelve, and one

discover him to us, that we may separate from
him.</p>

of a Congregation of forty professors, foure and twenty
may be,<note place="margin">

a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d twenty, suppose twelve of them be the Pastor,
<hi>Elders and Deacons,</hi> are truly parts of the Church as
visible: Howbeit not parts of the Church as the
Church, and as the true and mystciall body of Jesus
Christ, and by this same reason all the fourty may be
hypocrites for a time, because they are but men, who
seeth not the heart, who did congregate this
Church, and what is true of foure and twenty may
befall fourty. I say (for a time) they may be all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
or at the first constitution of the Church,
but that all shall remaine so, I thinke is against the
wisedome and gracious intention of God, who doth
not set up a candle and candlesticke, but to seeke his
owne lost money: And where he sendeth shepheards,


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98601:65"/>
he hath there some lost sheep, because the preaching
of the word is an essentiall note of a visible Church.
Hence that Congregation of forty not yet converted
is a true visible Church, I meane, a true teaching and
Ministeriall Church in which are acts Pastorall of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
baptizing, binding, and loosing that are valid
and right Ecclesiastically: For Baptisme there admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrated
was not to be repeated, and such a Church
by the Ministery therein, is and may be converted to
the saving faith of Christ: yea and Separatists would
call such an independent Congregation. Hence 3. this
must follow, that as to make one a Pastor, and to
make twelve men <hi>Deacons and Elders,</hi> and so such as
hath joynt power of the keyes, even by the grant of
<hi>Separatists,</hi> with the rest of the Congregation, there
is not faith in Christ required as an essentiall element,
as I have proved from <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. so to make these
twelve members of a visible Congregation, Faith is
not essentially required (suppose it be morally requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
so by that same reason to make other twelve mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in that visible society in Christ, faith were not
required, as to make <hi>Demas, Ananias, Saphira, Magus,
Alexander, Hy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>cus</hi> and some moe of that kind a
visible Church: There is no more required but that
profession of faith which moved the Apostolike
Church to make them members of a true Church
visible: For what maketh formally a member of a
Church visible, to wit, profession of the faith, that
same maketh forty also members of a visible Church,
and <hi>quae est ratio constitutiva partium, est etiam const<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

totius.</hi> That which formally constituteth a part,
doth formally constitute the whole, where the whole
is made of parts of the same nature, as what is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
to make a quart of water, that is essentiall to make
a whole sea of water, and every part of the visible
Church is visible, and a visible professour, as visibility
denominateth the whole, so doth it every part of the
whole. And from this I inferre this fourth, That a


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98601:65"/>
visible Church as visible, doth not essentially and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
consist of believers; but only of professours of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
so that a Church and a visible Church may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by way of contradiction, as a number of believers,
and a number of non-believers. For a Church essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is a number of believers and Christs mysticall body,
els it is not a Church, that is, a number of persons effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually
called; for this cause I grant an Eldership of
a congregation; a Synod Provinciall or Nationall
are unproperly called a Church; and howbeit we list
not to strive about names, we may grant our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
assembly not to be properly called a National Church,
but by a figure, for the believers of the Nation are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Nationall Church, I meane a mysticall believing
Church.</p>

            <p>There is 1. The single and occasionall preaching of the
Word.</p>
            <p>2. The setled preaching of the Word, the setling of
the Candle-sticke and Kingdome to dwell amongst a
people.</p>
            <p>3. The preached Word, with the seales, especially
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. The single and

            <p>2. The setled preaching of the Word established

of the true Church, and preached in Gods blessed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

               <hi>Master</hi> Barrow, Ainsworth, <hi>Mr.</hi> Canne. The
blast of the Kings horne can make no man a member of
Christs body, that must be done willingly, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

Idolatry, set up the true Worship of God, suppresse
errours, cause the truth to be taught, yet he cannot constrain
men to joyne to the Church.</p>
            <p>I answer, This is a senslesse reason; for how doth
the Magistrate abolish Idolatry, set up the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God? It is, I hope, by externall force and
power: For the Magistrate as the Magistrate doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but by an externall coactive power. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
useth the sword, not reasons, preaching and
counsell. Yea, this way he cannot <hi>abolish idolatry, nor
erect the pure worship of God, for it is a worke of Gods
Spirit</hi> and a willing worke, that a subject for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
Idols, and worship God purely at the command

<hi>(say the</hi> Separatists) is the Temple of the Lord, the body

people, chosen, redeemed Saints by calling, partakers of the
most precious faith, and glorious hope, the humble, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
loving Sheepe of Christ, a sheepe-fold watched by
discipline, a garden well inclosed, here entreth no Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
every vessell is holy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The body of Christ, <hi>a Kingdome of Priests
and Saints, and these that are partakers of the holy faith,</hi> are
the chosen of God, ordained for glory in his decree of
election, and effectually called and justified; but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
say, that the visible Church is a company of
Saints by calling, where (saith <hi>Ainsworth) there be
many called, but few chosen,</hi> hence this argument will
prove that none, no hypocrites can be in the visible
Church, as a Church is indeed Christs body. Now
the Church visible as a Church is indeed <hi>Christs body,
a reyall Priest-hood, a chosen generation,</hi> but as visible, it
is sufficient that the Church be a royall Priest-hood only
in profession, and so possibly for a while, no <hi>royall Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
no chosen generation,</hi> as I have observed before.
<hi>But</hi> (say they) <hi>hypocrites are not indeed and really mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the true visible Church, but only in reputation, as an
eye of glasse, is not indeed a true part of the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, then our adversaries give us no right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the true naturall and lively members of the
true visible Church, he that would give such a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a man as agreeth both to a living man, and to a
pictured or painted man, were but a painted <hi>Logician.</hi>


               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:98601:69"/>
For they acknowledge the true parts of a visible Church
to be <hi>a chosen people, a royall generation, partakers of the
holy faith,</hi> either they are really and in Gods esteem a
chosen people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so we are at a point, there be
none members of a visible Church, none ought to heare
the word as members of the Church, none ought to
preach, baptize, bind and loose with the rest of the
Congregation, but these that are really chosen and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
called, which cannot be said. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> then
and M. <hi>Canne,</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> doe but mocke us, when they
say, <hi>The true matter of a true visible Church are Saints in
profession,</hi> and in the judgement of charity, for that is
not enough, they must be according to the Texts of
Scripture alledged by <hi>Barrow,</hi> not onely in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of charity, but in Gods estimation, and in the
judgement of verity, <hi>a chosen people, a royall generation.</hi>
If the true matter of the true visible Church be <hi>a chosen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
and a royall Priest-hood</hi> only in profession, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
cited will not help them; for <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. writeth
not to an independent Congregation, who are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
only a chosen people; But he writeth to the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> even to all the dispersed and sanctified,
and regenerated in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia</hi>
and <hi>Bythinia,</hi> who were not only a chosen generation in
profession, but also really and in Gods decree of election.
Neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Isaiah</hi> are of purpose to teach that in
the independent Congregation of the New Testament
there are none, but all <hi>righteous men, no stones</hi> (to speake
with <hi>Isaiah) but Saphires and Carbuncles, no thornes
and briers, but only the firre and the myrtle trees; no iron
and brasse, but all gold and silver; no Cananite, no Lyon,
no uncleane vessell,</hi> this they shall not find in the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

who hath left no infallible meanes to keepe his
owne Name and ordinances from prophanation, and his
owne Church from being leavened and defiled with the
uncleane. For <hi>Simon Magus, Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,
Demas,</hi> to whom the precious promises of the covenant
were preached, and the seales conferred, could not be
discerned to be hypocrites by any word of God, while
the event of their out-breaking wickednesse declared
them to be such, and so this should prove that God is
not tender enough of the honour of his owne Name and
ordinances, who should permit hypocrites to lurke in
the visible Church, and heare the promises, and receive
the seales of the covenant, <hi>and defile and pollute them,</hi> and
Christs body the Church, for the godly by that Text are
<hi>made one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. (if it be rightly expounded)
with the latent hypocrites that come to the communion
with them. 2. The promises and seales were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
to Christ and his Disciples, because <hi>Iudas</hi> did heare
the word, and receive the seales of the word with them:
The Word and Sacraments were not polluted to <hi>Paul,</hi>
because <hi>Demas</hi> did communicate with him. 3. If some
one private Christian know another to be an adulterer,
he is to rebuke him privately, and not to tell the Church,
but in case of obstinacie, and suppose the Church would
not cast out the adulterer, yet is he not to private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
an adulterer, while he be <hi>juridice, by two or three
witnesses</hi> convicted before the Church, and all this
while it is lawfull to communicate with him; for a
a testimonie should not be received against any, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
two witnesses. We are not <hi>made one body</hi> by eating
that same supper with an unbeleever, except it be one
visible body communicating in one visible bread. Christ
and the Apostles were not made one body misticall with
<hi>Iudas,</hi> by eating the <hi>Passeover</hi> together, but only one visible

            <head type="sub">Quest. 10. Whither or no it be lawfull to seperate from
a true Church visible, for the corruption of teachers,
and the wickednesse of Pastours and professours, where
Faith is begotten by the preaching of professed truth?</head>
            <p>THat we may the more orderly proceed, these distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are to be considered, as making way to cleare
the question.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. There is a separation in the visible Church, and
a Separation out of, and from the visible Church.</item>
               <item>2. There is a Separation totall and whole, from any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
communion with the Church; or partiall and in
part, from a point of Doctrine or practise of the Church
in a particular only.</item>
               <item>3. There is a Separation negative, when we deny the practise
of an errour with silence, or refuse publike communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Church, but doe not erect a new Church
within the Church. There is a separation positive, when
we doe not only refuse practise of errours, and protest
and pleade against them, but also erect a new visible
Church.</item>
               <item>4. As there is a three-fold communion, 1. in Baptisme,
2. in hearing of the Word, 3. in communicating with the
Church at the Lords Supper, so there is a three-fold sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
answerable therunto.</item>
               <item>5. The influence of a worship corrupt may either be thought
to come from the persons with whom we worship, or
2. from the matter of the worship, if corrupt, and
that either, 1. by practise, or 2. by not practising
somthing that an affirmative commandement of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paseth
on us.</item>
               <item>6. A communion in worship either implyeth a consent


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98601:72"/>
and approbation of the worship, or no consent at
all.</item>
               <item>7. A communion of worship when the worship in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is lawfull, yet for the profession may be most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
as to heare a Jesuite preach sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</item>
               <item>8. There is a separation from a friendly familiarity, and
from a communion in worship.</item>

            <p>1. Conclusion. <hi>We are to separate in the true visible
Church, from all communion, wherin need-force we

            <p>2. <hi>Conclusion,</hi> from the first conclusion it will follow,
that a separation in part, I meane, in some acts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
worship, when we cannot chuse but fall in sin, from
a true Church is lawfull, as we must separate from an ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
communion, where the bread is adored: for then
the Lords Table is made an Idols Table, and yet we are
not totally and wholly to separate from the Church and
hearing of the word, and praiers and praises of that Church,
as we shall heare.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Anent separation from <hi>Rome,</hi> and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

of government Presbyteriall, who thinke we have
all as good reason to separate from our selves and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Churches, as from <hi>Babel.</hi> But I shall speake a little
of the first in some few <hi>Theses</hi> considerable for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Consideration.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bell. de not. eccles. l. 4. c. 10.</note> It is most false that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith,

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98601:73"/>
For 1. The contrary is seene in the reformed Churches
who never flourished, as since our separation from <hi>Rome.</hi>
2. The Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and especially the
Greeke Church flourished ever since, and they separated
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and had famous learned men in them after the
separation, as <hi>Theophylact, Damascen, Occumenius, Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naras,
Cedrenus, Elias Cretensis, Basil: Nilus,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, and especially the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi>
Churches had both their Bishops and Assemblies, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
generall they could not have, seeing they were apart,
not the whole Church.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Consideration.</hi> The faithfull before <hi>Luther,</hi> the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenses,
Waldenses</hi> and others, yea the Romane Doctors
themselves holding the fundamentall points with some
hay and stubble builded upon the foundation made a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Separation from <hi>Babylon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and did neither hold, nor
professe their grosse Idolatries, and other fundamentall
errours, howbeit they did not hold them positively,
by erecting a new Church, because the separation
was then in the blade, and not ripe for the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Consideration.</hi> We hold that <hi>Rome</hi> made the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Reformed Churches, and not we from
them, as the rotten wall maketh the schisme in the house,
when the house standeth still and the rotten wall fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>
            <p>1. Because we left not Christianity in <hi>Rome,</hi> but the
leprosie of Popery growing upon Christianity, seeing we
kept the Apostolike faith, and did positively separate
from the pookes, blybes, and ulcers of Christian
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We did not separate from the Westerne Churches,
either collective or representatively gathered in a generall
Councell.</p>
            <p>3. We departed not from a Nationall, Provinciall or
Parishonall Church, or Pastors that we had before, nor
from the materiall Temples and Churches, except that
some not very considerable hyrelings and idoll-pastours


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98601:73"/>
would not goe before us.</p>
            <p>4. And because the succession of fundamentall truths
from generations to generations, is as necessary as the
perpetuall existence of the true Catholick Church, while
the covenant with night and day and the ordinances
of Heaven shall continue, <hi>Jer:</hi> 31. 37. therfore there
were a succession of professours and members of the
Catholick Church that did ever hold these fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
which we to this day hold against <hi>Rome;</hi> suppose
Histories cannot cleare the particular persons by
name.</p>
            <p>5. We have not separated from <hi>Romes</hi> baptisme and
ordination of Pastors according to the substance of the
act, nor from the letter of the twelve Articles of the Creed
and contents of the old and new Testament, as they stand
with relation to the mind and intent of the Holy
Ghost, howbeit we have left the false interpretations
of the Lords of poore peoples Faith and Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Consideration.</hi> We separate not from acts of love to
have the reliques of <hi>Babel</hi> saved, howbeit we have separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from communion in faith and worship.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Consideration.</hi> The essentiall ingredients and reasons
of a lawfull divorce are here. 1. we could not lye in one
bed with that sometime sister Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but our
skin behoved to rub upon her botch-boyle, and therfore
we did separate from nothing but corruption. 2. There
was there persecutions, and in that we are patients and
ejected rather then departers on foot and horse. 3. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
dominion over our consciences. 4. Necessity of
receiving the marke of the beast, and so the plagues of
the beast, to worship Images, and the worke of mens
hands, a necessity of professing fundamentall errours, that
subvert the foundation of faith, did all necessitate our
seperation.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Consideration.</hi> The Church of believers might
lawfully use <hi>justâ tutelâ aet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rnae salutis,</hi> a necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
for salvation, and forsake her corrupt guides and


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98601:74"/>
choose others, and so we had the consent of the Church
to the separation, and a voice from Heaven, <hi>Come out of
her my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>Consideration.</hi> A collaterall and sister-Church,
such as <hi>Rome</hi> ever was, is not said to separate from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the lesser separateth alway from the greater, the
member from the body. Where there is a schisme,
sister-Protestant Churches then cannot be said to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
one from another, nor can the crime of schisme
here be more objected to us then to <hi>Rome,</hi> but rather to
<hi>Rome</hi> separating from Orthodoxe and right beleeving
Rome.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Consideration.</hi> We separate not from men but er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
2. We separate from Papisme kindly, properly
and totally: from Christian Articles in no sort. 3. From
points of truth sewed and engraven with Popery only
by accident, breaking the thread and needle that sowed
them together.</p>
            <p>But as concerning the other point. We see not how
we are to separate from the reformed Churches,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ainsworth</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyson, p 8.</note> as
<hi>Ainsworth</hi> saith, and how M. <hi>Jacob</hi> saith, <hi>Our reformed
Divines cannot satisfie the obiection that Calvin and Luther,
and Zuinglius, who had their ordination and calling to be
Pastors from the Church of Rome, and so from Antichrist,
and so our Ministers having ordination and calling from
Ministers, who had their calling from Antichrist cannot
be lawfull Ministers, nor our Church a true Church, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it wanteth a true Ministery, except we say with them,
they had their calling essentially from the suffrages and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Church of beleevers, who have power to ordaine
Ministers, and power to depose and excommunicate them if
need be.</hi> But I answer, this power is in the backe of
the Bible, and amongst unwritten traditions, not in
the holy Oracles of the old or new Testament. Hence
I will speake a word of the calling of our reformers.

here three things, 1. Something in the calling
of our reformers was from God: so authoritatively,
they were called of God, the Ministery being of God.
2. The Christian Church lying under Popery, called,
designed, and ordained the men to be Pastors; so their
calling according to the substance of the act was from
God, and the Romane Church as a Christian Church.
3. There was corruption in the way and manner of
their vocation, as the Antichristian ceremonies, and an
oath to maintaine the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
not onely as a Christian Church, but also as Romish,
if any of them did sweare to defend the corruptions
of the Church, this latter was taken away by Gods il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination
of their minds: A called Minister sweareth
to defend the truth, and this truth of this Church; but

but kept some of Christs truth. That which is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian</hi>
in part onely, may ordaine Ministers, who
have the true essence of a Ministeriall calling; for <hi>Israel
no wife, but a whore,</hi> Hos. 2. 2. <hi>a whore and no wife me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito
&amp; iure,</hi> in ill deserving; yet a mother and a wife,
<hi>de facto,</hi> and keeping something of a covenanted bride,
is called <hi>Gods people,</hi> Hos. 4. 6. and Ezech. 16. 21. <hi>Thou
hast slaine my children,</hi> then her barnes were Gods barnes


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98601:75"/>
in Covenant, and not bastards: God was still <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's</hi>
God, Hos. 13. 16. <hi>a remnant according to election re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,</hi>
Rom. 11. 5. The Orthodox Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the <hi>Africanes</hi> as a true Church, who defended
heresie, that barnes baptized by heretickes were to be
baptized againe. 2. A calling is extraordinary, either
in habit or in exercise; in habit, as to be an Apostle,
and have the gift of miracles: Thus our reformers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
was not extraordinary, they were not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called by God from heaven; for they would not
have concealed such a calling, if they had had any such:
Or a calling is extraordinary in the exercise, and that
two wayes; Either in the Principle moving them to
teach, or 2. in the manner of teaching and efficacy; a
calling extraordinary in the principle moving, is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:
Either a meere Propheticall impulsion of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
stirring them up to such an act, as the Spirit of
the Lord came upon <hi>Saul,</hi> and he prophecyed, this our
reformers had not, because we never finde that they
alleadge it. 2. A more then ordinary motion with il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination
by Gods Spirit, speaking in the Scriptures,
in which motions they were not subordinate in the
exercise of their Ministery to the Church of Pastors;
but immediately in that subordinated to God, and in
this I prove that our reformers were extraordinary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</p>
            <p>1. Because Ezech. 34. in a universall aposta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ye of the
Prophets and shepheards, the Lord extraordinarily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
v. 11. <hi>For thus saith the Lord God, behold I, even I
will both search my sheep, and seeke them out.</hi> Now this
is by Pastors, when the ordinary Pastors are all failed.
So Rev. 11. in that universall Apostacye under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
<hi>when the Gentiles treade upon the utter Court of
the Temple, and the holy City, God stirreth up two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
to prophecye in sack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loth;</hi> that is, <hi>some few Pastors</hi>
(for two is the smallest number) and they prophecye,
and are slaine, and yet <hi>they rise againe.</hi> We need not
apply this to men in particular, as to <hi>John Hush,</hi> and


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98601:75"/>
               <hi>Jerome of Prague;</hi> but certainly, some few spake against
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and they were borne downe, and oppressed,
and killed, and men of that same spirit rose and spake
that same truth, as if the very <hi>two men who were slaine,</hi>
had risen <hi>within three dayes againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because when the Church is overgone with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
and Apostacye, our reformers in the exercise of
their Minestery, were not to keepe a certaine flocke
as in a constitute Church, and suppose they had no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
but eminent gifts, they were to spread the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to Nations, as <hi>Luther</hi> did, and suppose the people
should resist them, as in many places they did; yet God
called them, and they were not to expect election
from people: So <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrenus</hi> preached, <hi>Act.</hi>
11. and 18. and we reade of no vocation that they had
from either people or Apostle.<note place="margin">Origen, Homil 11. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 18.</note> So <hi>Origen</hi> preached to a
people in a certain Town, where there was not one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and afterwards he was chosen their Pastor.</p>
            <p>As for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> suppose our Reformers
have their calling thence, yet have we a true Ministry
and there was a Church in <hi>Rome</hi> before the <hi>Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi>
which could constitute a true Ministry, as I cleare in
these distinctions, for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it hath these
parts.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Distinction.</hi> 1. The court of <hi>Rome</hi> and Clergy, 2. The
seduced people.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Distinction.</hi> There is a teaching court professing and
teaching Popery, and obtruding it upon the consciences
of others. 2. There is a people professing and believing
this with heat of zeal. 3. A people misled, ignorant, not
doubting but following. 4. There is a people of God,
<hi>Come out of her my people, ergo.</hi> there is a covenanted
people of God there, 2 Thess. Antichrist shall sit in the
<hi>Temple of God, ergo.</hi> GOD hath a Temple in
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third <hi>Distinction</hi> is necessary; a true Church is
one thing <hi>veritate Metaphysicâ,</hi> with the verity of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
as a sick-man, or a man wanting a legg is a


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98601:76"/>
true man, and hath a reasonable soule in him, and a
true Church <hi>veritate Ethicâ,</hi> a Church morally true,
that is, a sound, whole, a pure Church professing the
sound faith, that is another thing. <hi>Rome</hi> is a sick-Church
and a maimed and lamed Church, wanting legs
and armes, and so is not morally a true Church, for
vile corruption of Doctrine is there, as we say a thief
is not a true man, but a false and a taking man, yet
he hath a mans nature and a reasonable soule in him;
the question is if <hi>Rome</hi> have the soul, life and being of a
Church.</p>
            <p>A fourth <hi>Distinction</hi> is: That the question is either
of a teaching Church and a Ministeriall, professing Christ,
the Word and Baptisme, or of a believing Church and
Spouse of Christ.</p>
            <p>The fifth <hi>Distinction</hi> is. If <hi>Rome</hi> relatively be a wife in
comparison of other Churches, or if <hi>Rome</hi> absolutely in
her self be a Church.</p>
            <p>The sixth <hi>Distinction</hi> is. If <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>jure</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito,</hi>
a Spouse, or an Harlot, or <hi>de facto,</hi> a wife, not having
received a Bill of <hi>Divorcement,</hi> as the Church of the
<hi>Iewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The seventh <hi>Distinction</hi> is. If <hi>Rome</hi> according to some
parts be a Spouse, and keepeth any list of marriage kindnes
to her husband, or if she be according to other parts a cast
off whore.</p>
            <p>The eighth and last is, if <hi>Rome</hi> be materially a Church,
having in it the Doctrine of faith, or if formally it bee no
Church, having no professed faith that hath the nature
of faith.</p>
            <p>Hence shortly I say, The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> as Popish,
is the falling-sicknesse of the Church, not the Church.
But the same Court teaching something of Christ,
baptisme, good-works, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> hath something of the life
and being of a Church, howbeit she be not a whole
Church, her skinne being leprous, pocky and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.</p>
            <p>1. Because in a Church that is no Church, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98601:76"/>
be a true feale of Gods covenant, but in the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> there is true baptisme; for we baptize not againe
children once baptized there; some of the Separation
called it Idoll-baptisme, and no baptisme, which is <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme,</hi>
for then all converted <hi>Papists</hi> must be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
againe, no lesse then converted <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Iewes;</hi>
But 1. The covenant is there, <hi>Come out of her my people:</hi>
then their baptisme confirmeth this covenant. 2. <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
even in apostate <hi>Israel</hi> is true circumcision, her
barnes the Lords barnes, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 21. hee is <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi>
God, <hi>the holy one of Israel in the midst thereof.</hi> In
<hi>Hezokiahs</hi> reformation the people <hi>ate the Passeover,</hi> and
yet all had <hi>corrupted their wayes,</hi> and had beene a long
time worshipping Idols, and they are not, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30.
circumcised againe, and yet <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. none but the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
might eate the `Passeover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because the word of God and so the contract of
Marriage is professed amongst them, and so there is an
externall active calling there, and the word of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
sounding amongst them, and a passive calling also,
because many secretly believe and obey. 3. Many fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
truths are taught that may beget faith, and so
there are true and valid pastorall acts in that Church.
2. I say there is an hid and invisible Church and Temple
in <hi>Rome,</hi> and these God warneth <hi>to come out of Babel,</hi>
and these we by writings cry unto, that they would
forsake their harlot mother, and worship the Lord in
truth, and they obey, howbeit they dare not professe the
truth. But the teaching Church teaching Popery and
fundamentall truths, and obtruding them upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of others, is not the believing Church, and so
not the spouse and body of Christ. 3. <hi>Rome</hi> now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>Paules Rome</hi> which he did write unto, is no
Church, no spouse, as a whorish wife compared with
her selfe in her first moneth to her Husband, while she
was chaste, is now, when <hi>she imbraceth the bosome of a
stranger,</hi> no wife, and yet <hi>Rome</hi> compared with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>

Saints, is called no wife, but an harlot,</hi> Hose 2. 2, 5. &amp; 4. 15.
&amp; 5. 3, 4. 4. <hi>Rome iure</hi> and <hi>merito,</hi> in her bad deserving
to her Lord, is no wife, no Church, no spouse, no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in covenant with God, and yet <hi>de facto</hi> and formally
in possession, in profession, and for matrimoniall tables
which she keepeth is a Church, and differeth from the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> as a Church and no Church. 1. Because albeit
the <hi>Jewes</hi> have the old Testament, which implicity and
by interpretation is the covenant, yet they want two
things which <hi>Rome</hi> hath which destroyeth the essence of
a true Church. 1. The <hi>Iewes</hi> give not so much as a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
consent to the Marriage and the very externall active
calling and invitation to come to Christ, and all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall
publishing of the newes of salvation is removed
from them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 46. but there is a virtuall consent
to the Marriage with Christ in <hi>Rome,</hi> and salvation there
in the word, and some ministeriall and pastorall publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
thereof as in the seed. 2. <hi>Iewes</hi> directly oppugne
the Cardinall foundation of salvation, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 11. Acts
4. 12. 1 Thes.</hi> 2. 15, 16. Christ Jesus, Papists professe
him, and have his seales amongst them, especially bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
5. <hi>Rome in concreto,</hi> according to her best part,
to wit, secret beleevers groaning and sighing in <hi>Egypts</hi>
bondage is a true Church; but <hi>Rome in abstracto,</hi> the
faction of Papists, as Papists, are no spouse of Christ, but
the whore of <hi>Babel,</hi> and mother of fornications. 6. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98601:77"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> be materially a true Church, having the
materiall object of faith, the doctrine of the old and new
Testament common with us, yet formally they are not
one Church with us, but there is a reall and essentiall
separation betwixt us and them, as betwixt a true
Church and an Antichristian Church, a spouse of Christ
and no spouse; for faith relatively taken, faith of many
united in one society doth essentially constitute a Church,
and the formall object of their faith is the word of the
Church, and of men, or Gods word as expounded by
men, and our faiths object formall is the word of God,
as the word of God, and so doe formally differ. 7. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I say <hi>Rome</hi> is a Church teaching and professing, and
hath something of the life and being of a true Church,
yet I hold not that <hi>Rome</hi> is Christs body, nor his wife.

4. <hi>Conclusion,</hi> There be three sorts that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
rightly with our Church, 1. Infants baptised,
for baptisme is a seale of their fellowship with Christ,
and therefore of communion with the Church, because
Separatists will have none members of the Church, while
they can give proofes thereof by signes of regeneration,
infants must be without the Church, as Infidels and
<hi>Turks,</hi> for none are the Church to them, but the <hi>royall
generation, partakers of the holy faith, taught of God, called
and separated from the world,</hi> the rest are without: hence
baptisme shall either seale no entring of infants in the
Church, contrary to Gods word, or the baptizing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
is not lawfull, as Anabaptists teach. 2. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the word have a communion with the Church as
is cleare, seeing these <hi>that eate of one bread are one body,</hi>
these that professe in the hearing of the word, that same
faith, are also that same body in profession; yet excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
persons are admitted as hearers of the word.
Hence only the extreame and great excommunication,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. cutteth of men from being simply no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church, that excommunication that maketh
the party <hi>as a heathen and Publican,</hi> supposeth him still to
be a brother and hearer of the word, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 14, 15.
And all these are members of the Church and yet not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
converted. 3. The regenerate and beleevers
that communicate of one bread and one cup at the Lords
Table, are most neerely and properly members of one
visible body, and none of these are to separate from Christs
body.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Conclusion,</hi> It is not lawfull to separate from any
worship of the Church for the sinnes of the fellow-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,
whether they be officers or private Christians.</p>
            <p>1. Because <hi>Scribes and Pharisees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Arg.</hi>
               </note> and the Church in

perverted the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 21. denyed that hatred and
rash anger was a sinne, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. or heart adultery a sin.
<hi>Made the commandement of God of no effect by their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98601:78"/>
and will-worship, <hi>ver. 7. 8. Mark. 7. 6, 7, 8. said it was
nothing to sweare by the Temple, devoured widdows houses,
made their proselites children of damnation,</hi> Mat. 13. 14, 15,
16. <hi>were blind guides, filled the measure of their fathers
wrath, slew the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 8, 9. <hi>killed and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisied

followed them, and slew the Lord of glory also.</hi> The Priest-hood
was keeped by Moyen, <hi>Caiphas</hi> was High-priest
that yeare. But Christ by practice and precept forbad
to separate from this Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c, The assumption

            <p>Our second Argument,<note place="margin">2. Arg.</note> If Gods Prophets and people
were never commanded to separate from the publike
worship, but commanded to come up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and
worship, pray, sacrifice with Gods people, <hi>Deut. 12,
11, 12, 13. Deut. 15. 19, 20. Deut. 16. 7, 8. v.</hi> 16, 17.
And yet that people was <hi>a crooked and perverse genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

heart to understand God,</hi> Deut. 29, 3, 4. <hi>stiffe necked, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
proud, murmurers, idolaters,</hi> &amp;c. Then the sinfulnesse
of the worshippers defileth not the worship, and we are
not to separate from the worship for the wickednesse of
the worshippers. But the former is Scripture, <hi>Ergo</hi>
separate we cannot upon this pretence. The proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is sure, for God cannot both command his people
to come and worship publikely with his people, and
then also forbid them, because for the wickednesse of the
worshippers, they were to abstaine. Also 2. It will
follow that the people should not have gone to <hi>Shiloh</hi>
when God commanded them to sacrifice with <hi>Elies</hi>
sonnes,<note place="margin">1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

because <hi>Elies</hi> soones wickednesse made men to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre

            <p>Also 3. Because to prophecy to a people,<note place="margin">3. Arg.</note> and for the
people to heare the word of prophecy are both acts of
worshipping God, it will follow, if we must abstaine
from the worship for the knowne sinnes of fellow-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,
then <hi>Isaiah</hi> sinned in prophecying to <hi>a people la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with iniquity, corrupt children, the seede of evill doers,


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98601:79"/>
hypocrites, rebells,</hi> Sodome <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>murtherers,
oppressors,</hi> &amp;c. Isa. 1. for <hi>Isaiah</hi> and that wicked people
worshipping together, the worship was defiled to <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah,</hi>
by these wicked hearers, and he should have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
from prophecying and separated from that pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
and unlawfull worship. Hence <hi>Ieremiah</hi> sinned
in prophecying to <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah, Hosea</hi> sinned, <hi>Amos</hi>
sinned in prophecying to wicked people, <hi>Ionah</hi> sinned in
prophecying to <hi>Niniveh; Paul</hi> sinned in preaching
Christ to the obstinate <hi>Iewes,</hi> to the scoffing <hi>Athenians.</hi>
And seeing they were commanded to prophecy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Gods commandements, shall it be sin and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
for certainely the preacher and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the preaching joyne in one and the same wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>Also 4. <hi>Baruch</hi> should not have gone to the house of
the Lord at the commandement of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi>

because the <hi>Princes, Priests, Prophets</hi> and people fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>Baalim,</hi> slew their children to <hi>Molech, forsooke
the Lord their God, said to a stock thou art my father,</hi> came

Chap. 2. 13, 14. ver. 27. Chap. 14. 15, 16. Chap. 23. 1, 2,
3, 9, 10, 11, 12. Chap. 7. 30, 31, 32. Chap. 15. 1. No peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

worshipped God with them, commanded <hi>Baruch</hi> to
worship God, and commanded the King, his servants, and
the people publikely to worship and heare and beleeve
the word, <hi>Chap. 22. 2, 3. v. 5. Chap. 19. 3, 4. Chap.</hi> 26. 2.
And besides he should have commanded the faithfull to

them to heare in the Lords house, and beleeve

            <p>1. This idolatrous people in the judgement of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            </p>
            <p>2. It cannot be said, that to prophecy to them in
publick is not to keep a religious communion with
them. For to heare on <hi>Messiah</hi> preached, these same

priviledge in this beyond all the Churches of the

can we see it, yet all the Separatists goodly argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
hence fall to the ground, if the faithfull
might lawfully keep Church fellowship with the Church
of <hi>Israel</hi> so corrupted. Then in the old Testament
<hi>Christ and Belial, light and darkenesse might be</hi> in one
Church worship. Then in the old Testament, <hi>the seed

then it was lawfull to remain <hi>in Babel, lawfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
members of an Harlot Church, and be defiled with
their unlawfull worship, and to consent therunto.</hi> Then
it was not required in the old Testament, <hi>that the Church
of God, and his people in Covenant should be a Royall
Priest-hood, an holy people.</hi> In the old Testament, the

All their passages cited in the old Testament for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from a Church fall. The Church of <hi>Israel</hi>
had not Christ for their <hi>King, Priest and Prophet,</hi> and
therfore was not separated from all false Churches, as
they prove from <hi>Hos. 2. 2. Cant. 1. 7, 8. Psal.</hi> 84. 10. in
the old Testament, <hi>The wicked might have taken the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, The Church of <hi>Israel</hi> had no such priviledge
as that persons who were idolaters, thieves, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of <hi>Baal, and forsakers of the true God,</hi> and <hi>going a

for neither Saviour, Word of God, covenant, promise,
or seale belongeth to Satan: He is a hearer to carry
away <hi>the seed that falleth by the way side,</hi> Mat. 13. And
so because the word is not Satans in offer, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
uncalled, he hath no Church communion with
the Church, but the Word preached to men, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in an ordinary way is a professed communion
with all professours, for so the word of God saith, <hi>Eze. 33.
3. They come unto thee as the people commeth, and they sit
before thee as my people, and they heare thy words.</hi> And
<hi>Esa. 58. 2. They aske of me the ordinances of Justice, they
take delight in approaching to God.</hi> And <hi>Esa.</hi> 2. 2. The
peoples communion with one another in going to the
Lords Mountaine to be taught his Word, is set downe
as a marke of the called Church of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To heare or professe hearing of the word is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of God: therefore joynt-hearers are joynt-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98601:81"/>
and have communion together.</p>
            <p>3. To eate at one Table of the Lord is a profession
that the eaters are one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. with that
same Lord, and promises are offered in the word that are
sealed in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>4. All our Divines proove the Church of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> and the Church under the New Testament to
be one Church, because that same word of the covenant,
and that same faith in substance that was preached and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to us, was preached to them, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4. Heb: 11.
Heb: 13. 8. Heb:</hi> 3. 7, 8, 12, 13. none deny this but <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Socinians, Papists,</hi> and some other perverters of the
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>5. If a joynt hearing of the Word be denied to
be a Church-communion in externall worship, upon
this ground, because all that heare doe not believe,
but many scoffe at the Word, many hate it, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it in their hearts, as <hi>Separatists</hi> reason; this is most
weake and prooveth that all have not an internall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
by faith and love, but it is nothing against a
Church-communion, in the matter of Separation. Also
hence it might be concluded, none have a Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
that eateth at one Table, and eateth one bread and
drinketh one cup, except only believers, and so all Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
in the visible Church, hearing together, praying and
praysing and receiving the seales of the covenant toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one politick and visible body with believers,
should be Separatists from believers, having no Church

we can communicate in no Church, where there are

of God, <hi>Ergo</hi> separation from the Church in that kind
must be against the word of God also. The proposition
is cleare: If the sinnes of these that heare, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with me, defile the worship to me, they
defile it whether I know their sinnes or no. If a pest

infected to me, whether I know it or no, and if I be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to know it, and know it not, my ignorance is
sinnefull, and doth not excuse me. Now certainely no

no sinne in the <hi>eleven Apostles,</hi> that they knew not <hi>Iudas</hi>

               <note place="margin">6. Conclusion</note> A worship may be false in the matter
two wayes, either when we are to practice it, or give
our assent to it, as to receive the Sacraments after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
manner, to assent to corrupt doctrine, that is
never lawfull, and here we may separate from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
when we separate not from the Church. Or then
the worship is false in the matter, but our presence doth
not make it unlawfull to us; as professors may heare a
preacher who preacheth the body of divinity soundly,
howbeit he mixe errors with it, because what every one
heareth they are to try ere they beleeve, as the Spirit of
God teacheth, 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 21. Try all things, hold fast what

of God to come out of a corrupt Church, and separate
from it, if we would be in covenant with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This is no locall separation commanded the

               <note place="margin">Erasm. Sarcer. in loc. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> as <hi>Erasmus Sarcerius</hi> observeth, but a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

is from the <hi>Idol-table</hi> of the Gentiles, at which some did

8. 10. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 17, 18, 19, 20. but from this is badly
concluded separation out of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> or
any other true <hi>Church,</hi> where the word and sacraments
are in purity, suppose some errors be practised by some:

out from <hi>Babilon,</hi> seeing <hi>Cyrus</hi> had proclaimed liberty
to them to come home, and applyeth it to the case of
<hi>Corinth,</hi> that they should flye all fellowship with <hi>Idols,</hi>
and Idols temples and tables, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10. because <hi>light
and darkenesse, Christ and Beliall cannot agree,</hi> as he citeth

<hi>verse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marloratus in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> as <hi>Marlorat</hi> teacheth. Now this separation in
<hi>Corinth</hi> was in a Church from the Idolatry in it, which
separation we allow, but not a separation out of a
Church, else the wordes would beare that <hi>Paul</hi> will
have them to forsake the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
tables in it, and set up a new Church of their own,
which the Separatists dare not say, and is contrary to
other places, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4. 1 Cor. 11. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. Where
he commandeth and alloweth their meeting and publike
Church communion, therefore this place proveth not
their point.</p>
            <p>2. This separation is such a separation as is betwixt
<hi>light and darkenesse, Christ and Beliall,</hi> but the separation
is not from externall communion, which Separatists
urge, but from all spirituall and internall communion.
For <hi>Separatists</hi> teach that alwayes there are in the Church
visible hypocrites and true beleevers, for the which cause
M. <hi>Barrow</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Barrow.</note> it is compared to a <hi>draw-net wherein there</hi>


               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:98601:87"/>
are both good and bad; now Hypocrites and believers
together in one visible Church are light and darknesse
together, and externall Church communion with the
hypocrite (which is lawfull) cannot be a touching of
an uncleane thing, and so Church-fellowship with the
wicked cannot be Christ and <hi>Belial</hi> together.</p>
            <p>3. That Separation here commanded is from the worship
of God corrupted in the matter, where need force the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>

            <p>I <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. To stay in every place where sinners are, and
to haunt the wicked mans company as his companion, is
a sinfull tempting of God, suppose ye be not actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared:
but to stay in the company or Church, carefully
flying every spot and soule ayre, that may blow sin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, is no tempting of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But secondly, they thus urge,</hi> to stay a member of a
leavened Church, and keepe Church-communion with that
infected Church, is to tempt God, therfore God calleth you
to separate from that Church.</p>
            <p>I answer 1. To stay a member of that Church wholly
leavened, and where the matter of the worship is leaven,
and fundamentall points corrupted and obtruded upon the
conscience, is to tempt God, for then I keepe communion
with a leavened Church, as leavened, such as is <hi>Babell:</hi> but
the assumption now is false, and the case not so here, but
to keep my self and remain a member of a Church lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
in part with one sin, and to take no part with the
sinne, and yeeld no consent therunto is no tempting of
God; <hi>Paul</hi> joyned as a member with the Church of
<hi>Corinth,</hi> and acknowledged them as a Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98601:90"/>
to keepe Church fellowship with them, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi>
5. 4. even when this leavened lump was souring amongst
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thirdly they urge,</hi> the incestuous mans sinne not
censured, infected the Church, the infected Church infecteth
the worship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny that the sinne of the worshippers infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the worship to others that are not guilty, it infecteth
the worship to themselves, but not to others, a worship
corrupt by accident only through the fault of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper,
may and doth make the Lords Supper damnation
to the eater, and therefore the eater is forbidden so to eat;
a worship in the matter and intrinsecall principle unjust
and sinfull is defiled both to the man himselfe and to all
that taketh part with him, as the teacher of false Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
and all that heareth and believeth are defiled, but if
the sin of an unworthy communicant even knowne to
be so be damnation to himselfe, and defile the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to others, then <hi>Paul</hi> would have said, he that <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh his owne
damnation, and the damnation of the whole Church,</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> should have forbidden all others to eat and drinke
withall, who communicateth unworthily, if he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
separation, but he saith, <hi>he eateth and drinketh dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to himselfe,</hi> not to all others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But fourthly, they urge thus,</hi> We must not onely strive
to rebuke, and censure one another, but we must not stay a
member of that Church, in the which we are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to doe the duty that Christ hath commanded us, for
the station and place is unwarrantable, where we are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
to sinne, that is, to omit a duty of the Keyes, that
God hath given to all the faithfull. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we must sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from that Church, where all the faithfull may not use
the Keyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Also if the power of the Keys be in the hands
of the people, as some teach, so as they are under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of God to rebuke authoritatively, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to censure and excommunicate, their universall


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98601:91"/>
omission of that duty seemeth to be sinfull; and (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I be loath to teach Separation) I see not how the
authours who give the power of the keyes to all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians, are not to separate from all Churches
where Presbyteriall government is, no lesse then the

            <p>2. Affirmative precepts tye not in all differences of

be done, observing due circumstances; but that every
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the keyes doth not tye at all, because Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave that power to all. 2. Some duties tye abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
as to pray, these we cannot forbeare: Suppose
a Church should make a Law, like <hi>Darius</hi> to borrow
a dumbe Devill, for thirty dayes, and to pray none,
that Church should not be heard, and not acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in that. Other dutyes tye conditionally, as not to
pray in publicke with a man notoriously serving Satan,
and deserving to be excommunicate; yet if the Church
excommunicate not, wee are not to separate from the
prayer of the Church, because that person is suffered
there: so these duties that tye upon a condition that
dependeth upon others and not upon my selfe, tye not
alwayes. I am obliged to beleeve what point the Pastor
teacheth, but not absolutely, but upon condition it agrees
to Gods Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They fifthly urge.</hi> But I am necessitated in a false Church
to communicate with those whom I know to be no members
of the true Church, but limbs of Satan, because in Gods
court they are excommunicated, and no members of the
Church; but through the corruption of these that have the
power of the keyes, these are permitted to be members of the
Church, who in Gods court are no members at all; and if
<hi>I</hi> remaine in the Church, <hi>I</hi> must communicate with them,
yea if <hi>I</hi> remaine in the Church, <hi>I</hi> must communicate at
that table where the holy things of God are prophaned by
dogges and swine, therefore in that case <hi>I</hi> must sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>

            <p>9. <hi>They object, God commandeth</hi> the godly to plead
with their mother, because <hi>(saith he)</hi> she is not my wife,
nor I her husband, <hi>Ergo,</hi> if the Church turne a harlot,
the children are to protest and plead against her, as repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her no mother, and so they are to forsake her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If this place prove lawfulnesse of separation
from the Jewish Church, as from a harlot cast off of
God, it shall crosse a maine principle of Separatists,
that the <hi>Jewish Church was the onely visible Church from
which it was not lawfull to separate, seeing the Messiah be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved
to be borne there, and the Temple, sacrifices were
onely there.</hi> Also this pleading was for harlotry and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry:
But M. <hi>Smith</hi> and others say, that <hi>wickednesse and
Idolatry did not marre the constitution of the Jewish Church,
so being they had ceremoniall and typicall holinesse according
to the letter of the outward legall service;</hi> and so from
this separation from the true Church is vainly colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
2. <hi>Plead with your mother</hi> for her harlotries. Hence
it followeth first, 1. They were to esteem her <hi>as a mother,</hi>
and of duty as sonnes to plead with her. 2. If they
were to plead with her, and rebuke her, they were to
keep communion with her; because non-rebuking for
a time is a signe of separation and suspending commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for a time, Ezech. 3. 26. <hi>Thou shalt be dumbe, and
shalt not be to them a reprover, for they are a rebellious
house,</hi> Ergo, reproving is a signe of communion. But
they say, <hi>they were to plead with their mother by power of
the keyes; and if their mother would not return to the Lord
her first husband, then they were to goe on to a full separation
from her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer: Then two or three faithfull ones in the
Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> no lesse then in the Christian
Church were a true visible Church, having the power
of the keyes. This is contrary to their owne doctrine,
who make a typicall and ceremoniall cleannesse suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to constitute the Jewish Church; but require a


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98601:93"/>
reall, true, and spirituall holinesse, to the constitution
of the Church of the New Testament: For if the
children may plead with the mother for want of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
chastity and marriage-love to her Lord, and for
that contend against her, to separate from her, as from
a harlot and non-Church, then is reall holinesse requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the constitution of a visible Church amongst the
Jewes, as amongst us, which Separatists deny.</p>

what is this to separate from a Church where are the

            <p>2. That a visible Church may be a holy oblation laid
upon the Altar of God, to be offered to God, by our
High-priest Christ: It is not required for the Essence
of a true and acceptable sacrifice of worship, that all

an holy oblation, but <hi>an offering to God of Images and

beareth the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> in his breast,

               <hi>That it is not lawfull to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

grant; but every false worship doth neither make
a true <hi>Church,</hi> a false <hi>Church,</hi> or no <hi>Church;</hi> neither
giveth it a ground and warrant of Separation; for there
was much false worship in <hi>Corinth,</hi> where many were
partakers of the <hi>Idols Table,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 10. and many
denyed the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and so <hi>Thyatira, Pergamus,</hi>
Rev. 2. where were <hi>Balaams doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Jezabel the
false Prophetesse,</hi> and yet none of these are to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

observe this, that when Churches in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are most sharply rebuked, if communion with
these Churches going on in their sinnes be Idolatry
and false worship, and <hi>offering of Devils Images to God,</hi>
how is it, that the Lord and his Apostles rebuketh the
faults, but never warneth the true and sound beleevers
to separate and make a new Church, seeing this is

unto, or countenance <hi>Idols,</hi> but to communicate
with a Church where there is a prophane people and a
false worship, in some points, is not to touch unclean
garments, for the cleane and the sound worship of God
is cleane, and as for the example of <hi>Achan,</hi> it is most
impertinent, <hi>Israel</hi> knew not <hi>Achans</hi> sacriledge, till the
Lord found out the man, and if this stand good, a lurking
hypocrite, and an unseene <hi>Achan</hi> in a visible Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
bringeth a curse on the Congregation, and from
such a Congregation we are to separate, What madnes
is this, we are to separate from a society, before we
know any <hi>Achan</hi> to be amongst them. But Separatists
say, God would not have punished <hi>Israel</hi> by making them
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly before the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> Josh. 7. If <hi>Israel</hi> did take no

were punished, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Israel <hi>hath sinned and transgressed

the accursed thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, This giveth us occasion to speake a little of
the communion with other mens sins: We partake
these wayes of the Churches sins. 1. When we worke
with them, and are helping causes, this communion is
unlawfull. 2. When we counsell or perswade to false
worship. 3. When we omit what we are obliged to
doe, or commit that we should not doe, from whence
others are occasioned to sin; for by morall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
he promoveth the sin of others, who doth not
give all due and obliged diligence to hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of sin. 4. Those who consent to sin, who
approve and praise the fact, and the committers of the
fact. 5. Those that doe not rebuke sinne. 6. Those
who are not displeased for it, and doth not mourne for
it, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9. and are not humbled for it, and doth not pitty
the sinner, and pray that God in his mercy or justice


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98601:95"/>
may be glorified. Now of all these we are to consider
how <hi>Israel</hi> did properly communicate with <hi>Achans</hi>
sin. Some say there is a seventh way different from all,
when we in heart desire to doe, what others doe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly,
in the externall fact, As <hi>Israel</hi> also coveted in
their heart what <hi>Achan</hi> tooke with his hands, or when
we doe the same sinne by Analogy, that others are doing,
as the Marriners are punished for <hi>Jonahs</hi> sinne, when as
they were doing a sinne by Anology like the sinne of
<hi>Ionah:</hi> For <hi>Ionah</hi> fled from Gods presence, as if God
could not have followed him through the Seas, and had
been like the <hi>Idoll-gods;</hi> and the Marriners did the same,
they worshipped an Idol-god, and knew not the God
that made the Heaven and the Earth. Now wherein
none of these seven wayes we partake of the sins of a
Church, how can their worship be defiled to us, or
have any influence to infect us? but the truth is <hi>Israel</hi>
were guilty of <hi>Achans</hi> sin, because they did not carefully
observe, and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne one another to take heed that they
medled not with the accursed thing, but <hi>Joshuah</hi> never
dreamed of Separation from <hi>Israel</hi> for <hi>Achans</hi> sin, and
the Text saith not that; for they could not separate from
the Church for <hi>Achans</hi> sacriledge, which was not known
to them, while God discovered the same, else by this Text
we are to separate from all Churches, where there doth
live hidden and covered <hi>Achans,</hi> and unseen hypocrites,
and thus we behoved to remove and separate up to the

1. <hi>Argument.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Arg.</note> If the children of wicked parents
were circumcised, all without exception, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the wickednesse of their parents, then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of these who are borne in the visible Church of
Christians, are to receive that same seale in nature and
substance of that same covenant of grace, which is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
But all the children of most wicked parents,
were circumcised without exception. <hi>Ergo,</hi> so are the
children of Christians borne in the visible Church. The
proposition cannot be denyed by our brethren. 1. They
say circumcision was given only to members of the
visible Church, to whom the doctrine of the covenant,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. was preached, and these were professors
only within the visible Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi>

                  <hi>Best Churches plea.</hi> arg. 3. and 4. pag. 61, 62.</note> as M. <hi>Best</hi>
saith, <hi>and if children were to be circumcised because God
said (I will be your God and the God of your seed) then
because this promise is made to Christians, and to their seed
in the new Testament,</hi> Acts 2. 38. <hi>they should be baptized.</hi>
ver. 38. <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 39. <hi>for the
promise is made to you, and to your children.</hi> Whence it is
cleare, as these who were externally in covenant, were
onely to be circumcised, so these, who are externally
in covenant in the christian Church, are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
I prove the assumption, that all the male children
were to be baptized without exception. 1. From Gods
commandement, <hi>Gen. 17. 10. Every man-child amongst
you shall be circumcised,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>Every man-child in your
generation, he that is borne in the house, and bought with
money of any stranger, that is not thy seed, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised
must be cut off from his people, he hath broken my
covenant.</hi> Here is no exception, but all must be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised.
2. Also many must be circumsed, as these to
whom the Lord gave the Land for a possession, and was
<hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, according to the flesh, but the land
was given to the most wicked of <hi>Abrahams seed,</hi> so <hi>cap.</hi>
8. 3. That all the children of the wicked are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is cleare, <hi>Josh.</hi> 5. Because <hi>Joshuah</hi> at Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<hi>circumcised the children of Israel,</hi> ver. 2. 3, 7. whose


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98601:97"/>
wicked parents <hi>the Lord had consumed, because they
obeyed not the voice of the Lord, unto whom the Lord sware
that he would not shew them the Land which the Lord sware
to their fathers.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 10. of that generation the
Lord said, <hi>They doe alwayes erre in their heart, and they
have not knowne my wayes,</hi> there was in them an evill
heart, an hard heart, an unbeleeving heart, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 15, 18.
and yet God commanded <hi>Joshuah</hi> to circumcise their
children, therefore there was no more required of the
circumcised, but that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the flesh, and by that same reason there is no
more required of infants that they may be baptized, but
that they be borne in the christian Church, for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
baptisme, and the Jewish circumcision in substance
are all one. <hi>Rom. 6. 4. Col. 2. 11. Jer. 9. 26. Jer. 4. 4.
1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21, 22. This is so true, that circumcision is put
for the Nation of the <hi>Jewes, Acts 11. 2. Rom. 2. 26, 27.
Gal. 2. 7. Gal.</hi> 6. 15. which speech could not stand, if
most part of the children of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> for the parents
wickednesse were to be uncircumcised: neither doe we
reade in Gods word, that ever the children of wicked
<hi>Iewes</hi> were uncircumcised, and if their circumcision had
beene a prophaning of the covenant, and dishonouring
and polluting of the holy things of God, the Prophets
who rebuked all the sinnes of that Nation, would not
have passed in silence that which should have beene a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
sinne in them: and as God determineth the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of these that eate the Passeover, that they be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
people, and so <hi>Iewes,</hi> so doth he determine the
quality of these that are to be externally circumcised,
<hi>Gen. 17. every male child.</hi> Some answer that these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
<hi>Iosh. 5. circumcised, were the infants of parents dead
in the wildernesse, and so they were not now under the care
and tutorie of their parents, but under the care of others, and
so they might be circumcised.</hi>

God, and <hi>Isaacks</hi> God only, and not <hi>Iaacobs</hi> God, and
the God of the seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which is against the tenour
of the covenant, now if God be the God of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
seed farre off, and neare downe, to many generations,
the wickednesse of the nearest parents cannot breake the

then the wickednesse of the nearest parents, doe
not remove the mercy of the covenant from the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
because the mercy extendeth to <hi>the thousand ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations:</hi>
But the former is said, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
commandement, and therefore for the sinnes of
their nearest parents, they are not excluded from the
mercy of the covenant, and therefore neither from the
seales of that mercy. If our brethren say, we have no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of faith, that their thousand generation upward
hath been lovers of God and keepers of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and so the children in faith cannot be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>I answer first, by this argument you cannot deny bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
to them in faith.</p>
            <p>2. You have not certainty of faith,<note place="margin">

charity, as <hi>Camero</hi> saith well: and this faith you have
infallibly, that the sinnes of no one, or two, or foure
persons doe interrupt the course of Gods immutable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in the race of covenanters borne in the visible
Church, <hi>Rom. 3. 3, 4. Iosh. 5. 2, 3, 4. Levit 26. 41, 42, 43, 44.

and the seed of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and these that
are without the true Church of Christians. But if so,
that the sinnes and wickednesse of the nearest parents cut

hinder God to be their God; then these infants are in no

covenant to the seed of the faithfull to many generations
downeward, untill it please the Lord to translate his

be unbeleevers,)</hi> for that is contrary to the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boved
cited. Neither can they say, that the children of
unbeleeving parents borne within the christian Church,
have right to the covenant and the seales thereof, when
they come to age, and doe beleeve and repent, for
so the children of <hi>Turks,</hi> if they beleeve and repent
have that same right, as is cleare, <hi>Isaiah 56. 6, 7. Acts</hi> 10.

               <note place="margin">6. Arg.</note> If God in the covenant of grace and
Evangell, will not have the sonne to beare the iniquity
of the father, except the sonne follow the evill wayes of
his parents, and so make the fathers iniquity his owne:
then cannot the children of wicked parents be excluded
from the covenant, and the seales of the covenant, for
the sinnes and wickednesse of their nearest parents; But
the former is said, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 4. The sonne shall not beare
the iniquity of his father: Now infants as yet being
free of actuall sinnes, have not served themselves heires
to the iniquities of their fathers. Neither can it be said,
as some say, the children of <hi>Turks</hi> are not to be baptized,
because their parents are without the covenant, and yet

            <p>I answer, God keepeth a legall way with <hi>Turks</hi> and
all that are without the Church, and covenant of grace,
and we suppose the child borne of wicked parents to be
in the case of election, and so really within the covenant,


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98601:99"/>
and it is ordinary enough that chosen and redeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
be born of unbelieving parents, in that case who can
say that God layeth their fathers iniquities on them in
spirituall and eternall punishments, such as is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
without the covenant, and dying in that estate, to be
damned for ever.</p>

Rom. 11. 16. Now this holinesse cannot be meant of

that sense, if the fathers and fore-fathers be truly san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
and beleevers, then are the branches and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

17. or <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 for neither of these places speake of
nearest Parents, father and mother one at least; the
Text beareth no such thing, but the contrary. These
are to receive the seale of the covenant whose fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are in externall profession within the covenant;
for God commandeth not <hi>Abraham</hi> only to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his sons, but all parents descended of <hi>Abraham</hi> to
circumcise their seed, the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> carnally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to all generations: and so the nearest parents on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are not to be looked unto.</p>
            <p>2. This argument doth either proceed according to
this meaning, that these infants only are to receive the
seale of the covenant whose parents are within the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
by an inward ingrafting and union by true faith,
besides the externall professing therof; or then there
is no other thing required, but only externall professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Church without sinne may conferre the


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98601:100"/>
seales; if the former be said, it will follow that God
speaketh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. only to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his sons by
faith, according to the promise, and only to believers;
but God speaketh to all <hi>Abrahams</hi> sons according to
the flesh. 2. Because God should speake an untruth,
that he were a God by reall union of faith to all that
are commanded to be circumcised; for he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thousands to be circumcised to whom he was not
a God by reall union of faith: therefore these words
must import, that nothing is more required, that the
Church without sin may conferre the seale of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
but the children to be descended of parents
professing the truth and faith, although the parents
indeed, as concerning any reall union of faith, be plain
strangers to the covenant, and members of the Church
only as an arme of wood is a member of the body,
which being true, as it must be said, the assumption is
weake and sick. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or the question is, what it is to be
externally within the covenant, it is not to slee all
knowne sinnes, <hi>to be a chosen people, a people taught of
God</hi> (for then God would not have commanded <hi>Joshua
Chap.</hi> 5. to circumcise all <hi>Israel,</hi> because their fathers
externally were within the covenant) as this argument
would say; for their fathers were a generation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
<hi>who knew not God, who tempted him and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his holy Spirit in the wildernesse,</hi> and professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by their murmuring never to be truly within the
covenant. Then to professe the doctrine of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is but to be borne <hi>Iewes,</hi> and avow the Lord in

to be a member of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church? Is it to bee a

indeed to make men acceptable before God; but
to make one a visible member of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church
visible, nothing was required, but to be a borne <hi>Iew,</hi>
and professe Gods truth, and keepe them from externall

A man may be a just, peaceable, quiet man, and
so meet to be a Citizen in a City, but he hath not right
to the priviledges of the brughe, untill he come to them by

his childe be baptized; but also a member of a visible
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Objection proceedeth from a great
mistake, as if Church-communion with a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
congregation were more, and a better and


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98601:101"/>
nearer ground of baptizing, then Christian-communion,
which we judge to be false; because the Catholick
Church is by order of nature, and first and more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
the <hi>body, spouse, redeemed flocke of Christ,</hi> then
any particular independent congregation, that is but a
part or member of the Catholike Church; and therfore the
covenant, promises of grace, the power of the keys, the seals
of the covenant belong first &amp; principally to the Catholike
Church, &amp; to these that are in Christian communion with
her, before they belong to this or that visible part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and so all ecclesiastick power of the keys
must be first &amp; more principally in the Catholick Church,
then in a particular congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a reasonable soul by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of nature is in man, before it be in <hi>Peter, Thomas</hi> or <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I believe these are within, that are professours of
the true faith, suppose they be not members of the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> or of any setled Church, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
if they be within the <hi>covenant,</hi> and these are
without only, who are <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> not profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the true and sound faith, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> meaneth,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. Baptisme is a priviledge of the Church,
not a priviledge of such a particular independent Church,
and the distinction betwixt Christian-communion and
Church-communion in this point is needlesse and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse;
for none are to be refused of baptisme, whose
parents professe the faith and Christian-communion:
Howbeit, they by Gods providence may be cast into a
country where they are not, and cannot be (without due
examination) members of a setled Church, as one may
heare the word and joyn in publick prayer with any true
Church he cometh unto, and so having Christian-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with a true Church, he hath by that same also Church
communion. For baptisme is not like Burgess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they come to age: First this Text saith not they are
the seed of the faithfull onely that shall serve God:
For the seed of the faithfull, such as <hi>Ammon, Absolom,</hi>

such abused testimonies of Gods word from <hi>Separatists,</hi>
as they borrowed them from <hi>Anabaptists:</hi> For we preach
and invite in the Gospell all the uncircumcised in heart,

the holy things of the Gospell, and receive the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
thereof with faith: And when many come to this

not, because they prophane the holy things of God,
that Ministers who baptize the Infants of hypocrites,
and prophane persons, are accessarie to the prophaning
of the holy things of God, and that we bring in the
polluted in heart to the Sanctuary of God. It is one
thing whom Ministers should receive as members of the
Sanctuary and Church; and another thing, who should
come in, and what sort of persons they are obliged to
be who come to be members. To say that Ministers
should receive none into the Church but those that are
circumcised in heart, and cleane and holy, and cloathed
with the wedding garment of faith is more then our
brethren can prove: Nay, we are to invite to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

<hi>As many as you find bid to the wedding.</hi> But that all that

the Sanctuary and holy things of God) is most
true: But we desire that our brethren would prove
this; The Porters that held out the uncircumcised and
the strangers out of the Sanctuary, were types of the
Ministers and Church of the New Testament, who
should receive none to be Church-members, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
none to the wedding of the Gospell, but such as
have their wedding garment, and are circumcised in
heart, and are cleane, and holy, else they prophane and
defile the Church of God, as M. <hi>Best</hi> saith. We beleeve
this latter to be an untruth, and yet the strength of
this Argument doth hang upon this: <hi>They are obliged
to be such who enter into the Church, else they defile the
Sanctuary,</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Church and Ministers of the New
Testament are obliged to invite none to any Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
or receive them into a Church fellowship, but only
the circumcised in heart:</hi> Wee utterly deny this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.
It is one thing, what sort of persons they
ought to be, that should be members of the Church
(doubtlesse they should be beleevers) And another thing,
whom the Church should receive in (these should be

               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A promiscuous baptizing of all we deny:
It may import a baptizing of the Infants of <hi>Turkes,</hi> or

thinketh. 2. There is a double counting on in Gods
seed. 1. One according to Election, and so onely the
elect are counted in the seed, as is cleare, <hi>Rom. 9. Paul</hi>
expoundeth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. This counting in the seed is not
well counted to be common to all circumcised: <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists</hi>
doe ordinarily miscount and abuse Scriptures, not
caring what they cite, so that the Margen swell with
citations. 2. There is an Ecclesiasticall and conditionall
counting, whereby all baptized are in the judgement
of charity counted <hi>Abrahams</hi> heires; but with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that they have <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

               </gap>
seed, and all baptized. Hence the Separatists other two
Arguments doe not conclude: For they inferre, if all
must be baptized, that unbeleevers have alike interest
with beleevers in the seales and priviledges of the
Church, and must be counted in that same body and
state with beleevers: For to the externall priviledges
and visible body of the Church all professors (for they
are not to be reputed unbeleevers) have alike interest;


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98601:106"/>
but to the inward favours and graces sealed in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and in the true and mysticall body of Christ
they have not all alike interest who are baptized. 2. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists</hi>

And therefore children and infants, ignorants, and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously
flagitious persons, and mad persons are to be
debarred. But that none should be Church-members of
Christs visible body, but such as we can, and dare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Lords Supper, is most false: For we put a
manifest difference betwixt those that are admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christs visible body, as ordinary hearers of the word,
such as are ignorants, and many unconverted profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
and the excommunicate who are admitted to
be ordinary hearers of the word, but are not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Supper of the Lord; for so we should
prophane the holy things of God, and be accessary to
the prophaning of the Lords body and precious bloud.
Here a doubt ariseth, seeing Christ crucified is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and object of faith in the word preached, as well
as in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; and in no
sort are Ministers to be accessary to the prophaning of
the <hi>holy things of God,</hi> or <hi>of casting pearles before swine,</hi>
Mat. 7. 6. Mat. 15. 26. Heb. 10. 29. Hag. 2. 14, 15.

Num. 5. 2, 3. and Levit. 19. 22. How doe we admit the
ignorant and unbeleevers, yea the excommunicate, <hi>Mat.
22. 9. 2 Thess</hi> 3. 15. to the holy things of the Gospell
preached, which we know they shall, and doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane?
<hi>For to them the word is the savour of death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16. and <hi>Christ is a rocke of offence,
and a stumbling stone, a ginne and a snare,</hi> Isa. 8. 14.
1 Pet. 2. 8. and yet we are accessary to their prophaning
of the Lords Table if we admit such to the Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There are great odds betwixt a possible and
necessary meane of salvation prophaned, and a meane
of salvation not necessary nor possible to reach its end
for the which it is ordained: If these of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would distinguish this as Gods word doth, they
should not so stumble about the constitution of a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church: For the word preached is the necessary
and possible meane of conversion to the most flagitious
and wicked hearers; And howbeit they prophane the
word, promises, and despise Christ and his covenant
in the word preached; yet Ministers in receiving such
into Church-communion are not accessary to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning
of Gods holy things; because they are under
a necessity of offering Christ preached, as the onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
necessary, and possible meane of salvation;
Therefore we admit them to the hearing and beleeving
of the word, <hi>per se,</hi> and kindly; but to the stumbling
at the word by accident, by their abuse comming from
themselves. But the Lords Supper being a Seale of our
nourishment and spirituall growth in Christ, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth
faith, and the begun life of God, and the new
birth, and so to those who are openly flagitious and
knowne unbeleevers, it is neither a necessary meane of
salvation, nor yet a possible meane: Not necessary;
for meat and drinke and these elements cannot nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
those who have no life of God in them at all:
As bread and wine are not means at all to a dead man,
Infestment in the husbands lands, and a dowry is no
meane necessary at all to an unmarried virgin remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98601:107"/>
unmarried. Also untill the communicant beleeve
in Christ, it is not a possible Seale; for it can seale
nothing to one that is not capable of nouri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hment, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the unbeleever by no possibility can be sealed up in
a growing communion with Christ. And this Supper
is not a formall meane of conversion, but a formall
meane of the further growth and nourishment of these
who are already converted; and therefore when Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are accessary to admit to the Lords Table these
whom they know are unbeleevers, they have there
a kindly influence in the prophaning of the holy things
of God, in giving a meane of salvation to these to whom
it is neither necessary nor possible: But in admittance
of members of the Church to be ordinary hearers of
the word, their influence is not kindly, and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation
onely accidentall. The sinne is in the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of the word onely, which is a meane both neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and possible, and the fault is not in the Ministers.
For this cause are we to be more strict in admitting
to the Lords Supper, then in receiving of Church-members
to Baptisme, and the hearing of the Word.
But as we are to take care that the holy things of God
be not prophaned in this Sacrament: so also that none
be debarred by the under-stewards and servants whom
the Master of the house hath admitted. And 1. none
are to be excluded from the Table, but such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Church-censures, except the impediments be
naturall, not morall, such as age and distraction. 2. That
none are reputed uncapable, but such as are <hi>juridicè,</hi>
and in the Church-court, <hi>under two or three witnesses</hi>
convicted; for why should the Church punishments
be inflicted blindly, such as is debarring from the
Lords Table? therefore the Minister hath no power of
the Keyes himselfe alone, without the Eldership to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre
any; for then he himselfe useth the Keyes by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring,
Pope-like, without the Church. 3. Grossely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
are to be censured by the Church, and debarred:
But it may perhaps be here said, I make no evidence

of conversion required to goe before, as seene to the
Church, before they dare admit to the Lords Table, but
such as may be in hypocrites.</p>

I observed before that there be two degrees of a
Church independent, 1. In every visible Congregation
there is a number of beleevers, to whom our brethren
say, Christ hath committed the power of the keyes,
who have power to chuse and ordaine their owne offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
Pastors, Doctors, Elders and Deacons, and also
judicially to censure, rebuke, sentence, depose and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
these same office-bearers. We have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
already against this independent <hi>Church.</hi> 2. There
is another <hi>Church</hi> indepe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dent, which is that same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of beleevers new cloathed with a setled and
constituted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ldership, one Pastor, and Elders, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors:
Of this Congregation is our present question.
This Congregation againe hath either one Pastor only,
with a number of Elders; or it hath a number of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Elders who doe meet for discipline, which
is a Presbyteriall <hi>Church,</hi> such as we esteeme the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The question is of a
visible Church in both senses: And for the former, they
have within themselves some power of discipline, so
farre as concerneth themselves, as the Arguments of
our brethren doe prove, but with subordination to the
Eldership of their owne and other sister and consociate
Congregations, who shall meet in a Presbytery. The
<hi>Church</hi> in the latter meaning cannot conveniently meet
in all and every one of the members thereof, but doth
meet in their Rulers, as the Eldership of <hi>Ephesus</hi> did
meet, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17. And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did meet, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 18, 19, 20, 21.
And of this Presbytery that ordained <hi>Timothy</hi> a Pastor,
we read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. So the Eldership of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Rev.
2. 2. whereof there were a number of Pastors, as we
may reade <hi>Acts 20. 28, 29, 36. who tried those who called
themselves Apostles, and did lye, and were found lyars,</hi>
Rev. 2. 2. This Presbytery consisting of moe Pastors,
is the first ruling and governing <hi>Church,</hi> having power
of the keyes in all points of discipline within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
They have <hi>intensively</hi> power of the keyes in all


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98601:108"/>
points, and equall power <hi>(intensivè)</hi> with greater Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
and Assemblies; because ordination of Pastors by
them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. is as valide in the point of <hi>Church-discipline,</hi>
as the Decrees made in the great Councell
convented at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Acts 15. 21, 22, &amp;c. But Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
Synods, and Nationall Assemblies have greater
power then the Presbyteries <hi>extensivè;</hi> because they
have power as a great body to exercise discipline that
concerneth the whole Congregations of all the Nation,
which power is not in inferiour Elderships. Now that
there is not to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound in the word a Congregation
with an Eldership, and one Pastor that hath the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of all discipline independently, within it selfe, I
prove:</p>
            <p>1. I reason from the Apostolike Churches practise,<note place="margin">1. Arg.</note>
which must be a patterne to us: And first, let no man
say the Argument is weake, because the Apostolike
Church being lyable to persecution, and Parishes
not then setled, their order cannot be a rule to us: For
1. we have not a perfect patterne if the Apostolike
Church be laid aside, as no rule to us. 2. It is said,
Acts 9. 31. <hi>Then had the Churches rest throughout all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
Galilie, and Samaria, and were edefied, and walking
in the feare of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy-Ghost,
were multiplyed.</hi> Hence if there be not a patterne
of such an independent Congregation by precept or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
where one particular Congregation with one
Pastor, and their Eldership did exercise, or may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
all power of the keyes in all points: Then such
an independent Congregation is not to be holden; but
the former is true: For 1. an instance cannot be given
in the point of ordination of Ministers, by a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
with one Pastor. We desire an instance. 2. All
ordination by practise and precept in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is by more Pastors then one; yea by a Colledge
of Pastors, which is cleare, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 13. the <hi>eleven Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
were at the ordination of <hi>Matthias,</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Peter</hi> presideth in the action. And Acts 6. 2. the

Apostles sent <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to preach to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
and they fasted and prayed, and laid their hands
on them. So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> if there were not
more Pastors with them, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. appointed El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in every Church <hi>with fasting and prayer,</hi> Acts 20.
17. ver. 28. There was a Colledge of preaching Elders
at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and at <hi>Philippi,</hi> Phil. 1. 2. Bishops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> 1 Thes. 9. 12. a multitude, that is,
more then one Pastor that were over them in the Lord,
and laboured amongst them, and admonished them,
<hi>ver. 13 1 Tim</hi> 4. 14. a Colledge or Senate of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or Pastors, who ordained <hi>Timothy</hi> by the laying
on of hands. 2. If ordination of Pastors in the word
be never given to people, or beleevers, or to ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
but still to Pastors, as is cleare, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 22.
Tit. 1. ver. 5. Acts 6. 6. Acts 13. 3. 2 Tim. 1. 6. 1 Tim.</hi> 4.
14. And if ordination in the word of God be never
in the power of one single Pastor (except we bring
in a Prelate into the Church) then one Pastor, with
one single Congregation cannot exercise this point of
discipline, and so not all points of discipline. 3. If
the preaching Elders be charged by the Spirit of God
<hi>to watch against grievous wolves speaking perverse things,</hi>
Acts 20. 29, 30, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. and rebuked <hi>because they suffer them
to teach false doctrine;</hi> and commended, <hi>because they try
false teachers, and cast them out,</hi> Rev. 2. ver. 14. ver. 20.
ver. 2. <hi>if they be commanded to ordaine faithfull men,</hi> 2 Tim.
2. 2. <hi>and taught whom they should ordaine,</hi> Tit. 1. 5, 6, 7.
1 Tim. 3. ver. 2, 3, 4, 5. 1 Tim. 5. 22. and whom they
should reject, as unmeet for the worke of the Lord:
Then one Pastor and a single Congregation have not
the power of this point of discipline, and so they are


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98601:109"/>
not independent within themselves; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is said by GODS Word. <hi>Ergo,</hi> so is the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Argument.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Arg.</note> That government is not of God, nor
from the wisdome of Christ the law-giver, that devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
means of discipline for edifying the people by the
keyes, and omitteth meanes for edifying by the keyes
the Elders of every particular congregation; but the
doctrine of independent Congregations is such. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
this doctrine is not of God. The proposition is cleare,
Christs perfect government hath wayes and meanes in
his Testament, to edifie all rankes and degrees of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for the perfecting of the body of his Saints, <hi>Eph.
3. 11. 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. Mat. 18. 15, 16. Iohn</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23.
I prove the Assumption: If a pastor and six or twelve
Elders turne scandalous in their lives, and unsound and
corrupt in the Faith: there is no way of gaining them
by the power of the keyes; for there be but three wayes
imaginable.</p>
            <p>1. That they should censure and use the rod against
themselves, which is against nature, reason and unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Word of God.</p>
            <p>2. They cannot be censured by Presbyteries and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods;
for the doctrin of independent Congregations doth
abhorre this.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, they cannot be censured by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of believers; for 1. The Lord hath not given the
rod and power of edification, such as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh
of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 20, 21. to the flocke over the over-seers.
2. This is popular government and worse, the flock made
over-seers to the Shepheards, the sons authorized to correct
the fathers. 3. We desire a pattern of this government from
the word of God.</p>
            <p>Our third argument is from many absurdities.<note place="margin">3. Arg.</note> That
doctrine is not sound, from whence flow many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
contrary to Gods Word; but from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of independent Congregations without subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to Synods, flow many absurdities contrary to


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98601:110"/>
Gods Word, <hi>Ergò,</hi> that doctrine is not sound. The
<hi>Major</hi> is out of controversie, and is cleare; for the
Scriptures reason from absurdities, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 14, 15.
Iohn</hi> 8. 55. I prove the assumption; as,</p>
            <p>1. The Prophets shall not be authoritatively judged
by Prophets and Pastours, but by the multitude, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that, 1 <hi>Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 14. 29. Let the Prophets speake
two or three, and let the other judge.</p>
            <p>2. Authoritative and judiciall excommunication was in
the Pastors and Elders power, 1 <hi>Co. 5. 4. 1 Tim. 1. 20. 2 Cor.

excommunication into the hands of all the people.</p>
            <p>3. All the assemblies of Pastours in the Apostolick
Church, for the discipline which concerned many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
upon necessary causes shall be temporary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
and so not obliging us now, as <hi>Acts 1.

               </gap>ie the
Church, are men separated from the world, <hi>not intangled
with the affairs of this life,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 2, 3, 4, 5. therefore if all
the multitude governe and over-see both themselves and
their guides: they are not to remaine in their callings,

               </gap>, lawyers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
to give themselves wholly to the over-seeing of the
Church, contrary to that which the Word of God saith,
ordaining every man to abide in his calling, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 20, 21,
22. Col. 3. 22. 1 Thess.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>5. Believers are over-seers to excommunicate, deprive,
censure, and authoritatively rebuke their pastors, and so
1. pastors of pastors, over-seers and watch-men,
over their Over-seers and Watch-men. 2. The
relation of pastor and flock, of feeders and a people fed
is taken away. 3. That which the Scripture ascribeth
to pastor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> only, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 19, 20. Tit.</hi> 1. 13. v. 9. is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

to private professours. 6. The brotherly consociation
of the authority and power of jurisdiction in many sister-Churches
united together, is taken away, there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-communion
of Church officers, as Church officers 7.
All particular Churches are left, in case of errours, to the
immediate judgement of Christ, and obnoxious to no
Church censures, suppose they consist of six or ten pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
only. 8. The grounds of the doctrine are these
same arguments, which <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> use
against the places of <hi>Kings, Judges, Magistrates,</hi> to wit,
that believers are <hi>free, redeemed, bought with a price, all
things are theirs;</hi> and therfore all power, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence

9. It layeth a blot upon Christs wisdome, who hath

10. It maketh the Word of God imperfect, which
setteth downe no Canons, how the believers of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Church should governe, and <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth
how <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and all Church-men should
governe. 11. It excludeth not women from usurping
authority over men, by judging, excommunicating,
ordaining pastors, seeing they are the body and Spouse
of Christ as believing men are. 12. It maketh the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
no Sacraments, the baptized non-baptized,
and in the place of <hi>Turkes;</hi> if possibly the pastour and
the ten professours of the independent Church be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,
which is too ordinary. 13. By this an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly

have no more the power of the keyes, then one
single man, who may counsell and advise his brother.

it: For it is a society of believers joyned together co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
wayes in the true worship of God; which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
hath power to ordain and elect their owne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Elders, here is the power of the keyes to bind
and loose on earth, as Christ bindeth and looseth in
Heaven, <hi>Math: 18. 18. chap:</hi> 16. 19 and a ministeriall
act of these keyes, to wit, the ordaining of <hi>Pastours,
Doctors, Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> before there be any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
Doctor</hi> or <hi>Elder</hi> or <hi>Deacon.</hi> A ministery then
must only be necessary, <hi>ad benè esse, non ad esse simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
to the better or wel-being of the independent Church,
and not to the simple being of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the thing
must have a perfect constituted being and essence, before
it can have any operation, and working proceeding from
that being: as one must be a living creature indued with
a sensitive soule, before it can heare, or see, or touch; now
this independent Church, must have the perfect essence
and being of a ministeriall Church, seeing it doth by the
power of the keyes within it selfe constitute and ordaine
her owne Ministers and Pastors; and if they were joyned
in the worship of God before they had Ministers, they
did in a visible way (being a visible Church in the
compleate being of a visible Church) worship God,
before they had Ministers; for before they ordaine


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98601:112"/>
their Ministers, they must keepe the Apostolick order,
<hi>fast and pray, and lay on their hands,</hi> for so did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
<hi>Act: 1. 24. Acts 6. v. 6. Acts 13. 3. Act: 14. 23.
1 Tim: 4. 14. 2 Tim:</hi> 1. 5. So here are, publick fasting,
publick praying, publick ordination of a visible and
independent Church, and as yet they have no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
So in case the Eldership of a congregation shall
all turne scandalous and hereticall: this same inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
congregation may excommunicate them. <hi>Ergo</hi>
before excommunication, they must publickly and by
the power of the keyes, <hi>convince them of Heresie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
them, pray for them, and finally by the spirit of
Paul a Pastor,</hi> 1 Cor: 5. 4. judicially cast them out.
Now let all be Judges, if this be farre from pastorall
preaching, and if here be not ministeriall acts, and the
highest judiciall and authoritative censure exercised by
no Ministers at all; and what hindreth by this reason,
but the independent Church (that doth publickly and
<hi>authoritatively pray, fast, rebuke, convince gainsayers, make
and unmake, by the power of the keyes,</hi> pastours and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters)
may also without Ministers preach, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the Sacraments? against which the <hi>Separatists</hi>
themselves doe speake and give reasons from Scripture,
that none may administer the Sacraments, untill the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and teachers be chosen and ordained in their office.<note place="margin">Separatists confess. art. 34. p. 25.</note>
But hence we clearly see an independent Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in its compleat essence, and exercising mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall
acts, and using the keyes without any ministry
and edifying their Ministers, so that a ministry is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall,
and a stranger to the independent Church both
in its nature and working, and seeing they edifie others
without a ministry: why may not private Families, where
the independent Church dwelleth, edifie themselves
without a publick ministry? I reade in <hi>Arminian</hi>

What ground is there to tye a congregation by an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
tye of obedience to a presbytery, and a presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
to a provinciall Assembly, and a provinciall Assembly

in a positive Law of God, or in the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p>I answer, they have warrant of both: for it is Gods
positive law, that the Elders and Over-seers be over
the Church in the Lord, <hi>Heb: 13. 17. 1 Thess. 5. 12, 13.

prime officer in his name to command the whole
Church, like to the Judge and the high-Priest in the
old Testament: So <hi>Aristocraticall</hi> government is not
naturall, our presbyteries are founded upon the free-will
of Christ, who appointed this government rather
then another. Now the question, how subordination of

Synods is of natures law is harder, but a thing is
naturall two wayes, 1. simply and in it selfe, 2. and

17. Iohn</hi> 1. 12, 13. but upon supposition that God hath
given him a new nature, it is naturall or (as we say)
connaturall and kindly to this new nature in <hi>Peter</hi> to
love Christ, and to love Christs sheep and his lambes,
because every like loveth a like; So the subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not naturall: for it is not naturall for <hi>John</hi> and
<hi>Thomas</hi> to be subject to such an Eldership of this
congregation; for Gods providence might have dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> should have dwelt in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
congregation as members therof, and so subject to
another Eldership. But secondarily and by consequent
upon supposition that they are members and inhabitants
of this ecclesiasticall incorporation it is kindly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
now that they be subjected ecclesiastically to
the Eldership of Christs appointing in this congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and so the ground of the bond is <hi>(the part must
be in subiection to those who command the whole) Iohn</hi>
and <hi>Thomas</hi> are parts of this congregation, such an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98601:115"/>
commandeth the whole, therefore <hi>Iohn</hi>
and <hi>Thomas</hi> are in subjection to such an Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
So all the beleevers of this congregation and all
the beleevers of the sister-congregations are parts of this
presbytery; wheras Gods providence might have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that all the beleevers here might have beene
parts and members of another presbytery: And so by
proportion sundry presbyteries are parts of a provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Church, and sundry beleevers of many provinces
are parts and members of a Nationall Church. Now
the division of a Nation into Provinces, and of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
into so many territories called presbyteries, and
the division of presbyteries into so many congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
cannot be called a devise of mans, because it is
not in the Word of God; for by that same reason,
that <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> and so many threes and foures
of beleevers should be members of an independent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
seeing it is not in the Word, it shall be also a
devise of man. For all our singular acts are mixed, there
is something morall in them, and that must be squared
and ruled by the word; and something is in them not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
but positive, and this is not to be squared by the word;
but sometimes by natures light (which I grant is a part
implicite of Gods word) sometimes it is enough that the
positive part be negatively conforme to the word, that is,
not contrary to it: Howbeit I hold that the morality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in every action, must be positively conforme to
the word, for example the Law saith, <hi>Every male-childe
must be circumcised the eighth day,</hi> Gen. 17. 7. Now the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christs circumcision, and Christs presenting in
the Temple, and offering of two turtle Doves, and
two young pigeons is said to be according to the Law
of <hi>Moses, Luke 2. 23. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

him into the Temple, the Priest by name that offered the
Doves for him, are not written in the Scripture of <hi>Moses</hi>
his law; but the morality of that action was positively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to <hi>Moses</hi> his law: so that every part be subject to the


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98601:115"/>
law of the whole is Gods word; but that parts and whole
be thus divided it was not required to be defined in the
word. But what our brethren deny is, that as <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> are Ecclesiasticall parts of a single Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
under the jurisdiction of that single Congregation
is cleare in the word of God; but that three or foure
Congregations are parts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cclesiasticall of a Presbytery,
and Ecclesiastically subjected to the government of the
Presbytery; as <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> are parts subjected
to the government of a Congregation is utterly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But we may reply, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> are to obey
their Pastor preaching, in the Lord, and by that same
reason they are to obey their Pastors gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with the Elders in a Synod: So by that same
reason, as <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> are to obey their Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
convented in their owne Congregation to governe
them, by that same reason, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of foure
Congregations are to heare and obey their owne El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derships
convented by that same authority of Christ in
another Congregation, when a Colledge of other Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
are joyned with them.</p>
            <p>But I come to the Scriptures of God. If when the
Churches of <hi>Syria, Sylicia, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were
troubled with a question, whether they should keep the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and be circumcised, and could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
it amongst themselves in their particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
they had their recourse to an assembly of <hi>Apostles
and Elders at Jerusalem,</hi> who gave out a Decree and
Canon anent that question, which the Churches were
obliged to keep, then when particular Congregations
are troubled with the like questions in doctrine and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
they are by their example to have recou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se
to an Assembly of Pastors and Elders, that are over
many Churches, and to receive Decrees also, which
they are obliged to keep: But the former is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the <hi>Apostolike Church,</hi> Ergo, to have recourse
to a Synod of Pastors and Elders, to receive Decrees
from them, that tye many particular Churches, is lawfull
to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:98601:116"/>
I prove the assumption, A question troubled these
Churches, some false teachers said <hi>(Cyrinthus</hi> as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
thinketh) You must be circumcised after the
manner of <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiph.</note> Acts 15. ver. 1. and there was <hi>no
small dissention and disputation about this,</hi> ver. 2. and this
question troubled the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as ver. 4.
and 5. doe declare: And it troubled the Churches of
<hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cylicia,</hi> ver. 23. 2. That the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
could not well be determined in their particular
Churches, is cleare from ver. 34, from three circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
1. The maintainers of the question troubled them.
2. <hi>They almost subverted their soules with words.</hi> 3. They
alleadge a necessity of keeping <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and that it
was the commandement and doctrine of the Apostles
and Elders. 3. That in this question that troubled them
so much, they have their recourse to a Synod, is cleare,
ver. 6. <hi>And the Apostles and Elders came to consider of
this matter;</hi> and ver. 2. <hi>They determined that</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi>
Barnabas, <hi>and certaine others of them should goe up to</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
<hi>unto the Apostles and Elders about this question;</hi>
And that the Apostles who were led by an infallible
spirit, and could not erre, might have determined the
question, is cleare by their speeches in the counsell, if
the <hi>Apostles</hi> had not had a mind to set down a Samplar and
a Copy of an Assembly in such cases. 4. That there are
here the members of a Synod is cleare, <hi>Apostles, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Brethren,</hi> ver. 23. and Commissioners from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi>
ver. 2. <hi>certaine others, and the Elders of the Church
at</hi> Jerusalem, James, <hi>Paul, and the Elders of</hi> Jerusalem,
chap. 21. v. 17, 18 compared with ver. 25. So here are
Elders from sundry Congregations. 5. That these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
did tye and Ecclesiastically oblige the Churches;
howbeit all the members were not present to consent
is cleare, chap. 16. ver. 4. <hi>And as they went through the
Cities, they delivered them the Decrees for to keep,</hi> Acts
21. ver. 25. <hi>We have written and concluded that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The contrary is seen in the Text: For if the

they must be circumcised, ver. 24. Also <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>

taught the lawfulnesse of circumcision or not? But
the question is, ver. 1. <hi>Certaine men taught, except ye be

2. It were a vaine thing to say that v. 6. <hi>the Apostles

reasons from the Scriptures, and from the calling of

in question; but whether the Apostles had taught this
point, or not taught it. 4. That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
were sent to be resolved of more, then whether the
Apostles had taught this or not, is cleare by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

this Decree obligeth not as Scripture. 4. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
if they had not purpose that this Decree should
oblige as an Ecclesiasticall mandate; but as <hi>Canonicke
Scripture,</hi> they would not 1. have advised with all the

who alleadged that the Lords Apostles stood for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
otherwise <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe might have determined
the point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. 1. Paul</hi> as an ordinary Pastor, howbeit not as
an Apostle, was to submit to a Synod in this case,
as an Apostle he might have excommunicated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous
<hi>Corinthian,</hi> without the Church; but it shall
not follow that <hi>Paul</hi> did write to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to
excommunicate him for no necessity of a <hi>Church-court</hi>
and Synod, <hi>but onely to conciliate authority</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
and to stop the mouthes of enemies.</p>
            <p>2. I aske what authority doe they meane, 1. autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of brotherly advise? But these Decrees bind as the
Decrees of the Church, <hi>v. 28. chap. 16. 4. chap. 21. v.</hi> 25.
2, If they meane authority Ecclesiasticall, the cause is
ours. 3. If they meane authority of divine Scripture,
then this Decree must have more authority th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Paul</hi> could have determined the point his alone, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
there was no need of a Councell, for the Scriptures

they should have sent Commissioners. This assemblies
Decrees did lay a tye and bond upon the Churches
of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> then it did either tye them as a

as Pastors and Elders. 1. Because an offended brother can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have a Synod of Elders, and a Nationall Assembly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to complaine unto, and so Christ shall not set downe
an expedite way to remove scandals betwixt brother and
brother. 2 Christ <hi>(say they)</hi> is setting downe a way, how
an obstinate offendor shall be cast out of the Church, where
he was an ordinary hearer of the word, and a compartner
with other professors of the holy things of God, in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
visible Church. Now these of divers Congregations
partake not in a Church-communion of these same holy
things of God, Word, Sacraments, and Discipline.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Christ here setteth down a way how all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of brethren may be taken away; for Christs salve
must be as broad and large as the soare, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
must reach as farre as offences; but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
are betwixt Church and Church, betwixt the
<hi>Grecians</hi> and the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> Acts 6. 1. no lesse then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a single brother and a brother.</p>
            <p>2. I borrow the Argument and pay it home againe.
<hi>Christ setteth downe a way how all scandals in his visible
Church may be removed:</hi> So teach our brethren, as an
offended brother cannot alwayes have recourse to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Assembly, and so Christs remedy shall be insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
If by a Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. we understand a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
say they; but when the <hi>Grecian Church</hi> offendeth
the <hi>Hebrew Church,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew Church</hi> cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
to the <hi>Grecian Church,</hi> for the Law forbiddeth
the party to be the Judge; therefore if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. onely a Congregation, excluding all
Synods, Christs remedy of removing scandals betwixt
Sister, and Sister-church, shall be unsufficient; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Hebrewes</hi> must have recourse, as

many particular congregations were managed, not by one

               </gap>t independent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
but the former is true. <hi>Ergo,</hi> so is the latter.
The proposition our brethren grant. I prove the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by an induction. 1. The <hi>select Pastors</hi> of the Christian
world, and select brethren, Act: 1. did elect and ordaine
<hi>Matthias</hi> to be one of the twelve, because that concerned
many particular Churches, the publick treasury of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Churches was committed to the Apostles, because
that concerned them all, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 33, 34. When the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the <hi>Churches of the Hebrewes mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured</hi>
the one against the other, one common Synod of
the twelve Apostles authoritatively conveened, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>with praying and laying on of hands the seven Deacons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Act. 6. 2, 3, 4, 5. and <hi>Walleus</hi> saith, the argument for ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Deacons, that the Pastors might attend the word
and prayer, proveth also that there were then ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98601:124"/>
Also Act. 20. 28. there is a Synod of Pastors at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi>

            <p>9. <hi>Argument</hi> is from the care of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> the head
of the Church,<note place="margin">9. Arg.</note> in the end of excommunication. Hence if
Christ Jesus take care that one particular congregation be
not leavened, and sowred with the wicked conversation
of one, then farre more will he take care that many
Churches be not leavened, and hath ordained excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
for many, as for one; but our brethren grant
he hath taken care that one lump <hi>leaven not one single
congregation,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I prove the proposition,
For Christs remedy for remooving of scandals is hence
argued to be unperfect, if excommunication doe not
remove all offences, and prevent the leavening of many
lumpes; for he that careth for the part must far more
care for a whole Church, and ordaine excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Church, for the edifying therof, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 20,
21. 2 Cor. 10. 8. That their spirit may be saved in the day of

that is we are to separate from them, but there
is no warrant to excommunicate them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I say this is a begging of the question, for
we desire a warrant of Gods Word why sister-Churches
may use some power of the keyes against sister-Churches,
such as is to rebuke them, plead with them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 2.
and yet we may not use all power of the keyes, even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication;
now to rebuke and pleade against a
Church, to <hi>Parker</hi> and our brethren is a power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
and a sort of <hi>closing and shutting of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Iewes</hi> did justly excommunicate the <hi>Church of
the Samaritans,</hi> and Christ alloweth therof, <hi>Iohn 4. 22.
ye worship ye know not what, salvation is of the</hi> Jewes,
in which words, <hi>Christ</hi> pronounceth the <hi>Iewes</hi> to be the
true Church, and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> not to be the true
Church.</p>
            <p>3. I desire to know what excommunication is, if it
be not to deny all Church-communion with those who
were once in our Church, now if this be done by one
Sister-church to another sister-church, it is no excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
at all, seeing Christ hath not given the power
of the keyes to one Sister-church over another, for one
particular Church is not set over another in the Lord, but
when the Eldership of many consociated Sister-churches
denieth Church communion to one of these consociated
Churches having turned obstinate in scandalous sins, I see
not what this is els but excommunication and authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

and howbeit the Apostles and their universall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
ordinary to preach the Gospell to all, their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
calling, their extraordinary gifts be now out of
the world, yet it is unbeseeming the care of Christ, that
pastorall authority should be so confined at home, and
imprisoned within the lists of every particular Church,
consisting possibly of six or ten beleevers only, that the
care for <hi>many Churches,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 28. <hi>The pastorall care
to gaine</hi> Jew <hi>and</hi> Gentile, <hi>those that are within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
to be made all things to all men to save some,</hi> should
be now in no pastors on earth, but dead with the Apostles,
as if these places, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 32. 1 Cor. 9. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
Rom. 1. 14, 15. Rom.</hi> 9. 2, 3. did not presse to all Ministers
of Christ, the extending of their pastorall vigilancy to
the feeding and governing of all the Churches in their
bounds that maketh up one visible politick body, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
one with another in the acts of Church-communion.
Hence it must follow, 1. When the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Church</hi> shall be wronged by the <hi>Hebrew Church,</hi>
that the pastors may not synodically meet, and by joynt
authority remove the offences betwixt Church and

meetings of <hi>Apostles, extraordinary, temporary,</hi> and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods

as pastors to joyn their authority in one for the governing
of many Churches. 3. It followeth that <hi>Pastors and

joyne their authority in one for <hi>the feeding of the flock,</hi>
then they may take on them to <hi>worke miracles, speake

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98601:127"/>
and temporary in the conjoyned authority and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall
care of the Apostles for all the Churches of the
world, I see not, neither is it in reason imaginable,
which doth not in conscience oblige <hi>Pastors, Doctors
and Elders</hi> in the <hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> to conjoyne their
authority in one Synodicall power for all the Churches
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> O saith our Brethren, <hi>there should be too
many masters, commanders and Lords over the free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
visible Churches of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, seeing all these Pastors and Elders in a
nationall Synod, are no other way over all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then the particular Eldership in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
congregation is over the believers, there be no
more too many <hi>Lords and Masters over the whole
Churches</hi> collectively united in a general Synod, then there
be <hi>too many Lords over the particular congregations.</hi> For
1. in both meetings the beleevers choose their owne
guides and commanders that are over them. 2. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is done in either a Nationall or in a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Synod without the tacite consent of believers.
3. In both, it is free for beleevers to refuse and not

18. Nay, our brethren will have pastors so farre stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to all congregations, save only to their owne, that
M. <hi>Davenport</hi> and Mr. <hi>Best</hi> saith to the Pastours and
Churches other Churches are without, and Pastors have
nothing to doe to judge them, and they alleadge for
this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. but by these that are <hi>(without) Paul</hi>
meaneth not these who were not of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> but he meaneth <hi>Infidels and Heathen</hi> as

<hi>Hymenaeus and Alexander,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 20. who
were without the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and if this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
stand Pastors can extend no Church censure
towards these who are of other congregations, neither
can they rebuke nor admonish them as Christians, for


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98601:127"/>
these are Acts of Church-censures, as our brethren
teach.</p>
            <p>Our eleventh Argument is from the light of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
reason; for sanctisied reason teacheth that the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
authority of the greater politicke body of Christ
should help the parts of the body that are weaker, as
1 <hi>Cor. 12. The whole body suffereth when one member suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi>
and so the whole body helpeth the weaker, <hi>and
lesse honourable member,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. v. 23, 26. So universall
nature contendeth for the safety of particular nature,
and helpeth it; therefore the greater body and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
Church is to communicate its authority for the
good of a particular Congregation, which is a part
thereof: But the doctrine of independency maketh
every Congregation an independent and compleat body
within it selfe, needing no authority to governe it,
higher then its owne authority, as if it were an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
whole Church, and no part of a greater visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church: But suppose the greatest part of <hi>Corinth</hi>
deny the resurrection, as often the worst are manyest,
then I aske,<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 15.</note> whom to doth the Lord speake? <hi>Take us
the little foxes that spoile the vines:</hi> He speaketh either
to greater Synods, which we say, that the greater body
may help a part, and save <hi>a little daughter of Sion:</hi> Or
to the soundest part of the Congregation; but they are
weakest and fewest, and shall the greater body looke
and see a member perish, and not help? Let them help
(say our brethren) <hi>with advise and counsell, but not with
command and authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, <hi>Take us the little foxes,</hi> is an act of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
and disciplinary taking enjoyned to the Church.</p>
            <p>2. Our Argument is drawne from the greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the politicke body to the lesser; brotherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
is not authority. Hence authority as authority by
this meanes shall not help the weaker parts of the body,
contrary to that which we have at length commanded,
1 Cor. 12. Neither doe some reply well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he speaks,
1 Cor. 12. <hi>of Christs invisible body,</hi> because it is said, v. 13.


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98601:128"/>
               <hi>For by one spirit we are all baptized into one body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A manuscript for independent Churches, c, 1. p. 12</note> 
               <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we be Jewes or Gentiles. Jewes and Gentiles</hi> (saith
he) <hi>make not a visible Church, but an invisible Catholike
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer 1. What can hinder under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Paul</hi> a Jew to make a visible Church with the
<hi>Ephesians</hi> who are <hi>Gentiles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That he speaketh of a visible politicke body is
cleare while he alleadgeth, The eye exerciseth Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
acts of seeing for the foot, and that the eare hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for the whole body, and when one member suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
all suffer, which is principally true of a politicke
visible body: For we are not baptized in one body visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
with those preachers who are long agoe dead, who
never preached for the good of us who now beleeve in
Christ, because we never heard them preach, and so they
are not eyes seeing for us.</p>
            <p>Our twelfth Argument is from the practises of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Church in a morall duty.<note place="margin">Arg. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If Christ hath left the Churches of a whole Nation
in no worse case then the Nationall Church of the
Jewes were in, for their publike giving of thanks,
for the turning away of Gods wrath, when the <hi>Land
is defiled with bloud</hi> and other Nationall transgressions,
for the <hi>bringing backe the Arke of God,</hi> for the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Nationall Covenant and Oath with God in case of
universall Apostasie from God and true Religion. Then
hath Christ ordained to Churches in the New Testament
Nationall Assemblies, which authoritatively onely can
reach these ends and effects.</p>
            <p>But Christ hath left the Churches of a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in no worse case then the Nationall Church of the
Jewes was in, for reaching the foresaid ends and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have to prove 1. That the Jewes had their solemne
Assemblies for these ends. 2. That these Assemblies were
morall, and so concerne us. 3. That these ends cannot
be attained without Nationall Assemblies, which being


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98601:128"/>
done, I trust the Argument shall stand strong.</p>
            <p>For the first I may prove both in the Iewish, and
after their example in the Christian Church, Deut. 29.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> I will first answer these reasons, and withall
shew how the people had hand in excommunication,
and might prove that there was a Presbytery of many
Pastors at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and not a single Congregation of one
Pastor, and some few Elders and beleevers, who did
excommunicate. I retort these Arguments: These with
whom the fornicator did converse, and so leavened them,
these who were pus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed up, and sorrowed not at the
mans fall, and at his not being cut off by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
these were judicially to excommunicate with
the Elders: But the fornicator conversed amongst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
women and children, and did leaven them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
women and children were puffed up and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
not, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Beleeving women and children did
judicially excommunicate, but the conclusion is foule,
and against the Argumentators, <hi>Ergo,</hi> so must some of
the premisses be foule and false, but the assumption is
most true; therefore their major proposition must be
false; therfore they must first acknowledge a represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Church with us, and that men onely did judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98601:130"/>
excommunicate, and not all the faithfull, except
they make women ordinary Judges usurping the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

puffed up, and sorrowed not at his fall, &amp;c. must be
more then the number of the persons who should judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
excommunicate.</p>
            <p>2. The authors of Presbyteriall govern.<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> exam. say,

receive not Ministeriall spirit from God, neither is
such a spirit promised to them: Give an instance in
Scripture of this promise, and we shall lose this cause;
but this spirit for doctrine and discipline so given to
Pastors, 1 Cor. 4. 21. 2 Cor. 10. 8. Col. 4. 17. 2 Cor. 4. 1.
2 Cor. 5. 18. 1 Cor. 12 28, 29. v. 17. therfore the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

power of the keyes, as an Elder, must be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Eldership of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and cannot be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

yet <hi>were puffed up and sorrowed not,</hi> v 2. therefore this is

of beleevers, men and women meeting with <hi>Pauls spirit,</hi>
and his presbyteriall power of the keyes in an authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

be a gathering together of these who had such a spirit

<hi>Paul</hi> would not say they command the beleevers to
doe that which they had no authority and power from
Christ to doe, if all beleevers had <hi>not power judicially
to excommunicate.</hi> But I answer, beside that this is to
bring in a popular government in Gods house; they


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98601:132"/>
consider not that they presuppose as granted, what we
justly deny, that all and every verse of this chapter is
spoken joyntly and equally to all both Elders and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which cannot in reason be said, as in other parts
of the epistle, where sometimes he speaketh of all, as
1 Cor. 1. 1, 4, 5. both pastors and people, sometimes of
the people, 1 Cor. 1. 12. 1 Cor. 4. 1. sometimes of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
only, 1 Cor. 3. 12. 1 Cor. 4. 2. 2. One and the
same word <gap reason="foreign">

to both Elders and beleevers have divers meanings,
according as it is applied to divers subjects, so that the
Elders did excommunicate, and purge out one way,
that is authoritatively and with <hi>Pauls spirit,</hi> and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall
power; I meane that same power in kinde
and speech that was in <hi>Paul</hi> was in the Elders, for
<hi>Paul</hi> was no Prelate above other pastors, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did purge out the leaven another way, by a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>consenting</hi> that he should be excommunicate, and
this is well grounded on Scripture, see Acts 4. 27, 28.

gave one and the same religious worship to God and

it hence follow that the <hi>fornicator</hi> is no member de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
and in Ecclesiasticall subjection to the Church
of <hi>Corinth?</hi> So some of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 12.
are reproved for denying the resurrection; for this was
the fault of some, and not of all: But will it follow,
these some were no independent parts of the <hi>Church of
Corinth,</hi> but an independent Church by themselves?
The faults of remisse discipline may be laid upon a
whole Nationall Church in some cases, when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

a particular Church faileth in this and this point of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;

right to Christ, the <hi>promise, life eternall</hi> stand good, not
only one Church shall not be over another; but also
<hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> cannot be <hi>over the flocke in the Lord,</hi>
nor have <hi>the charge of them, nor watch for their soules:</hi>
The contrary whereof you shall reade, 1 Cor. 12. 17,
28, 29. 1 Thes. 5. 12, 13, 14. Heb. 13. 17. Ephes. 4. 11.


<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98601:136"/>
and the reason is good, but truly better with <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
then with men fearing God; because Pastors and
people, King and Subject, Doctor and Scholler, being
beleevers,<note place="margin">Act. 10. 34.</note> have all <hi>received like precious faith, and
right to the tree of Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for God is no accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By this Argument three beleevers in an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Congregation consisting of three hundred shall be
no dependent part in Ecclesiasticall subjection to three
hundred, and every three of independent Churches shall
be a Church independent, and twenty independent Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
shall be in one independent Church, because all the
three hundred beleevers have <hi>received alike precious faith,</hi>
&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>3. The consequence of the Argument is most weake,
for <hi>precious faith and claime and interest in Christ</hi> is not the
ground why Christ giveth the keyes to some, and not
to others, but the ground is the good pleasure of Gods
will. Christ gave not the keyes, nor any Church-authority
to <hi>Judas, Demas,</hi> and the like, because of their
precious faith; but because he calleth to labour in his
vineyard, whom he pleaseth, and whom he pleaseth he
calleth not.</p>

and confession of party, and <hi>Pauls</hi> testimony,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. there are none given of <hi>Christ, when he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

and gathering of the Saints to Christs second comming,
save only Pastors, and Doctors and Elders. But the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
gifted men are to edefie by publike prophecying,
and they be none of Christs officers, and they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
teachers.</p>
            <p>2. To preach publikely as ordinary messengers. (I say)
ordinary, because of our expectants of the ministery,
who preach by the call of the Church, for a time, as
the <hi>Sonnes of the Prophets,</hi> while they be ordained Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.
To preach (I say) publikely, is a formall act of
Pastors who are sent, Rom. 10. but these Prophets are
not sent, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ought not to preach. They answer
but as <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> doe, who say <hi>to be gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God is to be sent;</hi> but I answer, <hi>Paul</hi> Rom 10.
14, 15. thinketh not so, because he understandeth such
a sending, as is required in ordinary Pastors, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
faith in their hearers, v. 14. <hi>and whose feet are
beautifull upon the monntaines, by bringing glad tidings of
peace,</hi> v. 15. Now these were such as both were gifted, and
had authority to preach. 2. Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. clearly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenceth
gifting of Pastors, v. 1. from authoritative <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>

v. 5. v. 16. And also <hi>John</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23. 3. Because
God challengeth such as run, and the Lord <hi>sendeth them
not,</hi> Jer. 23. 21. 4. <hi>Because no man taketh that honour on
him, except he be called of God, as was</hi> Aaron, Heb. 5.
Suppose he be gifted as our Saviour was. 6. Publike
Preachers have power authoritative <hi>to binde and loose,</hi>

the booke, and may speake of their owne spirit, how then
were the pen-men of Scripture infallible, saith <hi>Robinson?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, there are none simply infallible but God,
<hi>every man is a lyar:</hi> The pen-men of the Scripture were
infallible, because when they were actually inspired by
the Holy-Ghost, they could not erre: And the spirits
of all Prophets are to be tryed by the word, even of
<hi>Paul</hi> preaching at <hi>Berea:</hi> But it followeth not that
<hi>Paul</hi> then could erre. To this they answer, that false
Prophets, as <hi>Balaam,</hi> could not erre when they were
actually inspired, no more then Canonicke writers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In the case of infallibility all are alike, none
are infallible by any infused habit of a Propheticall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
but false Prophets were inspired with an habituall
spirit of lying, which spirit is not in Canonicke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<hi>Robinson</hi> and others of his side thinke them not
extraordinarily inspired. 1. Because these Prophets might
have been interrupted and put to silence, that another
to whom choiser things were revealed, might prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<hi>v.</hi> 3. 2 Because <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth to pray for the gift
of interpretation, and <hi>to covet</hi> (saith others) <hi>to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</hi>
Now we cannot seeke in faith from God an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and miraculous gift. 3. Others adde, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying
was subject to the free-will of the Prophets,
for they might prophesie, or keep silence, as they pleased;


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98601:139"/>
but the acts of extraordinary prophecying are not subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the free-will of the Prophets; therefore this was
but ordinary prophecying, to the which all gifted profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
even out of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>1. <hi>Conclusion, Pareus</hi> observeth well that there be two
kinds of Prophets. 1. Some who foretold things to

extraordinarily inspired with an extraordinary grace of
interpreting Scripture: The former were Prophets in
the old Testament, the latter especially Prophets of the
new Testament; knowledge of both were given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
study or paines. So there was a Propheticall spirit
in <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1. 12. <hi>I received it not of man, neither was

            <p>The Propheticall spirit in the New Testament see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

            <p>3. <hi>Conclu.</hi> Hence prophecying is not a habit, and
it is a habit. It is not an habit. 1. Because no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

man Christ, especially of things to come by contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
causes <hi>(the presence of which things</hi> (saith <hi>Suarez)

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cy also is an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.
For 1. something remaine in <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
while they sleepe, and prophecy not, from whence
they are named Prophets, and really are Prophets; for
when God hath once revealed himselfe to one as to
his owne Prophet, even from by past revelation. 1 There
remaineth a disposition to prophecy, 1 Sam. 3. 20. <hi>All</hi>
Israel <hi>knew, even from</hi> Dan <hi>to</hi> Beersheba, <hi>that</hi> Samuell
<hi>was established to be a Prophet of the Lord.</hi> 2. Because
there remaineth a propheticall light, whereby the man
gave ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt to the last propheticall revelation, and so
the species and propheticall images must remaine
in the fantasie, and with these a propheticall memory
of by past predictions, and so some experimentall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
that what he fore-telleth shall come to passe:
See <hi>Thomas and Caietan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thomas 22. q. 172. ar. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> now the object propheticall

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 2.</note> 1. When the naked naturall
images or species of the materiall object are only cast
in by God and no more, and this is most in dreames,
as <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> saw a tree in his dreame, but knew
not that it was a King, <hi>Pharoah saw seven blasted reeds
and seven leane kine,</hi> but knew not that they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
yeares of Famine. And sometimes in a vision being
in an <hi>extasie,</hi> as <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 1. saw 1. <hi>seven candl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sticks,</hi>
but knew not that they were the <hi>seven Churches of</hi> Asia,
while Christ revealed the meaning to him. 2. The


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98601:140"/>
images and species are knowne formally, as signes sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
thus and thus, as <hi>Joseph</hi> by a propheticall light
saw the seven leane kine to be seven yeares of famine.
3. Now there is a third light, to judge of the act
of seeing, which I take to be two-fold. 1. When the
Seer and Prophet is perswaded that what he seeth is
a propheticall vision, and not a delusion of <hi>Satan,</hi> this
is (as saith <hi>Pareus)</hi> the very light of prophecy,<note place="margin">Pareus prolog. in com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r. 1.</note> or
some extraordinary light (as saith <hi>Anto, Walleus)</hi> There
is another light whereby the Seer beleeveth these things
shall come to passe,<note place="margin">Anton Walleus i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> loc. com. de Theol p. 18.</note> which he seeth, either by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
light of historicall faith, as <hi>Pharoah</hi> might beleeve
that seven yeares of plenty should come, and <hi>Balaam</hi>
that Christ <hi>the starre of</hi> Jacob <hi>should certainly arise and
shine upon the</hi> Church, or the Seer seeth and beleeveth
by light of saving faith, as <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> beleeved
that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be slai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and this latter light
whatever good Schoole-men say on the contrary, is the
light of faith; for the three former lights might well
be in <hi>Balaam.</hi> 1. He might see in his fantasie, the
species of the <hi>starre of Jacob.</hi> 2. And know that they
meaned no other thing, then the <hi>Messiah.</hi> 3. And be
certainly perswaded that he saw so, and that he was
not deluded, yea and historically beleeve that that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Starre</hi> should arise, and yet he had no light of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith to beleeve that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should come.
So h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e we cannot but distinguish betwixt a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
light, in the second and third sight, which is
<hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> a free gift, and the light of saving
faith, which is <hi>gratia gratum fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iens,</hi> a saving grace
of GOD in the sound beleever, onely in this last
sight.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Conclus.</hi> Hence <hi>Separatists</hi> may see that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
acts of prophecy may well be subjected to the
determination of the Church, and yet be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inspirations, and that divers wayes.</p>
            <p>1. Because the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were Prophets of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so grace being more aboundant now nor


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98601:141"/>
under the old Testament, it can bow and facilitate free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
to acts of prophecying, and <hi>Paul</hi> from more grace
laboured more aboundantly then they all.</p>
            <p>2. Prophecying at that time in <hi>Corinth</hi> might well
be obtained by prayer upon the extraordinary impulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the spirit, as <hi>Daniel</hi> obtained by prayer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of a dreame, neither can it be proved from
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. that <hi>Paul</hi> willeth them all without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to covet to speake with tongues and to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but only these that were extraordinarily moved to
pray, except these <hi>(v. 31. yea may all prophecy)</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to these words <hi>(1 Cor. 12. 29. are all Prophets?)</hi> which
we cannot say.</p>
            <p>3. Because it was of old in the power of Prophets
to use some meanes to dispose themselves to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for when the passion of anger overclouded the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and the species therin, then <hi>Elisha calleth for a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strell

3. The Kings and Judges were to teach according to
the judiciall Law the equity of their sentence to the ill
doer, as a Judge to convince a thiefe and a murtherer may
lay before him the eighth and the sixt commandement in
so farre as the breach of these disturbeth the peace of the
common-wealth, not as they are Church scandals, and
whither the male-factor be convinced or not, the Judge
punisheth with the sword, so that the Judges hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the judiciall law, and his handling of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
law now is meerly civill and coactive, neither is
he to labour the conversion and repentance of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and so ecclesiasticall edification; but the handling
of the law by the <hi>Separatist</hi> Prophets is meerly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall
and for the conversion of soules, and they are
the only preachers who gather the Church of Saints;
<hi>Pastors and Doctors are not to convert soules to</hi> Christ,
<hi>but to confirme these who are already converted and made
Saints by their Prophets,</hi> neither is the Prophets hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the law civill, coactive or regall, all which they
teach themselves: So are we to thinke of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
of <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> they taught in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

<hi>by whom we beleeve,</hi> and <hi>sent to open the eyes of
the blinde</hi> as Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. It is a most vaine
consequence. So also from <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> a generall of an
army his publick praying having the spirit of adoption,
asking helpe from the Lord of Hoasts before the armies
joyne in battle, can no wayes be concluded that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoshaphat</hi>
was a publick Prophet, for then at all times,
as in that extraordinary warre, hee should publickly
pray for the people in all Church-meetings, as did the
Priest.</p>

which no man, in reason, can say. 4. To intend


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98601:143"/>
and to appoint time and place for obedience to any
Commandement of God doth rather make the action
the more good and landable, as the more deliberation
in an ill action the worse, and the more deliberation
in a good action the better, <hi>Psal. 119. 30. v.</hi> 62, 106,
147.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither is that Objection more against us then against
the word of God, while some say,</hi> If private Christians may
teach, exhort and rebuke one another, then may they preach and
expound the word of God.</p>
            <p>I answer 1. For one private person to preach to one
and that occasionally is no lesse unlawfull, then for one
of intention and fore-setting time and place to preach
to many.</p>
            <p>2. The word maketh mutuall exhorting lawfull, and
condemneth the mutuall preaching of private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
            <p>3. Private exhorting and teaching differ. 1. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
rebuketh swearing as a publick watch-man, with
care for many, <hi>Ex officio specialis delegationis,</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively</hi>
by the power of the keyes, the private
person rebuketh swearing out of charity, with care
onely of these with whom hee converseth withall,
by noe power of the Keyes. A Watch-man giveth
warning of the approach of the enemy, and the
common Souldier may doe the same, the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
teacheth one lesson, the schoole-fellow tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
that same, the one by office, the other of
common Charity. 2. The Pastour interpreteth
the word, the private person doeth but use, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and accommodate the sense and interpretation
of the word to his owne act of beleeving, and
the acts of admonishing, rebuking, comforting his
brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfthly they object against Synods.</hi> The Pope is
the Antichrist, because he willeth men to appeale from their
owne Churches to him, as <hi>Whittaker</hi> and <hi>Chamier.</hi> prove;
but the doctrine of the Synods teach men to appeale


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98601:144"/>
from particular Churches to Synods, and by no word of
God have Pastors power over other Congregations, nor their
owne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Antioch</hi> appealed from corrupt teachers, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 2, 3. and that is Apostolike; but to appeale from a
Church to <hi>a man of sin,</hi> as if he were the whole Church
is Antichristian.</p>
            <p>2. If sixe beleevers in a Congregation of forty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
should censure a brother, our brethren would
say that brother should appeale from these sixe (who
yet make an independent Congregation) to the Church
of forty, yet should not this be Antichristian.</p>
            <p>3. To appeale from a Church as an unlawfull ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory
is unlawfull, but to appeale from a lesser
Church, as from a not competent Judge, to that same
Church in a larger meeting is most lawfull.</p>
            <p>4. That Pastors of divers Churches have power over
many Congregations, being convened in a Synod is
cleare, <hi>Acts 1. Acts 6. Acts</hi> 15.</p>

as Pastors,</hi> but as Christians either may administer the

the Sacraments, which is both Popish and absurd, or
that it is not lawfull for Pastors to administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

of another congregation then their owne, and so yet
communion of Sister-Churches, in these acts, is cleane
taken away. 2. Our Argument is from Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

ring is put on his ring-finger in token he is married to
the Church;</hi> but what have we to do with such trash
as this? For in a word, the comparison of a marriage
in this point is either Popish or unseasonable, or both;
because the mutuall consent betwixt <hi>A. B.</hi> and his wife,
being essentially marriage, as the Canon Law, Divines,
and sound Casuists acknowledge, it maketh <hi>A B.</hi> a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and also the husband of such a wife during their


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98601:145"/>
life-time; but election of the people that <hi>A. B.</hi> be their
Pastor, and <hi>A. B.</hi> his acceptation of the Church as his
charge, maketh him not both a Pastor, and also the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
of that Church; because the ordination of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
maketh <hi>A. B.</hi> formally and essentially a Pastor,
I meane a called Pastor under Christ; but the election
of the people and his consent doth not make him a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
but doth only appropriate him after he is made
a Minister to be the Minister of such a Church, and so
the comparison halteth in the maine point for which
it is alleadged; therefore <hi>A. B.</hi> is made indefinitely a
Pastor for the Church, and is obliged to labour the
conversion of all, within and without the bounds of his
Church, in as far as he is a Pastor: But forasmuch as
the Church thinketh good to appropriate his Ministery
to this particular congregation, for the more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
congregating and gathering of the sheep of Christ,
he is not so their Pastor, as he cannot exercise Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
acts towards others also, neither doth the place,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and 1 Pet. 5. 2. insinuate any such marriage-relation
betwixt Pastor and Parish, as that he is a
Pastor to none but his owne Parish, for as he is to
seed specially, <hi>these over which the Holy-Ghost hath made
him overseer,</hi> and amongst whom he is principally by
the Churches speciall appropriation and application of
his ministery to them: So also hath the Holy-Ghost
made him an over-seer to feed indefinitely, and as Gods
providence shall offer occasion, as many <hi>as God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by his bloud,</hi> Acts 20. 28. and as many <hi>as are the
Lords heritage,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 3. whether they be of his owne
congregation or no, as the words clearly import, and
he is a Pastor to them as they are the Lords heritage
conquered with his bloud, and not because he is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Pastor over them, and no more.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Arg.</hi> Beleevers of divers congregations are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a visible politicke body, and are to keep Church-communion
together in exhorting, rebuking and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98601:146"/>
Lords Table, and be made one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27. but by
this doctrine they may not eat at one Table of the
Lord; For if the Pastor may not administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lawfully to persons of divers congregations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may they receive the Lords Supper from him; for
if it be unlawfull for the Pastor to administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to these of other congregations, seeing he is
to them as a Non-Pastor, and as a Christian only, they
cannot lawfully receive the Supper of the Lord from a
Non-Pastor: Yea, and Pastors baptizing Infants of other

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98601:146"/>
Scripture of the ordination of Pastors and officers of the
New Testament that way. No man ever alleadged any;
one place in Numbers they bring, where the <hi>children of
Israel are said to lay on hands on the Levites;</hi> but judge how
six hundred thousand sighting men <hi>could all lay their hands
on the Levites?</hi> and these were not all Israel, but certainly
these must be the heads and Princes of Tribes, who put
hands on the Levites, as the word is often taken, as
I observed before. Now ordination is an act of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
such as is to send an Embassador; but that an
Embassador consent to goe (such as is election) is
no act of jurisdiction: For a father to give his daughter
in marriage to one is an authoritative act of a father;
but for the daughter to consent to the choise, is no act
of authority, but an act of her private choise. 2. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
is that which formally makes the man and
Pastor: The peoples election doth only appropriate the
mans ministery to such and such a people: It is one thing
to make a gold ring, this is an act of art, and another
thing to propine and gift the ring to such a person.
M. <hi>Jacob</hi> saith, <hi>the people hath power to reject a Minister

sending them to preach to the <hi>Indies,</hi> who are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to receive their ministery is onely essentiall to make
a man sent thither a Pastor; for peoples consent in that

consent at all, and <hi>non ens</hi> cannot be essentiall to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a Pastor.</p>
            <p>2. What is essentiall for making a Minister who is
extraordinarily called of God, is not ever more essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
to the making of a Minister ordinarily called of God,
in an Island where the Gospell is, if all the Pastors should
dye, the people might chuse Pastors to themselves, but


<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98601:147"/>
they could not then make Pastors, God onely without
the ministery of other Pastors in that case should make
Pastors; but it followeth not hence that Pastors ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

to <hi>A. B.</hi> That power is given by the Presbyteries
act of ordination, by order of nature, before the peoples

putteth it on her finger, presupposeth it was a gold ring

            <p>10. If two or three <hi>(saith M.</hi> Smith) faithfull ones have
power to make a Church,<note place="margin">10. Object.</note> then have they power to make the
Ministers of the Church, but two or three have power to
make a Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> two or three faithfull ones have power to
make the Ministers of a Church. He proveth the <hi>major.</hi> They
who can doe the greater can doe the lesse, to make a Church
is greater; for the Church is the Body, Spouse and Wife,
the Ministers are but an ornament of the body, and so the
lesse: The assumption he proveth, two or three faithfull ones
have Christ, the holy things of <hi>David,</hi> the promises. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
two or three have power to make a Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> These who can make a Church mysticall have
power to make a Church ministeriall, or Ministers of a
Church: that I deny: As for the probation, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<hi>(These who can doe the greater can doe the lesse)</hi>
must be right taken: It is true, in these same kind of
works, and in the same kind of power. Christ <hi>can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
sinnes,</hi> Ergo, he can doe lesse, he can say to a sicke
man, <hi>take up thy bed and walke:</hi> So if by prayer <hi>Jacob</hi>
obtaine a blessing from God, which is greater, then by
prayer he will obtaine deliverance out of the hands of
<hi>Esau,</hi> which is lesse; but in powers of divers kinds it
holdeth not true: A beleever by prayer may obtaine
grace and perseverance, which is greater, but it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee can <hi>open the eyes of the blind,</hi> and
worke miracles, which is lesse; and therefore howbeit
three can make a mysticall Church, which is greater, by a
power of saving grace (which is <hi>gratia gratum faciens)</hi>
It followeth not, that therefore they have a ministeriall
and pastorall power of the keyes (which is <hi>gratia gratis
data)</hi> to preach and make Ministers: For then, because
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> hath power to beleeve that Christ buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
shall rise againe from the death, which is greater;
therefore she hath power to preach and baptize, which is
a lesser power: He who hath power to make a ship, hath
not for that power to make a cup.</p>

               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:98601:149"/>
11. Smith <hi>reasoneth thus:</hi> These who have the true
matter and forme, have the property which ariseth from the
matter and forme, that is Christs ministeriall power to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
all the meanes of their edification to salvation; but
two or three faithfull ones are the true matter of the Church
of the New Testament, and therefore have the true forme
or covenant of the New Testament, and so have a ministeriall
power arising from these two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. These who have the true matter and forme of a
mysticall Church</hi> of beleevers, these have the union and
property of a mysticall Church <hi>resulting from matter
and forme,</hi> is most true; but they have not for that
the true property of a ministeriall Church; faith, and
the <hi>covenant</hi> written in the heart is not the forme of
a ministeriall Church, but of a mysticall Church of
beleevers. Sixe borne Scottish men dwelling in <hi>Paris,</hi>
make a body of Scottish men; but they are not for that
a politicke body of Scottish men living according to
the Lawes of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Foure beleevers are a mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Church borne over againe by the Spirit of Christ;
but if they be no more but single beleevers, they are
not for that a ministeriall Church, which is necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a politicke body governed by Christs Lawes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of shepheard and flocke: But this man will
have three beleevers, because they are beleevers, to be
Ministers, and so taketh away all vocation and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Church-officers by the Churches authority,
which is flat Anabaptisme.</p>

whether or no is a <hi>Democracie,</hi> and the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
government of the Church in the peoples hands?</p>
            <p>I answer affirmatively, seeing calling, ordination, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring,

Church-guides are in their hand, I see not what they
want, and wherein <hi>Morellius</hi> erred.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Quaere.</hi> Seeing hence it followeth that single be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
are to pray publikely, and exhort publikely, and
<hi>authoritatively convince gainsayers</hi> at the ordination and
deprivation of Pastors, if they may not also publikely
preach and administer the Sacrament?</p>
            <p>I answer: If you give to single beleevers one pastorall
Act, you may with the like weight of reason give to them
all.</p>
            <p>3. Whether or no is a ministery necessary in a visible
Church?</p>
            <p>I answer: seeing all these eminent acts of the Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
charge by an ordinary power may be performed by
single beleevers, I cannot see any necessity of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
            <p>4. Whether or no then is every mysticall Church of
beleevers, because it is such, a ministeriall Church, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the keyes both in use and power?</p>
            <p>I answer: The former doctrine standing it is.</p>

borne also a <hi>Key-bearer to open and shut Heaven?</hi>

6. 6. be not then quite out of the Church?</p>
            <p>I answer, in <hi>Churches independent</hi> it is quite gone.</p>

doth not inferre, that such a Church, where
they are baptized is a false Church in the matter, and so
in its constitution false? Hence I leave it to be answered
by authors of independencie, if they should not separate
from such a Church?</p>
            <p>9. Seeing we judge Papists cruell in excluding from

and if the sins of one unbeleeving Father, where many
foregoing generations have been <hi>lovers of God, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of his Commandements,</hi> doth exclude the Infants from
the Covenant made with these beleeving forefathers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We are to judge them in no Covenant with
God by the former doctrine. Hence we require that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture where God is said to shew mercy on a
wicked race of people: Yea, whose nearest parents were
most wicked rejectors of Gods Covenant, and that for
the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Joshuah, 5. 3, 4,

word of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 16. and to doc Church-businesse
and works of mercy toward the poore by their dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
and commissioners: We aske if consociated Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
tyed together in a visible Church-communion of acts
of divine worship be not with as good reason a visible po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
body of Christ, as many beleevers consociated in a
Church-communion, if acts of divine worship doth make
a particular Congre-gation. 2. If the former Church hath
not the power of the keyes upon the grounds of a visible
Church-communion among themselves, as a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath the power of the keyes upon these same grounds?
3. If these consociated Churches be not a visible <hi>Body,
Spouse, and covenanted people with God in Christ,</hi> as well as a
little Congregation of sixe or ten beleevers? 4. If such
a greater body may not meet in their overseers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
discipline, and governe the particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as a Congregation doth meet in their principall
members, and governe themselves, and all the members
of the particular Congregation 5. We aske a reason,
why in a Congregation of three hundred beleevers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
one Word and Sacrament, a hundred of the three
separated from the other two hundred cannot meet and
exercise the power of the keyes by themselves alone,
because one worship, and one government doth equally
concerne them all, and by that same reason it should not
be affirmed of ten Congregations, all partaking one Word
and Sacraments upon occasions which neighbourly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation
doth furnish, that one cannot meet to exercise
discipline in matters which in reason equally concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all the ten Congregations without subordination
to the joynt authority of all the ten? For if a hundred
of three hundred cannot exercise discipline there alone,


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98601:152"/>
without the other two, reason would inforce one or two
congregations of ten consociated congregations cannot
meet, without subordination to the whole ten, wherof
one or two congregations are part; if ten be owners
of one ship, six cannot meet and dispose or sell the ship,
or repaire her cordadge, or any decayed part, without
the power of the other foure, whom it concerneth; so
if ten congregations be visible owners and copartners
of one Gospell one worship, one externall profession,
and one communion with a brother, or separation from
a scandalous person, we aske a reason how one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
can meet and dispose of that common wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
government, and haunting familiarly with, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
from a member of the Church, without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to all the ten congregations, whom it doth
concerne?</p>
            <p>15. If the Eldership of one congregation make one
visible representative Church ruling and governing the
absents, we aske why the Eldership of <hi>six congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
may not judicially meet and rule six congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
also?</p>
            <p>16. If the power of the keyes be given to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,

<hi>Prophet, and all things are theirs, Paul, Apollo, Cephas,
the world?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It is asked, if none have the power of the keyes,
but beleevers, and if all acts pastorall of <hi>preaching, binding
and loosing,</hi> excommunicating performed by unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Ministers and Professours be not hence made null,
as performed <hi>à non hab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Pagans</hi> had performed these? We thinke they must

            <p>2. We thinke children baptized by unbeleeving Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
not baptized.</p>
            <p>3. An unbeleeving pastor not essentially a pastor.</p>
            <p>4. If, because Christ is <hi>given to the elect, and all things
are theirs,</hi> and so all ministeriall power of the keyes, it
is questioned, if amongst these all things given to the


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98601:152"/>
beleevers, we may not include the Magistrates sword,
the Kings power, the masters power over the servant,
the Captains power over the souldier, so that by that
same reason there be no Kings, no Judges, no Masters,
no Captains, save only beleevers, we see not how this
followes not, as well as that the power of the keyes,
and all things are given to beleevers, because Christ is
given to them.</p>
            <p>5. We aske if the power of the keyes in binding and
retaining sinnes be not given to unbeleevers, or rather
for them as Gods intended end, to declare the glory
of his Justice in the vessels of wrath, as <hi>Rom. 9. 17.
Esa. 8. 14. 2 Cor. 2. 16. 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>Quere.</hi> If the distinction of a true Church. 2. A
false Church, and 3. no Church can stand? And if the
distinction of true baptisme, 2. false baptisme, but valid
and such as is not to be repeated, 3. and no baptisme can
stand?</p>
            <p>I answer, the doctrine of independency standing, we
see not how a Church wanting the right matter and
consisting of members who are not professed beleevers
having saving faith, can be any thing but a non-Church,
and such as is a non-Spouse, a non-body of Christ, and a
non-covenanted people, and so wanting all power of the
keyes.</p>

baptisme, not to be repeated, I leave to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

by the former grounds, it can be no baptisme. But some
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay it is the baptisme of the Church, and so valid,
suppose the Minister be an unbeliever, and so want
power.</p>
            <p>I answer, the whole congregation may be unbelievers,
as is the Minister, and so yet the baptisme comming from
the Church, cometh from these who want power, and
cannot be valid.</p>
            <p>2. Suppose the congregation be a company of believers,
yet I see not how by their authority they can make the


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98601:153"/>
baptizing of a Pastor wanting all power to be valid, for
then if the Church should baptize by a <hi>Turke</hi> or a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
that baptisme should be valid, which no man can
say.</p>
            <p>18. What sort of an Assembly was the meeting, <hi>Act.</hi>
15. if it was a lawfull Synod of sundry particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

doth not oblige us? If it was a meere Apostolick meeting

how commeth it that the multitude spake, and
gave their mind in that which obligeth us as Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick

us?</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 19. How commeth it that the Lords Apostles,
who were to goe through all the Nations of the world to
preach the Gospell, doe so often assemble together to
consult about the common affairs of the Church and
discipline, as <hi>Act. 1. Act. 2. Act. 4. Act. 6. 4. Act. 8.
14. Act. 11. 1. Act. 13. 1, 2, 3. Act. 15. Act. 21. 18. Act.
20. Paul</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> v. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 14. it is questioned seeing these assemblies of many
pastors from sundry Churches (because the Scriptures saith
they were occasioned by the present necessity of ordering
things belonging to all the particular Churches) if they
were only temporary, extraordinary and Apostolick
meetings, which oblige not us to the like practise, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
there be the like cause of meetings in the Church
now, as errours and corrupt doctrine in many particular
Churches, as were <hi>Act.</hi> 15. the murmurings betwixt
Churches, as <hi>Act.</hi> 6. a suspitious practise of a pastor, which
seemeth to be against Gods law, as <hi>Peters</hi> going in to the
uncircumcised, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>20. Whither or not <hi>Paul</hi> did not some things as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
as writing of Canonick Scripture, working of


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98601:153"/>
miracles. 2. And some things as a Christian, as <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 3. And some things as an ordinary
Elder and Pastor of the Church delivering some persons
to Satan, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. and whither or no is <hi>Pauls</hi> rod and
authority, and his power of excommunicating, whereof
he speaketh, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 21. 1 Cor. 5. 4. 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 8. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all believers? Our brethren must say, it is common
to all believers.</p>
            <p>21. If the power of the keyes be given to all believers,
a question is, 1. If Pastors have no other power of the
keyes, but that same that believers have, seeing the ground
of Christs gift is one and the same, to wit, alike interest
in Christ, and if alike power of preaching, baptizing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
be in <hi>Paul,</hi> and all believers? 2. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no the calling of Christ and his Church doth not

               </gap> of the keyes to none at all, wee
see not, but our brethren must deny that the calling of
the Church giveth any other power of the keyes then
the believer had before he was called. 3. If there be not
a greater power of preaching, baptizing and binding and
loosing in the believers then in pastors, seeing believers
give the power to pastours, and may take it away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>22. If six believers be excommunicated, and that just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>clave non errante,</hi> yet remaining believers, it is questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
if they keepe not still the power of the keys? they
must keepe that power, and yet are no members of Christs
visible body.</p>
            <p>23. I desire a place may be produced in all the old or
new Testament, where a ministeriall or governing Church
is taken for a company of only believers? This our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
teach.</p>
            <p>24. If all authoritative Assemblies, for renewing a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98601:154"/>
with God, restoring of the worship of God, be
1. A part of the paedagogy of the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and
removed by Christ? 2. If these Assemblies in the
Churches of Christ now be a species of <hi>Judaisme?</hi> This we
deny.</p>
            <p>25. If believers exercising the most eminent acts of
ordaining pastors, publick censuring, depriving and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
pastors, publick convincing gain-sayers,
be not formally hence made by our brethren, <hi>over-seers,
watch-men for the soules of Pastors and guides, and so Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of Pastors?</hi> We answer affirmatively, they are by the
former grounds.</p>
            <p>26. Let the godly and learned consider, if the Patrons
of independent Churches are not to give obedience to
Decrees and Canons of Synods, for the necessity of the
matter, as a brotherly counsell from Gods Word ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
in conscience the brother to whom the counsell
and advise is given; howbeit the tye be not authoritative
by the power of the keyes, and if in that they are not to

            <p>Neither can some here well understand the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.

clearly differenced from the teaching <hi>Doctor,</hi> v. 7. from
the <hi>exhorting Pastour,</hi> and him <hi>who showeth mercy in

            <p>Many answers are given to elude the force of that

then are there two sort of Elders, for <hi>à qualitate
&amp; ab adjuncto subjecti ponitur subjectum ipsum:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
if <hi>Paul</hi> make the well ruling Elder worthy of
double honour, and more especially the teaching
Elder, then hee acknowledgeth some well-ruling
Elder worthy of double honour, howbeit, hee
labour not in the Word. A reason is; because the


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98601:156"/>
positive and comparative are ever differenced, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a number, when both are specified with particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
as here, they are by <hi>(well-ruling)</hi> and <hi>(labouring
in the word and doctrine.)</hi> The Author of the Survay
durst not looke this place in the face. <hi>Bilson, Field</hi> and
<hi>Tylen</hi> deny our major proposition.</p>
            <p>If one should say <hi>(say they)</hi> a preacher is worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
honour, especially a painfull Preacher, he should not say
there be two kinds of Preachers, some Preachers thus and
thus, and some painfull Preachers, and a King is worthy of
honour, especially a iust King, he should not make two sorts;
some are Kings, and some are iust Kings, as Deacons and
Pastors are two sort of Offices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. He who saith a Pastor is worthy of honour espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
a painfull Pastor,</hi> should clearly insinuate that two
sort of honours were due to Pastors two wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
For in the former part he should speake of
the office, which indeed is worthy of honour; In the
latter part he should speake of the officer <hi>in concreto,</hi>
laudably discharging his office; but <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not
so; for he speaketh not of the office, and the officer,
of the abstract and concret, of the office, and the use
and exercise of the office, as is here alleadged; but he
speaketh of officers in the exercise and use of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in both: He saith not Elders are worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
for that might well beare this sense; that the
office of an Elder is worthy of double honour, which
sense should be most true; for the office of an Elder
is worthy of double honour, which sense should be most
true; for the office of an Elder is worthy of honour.
Suppose the man be wicked; but the Apostle speaketh
not of the office, but the officers, and the praise-worthy
exercise of the office: <hi>The Elders who rule well are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of double honour,</hi> and so the example is not alike.</p>
            <p>2. If <hi>Paul</hi> had put downe a generall onely in the
former part, and said, <hi>an Elder is worthy of honour,</hi> this
answer might have had some colour (howbeit but a
colour) But now <hi>Paul</hi> putteth downe <hi>a speciall: El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98601:156"/>
who rule well are worthy of double honour;</hi> and with
these another speciall sort of Elders, <hi>especially these who
labour in the word and doctrine;</hi> and so clearly he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
downe two particular species and sorts of Elders:
Now to make good the sense of the objectors of this,
they must say, <hi>a worthy Preacher who ruleth well is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of double honour, but especially a worthy Preacher is
worthy of double honour;</hi> Therefore of necessity some
Elders who rule well must be meaned in the former
part, who are not meaned in the second, and these can
in good reason be no other but ruling Elders and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Elders; for these same sort of Elders cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in both places.</p>
            <p>3. And this sense, suppose it should stand, should have
but a colour of reason, because you shall never find the
Spirit of God commend and praise the simple exercise
of an office; but the right and conscientious exercise
thereof. Gods Spirit will not say, he who ruleth, and
he who preacheth is worthy of double honour; but he
who ruleth well and preacheth well is worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
honour.</p>
            <p>4. By this wild interpretation men may be <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>well-governing Pastors,</hi> who labour not in the
word and doctrine, and so the dumbe Prelates, who
hold it all one to be damned to a Pulpit, and to a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill,
shall be Pastors worthy of double honour. Now
<hi>Paul</hi> will not say this of a right Bishop, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 2.
Tit.</hi> 1. 9. because good governing in a Pastor includeth
labouring in the word and doctrine, as the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
the part: For preaching is a speciall act of
overseeing and well-governing of soules, <hi>Jer. 1. 10. 2 Tim:</hi>
4. 2. Because the word is the instrument of pastorall
governing, how can Pastors rule well by using aright
the word of God, except they labour in the word,
which is the shepheards staff: of right governing and
painfull preaching, <hi>Heb. 13. 17. Acts 20. 28, 29, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And so the Apostle shall say one thing twice; to wit,
these Pastors who rule well in labouring in the word


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98601:157"/>
are worthy of double honour, especially these Pastors
who labour well in the word and doctrine.</p>

<hi>Hierom</hi> acknowledge, that <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are

And so the kingly power in generall as given

God the Creator for the good of all societies whither
heathen or Christian. So <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Darius, Nero,</hi>

kingly power is considered in a speciall manner, as it is
in a Christian, whether professing onely the Gospell, or
truly beleeving in Christ, and so in relation to Christs

in kind in heathen <hi>Nero,</hi> and in Christian <hi>Constantine,</hi>
As a heathen man is as essentially a father to his owne
children, and a husband to his owne wife, and a King to
his owne subjects; as a Christian man is a father, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and king to his owne children, wife, and subjects.
Neither doth Christianity superadde, and give of new
any kingly power to a King, because he is now become
by Gods grace of a <hi>Heathen King,</hi> a <hi>Christian King,</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
addeth indeed a new obligation to imploy his
kingly power, which he had full and entire before, now
in its exercise and use to more regall and kingly acts,
as to take care that the Gospell be soundly preached,
the Sacraments and discipline of the Church kept pure,
and heretickes punished according to that, <hi>he to whom
much is given, from him much shall be required:</hi> But the

kingly power and authority to performe these regall
acts; but being yet a heathen, he wanted <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Rom. 13. 1, 2. 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 17. but this power

is, and may be in a heathen King; therefore kingly
power and Christian power are here carefully to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,
and a Christian Kings power as a Christian,
is more then the Turks power in Church-matters. Hence
our Adversaries here dethrone and degrade the King;
for they give the King a head-ship and dominion over
the Church as he is a Christian man, and take that head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
from him as a King; because if the <hi>Turke</hi> by sword

What then if the King discerne that to be truth, and
absolve the man, whom the <hi>Church-Assembly</hi> doth

            <p>I answer, the infallible rule of judging for both is

the Word of God, which speaketh home unpartially
to both, if they will heare, but certainly the Kings
civill, kingly coactive power to compell men to doe
their duty remaineth the highest and most supream pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on Earth, <hi>in genere potestatis politicae,</hi> in the kind of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
power, and pastors and all men may, by this power, be
compelled to do right, as for the abuse of the power, it is no
part of the power, and in this kind the King hath a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
politick and kingly suffrage and voyce in all Church
Assemblies, no ecclesiasticall constitution hath the force
of a law without the politick suffrage of the civill Judge.
And againe the ecclesiastick power that Christ hath
given to his Church remaineth: also the most supreme
power under Christ <hi>in genere potestatis ecclesiasticae,</hi> and
the King is subject to this power. The King is not
excepted in this, <hi>He that despiseth you despiseth me,</hi> and
in this, <hi>whatsoever ye shall binde on earth shall be bound
in Heaven,</hi> and in this, <hi>whose sinnes ye remit, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and whose sinnes ye retaine they are retained,</hi> and
this ecclesiasticall power being the highest on Earth,
Pastors may command Kings in the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 10,

            <p>I answer, by asking which of the two shoulders, in a
mans body are highest, and nearest to the mans head?
Certainly one of them in a well proportioned body is
not higher then another, and both are alike neare the head,

that the King his person, and as he is a Christian

is not subject to the Physitian, but only the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
as he is a wounded man is subject to the art of his owne

not by coaction, so the Image-maker or he who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
pourtracts, in his art is not subject to the King, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the King as King, Master of the art of painting,
or pourtract-making, the art onely is subject to the precepts
and principles of art, but the person of the painter is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the kingly power;<note place="margin">Bellarm. contra Barcl. c. 2.</note> for the King, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> saith,
may forbid the Image-maker to draw obscene and filthy I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
or to waste too much gold or silver upon his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or to sell his images at too deare a price. Hence, saith
he, the kingly dignity is not subject to the ecclesiasticall
power, or to any other power on earth, but only to Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>I answer, the Prelate doth well difference in the art
of paintry these two. 1. That which is artificiall and
is only ruled by art, that the King cannot command,
another thing which is morall, as that he sell not his
Images too deare, and hurt not the common wealth by
spending vainly too much gold and silver on his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and in this the King may make lawes to limit
the Painters <hi>morall carriage,</hi> but then he and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes


<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98601:167"/>
honour not the King, who call <hi>him judge over
all persons, and of all causes, or in all causes:</hi> and that
without any distinction; for when two Shoomakers
contend about a point of tanning leather, the King is
not Judge in that cause, because it is a point of art
which belongeth to the art, not the King. Also the right
translation of the Bible out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Greeke</hi>
in the vulgar language is a cause meerly ecclesiasticall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Church Assembly, it were hard to make the
King being ignorant of these mother languages, the Judge
of that version, as he is made by them Judge in all causes
ecclesiasticall, howbeit, <hi>de jure,</hi> he is a politick Judge,
even in this judging by a coactive and kingly power, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
<hi>de facto,</hi> and through ignorance he cannot exercise
the kingly power that God hath given him in this
act.</p>
            <p>2. By this comparison, the <hi>Prelate</hi> putteth upon the
King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut a course peece of country honour. <hi>O</hi> (faith he)
<hi>as King, I make him above all, and subject to no power
in Heaven or Earth, but immediately to God;</hi> forsooth
so make you the Painter, the Shoomaker, the Fashioner
subject to no power in Heaven and Earth, no not to the
King, but only immediately to God, only their persons
are subject to the King, and so is the person of the <hi>King as
a Christian man, not as a King,</hi> subject to Pastors, who
may exhort him and rebuke him when he judgeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly.</p>
            <p>But 3. saith the Prelate, <hi>The wounded Emperour is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to his servant the Physitian who cureth him, not as
Emperour, but as a wounded man, and that of his owne
free-will and not by coaction.</hi> What meaneth this <hi>(not
by coaction)</hi> but that a King, neither as King, neither as a
Christian man is subject to Church-discipline, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
of Pastors, by any ecclesiasticall coaction, or
any law of God, but of the Kings owne free-will? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how Court-parasites doe dishonour the Lord, for if
<hi>Nathan</hi> by Gods commandement was obliged to rebuke
<hi>David</hi> for his adultery and murther, and the man of God


<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98601:167"/>
obliged to cry against <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Altar, and the Seer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to reprove King <hi>Asa,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> commanded
to speake against the Kings and Princes of the land,
and if the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> were plagued of
God, because they would not heare and submit to
the Prophets speaking to them in the name of the Lord,
then the King as a Christian man is subject to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
power, not of <hi>his owne free-will,</hi> as this flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
saith, but by such Ecclesiasticall coaction as God
layeth upon all men, whose spirits are subject to Christs
kingly power.</p>
            <p>4. This comparison halteth fowlely. In the art of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
ye may abstract that which is morall from that
which is artificiall; but in a King as a King, there is
nothing artificiall, or which is to be abstracted from ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and piety; for all the acts of kingly authority as
kingly, are morall acts of justice, and of piety in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
both the Tables of the Law (if a King command
a stratagem of war, that which is meerly artificiall is
not from the King as King, but from a principle of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
art in him, as an expert souldier) if then the King
as King be a morall agent and a preserver of both Tables,
then as King he is subject to the Ecclesiasticall power.</p>

with us a Pastor maketh a Sermon of the necessity
of a Pastor, shewing what a person the Pastor should be,
after the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 1. 22. The looking out
of a man is sometimes given to the multitude of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
with us, according to that, Acts 6. 3. The Apostles
say, <hi>Wherefore, brethren, looke ye out seven men.</hi> But or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
this beginneth at the Presbytery, or Colledge
of Pastors, from whence things take their beginning,
<hi>Acts 1. 15. And in those dayes</hi> (when the Church wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an Apostle) Peter <hi>stood up, and said,</hi> Acts. 6. 2. <hi>then
the twelve called the multitude.</hi> When they wanted <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi>
Acts 21. 18. the matter is brought first to the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership,</hi>
Acts 11. 30. the Disciples charity is sent to the
Eldership. <hi>Paul</hi> sent <hi>Timothy, Titus, Sylvanus,</hi> whom
after the multitude did approve, <hi>Acts 14. 22. 2 Cor.</hi> 8. 16.
and so doe we.</p>
               <p>2. The person is tryed, 1. by <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and
so by the Presbytery. 1. his ability, <hi>that he be able to
teach others,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 3. <hi>that he be apt to teach,</hi> 1 Tim.
3. 2. Tit. 1. 9. else the <hi>Timothies</hi> of the Church lay
<hi>hands suddenly on him,</hi> contrary to 1 Tim. 5. 22. So the
Presbytery tryeth according to these Canons with us,
his skill in the Tongues, <hi>Latine, Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Greeke;</hi>
his ability of preaching popular Sermons, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
Scripture, in controversies, in Chronology, and
the history of the Church, and he must be proved and
tryed by the people, by preaching sundry Sermons to
them, 1 Tim. 3. 10. <hi>And let these first be proved, and let
them use the office,</hi> what ever officers they shall be, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
Doctors, Elders or Deacons.</hi> Also his grace and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
is tryed by both people and Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
3. 2, 3. his ability to governe, <hi>v. 4, 5. Acts 6. 3. Titus</hi> 1.
7, 8, 9. his fidelity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. and he must bring a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimoniall
or Christian Letters of recommendation, from
those amongst whom he lived as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
               <p>3. When all this is done he is not yet a Pastor. Then
a day is appointed, wherein an Edict is read and affixed
on the Church-doore, and another day set for his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98601:170"/>
at which day the Edict is called, all who have
any thing to object against his life and doctrine are thrise

<hi>Isaiah,</hi> Isa. 6. 8. Jer. 6. v. 7, 8. Acts 9. 20. Then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor

23. <hi>and the man must please the whole multitude,</hi> as Acts

of publike fasting on the Lords day, as if the
Christian Sabbath were a day onely of spirituall feasting
and rejoycing, because that day Christ ended the worke
of redemption and second Creation, is a wronging of
the Christian Sabbath, which is ordained for the whole
publike worship of God, joying, sorrowing for sinne,
learning Gods will in all and every point, as the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Sabbath was not ordained onely for Meditation on
the worke of Creation, but for worships of all kinde:
The worship of this day, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. is as large as prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,

of every particular Congregation who hath power of

<hi>to rebuke publickly these who sinne publickly,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.

the publick worship, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 20, 21. 1 Cor. 14.
33, 40. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. Hence there was an Eldership ordained
in every Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 23. Also seeing every particular
Congregation is a visible ministeriall Church, having
power of the Keyes in preaching the Word, though
they be but a small number, <hi>as two or three assembled in
Christs name,</hi> Mat. 18. yet have they a promise of Christ,
of his presence for binding and loosing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18, 19, 20.
in things which belong to themselves.</p>
               <p>The second Assembly is a Classis of many Pastors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from sundry congregations who have power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:98601:174"/>
in respect that the person excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
doth keep company with many consociated Churches,
and so as a leaven may infect many, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4. Mat. 26,
59. Joh. 11. 47. Act.</hi> 20. 17, 18. and for this cause one
Pastor of a single Congregation not being able to ordaine a
Pastor (because it wanteth example in the Word of God)
therefore a <hi>Colledge of Presbyters,</hi> or a <hi>Presbytery of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors

to excommunicate and ordaine Pastors is necessary in

so may deprive and excommunicate him, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 14.
Act.</hi> 20. 17, 18, 28, 29. These are to assemble together, and

trying and judging of the gifts of the Prophets and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
cannot be extraordinary, for if that were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and temporary, there should be now in the Church
no Colledge of Pastors who are to try the Pastors, <hi>that they
lay not hands on them suddenly,</hi> 1 Tim 5. 22. and are to take

handle matters of discipline which concerne the whole
Province, and many moe Congregations, which differeth
not from the Presbytery, but that it is a greater Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

there were many Pastors and Elders at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>

of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Churches about, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 18, 19.

In this Assembly a Moderator is chosen, who ordereth,

               <p>All our inferiour Assemblies have brotherly correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
by mutuall advise and counsell one with another,
but none have authoritative power over another, as 1 <hi>Cor.
16. 1, 2, 3, 4. 2 Cor. 8. 1, 2, 3. Col.</hi> 4. 17. By reason of our
Assemblies, no man though most eminent in gifts, piety,

hath power <hi>to cast out the brethren out of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By Assemblies order of gifts, and subordination
of the part to the whole is maintained, as <hi>Antioch</hi> is
inferiour to both <hi>Antioch, Jerusalem, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi>
convened in a Synod, <hi>Acts 15. v.</hi> 23. compared with 28.
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. both the Church of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and the Church

               <p>3. <hi>By Assemblies, schismes, dissentions,</hi> Acts 15. 2 <hi>and
errors or heresies</hi> subverting the soules <hi>of these of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches,</hi> Antioch, Syria, <hi>and</hi> Cilicia, <hi>ver. 23, 24.
are removed out of the Church, and unity preserved.</hi> In
keeping of the Decrees of Assemblies particular Churches
doe well, <hi>v.</hi> 28. and so are the Churches established in the
faith, and increase in number daily, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 4, 5. and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is restored to it's purity, and the Land enters into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to seeke the Lord God of their Father, and rejoyce
at the oath, and seeke the Lord with their whole desire, and
he is found of them, 2 <hi>Chron. 15. 12, 13, 14, 15. and this
have we found,</hi> So long as we were as <hi>Judah,</hi> who ruled

               <p>In Church-censures, we proceed thus: In private faults
if a brother offend a brother, he is admonished alone

before the offended Congregation: He standeth in

on <hi>a scaffold</hi> spake to the people, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 30. and the
practise of <hi>Ezra,</hi> who read to the people the booke of

adjoyned, which is a debarring of the offender from the
Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. which is our lesser excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
               <p>3. Our third censure is the greater excommunication,

excluded onely from the publike prayers and seales of
the Covenant, not from private prayers and hearing of
the word, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 15. For the Church intendeth in
that censure the <hi>saving of his spirit in the day of the Lord,</hi>
1 Cor. 5. 5. and the hearing of the word is that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
