            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OF an intended Meeting, to be held by <hi>George Keith</hi> and his Friends, at their uſual Meeting-place, in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners-Hall,</hi> in <hi>Philpot-Lane,</hi> the 29<hi>th.</hi> day of this inſtant and preſent Month called <hi>April,</hi> 1697. to begin about the 9<hi>th.</hi> Hour. To which Meeting <hi>William Penn, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ellwood, George Whitehead, John Penington,</hi> and theſe of the ſecond Day's weekly Meeting at <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> are justly deſired to be preſent, to hear themſelves recharged and proved Guilty of theſe vile and groſs Errors and Hereſies, wherewith they have been formerly charged by <hi>George Keith,</hi> and proved Guilty off, at a Meeting held at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> on the 11<hi>th.</hi> of the Month called <hi>June,</hi> 1696. notwithſtanding of the pretended Anſwers and Defences, given by <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> in his pretended Anſwer to the exact Narrative of the Proceedings at <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners-Hall,</hi> at the aboveſaid Meeting; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the pretended late Anſwer and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> in his late printed Book, call'd, <hi>An Antidote, &amp;c.</hi> At which Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be held at the Time and Place above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, by Divine Permiſſion and Aſſiſtance, and by permiſſion of the Civil Authority, he is further to detect the vile and groſs Errors of the abovemention'd Perſons; with reſpect to four great Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion, to which theſe Errors and Hereſies are directly Repugnant; the which Errors, as they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the printed Advertiſement and Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive expreſly mention'd, are here again expreſly rehearſed, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That Faith in Chriſt, as he outwardly Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is not neceſſary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Juſtification and Sanctification is not by the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there is no Reſurrection of the Body that dyeth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Chriſt is not to come without us in his Glorify'd Body, even the ſame that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Suffered Death for our Sins, to Judge the Quick and the Dead.</p>
            <p>At which Meeting alſo, he purpoſeth to ſhew, that the Anſwers and Defences given by <hi>Thomas Ellwood,</hi> and <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> in their late prints, in the vindication of themſelves and ſome of their Brethren are (as to the principal things charged againſt them) weak, impertinent, falſe and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably Sophiſtical; and that notwithſtanding their ſeeming preſent contradiction to ſome of theſe groſs Errors, and diſowning them; yet until they diſown, retract, and acknowledge their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Errors, as they ſtand upon Record in their printed Books, they are ſtill juſtly chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with them. But this they refuſe to do, for one hath in print by approbation of their 2<hi>d.</hi> days Meeting) put his and their Infallibility and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability in a Claſs, with the Immutability of God and Truth, ſaying, <hi>God is the ſame, Truth is the ſame, His People is the ſame</hi>; but <hi>George Keith</hi> is not the ſame. And let all impartial Men judge, with what Conſcience theſe Men can ſay, they are the ſame as ever formerly they were (ſince their profeſſion of being Quakers,) <hi>as God and Truth are the ſame (with whom is no varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs nor ſhadow of change)</hi> as to all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles, Doctrines, Words, and Sayings, and yet ſo palpably to contradict their former Aſſertions, that ſtand upon Record in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Books, againſt them. Is not this thick <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> darkneſs that may be felt? notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their falſe pretences to the <hi>Light within,</hi> which they <hi>ſtill hold to be ſufficient to Salvation without any thing elſe</hi>; ſo exclude the Man Chriſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and all that he did and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us on Earth, and his Mediation and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us now in Heaven, as being joyntly concerned, as a neceſſary concurring Cauſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Divine Light and Spirit</hi> in the work of our Salvation: And in their ſo doing, notwithſtanding their fained pretences to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, yet do what in them lyeth to throw down the Chriſtian Faith and Religion, and ſet up Deiſme and Gentiliſme in its place; which all ſincere Chriſtians ought to be awakened to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and contend againſt; and more eſpecially ſuch as Occupy the Room and Place of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Teachers and Paſtors, to oppoſe (not with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but Spiritual Weapons) this ſpreading Gangrene and Contagion, that hath infected, and doth at preſent infect many Thouſands in theſe three Nations, and many abroad in other Places.</p>
            <p>To which ſaid Meeting, to be held on the 29<hi>th.</hi> of this Inſtant, at the ſaid place, any moderate and friendly People of other Profeſſions (as well as theſe call'd Quakers) have freedom to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſo far as there is room in the place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, hoping they all will ſo peaceably and civilly demean themſelves, as to give no offence either to Civil Authority, or to any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by any undue or unſutable Behaviour of Words or Actions.</p>
