         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>REader, I am one of the leaſt,
but of thoſe who are peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

And amongſt thoſe I am not the firſt,
who have undertaken to lay open thoſe
defects, to which the moſt learned are
ſubject. Where is that <hi>Moſes</hi> who ſtill
doth not ſtammer, although God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

Defects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I have here noted, are
not ſo fatall in their conſequences, as
that of <hi>Shibboleth</hi> was unto the Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
Howſoever we ſhould indeavour,
to correct our ſelves unto the truth, and
to ſpeak as uprightly and as properly
as we can. Amongſt a multitude of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
and places which deſerve a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
I have onely taken a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and have ranked them by no other
order, but by that onely of my memory,

and according to that meaſure which
it hath preſented them unto me. A work
more compleat and exact doth pertain
to the great Maſters of knowledge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom I do commend the care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Nevertheleſs, If time, or reſt, or
life; if ſight, or light, (and which is

onely from cuſtom and vulgar
uſe, I ſhould not here make mention
of it. But it is authorized by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Tranſlation, reviewed, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
re-imprinted. For all the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations
of <hi>Math.</hi> 6. and <hi>Luke</hi> the 11.
do with one voyce pronounce, <hi>Who art

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not here ſtudy at all to give an
Anſwer to thoſe, who immediatly will
reply; Is it not all one, If we ſay that
<hi>GOD is in Heaven</hi> or <hi>in the Heavens?</hi>
A man experienced in the Scriptures
will never ſpeak it. The difference is
very great betwixt Heaven in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and Heavens in the Plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
And although in ſome matters,
the Singular be indifferently pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
as the Plurall, as in <hi>Math.</hi> 16. and
19. and <hi>Math.</hi> 18. and 18. yet this
difference is not univerſall. On the
contrary, It is of great importance to
diſcern, when the Scripture ſpeaks of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64307:5"/>
                  <hi>the Heavens,</hi> and when it ſpeaks of
<hi>Heaven;</hi> Of which I will not treat at
this preſent, It ſhall ſuffice to ſpeak, that
the word <hi>Heavens</hi> in the Plurall, doth
far more expreſs the extent of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of GOD, whom in that Prayer we
do implore; And alſo that Terme doth
imply, that he hath all the Heavens at
his ſervice to aſſiſt us, Not onely the
Angels who are in the higheſt Heaven,
but the Sun and the Stars alſo, which
are in another Heaven, and beſides
them, the Rain, and the Air which is
alſo called Heaven. In the ſame Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>The Heaven</hi> in which the Angels
do perform the Will of God, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by the Singular number from
<hi>the Heavens</hi> in the Plurall, which our
Father doth fill with his preſence and

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64307:6"/>
Is it <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven?</hi>
No, It is, <hi>Who art in the Heavens.</hi>
Wherefore then do we not ſpeak it ſo?
Wherefore do we not tranſlate the
word, as they are in the Original Text?
Is it becauſe the Ianguage of this Iſland
doth want a word to expreſs the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi>
in the Plurall? The contrary is
ſufficiently known, as by experience
it is evident. Is it becauſe the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of one word, to which the people
have a long time been accuſtomed,
would appear either ſtrange or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.
We ought to regard more the
truth of God, then the cuſtom of men.
And it will not be ſo uneaſy in a new
Tranſlation, to change a ſuppoſition
in the ſingular number, into a truth, in
the Plurall.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, it is here requiſite, that
I meet with, and prevent a ſubterfuge,
which may be uſed, For it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
The Evangeliſts themſelves
repeating the paſſages of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
in which <hi>the Heavens</hi> are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the Plurall, have tranſlated in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64307:6"/>
                  <hi>Heaven</hi> in the ſingular number, As may
appear in the 7th. of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the
46. verſe, in comparing it with the 66.
of <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. To which I anſwer, That
we are not Evangeliſts of ſuch a rank
as they were, and that our Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
proceed not as theirs did from the
Dictates of the infallible Spirit, And
when we render the new Teſtament
into any other language, we ought to
expreſs the very terms of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
and the Apoſtles, And likewiſe
when we tranſlate the old Teſtament,
we ſhould repreſent the very terms
thereof.</p>
               <p>It is remarkeable that in all the New
Teſtament the Son of God did never
ſay. <hi>Your Father which is in Heaven,</hi>
or <hi>My Father which is in Heaven,</hi> But
alwaies, <hi>which is in the Heavens; In the
Heavens</hi> in the Plurall. The Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
do recite a great number of the
paſſages in which he hath ſaid, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
or <hi>my Father which art in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;</hi>
But not that he ever ſaid, <hi>The
Father which art in Heaven.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64307:7"/>
then, Do we make him to change
his ſtile in the Prayer which he hath
preſcribed to us? But the Engliſh
Tranſlation doth change alſo all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places in which Jeſus Chriſt doth
expreſs the <hi>Heavens</hi> in the Plurall
Number, when he ſpeaketh of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe, our Lord did
never ſay <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but
alwaies <hi>the Kingdom of the Heavens.</hi>
One onely of the Evangeliſts hath this
terme of <hi>the Kingdom of the Heavens</hi> no
leſs then ſix and thirty times, but <hi>the
Kingdom of Heaven</hi> not once; which

The tranſlators in the Margent have
inſerted the true word of the Engliſh

the body of the text, they had rather
imploy the Name of <hi>Lucifer;</hi> as if it
were better Engliſh, or as if there were
ſome great cauſe which did oblige them
to it.</p>
               <p>It is indeed no other thing but the
tracing of an antient Allegory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
applyeth to the Devill, that which is
ſpoken to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of
the Name of a Star hath made it to be
the proper Name of the Prince of

<hi>that is to ſay</hi> Lucifer. And becauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Names do retain themſelves in
whatſoever language they are ſpoken,
it was beleived that this ought not to
be changed for any other.</p>
               <p>But wherefore do we yet retain the

It is true that the Divines, who

expreſs the Hebrew without this Latin

               <p>The common people of <hi>England</hi>
have a long time thought that the evill
Rich man <hi>Luke</hi> 16. verſe 19, &amp;c. was
called <hi>Dives</hi> according to his proper

do to this day believe it; for they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
ſay that <hi>Dives</hi> is in Hell, that
<hi>Dives</hi> ſpoke with <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. As if
<hi>Dives</hi> had been his Chriſten-name or

opinion was conceived and
born at that time when the people had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64307:9"/>

that <hi>Dives</hi> doth ſignify a rich man in
the Latin tongue, when mention was
made of <hi>Dives,</hi> the ignorant did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
that it was the name of a man; An
interpretation as vain as that which is
recited in a modern Satyre, of one, who
maintained that the name of <hi>Tobyes</hi>
Dog was <hi>Canis,</hi> becauſe, it is ſaid that
<hi>Canis</hi> followed his Maſter. But it is to

been fomented even by the Orthodox

               </p>
               <p>But 1. the text gives no name to that
ſinner; where have we then found it?
Who of the Evangeliſts, or what other
Authentick Scripture hath taught us
the proper name or the ſirname of that
Woman? For ſhe who poured the
oyntment on Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.
and <hi>John</hi> 12. was neither that ſinner,
nor <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> but the ſiſter of
<hi>Lazarus.</hi> All the circumſtances do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
that they are two diſtinct
Hiſtories, two divers actions perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

and by divers perſons. Secondly, Where
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64307:11"/>
ſhall we find that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did
ever anoint the feet of our Saviour?
Thirdly, Where ſhall we find that
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was a Woman of an
ungodly life? The Goſpell doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us, that ſhe was tormented with
ſeven Devils, or evil Spirits, an affliction
which may befall the moſt holy man
or woman in the world. But we find
not the leaſt ſhadow of a word which
doth ſtain her with any note of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Wherefore then do we yet adhere
to an invention not onely fabulous, but
injurious to the memory of a woman
illuſtrious in piety? We muſt abſtain
from bearing falſe witneſs, as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the dead, as againſt the living.</p>
               <p>It is remarkeable that neither the
ſinner, mentioned in <hi>Luke</hi> the 7th. nor
the Adultereſs, in the 8th. of Saint
<hi>John</hi> are found to have any name in
the ſacred Hiſtory, no more than the
theif who was converted being on the
Croſs. There are (no doubt) particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
reaſons for it, and in part we may
conjecture of them, why the Holy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64307:11"/>
Ghoſt abſtained to expreſs the proper
names of theſe great ſinners, although
they were converted. It is not then for
us to impoſe names on them, much leſs
to appropriate them to perſons whom
the Scripture hath not marked with

               <p>Now there is no man who ought

He hath more reaſon to wonder that
no more heed is taken of ſo manifeſt
an addition, For thoſe two firſt
words, <hi>Hearken Iſrael,</hi> which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
when we recite the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
are no part of the Decalogue
it ſelf, nor were they ſpoken then

publiſh it in <hi>Sinai,</hi> neither were they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64307:13"/>
comprehended in the writing which
he did give in the tables of that Law.
This is eaſy to prove the Decalogue,
which is wholy intire in two places
of <hi>Moſes (Exod.</hi> 20. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. hath
not theſe words, <hi>Hearken Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what inconvenience doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
to place them in the front of the

GOD did ſpeak them. But if we ſhall
affirm that they are the proper terms
of the Decalogue, it is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
And the Jews vvould tell us

               <p>It may be demanded, From vvhence

O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Lord our God is the onely

that the Decalogue in expreſs terms
did begin ſo, No more then by this
which followeth, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the

<hi>That is the firſt Commandement.</hi> For
theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord

theſe vvords, to which the Name of a

not that they were ſung, either by the
Virgin, or by <hi>Zachary,</hi> or <hi>Simeon,</hi> nor
that they vvere ſo much as conceived

Poetry.</p>
               <p>It vvill not ſerve to affirm that
their ſtile is Poeticall, and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

do not make the vvhole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

leſs may vve conclude that it vvas
ſung by pronouncing. Hovvſoever

in it, to make the vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64307:16"/>
to paſs for an undoubted truth.</p>
               <p>In all the New Teſtament there are
but tvvo Songs, ſo named in expreſs
termes, And both thoſe are in the
Revelations onely, and onely in a
Viſion: <hi>Rev. 5. ver</hi> 9. 10. and <hi>Revel.
15. ver.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay that thoſe excellent
words of the Virgin, of <hi>Zachary,</hi> and of
<hi>Simeon</hi> may not in our vulgar tongues
be put into the form of Songs, and
ſung in our publick Congregations;
It is of great edification. But it is not
convenient to believe for certain, that
they vvere Songs in the Originall.
Wherefore do vve not ſay as vvell
that the vvords of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> dictated

that all ſorts of ſins againſt the

               <p>Now this doth proceed from a

the terms of the Goſpel, in
which our Saviour ſpeaketh of the
ſin which is unpardonable, we ſhall
never find that he pronounced this
vvord, That a ſin againſt the Holy
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64307:21"/>

he hath ſaid, that Blaſphemy againſt

Or that he vvho ſhall ſpeak

no remiſſion. The crime then which

is not univerſally every ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Certainly we ſin divers vvays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

committed any thing againſt the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination,
which the Spirit of GOD
hath infuſed into his conſcience. Have
we never acted againſt the motions
of the Spirit? To luſt againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is that alſo to ſin unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

that Chriſtian in whom the fleſh doth

unto us All, if every ſin committed

againſt the Holy Ghoſt were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

the Holy Spirit, to make ſad
and to grieve the Holy Spirit? Now
the Iſraelites in the Deſart did grieve
him oftentimes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 10. Shall
we dare affirm, that all thoſe ſouls
who ſinned thus againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

from obtaining mercy both in this

prove the contrary we ſhal find in the

GOD were even then upon them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his Spirit, which they had ſo

               <p>There are then many kinds of ſin

others, one which ſhall not be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that is, Blaſphemy againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>THere are ſome ſins to which the
Divines have given the name of
crying ſins, And this Epithet is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Scripture. By this name
the effuſion of Innocent bloud is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
becauſe the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> did cry
unto GOD. So alſo is the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>Now there are reaſons wherefore

thoſe ſins, which are more enormous

Idolatry, nor Blaſphemy, no,
nor the worſhipping of Devil are
called crying ſins: And in generall I
do obſerve, that of all the ſins which

there is not one which is called a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of the Antients.</head>
               <p>I Will produce but two examples. A
very famous Scholar in his Book of
the truth of Chriſtian Religion, doth
alledge an Author, who doth recite a
very ſtrange ſtory concerning Jeſus
Chriſt, which is that the Jews did
chooſe him to be one of thoſe, who
offered ſacrifice, and that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him into their order, qualifying
thus the Son of GOD and of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſtory, if there were no other
thing to object againſt it, doth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſe, that which the Apoſtle
ſpeaks in the Hebrews, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
came from the tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> a
tribe, none whereof did aſſiſt at the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64307:30"/>
Altar, a tribe, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake
nothing at all concerning the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Prieſthood, that if Chriſt again
were upon the earth, he would not be
a Prieſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe fabulous ſtories which are
uſed to maintain Chriſtianiſm, doe
onely ſerve but to render it ſuſpected,
nay ridiculous to the Jews, and other
Miſcreants.</p>
               <p>The other example is not of ſo great
importance, nevertheleſs it will ſerve
to ſhew, how the moſt learned do
miſtake themſelves, men in matters
purely Hiſtoricall, which contain
nothing: but firſt that requires no
exerciſe of judgement, but onely of
attention. A modern Writer (whom
I highly do eſteem) doth recite and
follow, in this paſſage which I have
produced, one of the greateſt perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
of Antiquity, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> by
name. This Author affirms that
untill the twentieth age after the
Creation of the world, there cannot
any example be produced of any Son,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64307:31"/>
who dyed before his Father, <hi>that is to
ſay</hi> of a naturall Death. This was
put in becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> might not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt it. The order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was kept, that he, who was born
firſt in a line deſcendant, ſhould alſo
dye firſt, this continued untill that
<hi>Therah</hi> the Father of <hi>Abraham</hi> did
invent Idolatry, And then (the firſt
that is marked out for an example)
his Son <hi>Haran</hi> dyed before his Father
<hi>Therah, Gen.</hi> 11. 28. By a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
untill then unheard of, GOD
did puniſh <hi>Therah</hi> cauſing that his
Son ſhould dye before his Father.</p>
               <p>But all this obſervation is null,
and proceeds from a great miſtake.
For long before the days of <hi>Therah,</hi>
nay before the time of the Deluge,
we have the example of a Son, who
dyed before his Father, and of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Death. It is <hi>Lamech</hi> the Son of
<hi>Methuſelah.</hi> The proof is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
Compare the 5. Chapter of
<hi>Geneſis,</hi> ver. 25. with the 31. From
the birth of <hi>Lamech</hi> unto the death
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64307:31"/>
of <hi>Methuſelah</hi> were 782. years, but
<hi>Lamech</hi> lived but 777. He dyed
therefore five years before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
And by this account <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelah,</hi>
and not <hi>Therah</hi> was the
firſt Father by whom we find that
his Son dyed before him of a naturall
Death; And by this the truth of
this Commentary, which attributes
the firſt example of this accident to
the Idolatry of <hi>Therah</hi> doth vaniſh
into nothing; many other defects
may be noted in thoſe who do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite

word for the want of a better, and
one more anſwerable to the Greek

But a picture, which ſpeaketh in all
languages, ought not to corrupt
the Hiſtories in repreſenting them
otherwiſe than they are. The ſame
picture doth very ill deſcribe Saint
<hi>John</hi> in the Boſom of Jeſus Chriſt,
The particulars are by ſo much the
more conſiderable, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
ſome circumſtances of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

importance that we ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

us with Arguments againſt Altars,

the worſhipping of it.</p>
               <p>I will not here ſpeak of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Painters, who repreſenting
<hi>Lazarus</hi> in the breaſt of <hi>Abraham,</hi> do
paint him as a little Infant on the

               <p>Moreover in ſome Bibles of the old

We may truly paint <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve,</hi>
but it is impoſſible to paint God.
Thoſe who have ſuch pictures in
their Bibles, ought rather to take
them out, then take delight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

               <p>IT is ordinary to imagine that the

the ſeventh Day, which is Sunday
the world will end; And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he alleageth a tradition, which
imports that the ſecond comming of
Chriſt ſhall be on the Sunday. But
the ſame Day is not Sunday through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the world. In ſome places of
the world it is Sunday, when in other
places it is hardly Saturday. In which
Country then ſhall it be Sunday, when
our Lord ſhall come. Shall it be in
<hi>England,</hi> or rather in the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes?</p>
               <p>Speaking of Faſts he ſaith, that they
were inſtituted in the terreſtrial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
becauſe GOD did forbid <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:64307:42"/>
the fruit of the Tree of knowledge.
On this account; Firſt, <hi>Adam</hi> did faſt
although he did eat of all the other
fruits of the Garden. The Iſaelites
alſo did faſt all their lives, becauſe
many viands were forbidden them,
although they did eat of others. By
the ſame reaſon it may be ſaid, that
a man doth faſt, even when he is
eating. This is the language of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſay we faſt, when
we abſtain from fleſh, although we
then feed upon abundance of fiſh.
Secondly, the Faſts of which he there
ſpeaketh, had other ends than had the
abſtinence from the forbidden fruit,
For we faſt eſpecially either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
or to teſtify our repentance;
which could not be ſpoken of <hi>Adam,</hi>
who had no need of repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had not as yet ſinned, when
this abſtinence was enjoyned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> (ſaith he) was overcome by
the Serpent, for having not obſerved
this Faſt, But firſt, he ought rather
to have ſaid, that <hi>Adam</hi> did not keep
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64307:42"/>
this Faſt, becauſe he was overcome
by the Serpent, <hi>or to ſpeak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi>
by <hi>Eve</hi> already overcome by the
Serpent. Secondly theſe words are
doubtfull and dangerous to affirm,
that the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> did proceed
becauſe he did not keep the Faſt, As
if his ſin did ariſe from gluttony
which is a groſs error.</p>
               <p>This Book in the end thereof doth

               <p>

               <head>Of the word AMEN which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>EVery one doth know that it was
the practiſe of the antient Church
approved and recommended by the
Apoſtles themſelves, that the Paſtor
having pronounced a Benection, or
a prayer, or the giving of thanks, all
the Congregation, even thoſe who
were of the ſimpleſt people did make
anſwer to him in ſaying Amen,
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> 14. 16.</p>
               <p>It would be a folly to reply that
they did not ſpeak it, but in their
hearts onely, or within their teeth.
For, Firſt, This Amen was ſpoken
publickly to witneſs, that they did
partake in that which the Paſtor had
pronounced. This Amen was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to expreſs that which they had in
their hearts. How had they expreſſed
it, if they had not ſpoken it but in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64307:44"/>
their hearts onely? Secondly, this
cuſtom which the people had to cloſe
ſuch actions with an Amen, was the
very ſame as was practiſed in the
old Teſtament, by which it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that this <hi>Amen</hi> was pronounced
with a loud voice, 1 <hi>Chron. 16. 36.
Nehem. 8. 6. Pſalm</hi> 1. 16. 48. So in
the firſt ages of the Chriſtian Church,
this <hi>Amen,</hi> when the Congregation
was numerous, was heard afar off,
as if it had been ſome clap of thunder,
as the Hiſtory doth inform us.</p>
               <p>It is known that this cuſtom by
little and little, annihilating by the
want of zeal, and coldneſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the ſervice of GOD, there was
one ſubſtituted, who in their Names
ſhould anſwer Amen. And this is
practiſed even in the Engliſh Church,
ſince it hath renounced Popery. But
becauſe this <hi>Amen</hi> is not in the mouth
of the people, it would be better to
reduce our Churches to the Primitive
and antient cuſtom authorized by the
Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:64307:44"/>
We who make a profeſſion of an

with the Primitive Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do we ſuppreſs, that which ſhe

of this <hi>Amen.</hi> What difficulty
do the people find in it; what excuſe
can they make whereby they may be
diſpenſed. Can it be objected that
it would appear a novelty? Such a
novelty is of great antiquity, and
would be better than the continuation
of a fault occaſioned by coldneſs in
the ſervice of GOD.</p>
               <p>In the Roman Church, where the
publick ſervice is ſpoken in a tongue,
which the people underſtand not, they
know not in reaſon where to give
this acclamation of <hi>Amen.</hi> But why
do our Congregations refuſe this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of approbation, unto that
which they do underſtand, and to
which they do conſent?</p>
               <p>Moreover (as it may ſo come to

to make a diſtinction of thoſe who

it is known that their houſes were
flat, and plain on the top, as they are

               <p>This Conſtruction is indeed inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
and ſeemeth to be moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to the Greek text. But there is a
reaſon which doth diſſwade me from
conceiving it to be ſo. This Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
contained in the two firſt verſes
of the 22. of the <hi>Revel</hi> is taken out
of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> Chap. 47. 12. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
there doth repreſent this River
coming forth of the Sanctuary;
which Saint <hi>John</hi> doth call the throne
of GOD. He ſpeaketh there of the
trees, which brought forth their fruit
every month. He doth there make
mention of their leaves, which were
medicinall. It is there ſaid that theſe
trees ſhall grow on the bank of the
River on both ſides thereof. In all
this Saint <hi>John</hi> accordeth with <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi>
But this correſpondence will fail,
if it is ſaid, that the trees, of which
Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, is onely but on
one ſide of the River. It is true that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64307:47"/>
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaketh in the Plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of many trees, and that Saint <hi>John</hi>
mentioneth but one which is the tree
of life. But we know that the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
name of one kind, doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
all the Individuals to which
that kind is common.</p>
               <p>I will be replyed, that it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to maintain that there were
many Individuals of that kind of
tree. And to prevent this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
this ſame Doctor, whom I do
honour for his excellent knowledge,
hath changed the ordinary reading
of this place in the Revelations: But
as for the inconvenience I cannot ſee
what it is. Is it becauſe the Hiſtory
doth not make mention of this tree
as of an individuall? why, that is it
which is in queſtion. Is it becauſe
that this tree did prefigure Chriſt who
is but onely One? But Chriſt hath
been repreſented both by figures of
divers kinds, as by the Cloud, and by
the Sea, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. and by many
figures of the ſame kind, as by two
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64307:47"/>
Rocks, and a great way diſtant from
one another, <hi>Exod. 17. 6. Numb. 20.
28.</hi> &amp;c. Is it becauſe the fruit of this
Tree had a ſingular vertue to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the life of Man? It doth not
from hence follow, that there ſhould
be but one plant onely, which ſhould
bear this fruit. On the contrary, As
of all the Trees that were in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
this here was moſt neceſſary for
man: ſo it is to be believed that the
liberality of GOD, which is ordinarily
abundant in things which are moſt
neceſſary, and which do waſt away by
uſe had given him more than onely
one tree of that kind. Moreover, as the
Tree of life was indued with ſingular
properties, ſo had it the vertue alſo,
as well as other plants, to multiply
it ſelf. But without affirming that
there were many Individuals of it, I
onely ſay that the contrary opinion
hath no ſuch certainty in it, that it
may be received for an undoubted
truth.</p>

learned amongſt many other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
in which they are of a contrary
opinion, have treated on this queſtion.
One of them my intimate friend and
a moſt reverend man is ſo amorous
of antiquity, that he undertakes to
maintain all the Paradoxes, which
this opinion hath produced; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that ocular experience doth
ſhew us that Vipers are born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64307:48"/>
my ſelf in this difference, I will
onely ſpeak one word on that which
is in the Index, which I have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
It is dangerous either in Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
or Annotations on the
Bible, to lay down that for a certain
truth, which is diſputable, eſpecially
when there is experience to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Secondly, To what purpoſe,
or in what regard was it ſpoken that
the Phariſes, and the Sadduces, whom
the Scripture calls a Generation of
Vipers, had in their birth killed their
mothers. Thirdly, if I were to expound
ſuch places, I ſhould ſearch out the
ſenſe in a propriety, which is conſtant
and particular to the Viper onely,
amongſt all the kinds of Serpents.
All other Serpents do proceed from
their Mothers, having neither their
form as yet, nor any faculty to ſtir or
to move themſelves. For the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſhut up in an egge, which the
mother hath produced, and will ask

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64307:49"/>
in life, and all formed when they come
out of the Belly of their Mother.
When the Scripture therefore doth
give this Epithete of a Generation
of Vipers to certain Men, It is to
expreſs, that from their Birth they
have already actually hurted, or that
their malice was already compleatly
formed.</p>

this Sun that invirons her, this Moon
which is at her feet, and what is the

She treads under her feet the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy

but vvithout proof to allegorize, For
on the contrary, in the Scripture,
which ought to be interpreted by its
ſelf, the Moon is conſidered as an
Emblem of firmneſs and perpetuity.
As in the 9 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> It is promiſed
that the throne of <hi>David</hi> ſhall be as

               <p>Some modern writers (and thoſe

               <p>Thoſe who take theſe twelve Stars
for the twelve Apoſtles have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
unto the text. The Church
repreſented by this Woman is ſaid
to have this Crown of Stars before
ſhe brought forth Chriſt, when ſhe
was yet in her travail, and undelive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
There was at that time no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
at all. It could not be then
ſaid, that the Apoſtles were already
the ſtars of the Church, for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were not then in being. So
that theſe Stars could be no others
than the twelve Patriarchs, nor the
Sun any other than <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor the
Moon than <hi>Leah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reaſon of the ſimilitude
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64307:52"/>
will eaſily demonſtrate in what ſenſe
it is ſaid that the Sun doth inviron
the Church, and that the ſtars do ſerve
her for a Crown. All the difficulty
conſiſts in this which is of <hi>Leah,</hi> how
it can be ſaid that ſhe was under the
feet of the Church. The inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which appeareth at the firſt ſight,
hath cauſed, that in ſtead of <hi>Leah,</hi>
there have been clean another thing
imagined. For it hath been preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
to have the Moon under ones
feet, doth ſignify to tread it under
foot, either by miſpriſion as a thing
worth nothing, or by hatred, as a thing
that is odious. But theſe words do
not alwaies bear this ſenſe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they denote the power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that is exerciſed over one. So
it is ſaid that GOD hath put all things
under the feet of man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they have reference to that
which is as a ſupporter, or a reſt to
the feet of man. So by a metaphor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it is ſpoken that GOD had a darkneſs
under his feet. And in the ſame ſenſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64307:52"/>
it is ſpoken immediatly after, that he
was mounted on the Cherubins. As
for this Moon, ſeeing ſhe is adjoyned
to the Sun and to the Stars, which
repreſent the Glory of the Church,
ſhe cannot be taken for a figure of
contemptible things, and ſuch we
tread on by diſdain. It remaineth then
that this Woman, the Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
had the Moon under her feet, as
ſuſtaining her ſelf thereon. Now it
is not ſtrange to ſay that <hi>Leah</hi> was the
ſupportreſs of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
becauſe ſhe had held it in her armes,
and nouriſhed it from her Infancy.
To this the Hebrew Phraſe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.

which is unexpedient may become
unlawfull.</p>
               <p>The Politicians ought not to alledge
their reaſons againſt this principle.
If they were to be received we might
as well juſtify the prodigious impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, who
conſtrained the Jews, who were made
Chriſtians, to return to Judaiſm. The
motive was Avarice. For the Jews,
continuing in their profeſſion of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,
were more advantagious to
him, than after the time that they
were rendred Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But ſome may reply, we will call
them to convert them. We will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the way for that great work,
which GOD hath promiſed to do in
them, to ſave all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But obſerve
in the firſt place. It is not ſo eaſy as
we think it is, to convert the Jews.
The Controverſies, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and us are full of Abyſms,
the depths whereof are unknown to
the people; nay, and unto many
who meddle in Divinity. Before we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64307:55"/>
undertake to reduce the Jews, we muſt
be harder Students. Secondly, How
ſhall we convert them being our
ſelves divided into ſo many Sects, and
giving the lye to one another? What
would the Jews find, if they ſhould
come amongſt us? A confuſion of
language more great than that of
<hi>Babel,</hi> an infiniteneſs of ſhamefull
extravagancies, which are a ſcandall
to all true Chriſtians. Will this be
to convert the Jews? No, but rather
to divert them from Chriſtianiſm.
Thirdly, The people here are prone
to receive all the follies which are
preſented to them. The greateſt
horrors are the moſt excellent my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.
Is it not to be feared that
many will learn to Judaize? and, to
convert two or three Jews, a million
of Chriſtians will be expoſed to the
danger to become Jews? Fourthly,
Although they will not all be ſo in
generall, yet there will be many in
particular, and we ſhall obſerve new
Religions that will reſult out of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64307:55"/>
mixture of Judaiſm with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm.
Who knows, what monſters
will proceed from thence. All the
precautions, which other States do
uſe to hinder that Judaiſm corrupts
not Chriſtians, are found too feeble
there, where the torrent of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
licence hath already in ſo
many places over-topp'd and broken
down, the bounds which ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall alwaies wiſh that we travail
to convert the enemies of the Faith, but
without indangering thoſe who are
of the Houſhold of it, For this were
to do evill that good may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and GOD who knows both the

no need that we ſhould do evill for

Time hath ſince confuted this Doctor,

               <p>About that time, there was at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
a Boy of twelve years of age, of

diſcourſed pertinently and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
which cauſed an admiration
of him in all that heard him. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that ſome excellent Divines
were at a ſtand about it, doubting
whether it were not an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

the Spirit, which made the Boy to

Divill, vvho ſerved himſelf with the

him to ſpeak the moſt ridiculous
things in the vvorld, making mocks

be ſeen pieces of Bodies, which in
this poſture do ſhew themſelves as
if they had been forced out of the
Earth. They are all that day to be
beheld, but if you return the next
morning there is nothing to be ſeen.
On the Day of this Prodigy (for it is

               <p>This was a brave miracle, if it were

that we be not too credulous. I have
lately read the relation of an Engliſh
Travailer, who hath been upon that

this pretended wonder. He ſaith, that
as the Egyptians from all antiquity
have been very carefull to imbalm
the Bodies of the dead, they know a
long time to preſerve them either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
or in pieces (accordingly as time
doth diſmember and run them into

the next morning they may be ſeen
to the great amazement of thoſe who
know not how they came thither,
nor how after that day they diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
But thoſe, who brought them
the night before, do carry them away
the night following. And the opinion
that this is done by miracle, doth
draw thither a great multitude of
ſtrangers, from whence great profit
doth ariſe to the Inhabitants, which is

a vvoman ever had the gift of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
Moreover as the ſupernaturall

               <head>Of an advertiſement which is put into
the Margent of ſome paſſages
in the Bible.</head>
               <p>WHen the Annotators do meet
with a difficulty in any place
of the Scripture they ſpeak of it, that
it is a thing vvhich ought not too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
to be ſearched unto. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we do forbid or reſtrain the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
after a point, we ought firſt to
be aſſured that it is not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For this is not to be too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to undertake to know that which
GOD hath been pleaſed to ſpeak.
Wherefore doth GOD ſpeak unto us,
if it be not to be underſtood. Nay,
when he ſpeaketh obſcurely in ſome
places, it is to this end, that we ſhould
yet ſearch more after it, and not that
we ſhould recoyl from it. And if
it be a thing which we underſtand
not, it may be that others do or may
hereafter underſtand it, whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
we ought not to hinder. How
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64307:62"/>
many paſſages are there which have
been taken for Riddles, which are
now clearly expounded. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Queſtions have been held inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
which are now looſed and
layd open. How many particulars,
alluſions, and myſteries, which were
not obſerved in the Scriptures, are
now diſcovered to the great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thoſe Spirits who are lovers
of knowledge.</p>

               <head>Of the Dragon which was believed to be
a flying Serpent.</head>
               <p>SO he is painted nay and in ſome
Bibles alſo, And it is a common
opinion, that there is ſuch a kind of
Serpent having wings. But although
this be maintained by divers, there
are no more ocular witneſſes of it,
then of the Horſe <hi>Pegaſus.</hi> Nay it
contradict; that which the Naturaliſts
have obſerved which is, that there is
no Bird which is venemous, for the
providence of GOD hath not been
pleaſed to give wings to creatures,
which are venemous, And it is to
prevent an infinite number of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
which would come to paſs, if
creatures ſo dangerous could fly, or
move at randome in the traverſe of
the Ayr. How many deaths not to be
avoided would enſue hereby both to
men and Beaſts? This Fiction of
flying Serpents is tolerable, but we
ought by no means to introduce it
into the Bible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:64307:63"/>
It is moreover obſervable that the
Scripture doth give wings to the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins
who repreſent Angels, but it
never doth attribute wings to the
Serpent which repreſenteth Satan.
Adde to this, that in the 12. of the
<hi>Revelations</hi> the Woman who fled
before the Dragon, had wings given
her to fly away, but the Dragon had
no wings to fly after her, and all that
he could do was to ſend a vomit of
water lik a River from her gorge. It
is therefore an Imagination in this
paſſage to ſuppoſe a flying Serpent.
Such a Serpent not found either in
Nature or the Scripture.</p>

               <head>Of the Serpent which tempted <hi>Eve</hi> which
many think to be preſented in the
face of a Woman.</head>
               <p>I Have already made mention of
two learned men in this age, who
are of a contrary opinion in many
things which antiquity hath dictated.
Behold yet one point more of which
they are in diſpute. Some hold that
this Serpent which ſeduced <hi>Eve</hi> had
the face of a maid, and ſo he hath
been painted for a long time. One
of theſe great perſonages rejecteth
this opinion in this Picture. But he
gives no reaſon for it all, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaith that there being but two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of mankind in the whole world
that of <hi>Adam</hi> and that of <hi>Eve,</hi> if <hi>Eve</hi>
had ſeen a third it had been ſuſpected
by her, and the Impoſture had been
diſcovered. To this the other doth
anſwer in the contrary. Satan did
take the face of a woman to be
leſs ſuſpected, becauſe it was not ſo
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64307:64"/>
ſtrange that ſuch a head ſhould ſpeak,
as to hear a Serpent ſpeaking and
reaſoning like a woman. And that
<hi>Eve</hi> had no reaſon to wonder that a
Serpent ſhould have the face of a
woman, ſince there are divers Beaſts
who are endued with ſuch a form.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Antagoniſts have this
common betwixt them, that conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on a matter of Fact, they would
decede the controverſy, rather by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
then keep cloſe unto the Hiſtory,
which ought to be preferred to all
our own ſuggeſtions. Doth the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
then ſay, that the Serpent which
tempted <hi>Eve</hi> had the face of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
Could <hi>Moſes</hi> who maketh
mention of the great ſubtilty of this
Creature have forgotten ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a particular in ſo great an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,
as the Viſage of a woman
in a Beaſt, Do other holy writers
who ſpeak of this Serpent, ſpeak one
word of this face vvhich is attributed
to it? It is onely then an Invention
of the Brain of man, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64307:64"/>
enough to diſſwade us from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it.</p>
               <p>But vvere it neceſſary to take off
this difference by reaſons it is eaſy
enough to decide the controverſy.
Will any one affirme that there hath
been extant any kind of Serpent,
vvhich hath the face of a woman?
No man can affirm it, And no man
ever hath affirmed it, that I do know
of. And if it ſhould be ſo, it could
not prove that the Serpent which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<hi>Eve</hi> vvas of that kind ſince the
Hiſtory makes no ſpecification of it.
Much leſs can it be ſaid that it was a
monſter compoſed of the face of a
vvoman, and of the Body of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
For no monſters vvere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
till after the ſin of man, and ſin
entred not till after the temptation of
the Serpent.</p>
               <p>We muſt be then conſtrained to
affirm that this face of a woman was
onely an apparition or a figure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Satan in the Serpent. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Was this Serpent but an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64307:65"/>
onely? Certainly the ſubtilty
which the Scripture attributes unto
him, above all the Beaſts of the field,
cannot be ſaid to be an apparition on
a figure formed in the Ayr. Will
any man ſay that this reall Serpent
had a face which was not reall but
onely in apparence? This is a Serpent
compoſed of a fiction and reality
without any other proof but our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
onely. Finally, will any
man alleage, that Satan borrowed any
one of thoſe creatures, who have a
face like unto that of a woman? Why
then that Creature had been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the ſame puniſhment, as was
the Serpent for having ſerved Sathan
with its voice. But this not ſo, And
the ſentence was not pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any other Beaſt but the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
To conclude, that humane face
in which it is beleived, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
did ſhew himſelf is purely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary.</p>

               <head>Of the diſcord which is in modern Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and more particularly of that
in our Pſalms.</head>
               <p>THere are thoſe who have deſired
that all our Pſalms had but one
Tune, that ſo they may be more eaſy
to the common people, Others do
approve of the multitude and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Ayrs, as the moſt delightfull,
and moſt proper to move the Spirit.
And certainly, the difference which
is in the Pſalms, as to the meaſures
of the Hebrew verſe, doth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonſtrate that there were diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of Tunes. But becauſe they are
unknown to us, it remaineth that we
give to every Pſalm, yea to every
verſe that tune which ſhall be moſt
convenient, and the moſt convenient
is that which doth beſt repreſent the
matter of which we ſing. The voice
which doth expreſs a ſad and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſubject, ought not to be of one
tune, and the voice which doth expreſs
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64307:66"/>
a great joy ought to be of another.
The voice alſo of him which ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
as an affrighted man doth differ
much from the voice of him who is
ſafe from danger, And generally the
ſound ought not to be correſpondent
to the matter, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 14, 7, 8. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Muſick of our Pſalms,
(more particularly that of the
French) be very excellent, and the
ayrs be there conformable to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in many reſpects, nevertheleſs
it is not ſo univerſally over all, nor is
there that perfection which may be
deſired, and it is obſervable, there are
divers Pſalms, the ſubjects whereof
are of a contrary nature, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
they have the ſame tune. The
hundred and forty ſecond which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
the affrights and the crys of
a man brought into the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
hath the ſame ayr as the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
which expreſſeth nothing but
joy and the giving of thanks. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
fourth is full of grief and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.
The hundred and ſixteenth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64307:66"/>
is as full of joy and thankfulneſs, yet
notwithſtanding one is ſung in the
ſame tune as the other. Nay in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſame Pſalm there is a verſe which
corrects the matter of the precedent.
In the one the ſoul ſpeaketh as beaten
down with ſadneſs and maketh great
complaints in the other (as if another
perſon did ſpeak) the ſame is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
for the words it did ſpeak, and
for its want of courage. Moreover
there is oftentimes an alternative reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of theſe two Contraries which
clap in betwixt one another, the Fleſh
and the Spirit, as particularly in the
42, the 73. and the 77. Pſalms. Theſe
verſes which repreſent contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
although in one Pſalm ought
to differ in the tune, inſtead whereof
in every Pſalm we have but one tune
common to all the verſes.</p>
               <p>To this no other thing can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
but that it will be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
and almoſt impoſſible to have a
Muſick ſo exact and ſo univerſally
correſponding with ſuch diverſity of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64307:67"/>
matters, and which (moreover) can
be eaſy for the people to learn. This
is true, ſo that I ſpeak not to make any
change in the tune, which is uſed in
our Churches. In the Churches of
<hi>France,</hi> we have undertook to give a
tune to many Songs in the Bible, which
have been as Pſalms, and for that end
put into Muſick. But the common
people being not accuſtomed to them,
and diſorder from thence ariſing we
have been conſtrained to deſiſt. That
which hath ledde me to this diſcourſe,
is to ſpeak of thoſe who would reduce
all the Pſalms to one, and the ſame
tune, when it would be more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to multiply, and to diverſify the
tune more then we do. And although
it be impoſſible to put in practiſe a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
ſo perfect as that which hath been
ſpoken, yet it is not ſuperfluous to have
made mention of it, to the end that
we may know how imperfect and
how defective we are in that regard.</p>

               <p>THere are ſome even of thoſe

when it is given them. But for what

children to obſerve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
to which the promiſe is
annexed to make them live a long

not one year? And again can we
wiſh him many years, without wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing

               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:64307:68"/>
Well any one object, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of GOD ought not to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a year? Why, this would be
to reſtrain them yet more, when we
do wiſh good morrow to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
And yet no man condemns this
ſalutation, for in wiſhing that the
morning may prove happy, we do
not pray that his happineſs may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
with the Day.</p>
               <p>That which gives diſtaſt is that this
ſalutation is given in a Day which is
preſuppoſed to be the firſt Day of the
year, when it is uncertain not onely
on what Day, but alſo in what ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the firſt year of the world began.
But this very incertitude in which
GOD hath pleaſed that we ſhould be,
doth ſhew that the knowledge of this
Day is not neceſſary for us, and that
it is indifferent to begin the account
of the Days of the year, with ſuch a
Day which ſhould be made choice of
and received in uſe. If we ſhould ſtay
untill we know in what Day of the
year the world began, we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64307:68"/>
our ſelves of many helps which
are neceſſary for the meaſuring of
time, and the affairs which are ruled
by time; And if it be lawfull in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
year it be to wiſh a good day
to a Neighbour, wherefore ſhall this
wiſh be unlawfull on the day in
which we do begin to count the days
of the year.</p>
               <p>It will be objected that this Day is
ſullyed with ſuperſtition, but there
is not a Day in the year which is not
ſo ſoyled. Ought we therefore all
the year to refrain from acts of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or charity? If on ſuch a Day ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
is more preſent to us, or
more offenſive, the more ought we
to correct that bad ayr by actions of
a ſweet ſavour, not intermitting that
which ought to be practiſed every
day.</p>
               <p>On this Subject I have made uſe
of a paſſage which is in the French
Bible 1 <hi>Sam. 25, 6. David</hi> did ſend
this ſalutation to <hi>Nabal</hi> who did
ſheere his Sheep. And ſo mayſt thou
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64307:69"/>
make the year to come in the ſame
ſeaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe words are not
formally in the Originall text, no
more are they to be found in the
Engliſh tranſlation, nor in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tranſlation. Inſtead of all theſe
words the Hebrew hath but one, <hi>viz.
To living,</hi> And this word being not
accompanied with any Noun Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive,
divers ſenſes are given to
it, but that which our French Bible
doth give unto it is more forced and

amongſt all the Chriſtian

that cuſtome, as more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Engliſh. And it is diſputed
if it be well done, to ſalute thoſe who
do ſneeze in our preſence. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64307:69"/>
in the old Teſtament or the New
is there found any Example. In all
the holy Hiſtory there is not mention
made of any but onely one, And
this was the Son of the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> who
ſneezed ſeven times in the preſence
of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and nevertheleſs this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
did not uſe any ſalutation to
him. Some do beleive that this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
did begin about one thouſand
and fifty years ſince upon the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Diſeaſe, which was then Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall,
in which men and women
dyed ſneezing. But the Originall is
far more antient, as it can be made
manifeſt. It is certain that it had its
Original in the time of Paganiſm, but
the cauſe is uncertain. But preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that it did proceed from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm
the queſtion is, is it lawfull
to practiſe it.</p>
               <p>Our anſwer is grounded on theſe
following hypotheſes, Firſt there
are things which GOD forbids us to
do, but nevertheleſs being done he
willeth not, that they ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64307:70"/>
He did forbid that <hi>Jericho</hi>
ſhould be builded again, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
being afterwards rebuilded, he
did not command that it ſhould be
demoliſhed. Even ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
as <hi>Eliſha,</hi> did keep there their
Aſſemblies, and Jeſus Chriſt did
there convert <hi>Zacheus</hi> and cured the
blind. So God forbids to marry
with a perſon that is an Infidel, but
ſuch a marriage being made God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
that it ſhould be broken. The
league of <hi>Joſuah</hi> with the <hi>Gibeonits</hi>
was not lawfull in all things; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
GOD would not that it ſhould
be infringed, and chaſtiſed the houſe
of <hi>Saul,</hi> who had ill treated the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonits.</hi>
Secondly, That which hath
been introduced for bad ends, being
otherwiſe indifferent in it ſelf, may
be applyed to other uſes. The cuſtom
of imbalming the Bodies of the dead
proceeded from the Egyptians, who
did practiſe it either for ſuperſtition
or for vanity; nevertheleſs this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
hath paſſed amongſt the people
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64307:70"/>
of GOD, who hath never reproved it.
Thirdly, It is known, That we ought
to diſtinguiſh of that which is lawfull
in it felt from the abuſe which ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
hath mingled with it. The
Example which the Apoſtle gives
touching meat ſacrificed to Idols,
doth ſerve for this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10
I am of opinion that externall Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which belong even to the ſervice
of GOD, ought to be done with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of circumſtances, nay, ought
ſometimes to be ſuſpended. <hi>Eliſha</hi>
would not pray unto GOD in the
preſence of <hi>Naaman, 2 Kings 5. 10.
11.</hi> If I am conſtrained to paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an Idol, I will abſtain from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
any prayer, becauſe I will
not give on occaſion to any to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that my prayer tendeth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Idol.</p>
               <p>This foundation being layd, It is
eaſy to anſwer the queſtion. Firſt to
ſalute any, or to pray to GOD for
him is not onely lawfull in its ſelf,
but alſo it is commendable. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64307:71"/>
then be evill, but by accident
onely, either by the ſuperſtition of
him who ſneezeth, or of thoſe who
do ſalute him, or of others who are
preſent, or on the contrary for the
occaſion of thoſe who take offence
to hear that ſalutation, becauſe they
do beleive it to be ſuperſtitious. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
If I am then in the preſence
of any who is ſuperſtitious in that
kind, I will abſtain from ſaluting any
who doth ſneeze, to the end that I may
not ſeem to adhere to ſuperſtition.
And on the contrary, If it be in the
preſence of any to whom this ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is a ſcandall, I will abſtain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
Thirdly, But without the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of ſuperſtition, or of ſcandall,
this cuſtom being no more practiſed
for the imaginary cauſes which the
Pagans had thereunto, but being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into civility, it may be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
without offence. The Jews were
accuſtomed, when they beheld the
Rainbow, to ſay their prayers, and to
confeſs that they did merit a ſecond
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64307:71"/>
Deluge, and that they ſubſiſted not
but onely by the mercy of GOD. If

pernicious to the State it ſelf. But
becauſe the Queſtions, which on this

within that Dependence which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
them to the Law of GOD which
is the Rule of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>In the firſt the Divine meddles not

In navigation the Pilot is more
to be beleived then Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> if this

               <p>But the irregularities which we
may here meet with to the prejudice
of GOD are under the cognizances of
the Divine. It belongeth to him to
prevent them by his Counſels, yea,

               <p>When the Holy Spirit doth ſpeak
of theſe evill Spirits, which the Son
of GOD did caſt out of the Bodies of

it caſt forth Divels, but that he caſt
forth Demons, that he commanded
Demons, that he gave power to caſt
forth Demone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From which

Now ſince in this thing the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

and never the word of Divill, our

in the place, where we read
that he caſt forth Divels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is
true that this change is more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in thoſe tongues, to which the
word Demon is unknown, as in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to the Engliſh Tongue, but
ſince the word is become French, It

               <p>I will make no ſtop at all to give

who will demand, If it be not
all one to read Divels, inſtead of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Demons, In one word I ſhall
tell them that we ought to read it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Originall. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt there were reaſons which
obliged the Evangeliſts to make uſe
of one of theſe words, and to abſtain
from the other, when they ſpoke of
thoſe Spirits, which tormented hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies. Many (as the Sadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
did believe that theſe Spirits
were not ſubſtances, but onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Impulſions which come by
nature. Now the word Divel which
onely ſignifies a Slanderer, and can
be ſpoken of a man alſo, doth not ſo
well denote a ſpirituall ſubſtance, and
different from humane kind. The
word Demon is more ſignificant in
this regard, for it is the Name which
the Pagans gave unto their Gods, who
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64307:75"/>
in effect were evill Spirits. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> 10. 20. 21. ſaith not
(according to our Tranſlation) that
the Gentiles ſacrificed to Devils, but
that they ſacrificed to Demons. I

<hi>Abraham</hi> would have taken away the
life of his Son by taking off his head.

that he hath his ſoul already

at the mouth.</p>
               <p>I will not undertake to anſwer the
curious Queſtions, which may be
moved touching the coming forth
of the ſoul. I onely affirm that this
prejudging of the vulgar is not ſolid.
If the ſoul be univerſally dilated in
every part of the body, as many Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
do affirm, wherefore is it
locked up in a particular place at the
departure? If it lodgeth properly
and particularly in the heart, or in
the Brain, what need hath it to
come out at an open paſſage, ſeeing
it is a Spirit which can paſs away, at
the traverſe of the Skull or any other
Bone. Now who hath told us, that it
comes forth rather at the mouth than
at the ear or eyes, which are as the
windows of the ſoul? If <hi>I</hi> were at

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64307:81"/>
the deciſion whereof is neither cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

that the Spirit or the breath of him

antiquities. This Author making
mention there of Jeſus, doth doubt
if it be lawfull to call him a man,
ſeeing the great miracles which he
wrought. He alſo ſaith that this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
is the Chriſt. That at the third
day after his death, he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be alive. That ſuch things,
and other miracles were foreſpoken
of him by the Prophets.</p>
               <p>It is a long time ſince the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
employed this teſtimony of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi>
to convince the Jews. But, not
to diſpleaſe ſo many learned men, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and modern; I cannot perſwade
my ſelf that this Jew, which gives not
the leaſt apparence to be inclined to
Chriſtianiſm, hath written ſo much
to the advantage of our Religion;
Would he ſo highly have publiſhed
in his Book a belief of which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made profeſſion? And he is ſo far
from acknowledging Jeſus to be the
Chriſt, to whom the Prophets did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the Segniory of the whole
world, that, on the contrary, he gives
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64307:82"/>
it to Veſpaſian a Pagan Prince, and
applyes to him the Oracle which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
onely to the Son of God. This
is far off from acknowledging Jeſus
to be the Chriſt. It may be objected
that if theſe words above mentioned
were not the words of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> it
would follow that this Author made
no mention of Jeſus Chriſt in any
place of his Hiſtory, for he ſpeaks not
of him, but in this place onely which
is in queſtion. Now it is not believed
that having undertaken to write of
the memorable things of thoſe times,
he ſhould in ſilence paſs by the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
performed by Jeſus Chriſt, which
were known to all the world. But
this is not the onely Omiſſion that is
to be noted in <hi>Joſephus.</hi> The Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
of the Infants at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> of
which <hi>Herod</hi> was the Author, was ſo
famous, that the Heathens themſelves
did write of it, and nevertheleſs <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi>
who hath recorded many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cruelties of this <hi>Herod,</hi> doth
make no mention of it. And he is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the onely Hiſtorian who by contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or otherwiſe hath ſurpaſſed
ſome part of that which was moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
in his time. And ſhall we
wonder that a Jew, who never adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Chriſtianiſm, ſhould purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
omit the miracles of Jeſus Chriſt?
Was not his Reſurrection contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Prieſts, although they
were convinced of the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs I do beleive that this

withall that ſome have changed ſome

                  </gap>he Chriſt, but that it was beleived
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64307:83"/>
he was the Chriſt. <hi>Joſephus</hi> then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reciteth, that it was the belief of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to wit, the Chriſtians, but not his
own, for he was not a Chriſtian, and
being not one, nor making profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Chriſtianity, much leſs could
he ſay, that Jeſus was the Chriſt.
Now if one word in this place be
changed, it is not incredible, but the
contexture alſo of other terms is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
in which this Author ſpeaks of
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let us not think the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to be leſs aſſured, becauſe a
Jew doth not confeſs Jeſus to be the
Chriſt. Truth needs not the ſuffrage
of her adverſaries. Nevertheleſs this
paſſage of <hi>Joſephus</hi> is advantagious
to us in one reſpect. The Jews main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that the Death of Chriſt was
not under Pilate, who in the Name of
the Romans (as they alledge) was
Commander above one hundred
years before; The conſequences are
far greater then they ſeem to be at
the firſt appearance, of which I will
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64307:83"/>
not ſpeak at this preſent. So great
lyars are theſe malicious people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be by their own Hiſtorian, who
in expreſs tearms affirmeth that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
of whom the Chriſtians took
their Name, was crucified by Pilate.</p>
