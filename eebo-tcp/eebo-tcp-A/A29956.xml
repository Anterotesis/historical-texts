            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SHORT VIEW OF The preſent condition of SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>THe Common Enemy, by great ſlight, and profound skill, having brought us all, in a manner, inſenſibly and ſmoothly, we hardly perceiving it, to ſuch a paſſe, that we were all catched almoſt, when we did think our ſelves freeſt: For how many were there amongſt us, who, thinking themſelves ſincere profeſſors of the true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reformed Religion, were altogether infected with errour and hereſie, by an unparallell'd cunning of the Enemies of the Truth, in one way or other? He then did judge it fit time (as in all probability it was) to dallie no more, nor deal with us by undermining any further, but in an open way, to overthrow whatſoever ſhould lie in his way, in caſe of any oppoſition to his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48716:5"/>
main deſigne, which is to withdraw men from the Service of God, and from true love one to another.</p>
            <p>Now, when he had caſt his eyes up and down among us, to ſee where it was fitteſt for him to begin this his great and open undertaking, in the end he reſolves to begin at <hi>Scotland,</hi> where if he found compliance, he had what he deſired; for they, who were ſo far diſtant from him, having once complied, would not only invite others by their example to ſubmit; but alſo help him to go on with the work. And in caſe the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould refuſe, being not able to reſiſt long, as he thought, by reaſon of their weakneſſe for counſell and action; with means to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port both, they ſhould be made an example of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all others, not to dare to refuſe, and againſt their will to ſerve unto the advancement of the deſigne.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Scots</hi> are gone too, and compliance is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, which almoſt had been obtained, (the moſt part of the ſpirits of the people being kept under by heavy preſſures, and the great ones inſlaved by Court-intereſt;) but God in his Mercy to that Nation, did ſtir up the ſpirits of divers of all ranks and degrees, deſpiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able indeed in the eyes of the Enemy, to ſtand in the gap with wiſdom and reſolution:</p>
            <p>Firſt, In a fair way to decline and put off what was unjuſtly required of them by the Court, acting for the Enemy of God and his people.</p>
            <p>Next, When no better could be, they take Arms and ſtop the Enemies coming unto them, upon which a Peace is made with them, and their juſt demands are granted for the moſt part, in words at leaſt.</p>
            <p>The Articles of Peace are no ſooner agreed upon, but reſolution is taken by the Court to break them thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a Plot ſet afoot to catch at <hi>Berwick</hi> the chief ſticklers for the Truth. Which Plot, by Gods Providence, is diſcovered and diſappointed.</p>
            <p>Then ſhortly thereafter, at <hi>London,</hi> the Articles are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48716:5"/>
burned publikely, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners put in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and (a ſecond expedition) undertaken againſt them.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Scots</hi> Reformers were put to work again by a new undergoing of War, which they perform as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, with wiſdom and reſolution, and with ſucceſſe, under Gods bleſſing: For, having in a very ſhort time ſetled their own Countrey, by ſubduing thoſe who had then riſen and ſtood out againſt them, they come into <hi>England</hi> to ſeek out the Enemy, who was bound for their Countrey; unto whom they give a repulſe, and thereafter they come forward to <hi>New-castle,</hi> from whence they ſend their Commiſſioners to treat with the King, where all the time they ſtayed, they behaved themſelves with ſuch temper and moderation, that their ſworn Enemies had nothing to ſay againſt their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> incoming and abode at <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> did embolden ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, chief Gentry, and Magiſtracy, to petition the King openly and freely for a Parliament, to redreſſe all the diſturbances in the Common-wealth, both of Church and State.</p>
            <p>The King, although he had never intended to have any Parliament (as was clear, not onely by divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of himſelf, and of the Court, but alſo by the managing of publike affairs) is neceſſitated by reaſon of the <hi>Scots</hi> to grant a Parliament, which he doth, and ſince he could not refuſe it, his ſecond thought is how to make it work for his purpoſe, which he endeavoureth by cauſing to be choſen divers Members of the Commons, ſo far as he was able to do, what by his own private Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, what by the Court-dependers, Nobles, and others of credit: but all will not do; for ſome of thoſe who were choſen by his procurement are rejected, others do not anſwer according to his expectation: Then he plots with the Army he had gathered againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48716:6"/>
Papiſts, to undo the Parliament; but the Plot, through fear of miſcarriage (the <hi>Scots</hi> being ſo neer) is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and faileth.</p>
            <p>After this, the King hath his recourſe to the <hi>Scots</hi> themſelves, if they would come forward and deſtroy the Parliament, they ſhould have the plunder of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London</hi> for their pains, with the four next adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Counties for their inheritances, beſides ſtore of money.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> are ſo far from conſenting to this baſe act, that they reject it with diſdain, and give notice of it to the Parliament, with aſſurance of their affection and faithfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Upon this, the <hi>Scots</hi> are cryed up to be Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Army, by ſome, and the Parliament to be for the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then jealouſies muſt be raiſed againſt the <hi>Scots, That they would never remove, nor go home.</hi> This reproach is raiſed and ſpred abroad by the adverſaries of Church and State, and received by the ſimpler ones, otherwayes well-meaning and well-diſpoſed men.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Scots,</hi> to take away all kinde of ſuſpicion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire home peaceably. Then the King muſt follow them home to try concluſions:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He eſſayeth again if the <hi>Scots</hi> Army could be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted for his deſigne: But he loſeth his pains.</p>
            <p>Next, He goeth on, and being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth if he can make ſure the chief oppoſers of the great deſigne, as of ſome alſo who had not ſerved him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truſt he had given them therein: This Plot alſo faileth.</p>
            <p>By this time, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> break forth in Rebellion, burning and ſpoiling the Countrey, and ſlaying the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants there amongſt them: The Villains give out, <hi>That they have nothing to ſay againſt the</hi> Scots <hi>their old Friends, Brethren, and neer Neighbours, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48716:6"/>
againſt the Adherents to that wicked Parliament of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>ſo diſpleaſing to the good King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This they did, hoping that by theſe fair words, and not doing harm at firſt to the <hi>Scots</hi> amongſt them, to make the <hi>Scots</hi> be quiet, whom they knew would be very ſoon in readineſſe to fall upon them, if the King and Parliament of <hi>England</hi> would allow and deſire it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> make offer of their Service unto the King (while he is amongſt them) for repreſſing the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi>: He waves the buſineſſe, and puts it off, with <hi>that he could do nothing without the Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and ſo he cometh to the Parliament, where till he was conſtrained, he ſaid little or nothing of the Rebels; at laſt, he is made to make a Declaration againſt them, and then courſe muſt be taken for repreſſing them. The <hi>Scots</hi> continue to offer their aſſiſtance; but with ſhifts, they were put off by the Court, and by ſome corrupt men fiding with the Court, for a long time.</p>
            <p>At laſt, the <hi>Scots</hi> ſend an Army into <hi>Ireland,</hi> willing to do their beſt; but not being furniſhed with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the proſecution of the Service, nor ſupplied in their wants, they could not go on ſo earneſtly and with ſuch heartineſſe as they themſelves wiſhed: ſo after divers of them had ſtarved and periſhed for want, ſome return back to their own Countrey, yet they leave there a conſiderable body under the conduct of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Generall <hi>Monro,</hi> which number had abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtarved if it had not been ſupplied from <hi>Scotland,</hi> who although it was not able to provide for that Army in ſuch a proportion as was needfull for a more earneſt purſuance of the Service, yet they kept them alive, and encouraged them to go ſtill on with the Work; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Army there hath not done all what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of them, yea not ſo much perchance, as ſome men conceive they might have done, yet one thing is acknowledged by all, That this Army hath kept alive
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48716:7"/>
the Proteſtant-buſineſſes in that Kingdom; for without it, the ceſſation and compliance with the Rebels had gone on through the whole Countrey, unto the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Common Cauſe, and to the damage of theſe Kingdoms; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army ſent thither, being corrupted and drawn hither by the King, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant-Indwellers in <hi>Ireland</hi> had complyed, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Court for the moſt part.</p>
            <p>But to return unto <hi>England:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having left <hi>London,</hi> reſolves to make War againſt the Parliament, and being at <hi>Windſor</hi> he cauſeth to gather together ſome men, to try what he could do in the buſineſſe; but he ſeeing his few gathered men to be diſperſed by the Countrey, finds for ſuch an undertaking he muſt have a help from beyond Seas; to this effect, he ſends the Queen unto <hi>Holland</hi>: and he finds that he muſt go further off from <hi>London</hi>: So after her depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he goeth to <hi>York,</hi> where he ſets afoot, and lays all the deviſes he can to make War againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> hearing of this, preſently ſend Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to deal with him, and to deſire him to leave off the deſigne of making Civill War in <hi>England,</hi> while the Proteſtants were thus maſſacred in <hi>Ireland.</hi> He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatly rejects their remonſtrance, and ſends them back, not ſuffering them to come any further according to their order and mind, which was to repair unto the Houſes of Parliament, and to deal with them for the taking away all miſtakes betwixt the King and them.</p>
            <p>The King having eſſayed all he could in <hi>York</hi>-ſhire to little purpoſe, at laſt cometh Southward to <hi>Nottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham,</hi> where ſeeing his bad ſucceſſe in his undertaking, he ſends to the Parliament for agreement. The buſineſſe is ſlighted (at leaſt not ſo earneſtly laid hold on as the <hi>Scots</hi> had done, at far leſſe ouverture) by ſome chiefly who ſince have made known that they had more their own particular to heart then the publike good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48716:7"/>So the King continuing his deſigne of War, with the few men he had then, goes Weſtward, where he gets more men, and ſo with open force carrieth on the War.</p>
            <p>The Winter following, the <hi>Scots</hi> ſeeing the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the ſervice of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſlacked, yea in a kinde neglected, and things come to a great hight in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the loſſe of much blood already, and ſpoile of a part of the Countrey, reſolve to ſend once again unto the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (then at <hi>Oxford</hi>) the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners that were ſent to him at <hi>York,</hi> with one or two more from the Church and State. The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved for a paſſe to them, refuſeth it for a time; but at laſt he grants it as they deſired, which was to repair freely to and fro betwixt him and the Parliament as the occaſion ſhould require; Upon which, the <hi>Scots</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners come to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and tell their meſſage to the King, who ſlighteth them, and uſeth them coldly and corſely: After their abode for divers moneths, to no purpoſe, they give notice to thoſe who had ſent them, that they could do no good with the King, not ſo much as to have liberty to go unto the Parliament, yea not to converſe with the Commiſſioners from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament then at <hi>Oxford.</hi> At laſt they are ſent for to go home.</p>
            <p>The King not being willing at that time to give ſuch an open occaſion unto the <hi>Scots,</hi> as to make them riſe then in Arms, ſends their Commiſſiones home with generall and ambiguous words, and tels them that if they would be quiet, he would ere it were long have reaſon of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>; but if they ſhould ſtir, he would be put to it. So they go home, and give accompt of their voyage.</p>
            <p>The K. perceiving partly by the Commiſſioners, partly by his ſpies from the Countrey, that ſince he would not be moved to agree with the Parliament, the <hi>Scots</hi> were inclining to ſide with the Parliament in caſe of need;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48716:8"/>
ſo underhand and ſecretly he ſets a Plot afoot to give them work ſo at home, that they ſhould not think of going abroad.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners are hardly arrived, but there breaks out an undertaking by Malignants, in the South part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the favour of the Garriſon of <hi>Carlile,</hi> (then in the Enemies hands) and the Papiſts in the North part of <hi>England:</hi> but by Gods bleſſing the buſineſſe is quaſhed, and order is taken for the ſecuring of the Countrey from all inteſtine inſurrections and forrain invaſions, withall to be in readineſſe to help their Friends in <hi>England,</hi> at a call.</p>
            <p>So the Sommer goeth on, in which the Kings party prevaileth ſo far, that they maſter all <hi>England</hi> (ſome few places reſerved) except the aſſociated Counties about <hi>London,</hi> and theſe in a very tottering condition, with a great dejection of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Upon this exigence, the major part of the Houſes of Parliament thinks it fit time to deſire the aid of the <hi>Scots</hi>; they in all appearence being the onely men they could call to for help:</p>
            <p>Firſt, By reaſon of their common intereſt in the Cauſe of Religion and Liberty with the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, In reſpect of their neerneſſe and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In reſpect of their bound duty to requite (according to power) the favours their Fathers former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they themſelves lately, had received from the good people of <hi>England</hi> in their own troubles.</p>
            <p>Divers in both Houſes were againſt the ſending to the <hi>Scots,</hi> choſing rather to undergo the extremity, then to be beholding to their Friends.</p>
            <p>After divers debates and delays, at laſt, it is reſolved upon to ſend Commiſſioners into <hi>Scotland.</hi> None of the Peers could be perſwaded to go.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48716:8"/>The Commons ſend their Commiſſioners (Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Houſe) with power from the Peers to tranſact and agree for both Houſes with the <hi>Scots,</hi> by whom they are welcomed with heartineſſe, as they had been for a long time expected with devotion.</p>
            <p>They come to treat; and in a word, The <hi>Scots</hi> tell the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners, That ſince they deſire their aid and help, in oppoſing the Common Enemy in this Common Cauſe of Religion, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and change whereof is mainly intended by the Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all other things being but ſubſervient to this deſigne, as the Houſes of Parliament did well and wiſely declare in that Declaration they ſet forth when they were to take Arms for the Cauſe; it were very fit that there ſhould be a ſolemn Oath and Covenant drawn up and taken by both Nations, to be ſtedfaſt to the Cauſe of Religion, and ſettle it againſt all hereſies and errours, tyranny and confuſion.</p>
            <p>And ſo much the rather did the <hi>Scots</hi> move this, that they had been told by the King ofter then once, and by divers of high rank, yea all the papers written by the Court againſt the Parliament, did tell over and over again, that the Parliament did not intend a ſetled Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Church, notwithſtanding that they had called a Synod.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners did reply unto the <hi>Scots,</hi> That they could not but acknowledge that the thing was fit to be done; yet they had not the power to do it by their Commiſſion. Upon this, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſend hither to the Parliam. for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>As ſome of the ſaid Commiſſioners did ſay this in ſimpleneſſe and ſincerity of heart, Others did what they could to delay and wave the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it were poſſible; for they had no liking to it, as we have ſeen ſince; yet it was no time to reject the <hi>Scots</hi> ſo juſt deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48716:9"/>So the <hi>Scots</hi> ſend Commiſſioners to the Parliament, who together with ſome deputed from the Parliament, draw up the Covenant, and it is ſolemnly taken.</p>
            <p>One of thoſe who went unto <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, followed thither the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, and did what he could to obſtruct the drawing up of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to wave the taking of it; yet he was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take it, with others of that mind, for it was then not ſeaſon to appear otherwayes.</p>
            <p>The Covenant is no ſooner taken, but the Court changeth its language of the Parliaments intending no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Schiſms and Sects, and tels us, That hereafter the King will have a care of tender conſciences; which was, ſince he could not hinder the making and taking of the Covenant by both Kingdoms, at leaſt he will do his beſt to hinder divers particular men from taking it, and from ſtudying to keep it, as that which is the moſt contrary to his deſigne.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners ſend the Covenant into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where it is generally taken; and thereafter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to agreement, the <hi>Scots</hi> come into <hi>England</hi> for the help of their Brethren; but it was the deep of the Winter, to wit <hi>January,</hi> before they could be ready: So in froſt and ſnow, they come as far as <hi>Tyne,</hi> finding but ſmall oppoſition by men to that place; their main ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were evil weather and want; being come to <hi>Tyne,</hi> they find an Enemy with a Body of Horſe and Foot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding them in number, namely in Horſe, Maſter of all behind him to <hi>Trente,</hi> except <hi>Hull,</hi> and of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about, and ſtrong holds.</p>
            <p>After divers encounters and skirmiſhes, the <hi>Scots</hi> paſſe the River in ſpite of the Enemy, whom they make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire before them, and alſo keep together, and weary him ſo with hot Service and conſtant alarms, that divers of his men fell ſick with toiling and lying without in ſo hard a ſeaſon. At one encounter neer <hi>Durham,</hi> they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48716:9"/>
made 7 or 8 hundred fall to the ground of the Enemy his men. Then they take <hi>Hartlepoole</hi> and other places upon the Sea, from whence they had all their proviſions from <hi>Scotland,</hi> for a good while, till at laſt ſome are ſent to them from the South, namely, from the Citie. As they were thus preſſing the Enemy, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> iſſueth out from <hi>Hull,</hi> (whereinto he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himſelf for a while, being conſtrained to leave the Field) aſſiſted by Sir <hi>John Meldrum,</hi> and fals upon <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> which he takes with valour and ſucceſſe. Upon the news hereof, the Enemy runs to <hi>York</hi>; the <hi>Scots</hi> follow upon the heels, and take ſome of his men and baggage. Preſently the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> his Forces (have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come after his Son upon this ſucceſſe) and the <hi>Scots</hi> Forces, joyn together neer <hi>York</hi>: The Enemy fearing to be incloſed, ſends a party of his Horſe Southward, which is followed by a joint party of the <hi>Scots</hi> &amp; <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> his men as far as <hi>Trente</hi>; then the followers return, and reſolution is taken to beſiege <hi>York</hi>; but the <hi>Scots</hi> having left ſome of their men in divers places that they had reduced, had not men enough to beſiege the Citie, and keep the Fields in the Enemies Countrey, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the addition of <hi>Fairfax</hi> his Forces: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they wrote to the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> to come and help with his Forces, which he did willingly with all ſpeed he could. Then ſome there were who were againſt the joyning of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> and his Forces with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Fairfax,</hi> as there had been lately ſome who would have them to go home at the taking in of <hi>Selby,</hi> and as ſome had been againſt their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, and thereafter ſome were employed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>York</hi> to ſow the ſeed of diſſenſion betwixt the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Generals with their Forces, and as ſome likewiſe were railing at the <hi>Scots,</hi> while they were daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring and skirmiſhing with the Enemy. After this another ſort of men began to ſhew themſelves unto the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48716:10"/>
world, ſeeing that by the help of the <hi>Scots</hi> they were made able to appear again, who for their miſcarriage of things durſt not ſhew themſelves, and finding in themſelves that they began to ſtand upon their own legs, they feel the pulſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> to try if they were plyable to their phantaſies and opinions, &amp; perceiving the <hi>Scots</hi> conſtant to their principles, and firm unto their Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to care leſſe for thoſe who had raiſed them from the duſt; yea, they begin to oppoſe the <hi>Scots</hi>; and, to make the relation ſhort, the Battel of <hi>York</hi> is fought and the Town taken.</p>
            <p>In all ſuch actions thoſe new factious men, to indear themſelves unto the ſimple people, by their Emiſſaries, ſpred abroad that they did all; but God knows they had little ſhare in things.</p>
            <p>After the buſineſſe of <hi>York, Mancheſter</hi> returns into the aſſociated Counties; <hi>Fairfax</hi> ſtayes in <hi>York</hi>-ſhire; and the <hi>Scots</hi> return towards <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> where they find a new ſupply of ſix thouſand men under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Earl of <hi>Calendar,</hi> to repreſſe the Enemy, who had been for a while domineering thereabouts in that Countrey, while the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was ingaged at <hi>York</hi>; who having drawn neer, make their approaches, and lay a formall Siege about the Town, which after ſome moneths pain, they take by ſtorm, having tryed all means poſſible to keep things from extremity, but it could not be; yet their moderation was ſuch after they had taken the ſaid Town, that it was admired by their Enemies.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Scots</hi> were thus buſied about the Siege of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> they were ill ſpoken of by thoſe new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious men, who expreſſed tokens of ſadneſſe when they heard it was taken.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Scots</hi> clear all the four Northern Counties except <hi>Carlile,</hi> (which of late they reduced by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48716:10"/>
and ſo the Winter coming on, they kept in their Winter-quarters.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Scots</hi> (making the quarrell their own) did ſend their Army to fight in the Field, to help their Friends and Brethren by action; ſo they ſend Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners both from Church and State, to help with their counſell the carrying on of things in Church and State.</p>
            <p>When the Commiſſioners come hither, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto themſelves to find nothing ado, but to go on with the Work unanimouſly, for the good of Church and State, againſt the Common Enemy. But ſince, they have found themſelves hugely miſtaken; for, where they thought to have moſt oppoſition, they have found leaſt; and where they did look for none, there have they found moſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some factious men in the Synod have ſtopped the concluſion of things there; it is without example, that ſo few men being convinced with Scripture, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, antiquity, and the example of the beſt reformed Churches ſo, that they have nothing to reply, yet in ſtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>urneſſe they will not give over to diſturb. It is found true in thoſe men which is remarked, <hi>That the more mildly the adverſaries of Peace and Truth be dealt withall, the worſe they are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, in the Counſell of State, the <hi>Scots</hi> have a long time been croſſed in a high meaſure, by thoſe who were againſt their incoming; and thereafter ſtill have been oppoſed by theſe men, and their participants, who are advers to the ſetling of the Church.</p>
            <p>The former did oppoſe the <hi>Scots,</hi> namely becauſe they were not to approve their wayes in the managing the affaires of State, and thereafter perhaps in the Church-government.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, Becauſe the <hi>Scots</hi> cannot give way to their phancies and faction in Church-buſineſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in the State; but ſtand conſtantly to their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48716:11"/>
principles, and firm to the Covenant, not regarding to either the one or the other, with temper and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give offence to no body, if it were poſſible unto them.</p>
            <p>The Spring drawing on, the <hi>Scots</hi> preſſe to have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for the Field. After much delays, things go to them in <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> but in a very ſmall proportion. Howſoever, they are no ſooner ready, but they diſpoſe themſelves for marching: till then, they were not idle, but they were buſied up and down to the ſetling the Northern Counties, and they did ſend parties to and fro unto their Friends; namely unto Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> they ſent a party of Horſe by <hi>David Leſley,</hi> who then made the Kings Forces turn back, which at that time did intent to go through <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> for <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereafter, as the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was moving and about to march Southward, they have advice given them, that the King being then towards <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> was bound once more for <hi>Scotland</hi>; to ſtop which, the Army went with great difficulties and did ſo put themſelves in his way, who made him change his reſolution, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Southward again.</p>
            <p>And at that time the <hi>Scots</hi> ſupplied their Friends which lay then before <hi>Carlile,</hi> who were there altogether unprovided. Thereafter they return Southward; and although by agreement they were not to paſſe <hi>Trente,</hi> yet in compliance to importunities, they paſt and went Weſtward towards <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and cleared the Fields there ſo of the Enemy, that he durſt not appear before them.</p>
            <p>Next, Againſt their own Maxime, which is to clear the Field and wait upon the Enemies motion, that they may alwayes be in readineſſe to hinder his courſes &amp; purſue him; to ſtop the clamours of ſome raiſed againſt them, they lay down before <hi>Hereford,</hi> which if they had been ſupplied with neceſſaries at firſt, they had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48716:11"/>
taken; and when they had the things required for the Service in ſome meaſure, the great rains hindered them to perform what they earneſtly intended, and whereunto they were prepared. As they were thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged about <hi>Hereford,</hi> the King with all his Horſe, having made a great circuit, goes Northward, where; by divers promiſes made unto him, he did hope to do great things for his deſigne.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> ſend their whole body of Horſe (ſome few excepted) by <hi>David Leſley,</hi> who by his diligence and activity, gets North before the King, and ſends him back Southward once more, and ſo breaks that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</p>
            <p>At this nick of time, cometh the news to <hi>David Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley,</hi> being then neer <hi>Trente,</hi> upon his return South in purſuance of the Kings party, and he is deſired to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland</hi> without delay, and help his own Countrey in diſtreſſe, by an overthrow that the Enemy had given there to the Forces of the Countrey. He thinks to go onely with a party into <hi>Scotland</hi> himſelf, and ſend back the reſt to the Army before <hi>Hereford:</hi> but the whole Company hearing of the ſtraigth of their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, would needs go with him. Of this he giveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Committee of both Kingdoms and to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before <hi>Hereford,</hi> and ſo goes into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Army before <hi>Hereford</hi> having deſigne to end the Work they were there for, and ſeeing the Enemy his marching unto them, upon <hi>David Leſley</hi> his going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſend unto their Friends at <hi>London</hi> for a help of ſome Horſe to be neer by them (as in <hi>Gloceſter</hi>-ſhire) in caſe of need, they not having Horſe enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Enemy, and to ſerve the Army to bring in the proviſion, which they were conſtrained to do with ſtrong hold in the Enemies Countrey, having ever ſince their march Southward ſtruggled with great difficulties for neceſſary proviſions, yea for divers dayes they have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48716:12"/>
been without bread. But they could obtain no Horſe, howſoever ſome were very willing to grant their juſt deſire.</p>
            <p>Things being thus, it is put to a Counſell of War whither they ſhould ſtorm the Town, or no; ſome that were moſt forward, gave their voice for the ſtorm; others voiced, It was fit to ſave the Army whole, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how the poſture of affaires was then at home; and ſince ſome of their Friends for whom they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone ſo much, were backward to aſſiſt them in their great extremity, they thought it the ſafeſt courſe to raiſe the Siege, and return Northward to help their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and ſo the plurality of voices carried it, and Northward they went.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Scots</hi> were upon their march in <hi>York</hi>-ſhire, news comes to them that <hi>David Leſley</hi> had given a great overthrow to the Enemy in <hi>Scotland</hi>; yet they went: after this, they are deſired by the Parliament to come back and beſiege <hi>Newark,</hi> and not to ſtay there in the North Countrey, for fear of burdening that Countrey, ſo much already waſted, as was given out.</p>
            <p>The Parliaments deſire is not anſwered ſo haſtily as was expected, which hath given occaſion to ſome to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate and do what lieth in them to make ill blood, and not to ſtay for an anſwer, nor receive any reaſonable one without reall performance of what was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whereunto the <hi>Scots</hi> are moſt willing; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they have ſo few Horſe with them, they conceive it is not ſafe to venture their Foot when the Enemies Forces are onely in Horſe: and chiefly, becauſe they knew that the Enemy was to ſend a conſiderable party into <hi>Scotland,</hi> hoping to make a great faction there by the help of his Friends by the way, and ſo joyn with the Enemy there; and the Malignants in the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were to riſe with the open Enemy.</p>
            <p>And ſo it proved indeed; for the Enemy ſends from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48716:12"/>
               <hi>Newark</hi> a great party of Horſe, commanded by <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> and <hi>Digby:</hi> They were meet withall by the <hi>York</hi>-ſhire Forces, commanded by <hi>Poyntz</hi> and <hi>Roſſiter,</hi> who dealt ſo roughly with them, that they were routed, divers killed, and many taken, with a great part of their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; yet they rally again, and go on in their journey to invade <hi>Scotland</hi>: Before they were at the borders, they were a thouſand ſtrong. Generall <hi>Leſley</hi> having notice of their deſigne, ſends a party under the command of <hi>Vandruske,</hi> with expreſſe order to fight with the Enemy whereſoever he found him. <hi>Vandruske</hi> followeth ſo actively the Enemy, that he thinks to get into <hi>Scotland</hi> before him, and ſend him back again; but he miſſeth him: and the Enemy going another way, enters into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where there were divers parties ordered to wait for him, and fight with him; one from <hi>David Leſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48716:14"/>When by treachery at divers encounters, the Enemy did prevaile againſt the Forces of the good party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſome of the ſuperficiall Brethren about <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>-Hall, jearing and gibing, could ſay, <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>could not and durſt not fight in their own Countrey:</hi> which at this time they find untrue; for the <hi>Scots</hi> have ſhewn ſince that they both can and dare fight, not onely one to one, but one againſt two, (contrary to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb <hi>Ne</hi> Hercules <hi>contra duos</hi>) yea one againſt three. Let the glory be to God, who is pleaſed to own his own Cauſe, and honour deſpiſeable men to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this his Work, to the confuſion and ſhame of the Haughtie.</p>
            <p>The Enemy had ſo laid down this Plot of invading <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he promiſed unto himſelf (without fear) an iſſue according to his mind; for he thought having once entred in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Papiſts, Atheiſts, and Libertins, (for Sectaries there are none) to make up in the lower Countrey a great party; and ſo joyning with the Enemy now afoot in the hills (who is gathering what he can, and hath already betwixt three and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, although divided amongſt themſelves, as we are informed) he did think no leſſe then in a very ſhort time to ſubdue all <hi>Scotland,</hi> and preſently thereafter, to come into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who have read the intercepted Letters, can tell much ſtuffe to this purpoſe; but <hi>he that compteth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his host compteth twice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rumour of this deſigne was ſo great in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the good party thought fit to draw a good part of their Horſe Southward, and to make ſure the chief and moſt commodious paſſages to hinder the conjunctions of the inteſtine Enemy, and the invaders; ſo <hi>David Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley</hi> lay with one party at <hi>Glaſgo</hi> upon <hi>Clyde,</hi> and <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton</hi> with another at <hi>Alloway</hi> neer <hi>Sterlin</hi> upon <hi>Forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea to ſee this enterpriſe repreſſed is the chief reaſon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48716:14"/>
why the <hi>Scots</hi> Army in the North of <hi>England,</hi> did not come ſo ſoon Southward to <hi>Newark</hi> as was deſired: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> juſt and lawfull delay of the <hi>Scots</hi> for a time, by factious and malicious men, although they knew very well the reaſons and the cauſe thereof, is publiſhed as a deniall; and ſo it hath been beleeved by the ſimpler ſort, and laid hold on as <hi>argent contant</hi> preſent count; it is not enough for the malicious and factious ones; not conſidering that the good party in <hi>Scotland</hi> hath made the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments quarrell its own, in joyning with it in Covenant for the purſuance of the Cauſe it took Arms from the very firſt beginning, that is, for the Truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, all things whatſoever, yea Liberty and Priviledge being ſubſervient unto it, as it is expreſſed, firſt, in generall terms in the Declaration at the giving the Commiſſion to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>; then, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>This ſheweth the forgetfulneſſe of him who in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly, was ſo unmindfull of the Truth as to aver that Religion was not the ground of the quarrell betwixt us and the Common Enemy at the firſt, abuſing the ſimpler ones, and making uſe of the connivence of others; yea, he was put at work by ſome to ſay ſo, at leaſt, he was applauded by them, as the ſtory runs.</p>
            <p>This quarrell here in <hi>England</hi> hath coſt the <hi>Scots</hi> a great deal of pains:</p>
            <p>Firſt, In the Counſell both of Church and State.</p>
            <p>Then, In the Fields, with the loſſe of many a gallant &amp; brave man, which they think all well ſpent &amp; beſtowed, ſince God hath been pleaſed to make uſe of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to put forward in ſome meaſure his good Work in both Church and State, and to repreſſe the domineering of the Common Enemy, who ever ſince the conjunction of the <hi>Scots</hi> with the State of <hi>England,</hi> hath been declining (if the thing be well conſidered with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) although now and then he hath had ſome <hi>lucida
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48716:15"/>
intervalla,</hi> as we have all ſeen.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Scots</hi> think their pains, labours, expences, charges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> well beſtowed, ſo they complain not of the manifold reproaches and lyes that have been ſaid and ſpred againſt them, what by the open Enemy, what by the falſe Friends, nor of the hardſhip their Army hath endured to this day in the Field, no more then of the ſmall content of their Commiſſioners in the Counſell, which all they paſſe and lay aſide, not as inſenſible and leprous men who have no feeling, for in any other thing they are touchy enough; but as being reſolved to do all what they can, and ſuffer what they are able, for the Cauſe of God and of his people, with grief of mind to ſee thoſe whom at firſt they conceived certainly to be right and round in this buſineſſe, to have corners and by-wayes wherein they muſt acknowledge the ſhortneſſe of their own judgement and confeſſe the infirmity of man: But their great grief is, (at leaſt ſhould be) that their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath not been timely nor duly furniſh'd with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies and neceſſaries, to make it go on with action in the Field; yea to ſee them kept back from doing as if it were plotted of purpoſe: Then, that their counſells in Church and State have not onely not prevailed, but have been hid, yea oppoſed, and ſo hindered to yeeld their due fruit unto the Cauſe in hand as they intended. Beſides all theſe things, in joyning with the Parliament in action and Counſell, and coming in when it was below a ſtand, they have not onely expoſed themſelves and their poor native Countrey to all kinde of perills and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, but have drawn evil upon it.</p>
            <p>More, They have gone in the higheſt degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the King; for they have not onely in down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right terms declared themſelves oppoſite to his deſigne, but have quite ſpoiled it; which as he told them, <hi>he would eaſily compaſſe in this Kingdom, if they would be quiet:</hi> and indeed he had brought his buſineſſe to a pretty paſſe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48716:15"/>
before the <hi>Scots</hi> came in. Then their coming in into <hi>England,</hi> and their going before into <hi>Ireland,</hi> did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty their native Countrey much of men of Counſell and action. So for <hi>England</hi> they left their own Countrey as if it were to be a prey unto the Malignants there, who ſince, not being kept under by the good party by reaſon of its weakneſſe, ſhew themſelves to be in great number.</p>
            <p>Next, The indifferent and neutrals, whereof there be but too many everywhere, moſt men looking more to their convenience here upon Earth, then to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, or to his Kingdom; who had ſided former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the good party, bearing the ſway; but ſince ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them abſent for the moſt part, helping their Friends, and weakeſt at home, begin to have other thoughts, and fall in with the Malignants.</p>
            <p>All this being perceived by the King, who hath his thoughts full of revenge againſt the Covenanted <hi>Scots</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> bethinks himſelf of all means poſſible to oppreſſe and deſtroy that poor Countrey of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and, in the firſt place, the <hi>Danes</hi> are invited to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it, unto whom are promiſed the Iſles of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kades</hi> for their pains, (their old pretenſion;) But as the <hi>Danes</hi> were preparing to come hither, God ſends them another work to do at home, which was to defend themſelves from their invaders, to wit, the <hi>Swediſh</hi>; with whom after a great ſtrugling by Sea and by Land, they have been conſtrained to make their peace almoſt upon any terms: Yet we hear they are now making again themſelves ready for War, and againſt us (as we are informed) to try perhaps if they can make up their loſſes in ſome meaſure (in one way or other) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p>Again, The King ſeeing the <hi>Scots</hi> ſiding with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam. of <hi>England,</hi> ſets afoot Plot upon Plot in the South part of <hi>Scotland:</hi> but by Gods bleſſing they all fail, being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48716:16"/>
no ſooner diſcovered but repreſſed, and thrown in the duſt.</p>
            <p>More, By Pyrates and men of War having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the King, the <hi>Scots</hi> Ships with goods and men are taken, yea divers men are thrown overboord: Their onely quarrell is the conjunction of the <hi>Scots</hi> with the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in the Service of this Common Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The loſſes the <hi>Scots</hi> have ſuffered by Sea ſince their ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Parliament, do exceed far the monethly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance agreed upon for their Army, although it were well and fully payed; which they are far ſhort of; for ſince theſe eight moneths, they have had but one moneths pay to wit, about Thirty thouſand pounds, and theſe from the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſt of all, The King bethinks himſelf, (ſince he is pleaſed to own all the undertakings of the <hi>Juncto,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be not alwayes one of the number, it taking its authority from the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholike Princes abroad more then from him, although he hath the name of all;) to ſend over out of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſome of thoſe deſperate Villains, who at their firſt riſing in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did offer all kindneſſe unto the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſaying that they would not ſtir againſt them; who take a fit opportunity of the good party of the <hi>Scots</hi> being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent out of their Countrey for the moſt part, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Iſles and the Hills, finding a party of Malignants, ſome whereof and the chief Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had been ſent from the Court to manage the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who not only privatly do favour &amp; openly do ſide with them, but make a number of diſguiſed Villains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the truſt they had from the Countrey, in places of power and command, yea ſome in the time of action in the Field, either ſlakly acting againſt the Enemy, or flying from before him, or running over to him, at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places and times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48716:16"/>So the Enemy increaſeth his party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and deſtroyeth divers places of the Countrey, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lands of thoſe who were moſt deeply ingaged with <hi>England,</hi> (above all the high Lands of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Argyle</hi>) which they have totally depopulated and burnt, as the Lands of his Friends; ſome other parts they have ſo depauperate and waſted, that in one County they have put many ſcores of good Families to meer mendicity What did moſt then grieve good men, was to ſee not onely the good Work of Reformation at a ſtand and not likely to go on, as they looked to it with carnall eyes; but alſo the former abominations ſet up again, and alſo to ſee the poor well-meaning people (for fear) aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the Truth, and imputing unto the profeſſion thereof the cauſe of their ſufferings, as many men do when they ſuffer for the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now albeit the loſſes be great and exceſſive which the <hi>Scots</hi> have had by Sea, in regard to the extent of their Countrey; yet their loſſes and damages by Land are a hundred times greater and more.</p>
            <p>Further, God ſuffered the wicked Enemy, by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the chief Leaders and Directors of buſineſſes, to give a great overthrow to the good party of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at which, as the good party was much dejected, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in his pride was highly puft up, and he thought to carry all things before him, maſtering all; but in a ſhort time, it pleaſed God to abate his pride by a great Victory againſt him, God making uſe of <hi>David Leſley</hi> for that Service.</p>
            <p>More, As <hi>Digby</hi> and his aſſociates going to the wicked Enemy in <hi>Scotland</hi> had firſt a good blow in his way thither, and then was totally defeated at the ſecond time, when he thought himſelf, as it was, at his joyning with the Enemy in <hi>Scotland:</hi> So doubtleſſe, under Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ere it be long we ſhall hear, that the wicked Enemy there, having had already this great blow, will have next his fatall and totall deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48716:17"/>Here let it be noted, that among the papers taken from the Enemy, when he had this great blow given him by <hi>David Leſley,</hi> there were found inſtructions for the holding of a Parliament, wherein all things ſetled in Church and State ſince the yeer 1639, were to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and altered, the Covenant broken with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels, ſo were they pleaſed to call all thoſe who ſtand for the Parliament; thoſe who had been active for the Covenant, to be furniſhed and deprived of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l benefit and priviledge of a Patriote or native, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ranks and ſtations.</p>
            <p>All the ſufferings and undergoings of the <hi>Scots</hi> for their joyning with the Parliam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ſo far neglected, that not onely in their diſtreſſe they are not helped nor aſſiſted, as generoſity had required, after ſo much undergone for Friends at home and abroad, making other mens quarrel their own, and drawing evil upon themſelves for their ſake; but divers who have received benefit in a high meaſure by their joyning and incoming, have been glad heartily at their ſufferings, expreſſing now and then, <hi>It was well they were beaten</hi>; and when they were droven to the greateſt pinch of neceſſity, what by the prevailing Enemy, what by the fault of their Leaders, which lies heavily upon ſome; at laſt, having kept off to trouble or diſquiet their Friends, going conſtantly on with the Work ſo far as they were inabled, and could do: they required ſome help of Arms, and of Money due unto them; but what comfort they received more then a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Faſt, and private condolance of ſome Friends, let them tell if they can: Yea when they were thus low, then they were moſt neglected and vilipended by ſome; Was it not ſaid by ſome of your prudentiall men, <hi>That the Scots would undo both themſelves and this Kingdom?</hi> yet their wiſdom and valour, bleſſed with ſucceſſe in their own affaires, were not queſtioned before they were joyned with <hi>England</hi> in the buſineſſe, and if they had not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48716:17"/>
come in, <hi>England</hi> was undone, at leaſt a good part thereof.</p>
            <p>Was is not ſaid, <hi>That they had buried their honour at</hi> Hereford? Yet they have ſhewn ſince that they had both heart and hand to gain and to maintain honour.</p>
            <p>Was it not told openly, <hi>That they ſhould be ſent home, as being troubleſome to the Countrey: and if they would not go with good will, they muſt be killed by half-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not their Gariſons, and Places of retreat, (ſo long as they are in the Service of the Publike) which they have reduced and brought into obedience with a great deal of pain, loſſe, and hazard, demanded from them, and ſpoken to be put in the hands of thoſe who are not thought to be faithfull to the Cauſe we have all fought for to this day?</p>
            <p>If this ſmell of piety and generoſity, let God and all the World judge.</p>
            <p>Here I forbear to give anſwer to this; onely I ſay, It is done, and let it undergo the cenſure of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and indifferent men, without exception: onely we ſhall ſee how this ſtands with the Publike Service, and with the Treaty, to deal ſo with Brethren and Friends, who have put their breaſt betwixt their Brethren and the ſtroak of the Enemy, and who did ſtand firſt in the gap againſt the Enemies Plot, to teach their Brethren to be upon their guard, and timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Enemies aſſault; yea, who (under God) have put their Brethren in poſture of defence, by occaſioning the Aſſembly of Parliament, and in protecting it by their ſtay here for a time, laſtly, by reſcuing it (as it were) from the jaws of Death, and from the brink of perdition. Now, by neglecting, vilifying, croſſing, and oppoſing, to diſhearten Brethren who have been and are to this day, ſo uſefull unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Common Cauſe, cannot be but much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48716:18"/>
to the happy end intended by us all, to wit, the ſetling of a true Reformation in Church and State.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Scots</hi> went not upon higher principles then thoſe of human intereſt, of phanaticall opinions, of ſelf-conceit, and the like, this uſage of ſuch Brethren could not but produce ſo bad effects as the hinderance of the end intended, with the loſſe of all whatſoever hath been done, employed, and undergone thereabouts, and the deſtruction of both Nations at laſt. But bleſſed be God who hath given them wiſdom and longanimity not to be ſo diſturbed with the forenamed occaſions of miſcontent, as either to be weary of the Work, or to leave it off. And to uphold them therein, God yeelds the <hi>Scots</hi> the good will and aſſiſtance of divers well-affected men, maugre all malice and malignity, with the earneſt deſires and wiſhes of the people for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the firſt purpoſed and purſued end, which is (in few words) the Glory of God, and the ſafety of his people.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee how this carriage towards the <hi>Scots</hi> ſtands with the Treaty and Covenant made with them at their incoming:</p>
            <p>Are not the Brethren of <hi>England</hi> with their Ships bound by the Treaty, to guard the Coaſts of <hi>Scotland</hi> by Sea, to ſave it from forrain invaſion, and to ſecure the <hi>Scots</hi> in their trading by Sea? But how ſlakely this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath been performed, the great loſſes and wofull ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of that poor Countrey can now tell; of which inconveniencies and evils they had been free, at leaſt to this preſent, if they had not joyned with their Friends in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it will be ſaid, <hi>When the Enemy had done with</hi> England, <hi>his deſigne was with all his power to go into</hi> Scotland.</p>
            <p>But human reaſon tells you, That it is wiſdom to put off an evil, if we can, for a time; for he that hath
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48716:18"/>
time hath life, as it is commonly ſaid; and the mean while, God will provide ſome means or other to return the evil from his people.</p>
            <p>And ſo human Policy would have taught the <hi>Scots</hi> to look to themſelves, and be quiet: but their zeal to the Cauſe of God could not ſuffer them, and for it they have undergone all this hardſhip, who can and will deliver them in his appointed time. And if thoſe for whom they undergo this Service, do not requite faithfully their kindneſſe, God will by ſome means or others not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, but recompenſe them according to the ſincerity of their intentions: But if any of the <hi>Scots</hi> (as I doubt not but there be ſome) who had or have ſome by-ends in this Work, God will puniſh them for it, and ſhew their vanity for mixing their own intereſt with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who requires the whole of man, which is ſo known to the Enemy of God and of his people, that he cares not what good a man do, providing he can nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in him any little evil, being ſure to catch him at laſt, if he do continue in it.</p>
            <p>Then the Brethren of <hi>England</hi> are bound not onely by reaſon, to make the <hi>Scots</hi> no worſe then they have found them, that is, then they were before their late conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for it ſtands againſt the Laws of all human Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and partnerſhip, that one party being preſerved from totall ruine, and reaping a ſeen benefit by the Society through the hazard and great loſſes of the other party, not to make the party at leaſt in the ſame condition he was before the Society: far more is it againſt Juſtice, to ſee the party undone and periſh for us; above all, if we can afford him help or comfort; leaſt of all, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and make our own advantages of his loſſes, who hath loſt himſelf for us.</p>
            <p>If the thing be ſo among particular Societies of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why not ſo betwixt State and State, who are nothing elſe but a Congregation of leſſer Societies? And if Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48716:19"/>
is to be done by the leſſer, Why is not the greater far more tyed to it? For the moſt part, particular men are either puniſhed, or cried out upon, as cheaters, if they cozen or deceive their fellows. And ſhall States eſcape free not onely from cenſure, but be thought wiſe and prudent men, for their deceits? And ſhall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening in publike affaires be not onely not thought evil, but eſteemed as a vertue?</p>
            <p>Hence cunning deceitfull man is called Politick, and deceit is called Policy. To ſuch hight of wickedneſſe are we now come, that vice muſt go under the name of vertue; for Policy is the honeſt, juſt, and prudent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of publike affaires, and not deceit and guile in them.</p>
            <p>If it were onely to give ſin a term leſſening the ſhame of the crime, it were to be born withall; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to call ſtealing, robbing, and ſpoiling, plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as now adayes we do. But to call vice vertue is intolerable.</p>
            <p>Next, We may ſee if this ſtands with the Treaty by this ſole inſtance, which is here inſerted as it is in the firſt article:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in caſe that notwithſtanding the monethly ſum of Thirty thouſand pounds payed as aforeſaid, the States of</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhall have juſt cauſe to demand further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Brethren of</hi> England, <hi>when the Peace of both Kingdoms is ſetled, for their pains, hazards, and charges they have undergone, they ſhall have due recompenſe made unto them by the Kingdom of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Now if the <hi>Scots,</hi> for their pains, hazards, and charges, be not payed of their monethly allowance, How is the Treaty obſerved? But the neceſſity of the times may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, (if there be not a full payment) when there is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to perform if there were capacity: But to give reproaches and injuries with threatning and to ſend men home with ſhame and without ſatisfaction, who have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48716:19"/>
done and undergone ſo much for thy good and to ſave thee from perdition, is doubtleſſe far from grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>I pray thee, What is it, and how far is it from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not to allow men to run home and quench the fire in their own houſe, left having devoured the one, it ſhould deſtroy the other? which it would do, if it were not quenched in time: Yea, ſo long as the fire was but burning in one end of the houſe (in reſpect of the ingagement) it was in a manner little regarded: but when it came to ſhake the very foundations of the building, and deface it quite, then it was full time to look to it: And yet it cannot be approved by ſome, becauſe forſooth <hi>There was not a formall warning given as in decency was fit:</hi> yet it was done with ſuch order as could be expected upon ſuch a nick of time.</p>
            <p>But here it may be ſaid, <hi>What needs all this to ſpeak of the Treaty? Hath ever been any Treaty made betwixt two Nations or States, but each have made their beſt advantage of it? and ordinarily the Southern Nation hath been too cunning for the Northern; as may be ſeen in all the Treaties betwixt</hi> Spaine <hi>and</hi> France, Spaine <hi>hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunning'd</hi> France; <hi>and ſo in the Treaties betwixt</hi> France <hi>and</hi> England, France <hi>hath over-reached</hi> England; <hi>and ſo of ſuch others, for the moſt part.</hi> But as the Southern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath over-reached the Northern by ſlight and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo the Northern oftentimes hath ſurpaſt by Field-action the other.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this is from the conſtitution of the body in the Northern people, (vile domineerers) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are inclined to do things rather by a ſtrong hand then otherwiſe. In the Southern people, melancholy reigneth, whereby they are inclined unto deviſes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe things with leſſe force and hazard; for where there is moſt wiſdom, there is leaſt hazard. The more North

or South that a people be, the more or leſſe they have the one of the other.</p>
            <p>But ſince the Treaty betwixt the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> runs upon other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to wit, of Religion, this human over-reaching, cunning, or ſurpriſing, is not and ought not to have any place; but all is to be guided by conſcience according to equity before God, and as weare ſworn to in our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, now, let us ſee how this agrees with the Covenant, whereby we are all ſolemnly ſworn to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and advance the ſetling of a through Reformation in the Church, according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Neighbour Churches; and if theſe reproaches, injuries, and hard uſage of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who have contribute ſo much to bring this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſuch a poſture, do not proroge the compaſſing the ſame end, let God and the World judge.</p>
            <p>And then, Are not theſe things flatly againſt the third article of the Covenant, whereby we are all ſworn to defend one another in this Common Cauſe? which how do we perform, when we deny aſſiſtance to our Brethren in diſtreſſe, and will not allow them to help their own ſelves, yea we rejoyce at our Brethrens ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings?</p>
            <p>Are we not bound alſo by the fourth article, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtop and remove any thing which may or might give any wayes occaſion of miſtake, and conſequently of diviſion betwixt the two Nations? Yea we are ſworn to diſcover thoſe who endeavour any ſuch action: and ſo according to Oath, I here declare, That it is thoſe incendiaries, and factious ones, who contrary the ends expreſſed in the Covenant, phancy to ſet up their evil opinions, and invent all means they can to hinder the ſetling of Government in the Church, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as appears by all ſymptoms) to bring Anarchie in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48716:20"/>
the State, promiſing to ſet down a Seraphin-Modell of a Church, which they after ſo long forbearance will not nor cannot agree among themſelves to ſet down; onely they are reſolved to ſtop the ſetling of the Church-government, (according as aforeſaid) to the end that all hereſie, errour, licence, libertiniſme, and corruption, may creep in the Houſe of God: this is their main drift, after their own intereſt.</p>
            <p>Then, Is not the dealing of theſe factious men with the <hi>Scots</hi> againſt the fifth article of the Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are all ſworn not onely to keep a good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency betwixt the two Nations; but alſo to keep a fair Union for ever?</p>
            <p>Here theſe factious men will ſay, <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be thus dealt withall, for not doing more Service then they have done this Sommer, and not following the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which is anſwered,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let it be ſeen what the <hi>Scots</hi> have done; and if that which they have done, be not as much important to the Common Cauſe as any thing done elſewhere by any.</p>
            <p>Then, If they have not done more, let it be ſeen where the fault lieth, whether in them that would not do, or in others who have ſtopped them from doing, by hindering them to be furniſhed and provided for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther action.</p>
            <p>More, Let it be ſeen whether or no it were not out of good reaſon, and not by chance, that they have not inſtantly followed the courſe they were deſired to do; and whether or no it had been better for the Service of the Common Cauſe to have ſo far complied with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes preſſed by thoſe who either would not or did not ſee and foreſee what is moſt advantagious for the Common Cauſe; or whether or no there was a ſet Plot to undo the <hi>Scots</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48716:21"/>Then, The <hi>Scots</hi> are accuſed <hi>To lie heavily upon the Countreys where they come, and that they have done many things againſt the Liberty and Right of the Subject of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, As for their burdening or wronging the Subject in the leaſt kinde, it is not their intention, being come in into <hi>England</hi> for the relief and righting of the Subject from the oppreſſion and injury of the Common Enemy: and if any Souldiers or Officers of theirs have exceeded in any kinde, upon juſt tryall of their faults, they are to ſuffer and to be puniſhed for it; beſides, all things taken by wrong, are to be reſtored, and repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be made to the full by the judgement of honeſt and underſtanding men, upon the place, to the end that all miſtakes may be taken away, and the Union kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Nations, in ſpite of faction and malice againſt upright men.</p>
            <p>Further, Let it be known, how the <hi>Scots</hi> are payed, and how they offer to repay ten for one for any thing taken by extortion, if they could have the half pay that others have employed in the ſame Service.</p>
            <p>For this, the <hi>Scots</hi> have frequently ſollicited.</p>
            <p>If the Committees of <hi>York</hi>-ſhire (ſet a work by ſome ſecret Enemy) had not gone ſo high, and publiſhed at every Pariſh-Church their orders againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> as the Prelats did in former times with their bloody thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts of excommunication; and if they had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in whoſe hands the Liberties and Rights were, when the <hi>Scots</hi> came in to help, or where their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees were then ſitting, and how far their orders had been obeyed then; they might have thought whether or no they had ever had a Parliament given to authorize them, if it had not been for the <hi>Scots</hi>; and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being aſſembled, whether or no ſitting this day.</p>
            <p>Till theſe factious men did riſe, (who beſturre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48716:21"/>
ſo much now of late) it was ſaid ordinarily for any Reformation obtained either in Church or State, and for ſtopping any evil to the Publike, or to any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, <hi>Gara mercy good Scot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this is now forgotten by divers private men to their ſhame and diſcredit, ſo theſe factious men would have it to be out of memory by the Publike: but they ſtrive in vain; for, neither Parliament nor People, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod nor Church will ever, nor can forget what they owe to the <hi>Scots</hi> for the good they enjoy at this preſent, and hope to enjoy hereafter, in Gods Mercy.</p>
            <p>Then, It is reproached to the <hi>Scots</hi> (to their great grief,) <hi>That they purſue too rigidly the ſetling of the Church, which may be done at leaſure when other things are ended, and muſt be performed with ripe conſideration, for fear of miſtake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>That they preſſe too much for Peace, when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent none can be made but by the overthrow of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As alſo, <hi>That they ſtand ſo much for Royaltie, when God knows the King deſerveth but little at their hands, they being the men he hath the greatest ſplen againſt, and whom he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es most, as he declares himſelf by all his expreſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all this they anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they are obliged in the firſt place to ſee the Houſe of the Lord ſetled, and then to look to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things: for this they have not onely Law and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to begin at God; but alſo, example, Firſt, out of the ſacred Hiſtory, where we ſee that all true Reformers of the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> did begin at the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Houſe of God: Then we ſee the ſame in the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory practiſed by the Ancients: And of late, Hath not the ſame been done in our Neighbour-Countreys, yea in our own, by our Fathers? And is it not full time, after ſo long and ſo tedious a debate, ſince it is agreed upon, how, &amp; what it ſhould be, by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48716:22"/>
full conſent of Divines aſſembled for that purpoſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſome few of a private ſpirit for ſelf-conceit and by-intereſt, who having nothing to anſwer unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Truth and the reaſons for it, made known unto them, yet with obſtinacy do oppoſe the ſetling of the Church; and ſo way is given (if not countenance) to all kinde of hereſie, errour, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God, ſo generally and ſo long a time, now theſe five yeers, ſince the Reformation is in hand?</p>
            <p>As for the preſſing of Peace by the <hi>Scots,</hi> Is it not full time, after ſo much blood ſhed, devaſtation of the Countreys, and ſuch a deal of all kinde of wickedneſſe committed in the War, to ſeek after a firm Peace, &amp; lay hold upon any occaſion to help us to it? Firſt, Becauſe it is the end we make War for, not having intention to make a Trade of it. Then, If we beg for Peace at God, Why ſhould we not ſeek earneſtly after it from man, by all honeſt means? Otherwiſe, God will not grant our demands, and will tell us that we are but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, having a thing in our lips when our hearts are far from it.</p>
            <p>As for ſtanding for the King, It is true, we ſtand for him, and reſpect him, as we do on the other part ſtand for the Parliament the great Counſell of the Land, as thoſe whom God hath been pleaſed to ſet over us, not fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and feignedly idolizing &amp; worſhipping them as gods on Earth impeccable, one day, (as Paraſites and Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants do) and another day vilifying and rejecting them, when our turn is not ſerved by them: but ſincerly, &amp; with reaſon; for as we avouch him to be our Soveraign Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, ſo we acknowledge him &amp; all thoſe of the Counſel to be but infirm and weak men, him miſled &amp; miſcarried for the moſt part by thoſe who are about him, deceiving him to his own and the peoples ruine; and them alſo ſubject to miſtake and errour: So as we pray God for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48716:22"/>
him to ſave and protect him from doing evil, &amp; from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving evil; we freely admoniſh him both from Church and State of his errours and faults both before God and man: This we do both in private and publike, as the cauſe requires or occaſion will permit; and when neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity drives us to it, we take Arms to oppoſe the evil courſes he is inſnared in, and repreſſe them, alwayes with reſpect to his Office and Perſon, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be lawfull, and him lawfull poſſeſſor thereof, and no further we go then to ſtop him from doing evil, if we cannot gain him to do good.</p>
            <p>Then for faults, although they be great, we muſt not change till we ſee that we can do better. We have aboliſhed the Prelacy, not ſo much for the abuſes thereof as for the unlawfulneſſe of it, although of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, it being againſt the intention of God expreſſed in his Word, howſoever wreſted by the Prelats; but for Royalty, it is approved and ordained by God, &amp; hath ſo continued with us, that we can hardly leave it; beſides we find already ſuch inconveniencies by not keeping it up in its due right and authority, that we ſmart hugely for it; and if it were altogether caſt off, we ſhould be far worſe; witneſſe the infinite diſorders now adayes.</p>
            <p>Now let the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ingenuouſly confeſſe, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ey never have told the tenth part of the truth of things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, which he hath heard of from the <hi>Scots.</hi> Hath the Parliament and Church of <hi>England</hi> ſpoke ſo home, and acquainted him ſo freely with his errours as the <hi>Scots</hi> have done? or would they have ſo withſtood the evil courſes he is caſt in, had the <hi>Scots</hi> not ſhewn them the way?</p>
            <p>Then, we muſt not caſt off a good accuſtomed and lawfull office, for the faults of a man who bears it, yea in the exerciſe of it, and that about main buſineſſes; for lawfull things are not to be rejected for the abuſes, but the abuſes to be taken away, and a reformation to be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48716:23"/>
made; otherwayes the moſt things and moſt neceſſary ſhould be caſt off; for we offend almoſt in all things, and abuſe many things.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid, <hi>The King hath spoiled the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and endeavoured to overthrow the Liberties and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true; but if he had not found Peers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the three Kingdoms to ſecond the evil counſels ſuggeſted unto him, he would never have attempted it; for they cauſed him to ſet the work afoot, and they laid down the wayes to go on with it, and have ſerved him in it. Although that other kindes of government may be fit for other people, ſure I am, Monarchie is beſt for us, being regulated (according to the Law of God and right reaſon, with the Prerogative and the Priviledge ſubſervient,) to the good of the people.</p>
            <p>Then, It is reproached unto the <hi>Scots, That they are a poor weak people, and not conſiderable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truely, They do not hold themſelves either potent or conſiderable in regard of greater Nations; but ſuch as they are, God hath made them very helpfull to other Nations, which think themſelves very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:</p>
            <p>For example;</p>
            <p>Did they not turn the ballance in the affairs of <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh, when things were very low with the <hi>French</hi>? for at their going to help that King, they found him ſo diſtreſſed and ſo under the power of his Enemy, that he was conſtrained to keep himſelf at <hi>Bourges</hi> in <hi>Berry.</hi> Hence he was called in deriſion, <hi>King of</hi> Bourges. But in a very ſhort time, they helped him ſo, that he repoſſeſſed himſelf of his whole Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and repulſed the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Now, Have they not done more unto their Brethren of <hi>England</hi>? Have they not made their quarrell their own, expoſing their lives and all that is dear unto men
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48716:23"/>
for them? And by their help, are not their Brethren come to have the face of affaires changed unto the better, ſo far, that not onely they are come to equall terms with the Enemy, but they have brought him ſo low that in likelyhood he will not riſe again ſo haſtily?</p>
            <p>Howſoever the <hi>Scots</hi> be inconſiderable in the eyes of ſome men, yet God in his goodneſſe, hath conſidered them ſo far, as to make them uſefull inſtruments in this his great Work of oppoſing the Enemies of his Truth, both open and declared, and ſecret and undermining.</p>
            <p>And ye ſee both parties of open and ſecret Enemies to the Truth of God, have conſidered the <hi>Scots</hi> ſo far, that each of them hath by all cunning preſſed to have the <hi>Scots</hi> for and with them; but the Enemies ſeeing they could not prevaile, they have made their earneſt ſtudy by deviſes and Plots underhand, and by open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and force, to wit, by an abſolute and declared War, as far as they can, to deſtroy the good party in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as the onely obſtacle of hindering the one and the other Enemy to compaſſe their deſignes, and to ſet up their by-ends.</p>
            <p>Hence the good party in <hi>England</hi> conſidereth the <hi>Scots,</hi> as their onely helpers; for without their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they had all been undone before now: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are ſtrong in appearence for the preſent, if the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould retire and leave them, it is conceived upon juſt grounds, that they were to begin the play again.</p>
            <p>As for deſpicability, Howſoever the <hi>Scots</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by ſome now adayes, I am ſure, had it not been for theſe deſpiſed men, many here who are at this time come to a great hight, had been in little conſideration: and they whoſe valour and wiſdom are ſo much queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned at this time, ſurely in their own buſineſſe, they did ſhew themſelves to have both, to the admiration of their Neighbours; and their valour and wiſdom were never
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48716:24"/>
queſtioned till they were joyned with <hi>England</hi>: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have ſhewn &amp; do ſhew daily both, as much as men can do for the carrying on the Work wherein they are ingaged, unto the content of all impartiall men, although not to the mind of ſelf-conceited, phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and by-ended ones, who gave out <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>will deſtroy them and themſelves:</hi> Surely I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had the <hi>Scots</hi> framed their courſes according to the deſires altogether of ſome men, they had long ere now both been deſtroyed; and had they not ſo far complied with the humours of ſome men, the Publike Service had been in a better eſtate, in all probability.</p>
            <p>In this I blame the wiſdom of the <hi>Scots,</hi> for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they had not ſuffered their own Countrey thus to be ſpoiled, in compliance to ſome, when they might have helped it in time.</p>
            <p>As for their means, Although in the eyes of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabondants they be not ſo conſiderable, yet they were ſuch that they lived well upon them, and they could wiſh with all their hearts to have no more then they had when they joyned with <hi>England</hi> for the Service of this Common Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And if they reproach the barrenneſſe of the ſoile in <hi>Scotland,</hi> It is the fault of the Climate which lieth ſo Northerly, and not of the people; and the ſoile, if it be not ſo fertile of fruits as hotter grounds; yet it abounds in men of valour and wiſdom as much as any Countrey whatſoever of its compaſſe. And theſe deſpicable ones, of old and of late, have obtained Victories againſt great and conſiderable Enemies, by valour. Perhaps if the <hi>Scots</hi> were more enclined to husbandry, or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ground and other things which nature affords them, by the goodneſſe of God, they would be in a kinde more plentifull of conveniencies for the life of man then they are.</p>
            <p>As to the Gariſon-Towns which the <hi>Scots</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48716:24"/>
from the Enemy for the good of this Church and State, with hazard, hardſhip, and loſſe of divers brave men, and which are ſtill in the <hi>Scots</hi> hands for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Service, it hath miniſtred one convenient occaſion unto thoſe factious ones to make a great deal ado, yea to ſtrive to bring things to a breach betwixt the two Kingdoms, if it were poſſible; and they have proceeded ſo far as to cauſe the Towns and Places to be demanded from the <hi>Scots</hi> betwixt ſuch and ſuch a day, without any conſideration unto equity, Whether or no it is juſt that the <hi>Scots</hi> have ſome places of retreat, ſo long as they are in the Service of the Common Cauſe, wherein they are obliged by Common Intereſt, and bound by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to continue till the full ſetling of things in Church and State.</p>
            <p>Next, Without conſideration if it be or not for the benefit of the Service now in hand, that theſe Gariſon-Places ſhould be left by the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſince we have ſeen by divers paſſages and occurrences of affaires that it hath proved very uſefull for the ſaid Service that thoſe places were in their hands for a time, namely in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of <hi>Digby</hi> with his aſſociates towards <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, When we caſt our eyes upon thoſe who have an aim particularly at the having of thoſe places, we ſhall finde it to be fit for the Service of the Cauſe which we fight for, that thoſe Gariſon-Towns ſhould remain with thoſe who now have them for a time, who are both conſtant and truſty to their true principles of the Covenant, and the others altogether againſt the good of the ſaid Service.</p>
            <p>Yea, It is moſt prejudiciable to the Cauſe we have now in hand, to put thoſe places in the hands of thoſe who either ſide with the Common Enemy ſtill in their affections, as they have been ſerving him openly by their actions formerly; or of thoſe who underhand with cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48716:25"/>
ſtop the ſetling of things amongſt us as we are ſworn to by the Covenant, and ſo fruſtrate ſo far as in them lies the intention of it.</p>
            <p>Further, Thoſe men who are ſo little faithfull to the Covenant, cannot from their heart, mind the good of the State, or people, more then they do the welfar of the Church.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Scots</hi> took Arms for the publike Service, they neither pretended, nor did intend, to hold the places they have taken any longer then the ſaid Service ſhall require for the ſetling of the ends of the Common Cauſe expreſſed in the Covenant, no more then they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, witneſſe their returning ſo quietly home, and their refuſall of thoſe Seigneuries, Towns, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties adjacent, from the King, to joyn with him againſt the Parliament; and that more then once.</p>
            <p>Me thinks, that after all this, all rationall and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall men ſhould ſpeak clearly for the <hi>Scots</hi> fair and honeſt intentions, ſince they are entred into ſo ſolemn a League and Covenant, for which they have undergone and do to this day undergo ſo much hardſhip, hazards, and loſſes.</p>
            <p>Men may talk and babble, yea deviſe tricks and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, for a time; but it is honeſty and truth that holds out to the end; and it ſtands with Gods Juſtice to make lyes and double dealings fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I will adde this ſhort enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, There hath been a great buſling raiſed by thoſe factious men, who trouble both State and Church, about the publiſhing of ſome papers given in to the Houſes of Parliament by the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners. Thoſe men had prevailed ſo far with ſome of their Friends in authority, as to make an exact ſcrutinie by whom theſe papers were firſt printed, and by whoſe order, (as for the ſecond impreſſion they had nothing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48716:25"/>
to ſay, which the Commiſſioners cauſed to be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a nicety for ſome faults of the Printer committed in the firſt impreſſion;) thinking themſelves wronged, namely, becauſe it was not corrected according to their mind; and the thing to have been done without their expreſſe order; but ſince it was done, it could not be ret called.</p>
            <p>Next, Thoſe factious men moved their Friends in authority to draw up a Declaration againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> for thoſe papers, with very tart expreſſions, as we are informed: but after riper deliberation, the fume of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger being ſetled, the thing was left off a time; for they did clearly perceive, that no Declaration ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the people could be made againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> or their papers, ſince it could not be demonſtrated that full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in reaſon had been given to the <hi>Scots</hi> upon their ſeverall papers from time to time given in.</p>
            <p>Now, Let the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners confeſſe, that they have failed by their ſilence, in not making known unto the world from time to time the papers of greateſt concernment which they have given in to the Houſes, and what ſatisfaction they have received upon them; for if they had done ſo, they had ſpared themſelves of much drudgery, and of many ſad thoughts for the ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they have received by reaſon of ſome factious men, who have hindred due ſatisfaction to be given unto their juſt deſires; and they had ſtopped many evil reproaches raiſed againſt their Nation, and againſt their Army: and laſtly, the publike Work had gone better on; for thoſe who have thus long time ſtopped it, had not been able to carry things ſo under boord as they have done: and ſince the publike is ſo concerned in main things, is it not fit they ſhould be known by the Publike.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Scots</hi> muſt be warry, mild, and civill, where they ſhould have been plain, rightdown, and forward in the buſineſſe they come for.</p>

               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48716:26"/>Wiſdom and warrineſſe are good, and civility is to be praiſed; but reſolution and forwardneſſe carry on the two thirds of human actions, (namely when the cauſe is good; for ordinarily men impute much warines to want of courage, and great circumſpection to doubtfulneſſe and irreſolution: there muſt be a mixture, otherwayes things cannot go well on;) both publike, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
            <p>This I ſay for the Truths ſake, and not to blame the Commiſſioners; for I know, from the beginning, they have taken the way which in all ſincerity they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the beſt for the advancing of the Work they are come hither about: but they have miſtaken themſelves, not being throughly acquainted with the temper and intereſt of thoſe on whom they have relied ſo much, that they were ſaid to dote upon them; no more then of ſome others with whom they have ado withall.</p>

               <p>THe Independents in their great charity towards Church and State, and in their zeal to the glory of God, and to the good of his people, after they had, firſt, put off the calling, then, the meeting of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines for a long time, thus fruſtrating ſo far as in them lay or as they can, the good intention of the Parliament, and the expectation that the people had of it, for a true and through Reformation in the Church, according to the Word of God, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the beſt Reformed Neighbour-Churches: then, after they had kept the Aſſembly (once met by the Authority of the Parliament) for many moneths a trifling about ſmall matters; at laſt, being put to it by their miſcarriage of things, the <hi>Scots</hi> come in, and the Covenant is taken, the Diſcipline of the Church in all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48716:26"/>
earneſtneſſe is fallen to by the Aſſembly of Divines, the ſetling whereof the Independents (notwithſtanding) have oppoſed with all their cunning and might, for long time; but at laſt, they are ſo convinced, what by the ſacred Scripture, what by ſtrength of reaſon of judicious and knowing men, what by the practiſe of the primitive Churches, and what by the example of the modern beſt Reformed Churches, that they have nothing to reply, and ſo they are conſtrained to be ſilent at the reſult of the Aſſembly upon the matter: but yet they remain ſtubburn in their wilfulneſſe and ſelf-conceit, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves to be the onely wiſe men, and to have the beſt knowledge in the wayes of God</p>
               <p>Then, in charity, and by a ſuperabundant compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Independents are by the Synod deſired to bring in it what poſitive Diſcipline they would be at, and they have ſix moneths granted unto them for that purpoſe; during which time, they gave out, <hi>That they were to produce ſtrange things, with new lights:</hi> but when the day of performance came, upon which they ſhould have brought thoſe great and ſo much expected things into the Synod, they were not ready, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded further time.</p>
               <p>Upon the Independents deſire, ſome more dayes are from the Synod granted unto them, at the end of which they promiſed to declare what they would be at poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: but in lieu of a poſitive Diſcipline ſo much looked for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they give a paper full of reproaches and complaints of their harſh uſage; when never men have been dealt withall with ſo much tenderneſſe, meekneſſe, and longanimity, as they have been dealt with in the Synod; for it is without example, to ſee a few men having neither Scripture, reaſon, nor example for them, thus diſturb ſuch a Reverend and learned Aſſembly ſo long, and ſtop their going on with the Work of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48716:27"/>At laſt, The Independents do declare (when by the Authority of the Parliament there was a Committee, in compliance unto them, and upon hopes to gain and reclaim them by fair terms if it were poſſible, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to agree the differences betwixt the Synod and them) and ſay, <hi>That they would have a toleration to all thoſe who oppoſe Popery in its fundamentalls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, to underſtand this demand of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, we muſt enquire what is meant by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls of Popery.</p>
               <p>Truely, in all probability, by the fundamentalls of Popery muſt be either meant the grounds, or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which it is builded, and laid; or the main and eſſentiall parts whereof it is compoſed.</p>
               <p>The grounds and foundation whereupon Popery is builded, are ambition and avarice, by the conſent of all judicious and impartiall men.</p>
               <p>The main and eſſentiall parts of Popery, are corrupt Diſcipline and corrupt Doctrine in the Church, both directly oppoſite and contrary to the will of God decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his written Word, and to the primitive times.</p>
               <p>Now, If the Independents and their adherents, can clear themſelves of the fundamentalls of Popery, to wit, of ambition and avarice, and of corruption of Diſcipline and Doctrine, I wiſh they may not onely have toleration, but alſo the hand of Brotherly Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: but their hunting after moneys and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with their ſelf-conceits and ſelf-love, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that they cannot deny the two firſt, ambition and avarice.</p>
               <p>As for the corruption of the Independents in their Doctrine and Diſcipline, the Synod can tell enough of it, beſides the writtings of many learned and well-minded men againſt their Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: For all, thou may conſult Maſter <hi>Bailey</hi> his Book, where their beginnings and growth are ſet down clearly out of their own writtings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48716:27"/>Then, The Independents muſt preach to the people, yea in preſence of the Houſes of Parliament, upon a ſolemn day of Faſting, <hi>That it was hard meaſure to ſtop them from preaching, and dogmatizing upon</hi> (I know not what) <hi>niceties of Diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be no more but niceties in diſpute betwixt the Synod and the Independents, then let the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents tell me where is their charity, ſo much vaunted of; or, where is their ſelf-deniall for a meer nicery, in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for ſo long a time both the Parliament and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and in ſtopping the ſetling of the Church to the glory of God, and for the comfort of his people; for doubtleſſe, were it not for them, the Church-affaires had been ſetled long ago, and the Countrey had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with faithfull Paſtours to feed the Flock of Chriſt long before this time: But God in his hid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, for Cauſes beſt known unto himſelf, hath ſuffered this ſetling of the Reformation to be thus retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſtopped by theſe Sons of diſſention to this day.</p>
               <p>As in this we adore the good Providence of God, yet we cannot but accuſe our ſelves of manifold ſins, whereby we are thus kept back from the enjoying of a through and ſetled Reformation.</p>
               <p>The Independents do here inſtance, <hi>Why doth the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod deal ſo rigidly with them, as not to comply with them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let God and the World judge, Whether or no ſo Reverend and learned an Aſſembly, called and met together by Authority of the Magiſtrate to give out the Platform of a true and through Reformation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word of God, and conform to the pureſt primitive time and the beſt Reformed Neighbour-Churches, having the Word of God for their Rule and Warrant, with the example of the pureſt Antiquity, and of the beſt Reformed Churches now adayes, and that not onely by practiſe of their ſetled Diſcipline and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48716:28"/>
Doctrine; but alſo their ſentiments and advices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the points in diſpute with the Independents, with the judgement of the learnedſt Orthodox men in this part of the World; it be fit that the Synod ſhould lay aſide the Truth of God and the good of the Church, and yeeld to the phantaſie and conceit of ſelf-witted and by-ended men, who make Religion a cloke to their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and avarice, by faction, troubling both Church and State.</p>
               <p>Then a great ſtickler of the Independents moves the Houſes of Parliament for a toleration for thoſe of his holy Society, Fraternity, and adherents, to have Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience in the tranſmarin Plantations, thinking by theſe means to make a ſtep for the ſame Liberty at home.</p>
               <p>This cunning of the Independents is ſo eaſily to be ſeen, as white threed upon black cloth. But how the Magiſtrate can condiſcend to it, I know not: True it is, the Magiſtrate at his entry, finding men in a Countrey profeſſing erroneous Doctrine and Diſcipline, may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to preſſe or trouble them for their errour; (ſo the Magiſtrate in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not preſſe the <hi>Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> for their errours, yet did he not ſuffer them to dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize and openly commit Idolatry, to the diſhonour of God, and to the withdrawing of men from the Truth;) but to authorize men in their errour, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it in duty to God, nor in good will towards man; for ſelf-Worship of God is far leſſe to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Magiſtrate, then diſhonouring of parents, ſtealing and adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon is, The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects immediately upon God, who will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped according to his Rule which is ſet down in his Word, and not according to the phancies of ſelf-conceited men: Otherwiſe, in vain God had eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rules, according to which he would be ſerved in ſpirit, and not juſtly had he puniſhed Nations for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing his Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48716:28"/>Then, the Independents plead for not troubling their conſciences.</p>
               <p>It hath been the obſervation of many remarking men, That there was never time nor place, when and where the name of conſcience hath been ſo much uſed for a covert to carriage of things, both in Church and State, as now adayes, and amongſt us. And if judicious men will ſeriouſly conſider the conſcience this day in every mans mouth, they ſhall find it to be but little more then a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>-conceit miſled by wilfull ignorance, in ſome men, but for the moſt part, by worldly intereſt of ambition and avarice; For, if you take conſcience in a right notion (to ſpeak homely and plainly of it in this place, without ſubtilizing,) it is a knowledge of the ſoul with God, of our carriage towards him and towards man.</p>
               <p>Now, Whether this carriage of ours be right or no, we are to judge of it,</p>
               <p>Firſt, and principally, By the Rule of Gods, Word.</p>
               <p>Next, and conſequently, By right reaſon, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws, ſubſervient to the Rule of God, ſimply and purely, without by-reſpects, and meerly for the glory of God, and for the good of man.</p>
               <p>Now, Let thoſe who have conſcience (and the tenderneſſe thereof) ſo much in their mouths, caſt up their accounts, Whether or no they do ſet before their eyes the glory of God and the good of man, according to the Rule of God, and to right reaſon, or Laws of man, ſubſervient to this ſet Rule, without any by-reſpect of worldly ambition and avarice.</p>
               <p>Further, Have not the Independents endeavoured ſeverall times to diſſolve, at leaſt to adjurn the Synod? Yea of late they went ſo far on as to move it in the Houſe of Peers; but the motion was rejected (although they had made a good party for the buſineſſe) by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48716:29"/>
of the Houſe, and praiſe to that Noble Lord <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> who firſt anſwered.</p>
               <p>At this time, The Independents do what they can to make a quarrell betwixt the Parliament (with the people) of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſince they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they would find but ſmall oppoſition in their deſigne, if the <hi>Scots</hi> were not in their way: This they tell in their particular diſcourſes freely, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form really ſo far as they are able.</p>
               <p>So, firſt, The <hi>Scots</hi> underhand muſt be ſtopped from all conveniency for their Army, and from every thing to go on with the Service in this Common Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Next, The <hi>Scots</hi> Army muſt be preſſed Southward, on this ſide of <hi>Trente,</hi> to undo it by want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>Then, The main Committees of the Countrey muſt be forbid to ſupply the <hi>Scots</hi> with any thing, yea cauſed underhand to obtain an Order from higher power, to furniſh the <hi>Scots</hi> with little, or nothing at all.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, The <hi>Scots</hi> muſt be cryed out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as idle and laſie, not minding the publike Work, and as being burthenſome to the people.</p>
               <p>Yea, more, They muſt be grievouſly complained on, as taking exorbitantly from the people; and men muſt be perſwaded, induced, and forced to come unto the Parliament, with complaints againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon and equity, and further, contrary to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for, by ſtipulation it was accorded, <hi>That no complaint ſhould be made unto the Parliament againſt the</hi> Scots, <hi>till the buſineſſe were tried by the Committee of both Kingdoms, reſiding upon the place; and thereafter, if ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and reparation had not been granted, the recourſe was to be had unto the Parliament.</hi> Witneſſe this ſeventh Propoſition, and the Anſwer unto it; which I have thought fit to inſert in this place following, that every one may ſee the truth of things.</p>

                     <hi>That for the complaints that are or may be made of the</hi> Scottiſh <hi>Army to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Committee do conceive it juſt, That the complaints ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the</hi> Scots <hi>Commiſſioners, as is deſired: And for the preventing of ſuch complaints to the Parliament for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That the Committee of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms reſiding with the</hi> Scots <hi>Army, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the redreſſe of them, if poſſible, upon the place.</hi>

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>After all this, upon complaints made on purpoſe, The <hi>Scots</hi> muſt be ſent back in all haſte without any more ado, without regard to what they have done, what they are doing, and what they may do for the publike Cauſe now in hand, and without reſpect to the Treaty made betwixt the two Nations, and to their mutuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. And this went on ſo far, by the artifice of the Independents, that it was moved in publike by a great ſtickler of that Faction, and a Venter of their Plots.</p>
               <p>Thereafter, The Independents have another thought, which is to have the Garriſons (taken in by the <hi>Scots</hi> from the Enemy) in their poſſeſſion, namely <hi>Carlile</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48716:30"/>
                  <hi>New-castle,</hi> as places fit for their plantations; from the one, they do think to ſpread their ſeed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſend it over to <hi>Ireland</hi> with facility; and from the other, to have eaſie commerce with <hi>London, Amſterdam, &amp;c.</hi> and this is becauſe the <hi>Scots</hi> hinder their Plots.</p>
               <p>But let the World judge whether or no it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the <hi>Scots</hi> return preſently back into their Countrey, and give over thoſe Garriſons, before the Work be ended, that is, Religion and Peace ſetled, for which they have done and ſuffered ſo much abroad and at home in their zeal to the Cauſe and kindneſſe to their Friends; and leave all to the adverſaries of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and whether or no they ſhould have any place of retreat in caſe of need, ſo long as they are about the Service.</p>
               <p>And, Is it to be thought, that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould return home <hi>re infecta,</hi> they came hither for, when they are conſtantly willing and in capacity to go uſefully on with the Service, to ſay nothing of the juſt thanks due unto them for what they have ſuffered and done in their love to the Cauſe, and affection to their Friends?</p>
               <p>What? Muſt the <hi>Scots</hi> abandon the Gariſons to the adverſaries of the Reformation, who have already ſome ſticklers in <hi>New-caſtle</hi> who begin to broile and to trouble the People with their errours and phantaſticall dreams, leading to Faction and diviſion?</p>
               <p>Laſt, The factious Independents (in what truth, we ſhall ſee it preſently) give out That it is by their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, purſes, and valour that things are brought to ſo good a paſſe, and unto the happy condition we ſee them in, for the ending of theſe troubles.</p>
               <p>To this I answer;</p>
               <p>Let no man ſacrifice unto his own worth, merit, or action; for it is a great ſacriledge to take away from God his due, who is all in all, ſince in him we are and move, not having either being or motion but by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48716:31"/>
him originally, and by his continued upholdig and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of us.</p>
               <p>Then, It is Idolatry to put any thing whatſoever in the lieu of God. But let this paſſe for this time.</p>
               <p>As for the wiſdom, purſes, and valour of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Where were they before the <hi>Scots</hi> coming in? Yea, Where were they before the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Oxford</hi>?</p>
               <p>And to begin at their wiſdom, By a great deal of cunning they have ſtopped the ſetling of the Church to this day, and conſequently the ſetling of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, The Church being as it were the ſoul, and the State as the body of the Common-wealth: except the Church, that is the ſoul, be in a good poſture, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth cannot be well: And for the State, or politike part of the Common-wealth, They are the cauſe of all the jarres, jealouſies, and miſtakes betwixt men of both Nations, and betwixt divers in this one Nation, yea betwixt City and Parliament.</p>
               <p>Next, By craft from the very beginning of this War, the Independents have ſcrued themſelves in imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and got in to have a main hand in all buſineſſes: But by their wiſdom they had brought things to ſuch a paſſe that not onely they did loſe their credit, but they durſt hardly appear in the ſtreets for a time, ſo odious were they become unto the People. The incoming of the <hi>Scots</hi> did put life in them again; for, the People ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were ſo earneſt for the <hi>Scots,</hi> whoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and dexterity was known to all, with their fidelity and honeſty, could not but give occaſion to think better of the Independents then they had done formerly, by reaſon of the miſcarriage of things. But theſe ſweet Birds ingrate to their reſtaurators, and unthankful to the People, fall to their old tricks again, to raiſe up their Faction againſt Church and State.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Scots</hi> by their aſſiſtance gave the Independents
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48716:31"/>
life when they were dead, (as it were,) and raiſed them from the duſt unto conſideration, by their ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able help; ſo the late miſcarriage of buſine;ſſes by ſome then in power, did furniſh unto the Independents ſome means to thruſt in buſineſſes &amp; favour among the People.</p>
               <p>All this while, the Independents are getting themſelves in all Committees and Counſells, namely where money is a handling: So by degrees they get benefit and power into their hands, and then pleaſure ſome whom they do affect, and put nack others whom they do diſlike.</p>
               <p>By this means, divers of all ranks, to get their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires either of benefit or employment, do ſide with them; or to have their turn ſerved for the preſent, do cog in with them for a time.</p>
               <p>As the Independents do diſpoſe all things almoſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their mind in the Southern Forces, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out thoſe they do diſlike, and taking in thoſe whom they think fit for their ends, or, at leaſt, who do not oppoſe them, nor do take any notice of their tricks and deviſes; So, They do ſtudy in the North to keep the <hi>Scots</hi> idle, being not fitted with accommodations for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet earneſt they are to call them Southward, yea to make the weight of the main Service to lie upon them; and then cry out againſt them, <hi>That they do not go on as they were deſired,</hi> and that, to irritate both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and People.</p>
               <p>Then, As the new moulded Army was a ſetling, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good occaſions of doing buſineſſes are let paſſe by the faults of the Independents, whereunto advice was given namely by the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, and by other judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men upon good intelligence, for the eaſie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing of things.</p>
               <p>At laſt, There muſt be a Siege at <hi>Oxford,</hi> at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a way. How that Siege was undertaken according to the rules of wiſdom, the judicious, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48716:32"/>
and indifferent men, both at home and abroad, can tell.</p>
               <p>All this time, the Independents in their wiſdom, are not onely buſie to ſtop the ſetling of the Church in a true and through Reformation, as by the Covenant we are all ſworn to; but they continue and maintain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinde of errours and hereſies, yea, they move to have their pernicious Tenents ſet up by Authority, both at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>Further, They study to make a rent betwixt the two Nations againſt the good of both, yea againſt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>What more? Have they not in their wiſdom raiſed up great factions, both in the City and Countrey, by their cunning devices, under pretence of piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion?</p>
               <p>Yea, which is worſt of all, Are they not buſie to make the Parliament and the City claſh and divide, if it were poſſible, if not, to inſlave the City?</p>
               <p>Firſt, By underhand-dealing, to ſtop the City to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto the Parliament (with due reſpect) their juſt deſires for the long expected ſetling of the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Next, When at another time that the City did ſend the ſecond Petition unto the Parliament for the ſame purpoſe with the former, the Independents made their Favourers ſnuffe at it, and ſtruggle to reject it: But the wiſer part did accept of it, and did promiſe to give due content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did expreſſe himſelf worthily upon the point, and told the Company of the Houſe, Beſides the juſtneſſe of the Cities deſire, the Parliament muſt not neglect nor forget the Cities ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt kindneſſe to it, namely in its greateſt need, and to the Cauſe, witneſſe among other things,</p>
               <p>Their refuſall of aſſiſting the Court againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48716:32"/>Their keeping cloſe to the Parliament, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the workings of the Court-Paraſites, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers made unto it by the Court.</p>
               <p>Their reſcuing the Parliament from violence, when with ſtrong hand ſome Members ſhould have been taken from it.</p>
               <p>Their free and unparallelled plentifull furniſhing both men and moneys, from the beginning of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Wars.</p>
               <p>And their conſtant ſupplying upon all occaſions of both to this preſent, namely in the remarkable needs, as at <hi>Brainford</hi> buſineſſe, and at the buſineſſe of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did ſo bravely relieve that Town (ſo courageouſly kept by gallant <hi>Maſſey,</hi>) and thereafter did beat the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Many ſuch inſtances may any judicious man give of the Independents wiſdom ſo much cried up by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and by their hyrelings, which conſiſts in plotting for their intereſt of ambition and avarice, under the cloke of piety and devotion, without regard to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, or to the good of man; for if they had any reſpect to theſe two, they would not drive on ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt the ſetling of the Church, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the State.</p>
               <p>Now, having ſeen how the Independents have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the Cauſe with their wiſdom, let us ſee what they do with their purſes.</p>
               <p>Are they not noted to be the moſt needy, craving, and ſcraping wretches that are?</p>
               <p>Have any of them heartily and willingly given any thing out of their hands too? When God knows, in lieu of giving any thing of their own, that they are deep ſharers in the moneys they can lay hold on.</p>
               <p>Are they not the nimbleſt to hearken after moneys? And for this end have they thruſt themſelves everywhere
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48716:33"/>
where any benefit is to be had, and where the fingring of money is.</p>
               <p>Have they not received vaſt ſums of moneys, and neither have, nor will, yea perhaps neither can give an account? Witneſſe ſome of them who refuſed to give an account in the uſuall way unto the Committee of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts eſtabliſhed by the Parliament. And thereafter the ſame men, after their refuſall of giving account, have obtained by the favour of the factious Fraternity, a free diſcharge, without giving any account.</p>
               <p>It is conſtantly and generally reported<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they have ſent immenſe ſums of moneys beyond Seas.</p>
               <p>Many ſtirring Blades and ſticklers of their Faction of late had neither credit nor means, yea hardly whole clothes, who now are great men, companions to Lords.</p>
               <p>Yea, It is told of ſome of them, that they ſhould ſay, They hoped to ſee the day wherein they ſhould not ſee this diſtinction of men, and ſo to be Independents as well in the State as in the Church.</p>
               <p>Is there any one of their Fraternity that hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched himſelf ſince theſe troubles have begun, by the foolery and ſimplicity of others, as Rooks and Charla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans in all profeſſions do? And ſo they have increaſed their number.</p>
               <p>If one ſhould take in hand to ſet down in writing all the cunnings, devices, artifices, deceits, and crafts known to many, with which theſe men uſe to catch moneys, and give no account of, it would make a great Volume.</p>
               <p>They have gotten the fingring of the moneys of State by gathering it, and they diſtribute it for the moſt part among themſelves: So they give out, <hi>That all is theirs which paſſeth through their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us ſee their valour:</p>
               <p>It is known they have drawn ſome men of heart and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48716:33"/>
courage among them; But give me leave to ſay, That their own courage doth not ſo much as yet appear unto the World, as other mens valour doth, although they have uſed all the means which they could bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of to be cried up for valour; for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Have they not cauſed their names to be recorded in Pamphlets, and read in Churches? If the meaneſt of their Faction had appeared the leaſt in action, he was highly named as the moſt valiant in the Army.</p>
               <p>Yea, Is it not a ſtrange thing, to ſee that gallant Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> to be ſo little mentioned, although he be Generall, and notwithſtanding that he conſtantly in all actions doth carry himſelf as bravely as any man can do? How gallant his carriage was at the Battel of <hi>Naſeby,</hi> it is well known to all, yet he was little ſpoken of, and the Independents muſt have the glory of the day; but it is an eaſie way of theſe men to raiſe themſelves, and to gain eſteem and credit with ſmall merits of their own, by the help of good Neighbours and Friends.</p>
               <p>In Gods Name, let every one have his due, without taking any from others: But ſuch is the weakneſſe of many infirm men, who think they cannot be well thought or ſpoken of to their mind, unleſſe they keep under and balk other mens juſt praiſe, where there is occaſion enough of praiſe to every one who doth well in the War, as in any other courſe.</p>
               <p>In all this Diſcourſe, I name no perſon but to his praiſe; yet I tell the errours and faults of a Faction, which is as dangerous unto us as that of <hi>Barnevelts</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands</hi>: But we hope that the ſame God who broke that Faction there, will do the ſame here, as he hath done the Prelats Faction here amongſt us; and will ſtop it to go on any further, for the diſhonour
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48716:34"/>
done to his Name, and the miſchief done to his People, by thoſe ambitious, coveteous, and ſelf-conceited men, againſt all Divine and human Law, without ſhame, provided they ſerve their inſatiable and phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall deſires, caring neither for God nor for his People, as appear clearly by the whole tenour of their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
