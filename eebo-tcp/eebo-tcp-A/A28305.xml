         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. ABOUT Three Years ſince, I humbly Propoſed (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things) the New Coining of all our Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Moneys: And gave theſe Reaſons for it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>

                  <p n="2">2. The ſuffering them to Paſs, gave advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Further clipping them: as is manifeſt in our Sad Experience; for, they are now much worſe; And ſo unſerviceable at home.</p>

The inconveniences and damages whereof to the Nation and Trade thereof, are, and will be at leaſt as great, as the clipping of the Silver: And, if not timely Prevented, will utterly Ruine us in Our Trade: And the longer this is Suffer'd, the Firmer will the diſadvantages be Fix'd; till the Root of all our Commerce becomes Worm eaten, and canker'd; and we Loſe the Sweet Fruit thereof for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> III. In ſhort, the whole Nation is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſtitute of Moneys: Not only, For the carrying on the War (in, or by any Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe of procedure) but, For Our home Markets: And, Taken off from trade abroad, As, by means hereof, So, Partly by their Loſſes at Sea; partly, By the More-advantageous Propoſals for Lending or Laying out their Moneys, on the Lotteries, and <hi>Other Ways and Means</hi> found out, and pitch'd upon, by the

Late Parliament, <hi>For carrying on the War:</hi> And laſtly, By the high Exchange of Moneys abroad, for Commodities imported hither; and paying our Forces there, who muſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have had more of our Moneys ſent hence to our further ſtreightening.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98180:4"/>
ſame; ſo, as there ſhould be no Leſſening of the Nation's Stock; and would coſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And, to facilitate this: That All un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary <hi>Silver-</hi>plate (eſpecially in Taverns, Inns, Alehouſes, and Victualling-houſes) might be Prohibited, called in, Coyned and delivered out, immediately, to ſuch as ſhould bring in the ſame, at 5 <hi>s. 3 d. per ounce,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the Coynage.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> V. I Humbly Propoſe: That all Coyned-Gold may be likewiſe called in, by a certain day: And Each piece Punch'd, and deliver'd back again to the owner; thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to paſs but at 20 <hi>s.</hi> each <hi>Guinney, &amp;c.</hi> And that Like Bills of Credit may be alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the parties concern'd, for 10 <hi>s.</hi> more, upon each Guinney<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably for other Pieces of Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus, both Silver and Gold become Reduced to their Coyn'd values, without Prejudice, Loſs, or Damage, either to the Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, or to the Publick Stock of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: No body is injured, but all greatly obliged, in thankfulneſs and loyalty to the King, for Recommending the care thereof; and to the Parliament for their Enacting the ſame. For, thus, Our home-Markets and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures will be ſupplied, and carried on, in future, to General Satisfaction. And, for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98180:4"/>
preventing, as much as may be, this additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Charge upon Guinneys, I humble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, care may be taken, That from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth no Guinneys may be Coyned, till this Work be over; and, afterwards, only ſuch as ſhall be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe already Coyned, by ſome ſpecial mark in the Stamp thereof, to be paſſed at 20 <hi>s.</hi> and no more. Which is, alſo, the Reaſon of Propounding, All Guinneys already coyned may be Punch'd <hi>viz.</hi> That they may not be twice allowed for.</p>

I formerly Propoſed: <hi>1st,</hi> That whatſoever Taxes or Aſſeſſments ſhould be thought fit and neceſſary to be Raiſed or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd, for carrying on the preſent War, and other publick charges of the Nation, whether By or Upon Lands, Tenements or Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Poll-moneys, or Perſonal Eſtates, might be paid by the Parties ſo Aſſeſſed, Quarterly (as had been done before) in ready Moneys, or Silver-plate at 5 <hi>s. 3 d. per ounce.</hi> This, I argued to be neceſſary, upon ſeveral accounts, (1) To aſſiſt and facilitate the Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age propoſed. And (2) for Pay of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abroad; tho' poſſibly not needful to be all ſent over in ſpecie, but, partly Remitted by Bills of Exchange charged by Merchants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and partly ſupplied by the Products, Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures and Proviſions that may be ſent from

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> VII. <hi>2dly,</hi> I alſo Propoſed, That every perſon ſo Aſſeſled, who ſhould voluntarily advance and pay in One full years tax, at One Entire payment, To the Pariſh or County-Collector, or Receiver, within One month after demand made of the firſt quarterly payment; might, in lieu thereof, Have Like Bill or Bills of Credit deliver'd him, for the Re-imburſement of his ſaid full Sum paid: And ſo, Be out Nothing.

               <p>If any Object,</p>

It cannot be deny'd, but that, If we were twenty times as Rich, in that which will effectually carry on Trade and Manufactures, pay Debts, purchaſe Lands, and manage our Markets, amongſt our ſelves, as now we are, or Ever were, We ſhall be able thereby to multiply and Export Our Manufactures proportionably; and carry on our Fiſhing-trade (the Richeſt Golden Mine in the Experience of our Neighbors; ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them, for that it infallibly brings them Gold in) to far greater value (from the Greateſt Maſters of it) than our neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Imports of Commodities from other Countries need to be, for Our home Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: And what's Imported more, may be Eaſily ſhip'd off to other Countries; as is aforementioned.

Tho ſome things might be offer'd (which poſſibly might ſilence ſome Objectors) yet the Debt (ſhould the War continue) would be ſo Vaſt, as, Nothing Leſs than the whole Nation can be Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: And, That can no otherwiſe be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, than by an Act of Parliament. It cannot be Rationally Expected, they ſhould Expoſe Particular Eſtates of this, or that, or another Sort of Men, to become liable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of Others: And it's manifeſt, if the People were ever ſo willing, they cannot pay down ſo much Money, yet the War muſt and may be carried on by Bills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

from any Parliament to paſs a Law to make them voyd, (without firſt paying them off) as, to paſs an Act, for taking away all their Lands, (which, their Juſtice, as well as Intereſt will not ſuffer them to do) For every Parliament-Man, and Perſon in the Nation, will have a conſiderable part of their Perſonal Eſtates lye principally in theſe Bills.

               <p>The One is, in <hi>New England;</hi> where the Government, conceiving they had power by their Charter from the King, to Coyn Moneys; Coyned Shillings of about the Value of <hi>Nine Pence</hi> Sterling, and Stamp'd the ſame <hi>Twelve Pence:</hi> They alſo Raiſed the Value of <hi>Spaniſh Pieces of Eight,</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Seventeen Penny</hi> Weight, from <hi>Four Shillings Six Pence</hi> to <hi>Six Shillings,</hi> (which held proportion with their Shillings) This They did, upon this Vulgar Error, and miſapprehenſion, That, by this Inhanſing the Price of Silver, They ſhould, both keep their own Coyn, and, bring in and retain other Imported Moneys, amongſt them. But, This (inſtead of Anſwering their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation) Raiſed the Value of all Goods, to, at leaſt 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> And likewiſe all their Exchanges, whether to, or from <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> or other Parts, proportionably: Or, ſo much more of their Moneys were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98180:13"/>
forth in theſe <hi>Species</hi> (tho' they were ſufficiently ſevere againſt its Exportation) to their Diſappointment.</p>
               <p>The other Inſtance (and more notable) is in <hi>Penſylvania;</hi> where, tho' they Coyned no <hi>Moneys,</hi> yet, ſuffering <hi>Spaniſh</hi> pieces of Eight, of not above 11 or 12 penny-weight, (and conſequently not above 3 Shillings in value Sterling) to paſs current at 6 Shillings: And, tho' the Exchange did not Riſe propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably (For, They had Little or very Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom occaſion to Return any in Trade); yet this other Conſequence attended their ſo doing, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch as brought thither any Goods or Merchandizes, needful for that Plantation, from <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> when any came to contract with them for their Goods, they treated them after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> (Says the Importer) <hi>The Cargo coſt me 100 l. in Engliſh Ready-Money, at about 5 s.</hi> per ounce <hi>Sterl. whereas Your Money is not half the value: So, I muſt have 200 l. of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or, I ſhall be a</hi> Loſer <hi>of my Firſt Cost: And I cannot take leſs than 50 l. Sterling</hi> per Cent. <hi>for my Freight, Riſque, and Profit, which will be 100 l. more of your Money:</hi> And accordingly Receives of the Retailer there 300 <hi>l.</hi> who, generally raiſes the price of the ſame Goods to another 100 <hi>l.</hi> whereby, the price of the ſame Goods which coſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> Engliſh-money, coſts the people there, Four hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>The Effect whereof was, The Generality of the People (except their Shop-keepers, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, Handycrafts-men, Carpenters, Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, Labourers, and Servants) grew poorer. And, particularly, it had this influence upon the Landed men (whether Proprietors or Farmers) <hi>viz.</hi> that they are forced to give great wages to all theſe Sorts of poor people, eſpecially to Ploughmen, Carters, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> From 12 <hi>l. per annum</hi> wages to 27 <hi>l.</hi> (beſides Victuals, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> And, at this Charge, they get a little Corn; which, if they ſpend not all in their own Families, they bring (what's left) to the Market, and ſell that there, at 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> the Buſhel of Wheat, which, in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Money, is but 15 <hi>d. per</hi> buſhel.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98180:14"/>
enſues their enhaunſing the value of their Moneys, amongſt themſelves: For, ſay their Servants, <hi>&amp;c. We muſt have ſuch Wages, or we cannot live: We can Buy nothing we have occaſion for, but at four times the Rate of what's paid in</hi> England. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Whilſt we Plead (tho' under the moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences having Regard barely to the Theory and Notions of things taken up thence, or from vulgar miſapprehenſions) for the enhauncing of our Silver or Gold, to above the Par, Intrinſick value and ancient Mete-yard of Traffick, between us and other Nations, We are, in truth and reality, ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the ſame Needle, or Common Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of <hi>Penſylvania;</hi> and diſcern it not. Which will (in time) be like Ruinous to Us.</p>
               <p>Nor is it any Anſwer to our Aſſertion, to tell us, Our Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> need Nothing that comes from beyond Sea; (which may be as truly predicated of Our ſelves too, could we be contented (with Sobriety) to uſe our own Products and Manufactures): For, what does that avail? Such do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or conſider, that the prices (even of our Home-Commodities and Manufactures that are neceſſary, (as well as Foreign, that are leſs neceſſary) are Raiſed alike upon us all, ſince Our Coyn hath been at this paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98180:14"/>
Nor do ſuch give us any Eſtimate of the Height to which Servants, as well as their Maſters, are grown, (ſince the laſt Act of State for enhauncing the value of Silver and Gold) in their Expectations, and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Which yet can no more be Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than the Nation Converted from their Atheiſtical Prophaneſs, and Impieties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till their Superiors and Maſters ſet them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Copies to write by.</p>
               <p>There is, then, A Neceſſity of putting a Stop to the enhaunſing of our Moneys: And, if any Eaſier, Safer, More Probable or Advantageous means, ways, or methods of doing it to general Satisfaction, than theſe afore mention'd, and humbly propos'd, be offer'd; I ſhall readily Receive my diſmiſs from this Controverſie, having offer'd my Poor Mite. But,</p>
               <p>There Remains yet One Stumbling-block, in the Minds of ſome; who do not duly weigh and conſider, That there's no Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction attainable under the Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis this, <hi>viz. The Danger of Counterfeit Bills.</hi> Touching which, I ſhall offer ſome Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Humbly Propoſed,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſaid Bills of Credit ſhould be printed or impreſſed on Paper, from engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98180:15"/>
Copper-plates; and gave Reaſons for it. Which, together with a Specimen of ſuch Bills, being Uncounterfeitable, I ſhall readily Evince when required.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ſaid Paper ſhould be of a Different Make and Mark from any yet Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Indented Counter-parts of Each Bill, ſhould be Filed up, and kept in a Publick Office or Offices, to be erected for that purpoſe; in order to the diſcovery and preventing of Damage thereby, to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Printing or Publiſhing ſuch Bills, to any greater Number, Value, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion than ſhall be allowed and appointed by Act of Parliament, (tho' by the perſons that ſhall be thereunto authoriz'd) might be made as penal as Coyning or Counterfeiting the Current Moneys of the Kingdom. Or, That the ſame: And, particularly,</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the engraving all ſuch plates, and <hi>making, having,</hi> or <hi>keeping</hi> undiſcover'd any ſuch paper, ſo made and mark'd, as from time to time ſhall be made uſe of upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Or bringing the like into this Kingdom from beyond the Seas, by any other perſon than by Order of ſuch as ſhall be by ſuch Act of Parliament appointed and authoriz'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98180:15"/>
thereunto, might be puniſh'd with great Severity, both Corporal and pecuniary <hi>(in terrorem) viz.</hi> (Being Convicted thereof) may be Branded in the Right Hand and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or Cheek: So, as to be known thereby ever after; and thenceforth kept ſtrictly to the moſt Severe, Servile, Conſtant, Hard Work and Labour: Enjoyned a daily Task; and on failure of doing it, have Correction at the Keeper's or Workmaſter's diſcretion: Never to be pardoned, remitted, or mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but upon the diſcovery and producing of other his Partners, Accomplices, Aſſociates or other Offenders in like nature, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame. Which, undoubtedly, if pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, will deterr and keep all men, who have the leaſt Spark of Ingenuity or Humanity from attempting to Counterfeit theſe Bills, if any thing will. And,</p>
               <p n="6">6. That tho' it is impoſſible in nature theſe Bills ſhould be ſo Counterfeited, as to Deceive the Office; Or, That in 20 millions of them, printed off from the ſame Copper-plates, any two ſhould agree, [as hath been acknowledged by ſeveral Engravers and other Counterfeiters of Writings critically skil'd in ſuch Affairs, and call'd together for Advice in the like Caſe] yet, That perſons abroad may not, in all caſes, be ſo critical as to diſcern true Bills from falſe, through the Niceities of them. It may be therefore Queried, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98180:16"/>
                  <hi>Is there Any Courſe to be preſcribed by way of Remedy for avoiding Falſe Bills?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where the diſtance is not great, perſons may Repair to the Office, where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terparts of all True Bills Remain; and, have them examined, as <hi>Exchequer-Tales</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Counterparts: And, if Remote, They may be ſent up <hi>per</hi> Poſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, The perſon who offers them, may be put upon the proof of them; or, if ſuſpected, give Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And being made to continue but for a Year, from the reſpective Dates of them, (as is propos'd) They will then be certainly Detected, and the Values of them known.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe that there ſhould be ſome <hi>Bills</hi> Counterfeited, which may be thought fit to be Repaired (to the perſon deceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by) By the <hi>Publick:</hi> It would (in the whole) be far Leſs (being thus Annually detected) than the Twentyeth part of the Intereſt-Money, hitherto allowed for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys borrowed upon the Funds ſettled, and Layd upon the Nation according to Mr. <hi>Briſco</hi>'s Computations, in his Printed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.) Beſides, the Repaying of them might be by other Bills, which would coſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98180:16"/>
3. The Riſque of ſuch is No greater than of Gold and Silver Coyn, of which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been, and dayly is, and will be deceived: Nor than That of all Merchants Bills of Exchange, and Letters of Advice from Foreign Parts: All which may be more eaſily Counterfeited. Beſides,</p>
               <p n="4">4. There's no Sorts of Deeds, Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Lands, or Bonds given for Moneys, But, they, alſo, are more Lyable to be Counterfeited, both as to the Hands and Seals of the Granters, Obligors, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: All which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be ſo Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, as, the Parties themſelves will not be able to deny them to be theirs. Yea, even Exchequer-Tales, are lyable to be Counterfeited, ſo as Perſons may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, till they come to the Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet, By theſe more uncertain Methods of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Dealings, and Dangers, We are not affrighted, or taken off from our Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and Buſineſſes, as Men.</p>
               <p>Why then, in this Caſe only, and upon this Urgent Occaſion? Wherein, if now we become ſo ſingularly Wiſe or Cautious, as to ſtumble at the Threſhold, we endanger Our Selves, and theſe Nations and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to All Our unavoydable Ruine, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than run the Hazard of (probably) ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98180:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſmall inconſiderable Sum <hi>per Annum,</hi> which will certainly come to be diſcover'd, at each Years end, at fartheſt, and Cancell'd? This were to be Penny-wiſe, but Pound-fooliſh, according to Our Engliſh Proverb.</p>
