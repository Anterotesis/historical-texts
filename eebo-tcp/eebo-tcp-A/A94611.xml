            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>Humbly ſheweth:</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat your Petitioners who have in all your dangers been found ready to ingage
their lives and fortunes for your ſecurities in the defence of Religion, and juſt
Liberty, as by our Nationall Covenant by us ſolemnly taken we are obliged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We
who have been by Gods acceptance made more then ordinarily Inſtrumentall in
all the ſuppreſſing of the Common Enemy; We who have laboured to preſerve
our ſelves, not thereby ſo much ſeeking our private comforts, as that we might be continued
a people able to do You ſervice in all Your pious and faithfull undertakings; have now a great
and unſupportable Army quartered upon us, which for the Reaſons hereafter mentioned we
deſire may be removed, and otherwiſe diſpoſed of. And in the firſt place we humbly offer to
Your conſiderations, how unconvenient a thing it will be, for ſo great an Army to lay out their
Quarters ſo neer a Parliament, where all things are wanting, and dear; as makes us fear there
is ſome deſigne to have an awing influence upon the proceedings of Parliament, and thoſe who
are willing to ſubmit to Your Government: And we the rather fear it, becauſe the Army is
now brought into theſe parts, when all the Kingdom takes notice that You are about the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
of it, and ſetling the Government of the Church; both which, we humbly conceive,
are moſt neceſſary to be diſpatched. And we have reaſon to beleeve, that ſome in that Army
will not be promoters of thoſe good and neceſſary Works, being men of Erroneous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and oppoſite to the Government of the Parliament; who make it their buſineſſe in all
places where they come, to work upon the ignoranteſt people, perſwading them into the like
Errours, which tends much to the deſtruction of all good Government, either in Church or
Common-wealth. In the next place, they humbly deſire this Honorable Aſſembly, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their firſt free will offerings upon the Propoſitions, with what chearfulneſſe, and in what
multitudes they put themſelves forth to make up the firſt Army, which was raiſed for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Parliament. After that, raiſed two private Armies, at their own Charge, for the
publique Service of the Kingdom; The one, under the Command of the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark;</hi>
and the other under the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> whom they payed ſeverall yeers: and all that
time did not onely defend themſelves at home, but upon every Alarum went forth into other
Counties with their Trained Bands, and other Auxiliary Forces. And now God hath bleſt us
out of the hands of our Enemies, our hope is, we ſhall not be eaten up, enſlaved, and deſtroyed
by an Army raiſed for our defence. In the laſt place, we humbly offer to Your Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the ſad and dying condition of <hi>Ireland,</hi> That this Army, or ſuch part thereof as ſhall be
thought neceſſary, might be imployed for the Recovery of that Kingdom, wherein the ſafetie
of this, is ſo much concerned.</p>
