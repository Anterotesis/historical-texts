            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Theſe armed with Launces, demy Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Azagies, and many Larbies that came in to him, by the way as he came ſome hee forced, ſome voluntary. And at the day of battaile his people beganne to bee diſmaied, perceiuing <hi>Mulley Sidan,</hi> was very ſtrong. But hee encouraged them, ſaying, as they had found that come to paſſe which formerly hee told them, ſo now they ſhould ſee the like and bid them not feare his ordnance, for onely three peeces ſhould goe off, and doe no harme: the reſt ſhould take fire, but not ſhoote a bullet, and hee would bee formoſt, and goe in the face of the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and finding his wordes true, then at his commaund to fall vppon his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>

            <p>Whereupon he hauing ſome of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mulley Shecks</hi> children with him, (to make friendſhip with his brother) ſent him his children and wrote to him very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Whereby hee was forced to fraight a ſhip of Marſelle is heere in port, with a French Ambaſſador, who came to him vpon buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe out of France, and a Fleming that was in the roade: and tooke his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and luggage, ſome Women and Children, ſome <hi>Alcaids</hi> and Seruants, and <hi>Benwaſh</hi> and his followers, and went for Santa Cruz and there Landed in Sus: and from thence to Tarradance and there ſince remained, what force he hath or of his

            <p>Some fewe dayes after his departure, came our new King into theſe parts, halfe a dayes iourney from Saphia, and all the Larbies came into him &amp; ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and he receiueth al in to fauor, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning what paſſed: For, hee ſayth, hee comes to make peace, and is ſent from God, becauſe of thee euill gouernment of <hi>Mulley Hammets</hi> ſonnes the Xeriffes; and<note place="margin">Kinred of Mahomet which they challenge.</note> to ſtabliſh their Prophets religion, that was decaied, and to fight againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and recouer thoſe parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the king of Spaine holds from them: as Granada, Andaluzia, &amp;c. and tels his people they ſhall yet ſee greater wonders come to paſſe, where they ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he is ſent of God; he promiſeth them Spaine, Italy, and France: and hauing put peace in theſe countries, there muſt now appeare a bridge in the mouth of the ſtraights, which hath been in former time, (and ſo recorded in their writings) &amp; ſunk in the ſea. Now in his time it muſt appeare to carrie ouer the Moores: and hauing gayned theſe countries, he muſt raigne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres, and then muſt com Chriſt, whom they call <hi>Sidie Nicer:</hi> and he muſt ſurren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>But for England, Flanders, or other parts they haue not to doe, they will haue friendſhip with vs, and deſire trade and traffique with vs in loue and friendſhip, and would haue his myracles and acts made knowne abroade the world: I was in his Almahalla at firſt fowre dayes, and ſpake<note place="margin">Or Camp.</note> with him, and ſaw his behauiour; and found him very humble and courteous, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good ſpeeches; and pittying the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries all the Chriſtians haue by the ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his Predeceſſors, or Vſurpers as he counted them.

And for his gouernment at Morocus placed his Hackam to ſee euery one haue peace, and a very honeſt man for iuſtice: So Morocus is in peace and quietnes; and amongſt the Larbies he demands his due, either corne, horſe, cattell, or money; and tels them he coms to put peace amongſt them; neither to rob the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor yet to loſe his right; not to giue them pay, but force them to ſerue him, as need requireth, if they yeelded not to ſuch conditions, his ſword ſhould force them: he came amongſt them as a gueſt, and was to be entertained by them, and not to giue them to gaine their fauour. By which ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, myracles paſt, and policy, hee hath made them all tremble; ſo he puts all to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Som co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent themſelues, of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in former time, to heare and ſee, ſhew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and ſay nothing: others change with the time, and haue great imploiments, and profeſſe loialty to him, and renounce their old Maſter; what the euent may be I know not: for, we haue learned, <hi>the hearts of Kings are in the hands of the Lord, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them: as riuers of waters which way hee pleaſeth.</hi>

euery howre to heare ſome good newes that he may preuaile; but here it is greatly feared, becauſe many of his owne people be depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him: and thoſe Larbies he caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him out of theſe parts, run away and returned, ſo if he loſe, the other bee the friends of <hi>Mulley Sidan,</hi> and he is expected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: But the beginning and riſing of this king and his procedings are very ſtrange. He is a great ſaint and learned in the lawe, and was ſought vnto by many the principalleſt of the land for his bleſſings, and fauour, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſuperſtition; he findes it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient books writ of him by way of prophecy, that ſuch a man of that place named <hi>Meſſae</hi> (whence he is) by name <hi>Mulley Om Hamet ben Abdela,</hi> ſhould bee ſent at this time, to put peace in the country, and to reuiue their law, and put out the race of <hi>Mulley Sidan,</hi> and name of Xeriffes: and ſo to raigne forty yeers till Chriſt come to iudgement: his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt be, hee muſt ſtrike vp a drum hee ſhould finde in that Zowie at Miſſa, and then<note place="margin">Or Saints houſe.</note> ſhould repaire vnto him people, to make him king. The manner of his proceedings, and what encounters hee ſhould haue, and what he found written, all the Talbies and learned men now do confeſſe to find the ſame writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their bookes. At his beginning he put forth only <hi>one tent</hi> and <hi>a kitchen:</hi> ſo reſorted
<pb facs="tcp:19460:9"/>
to him the Shrokies, a ſaintiſh people in their lawe, but otherwiſe in behauiour very Sauages. Theſe without pay came to him, to the number of 150. or 200. at moſt; and with their helpe hee brake Alhadge Lemiere, and his forces, ſeruants of <hi>Mulley Sidan,</hi> beeing 5000. ſtrong; ſo more of the ſayd Shrokies came to him, to the number of 5000. &amp; with them and ſuch people as ioined with him in the way, he ouerthrew <hi>Mulley Sidans</hi> forces thriſe before the battell.</p>
            <p>And ſo came to ſome ſtrong places in the Mountaines, neuer brought to ſubiection in the time of <hi>Mulley Sidan,</hi> nor his father: Thoſe with-ſtood him, but hee ouercame them and made them pay him what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, ſerue and obey him; ſo forced the principalleſt Shecks in the countrie to come to him. After this marched towards Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, and by the way was to paſs a riuer; and the daie before he warned his people, in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch a riuer no man to take vp water in their hands to drinke, if he did he would die. After comming to the riuer weary and hot, many not remembred, or not regarded his words, but tooke vp water in their hands, drunk, and anon after dyed, the reſt all eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, which ſtrooke a feare into them to breake his command, and a perſwaſion that hee is more then a man: For they ſay hee
<pb facs="tcp:19460:9"/>
is their Fatamie, that is, a Sauiour. Next in comming to Morocus, diuers great Saints and Sheckes reſorted together, and would goe to viſit him, that they might ſee what hee was, and vnderſtand whether that which paſſed was true or not. So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, after ſalutations, hee told them they came to enquire and ſee what newes, and what wonders hee did, and ſo meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, beeing men of account and Talbies hee would ſatisfie them, that they might ſatisfie others. So appointed them a time to come againe, and to bring ſuch bookes, hee nominated, with them; ſo they did: Then he vvilled them to turne to ſuch places, and reade what they found written of him; ſo they did. To wit, both his name, his beginning, and courſe he was to take, and withall found written ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſpeciall markes, or ſignes, hee muſt haue vppon his bodie, a wart aboue his right eye, a blacke tooth before, a bunch of hayre growing betweene his ſhoulders, a ſigne of a ring in the palme of his right hand, the ſigne of a ſpurre vpon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of his right legge; the reſt I remember not.</p>
            <p>But theſe and the reſt hee ſhewed them which ſeeing they did honor him and ſwore
<pb facs="tcp:19460:10"/>
to him to ſerue him, and to liue and die with him, or in his cauſe.</p>
            <p>Next comming to a place named Dets in the mountains very ſtrong, where much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were gathered together againſt him ſo that ſome of his owne people began to faint and be afraied: hee bad them feere nothing for that before to morrow they ſhould ſee there was more with him then againſt him: ſo that night, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to take vp his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahalla &amp; march towards that place Dets: ſo they did, and all night long to the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of al his people, there marched another Almahalla greater then theirs, and went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: and comming to the place Dets vanniſhed away, and at ſight of it his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fled, leaſt the place and goods al to the ſpoile, ſo comming thither had the ſpoile of all without fighting. This our country man M. W. affermeth with diuers others vpon ſolemne oth to haue ſeene. At his being in theſe parts, my ſelfe with others went to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him: he entertained vs very kindly, &amp; told vs he would ſhew the Engliſh what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour he could, and permit them free trade, willing vs to take knowledge that he was ſent by Gods appointment to releeue the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as wel Moores and ſtrangers, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and al ſorts, and what we had ſeene and heard to aduertiſe, ſaying wee ſhould ſee yet
<pb facs="tcp:19460:10"/>
more ſtrange matters come to paſſe, then what had paſſed. His meaning as we gather is, the conquering of Spaine, France and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; with which oppinion hee poſſeſſeth the fooliſh and credulous Moores. Now hauing bin tedious to trouble you with ſuch news as the time affoords (not al but part as it comes into my memory) I pray you take it in good part: the cenſure hereof I leaue to your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and confideration. For my owne part I am perſwaded, they bee deluſions of the diuell done by witch-craft, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord, to ſeduce them to further error, God deliuer vs Chriſtians well from among them, and grant vs the vſe, and true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his holy word preached in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an countries which heere wee want, and the vſe and comfort of his holy Sacraments to the ſealing vp of our faith in Chriſt Ieſus <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>GOod Sir pardon me in that at my going away, I came not to take my leaue of you: the ſhip went downe two daies ſooner than I made account off. But for all your courteſies alwaies towards mee, I heartily thanke you and remaine your debter &amp;c. For the ſtate of this country, and of the wars of this new King, I know Maſter S. hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged you more than I can a great deale. But for all this, and the troubles <hi>Mulley Sidan</hi> hath had, it is thought he will be king again, and that in ſhort time: ſtaying but for a new Moone to giue battaile. This Saint or king told his Shrokies which came with him at firſt, his comming was to take Mazagant, Sute and Tanger, not to fight againſt the Moores vnleſſe they would reſiſt, and not let him take the Chriſtian townes. Hee ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that <hi>Mulley Sidan</hi> and his followers were Chriſtians, one who robbed all men without reaſon, killed and ſlue many men vpon no occaſions, but in his angry minde. And withall ſaid hee dranke wine, and eate oppium, therefore ſaid it could not bee but
<pb facs="tcp:19460:11"/>
that hee was an <hi>Vnſrony,</hi> which amongſt them they hold to bee an vniuſt, or vngodly man as they ſay wee Chriſtians are. His Shrokies two thouſand fiue hundreth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all footmen, with no peeces, but halfe Launces: that was their weapons, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed men. Neuer in their liues they weare ſhert, or cloth to their backes, but an Alheik. Which Shrokies haue left this king; and are all gonne for their country. This kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are of Larbies, which are horſemen: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day they flee from him more and more. As <hi>Alkaid Syde,</hi> whom you knew <hi>Alkaid</hi> of this place, is come from him with ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth horſe. So that very ſhortly <hi>Mulley Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> is expected to come heare againe. And thus with my commendations to your good ſelfe, and all our good friends I commit you to the Almighty.</p>
