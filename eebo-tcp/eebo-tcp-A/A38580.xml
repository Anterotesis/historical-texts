            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> 
               <hi>as when a Lion roareth, and seven thunders uttered their voices,</hi> &amp;c. That is, when there was a powerful appearance of the Mystery of Christ; when the Mystery of God (which before was sealed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. but afterwards to be finished and fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested) began to be opened, and that so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> even to the terror of the Christian world, and of the Churches also (for the seven thunders respect the seven Churches; that's all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches under Antichristian Apostacy) I say, when the little Book began to be open, <hi>John</hi> began to write, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that's our weakness; <note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> when any light breaks forth in us, any new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Truth</hi> be made out to us by the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God in us, we begin presently to be Teachers of men, to write, to publish it in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit and Print, or in our private Teachings. This
<pb facs="tcp:43228:3"/>
was <hi>Johns</hi> weakness also; who was therefore commanded to seal those sayings, and write them <note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> not, till he had eaten the Book, and better digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that heavenly secret, The Mystery of God, <note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> and of Christ; afterward, he was to Preach it, and Prophesie to Nations, Tongues, People, and Kings. <note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is another Mystery in the next Chapter, <note place="margin">Reve. 11.</note> where that prophesying begins. Those two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses who prophesie in sackcloth, signifie a few Saints, who yet make a full witness, <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> witnessing Christ in Spirit, and against the spirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ: These are the two Olive trees as having <note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> their teachings immediately from God, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 11, 12. And these are the two Candlesticks, the true Church in Spirit; for the seven Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks were faln, and removed out of their place through the Apostacy; but these two witnesses have the <hi>Testimony of Jesus, which is the Spirit of prophecy, Revel.</hi> 19. 10. Which Spirit is that fire <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> going out of their mouth, devouring their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, and that spirit of Antichrist, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in several forms, the Dragon, the first beast, second beast, <hi>Babylon,</hi> the great whore, all is but the various appearances of that one spirit of Antichrist in the Christian Church, for there Antichrists seat ever was, and is, set up this day, though in a more glorious form, which is but the flesh of the whore, whose flesh is now fairer, and her forms, her array more fine in scarlet, <hi>&amp;c. Revel.</hi> 16. 4. Yet these two witnesses in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth (who were also in former ages) these few poor persecuted Saints still stand up, burning her
<pb facs="tcp:43228:3"/>
flesh with fire, and by their prophesying, though in silence, plague men by shutting Heaven, that the rain (or waters from above) the Teachings <note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> of God, fall not on their fellowships, and turning their waters into blood, their formal worships, and teachings of men from below, into the blood of a dead man, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 3, 4. And all this those two witnesses do, as oft as they will, which needs must be none else, but Christ in them, God in their flesh, coming forth in power and Spirit from them, plaguing and tormenting them which dwell on earth, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> earthly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Churches also. For this, the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses suffer (their sufferings being shadowed forth by that sackcloth, and bitterness of the Book in their belly) yet all this is but the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their flesh, and filth of it (as 'twere in the belly) but yet they suffer with Christ, and Christ suffers in them; for they are slain where <note place="margin">Verse 8.</note> our Lord was crucified, thats (spiritually) fleshly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Christian carnal Churches, where spiritual Saints, and Christ in Spirit is still slain and crucified: but after three dayes and a half, <note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> (that's a little longer then Christ in flesh lay bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried) the spirit of life enters into those dead and unburied witnesses, who rise with Christ, and Christ riseth in them; yea, they ascend in glory, a greater glory (at least in the Letter) then Christ <note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> ascended; for none but Disciples and friends, were witnesses of his Resurrection, and saw him ascend; but the ascension of the Saints, their <note place="margin">Acts 10. 43.</note> very enemies shall behold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43228:4"/>
The sum of all is this, That which this man writes, he writes not as a clear Truth to publish to the world, not to put off his Earth, that heap of Heresie and Blasphemy cast upon him by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to bury his name and make it rot; nay, he is content to lie unburied yet, to the loathing of his person; that the people who dwell on earth, may look on, rejoyce, and glory over his dead C<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <head>The Relation of a publike Discourse and Dispute at OXFORD, <hi>January</hi> 11. between Mr. <hi>Cheynel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Erbery,</hi> who spake thus:</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian friends and fellow Souldiers, and worthy Schollars also; I am your servant: I am called this day to come here in publike, from my private walkings; not by my desire or seeking, but as sought out and drawn forth by a twofold cord, a publike charge; and a private chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge: The charge was publikely given out in a Pulpit, of Heresie and Blasphemy against me; the challenge was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately sent unto me, by word, and writing also, in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Master <hi>Cheynel,</hi> that I should give him a meeting in the Schools, or some meeting place in the University; the place appointed is <hi>Maries</hi> Church, where I now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent my self to wait on you all, and to answer what shall be objected, or to desire a satisfactory Answer to this my Quere I am questioned for.</p>
            <p>That which I have in private, I also profess in publike; whatever I spake was not spoken as a Minister by outward call, though twice I was made one; nor as a guifted man, knowing Christ, though once I was accounted some body by others, and by my self also: but now I am nothing; know nothing; and let all men know so of me: that I can neither see nor speak (as Ministers, or gifted men should) with any clearness in my self, or conviction to others;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43228:5"/>
but inquiring onely, and seeking the Lord our God, and <hi>David</hi> our King. This is that condition the Church shall be brought unto, into a Wilderness, where no path nor company shall be to walk with; but being left alone, the Saints shall be all set in a seeking way, as the Prophets have foretold, That about <hi>Babylons</hi> destructions, and their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <note place="margin">
                  <p>Jere. 50. 2, 4.</p> 
                  <p>Vers. 5.</p>
               </note> from thence, <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> those who were a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Kingdom in Church-fellowships, shall come together in one, <hi>to seek the Lord their God, and the way to Zion;</hi> that i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, not the way to Church, as the Churches this day are divided about, by a confused preposterous way; seeking that first which should be last, (as if they had found the knowledge of the Lord God already) but first <hi>seek the Lord their God,</hi> and then <hi>the way to Zion;</hi> that is, to know God dwelling in us, and our selves the habitation of God; for this is <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Prophet points at a time, that all the Saints shall be left for many dayes <hi>without a King, and without a Prince, and without a Sacrifice, and without an Image, and without</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hosea 3 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>an Ephod, and without a Teraphim:</hi> that is, without all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Worship or Ministery, true or false; false they will not, and true they cannot have, <hi>[not a King, or Prince]</hi> that is not meant of crowned men or Civil Magistrates, but as I conceive, an Ecclesiastike, or Church Ruler, Officer, or Minister of Christ, to go before them; nor yet a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Ephod, or any Church Ordinance among them, no not the least means of knowledge or enquiry left; for an Ephod was the least Ordinance under the Law (as all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances under the Gospel, are legal also:) by an Ephod men that were not Ministers or Priests might enquire of the <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 9.</note> Lord in doubtful cases, or in a distress as <hi>David</hi> did, and as men do now a dayes seek by fasting and prayer; but this <note place="margin">Zach. 8. 19.</note> also at last shall be taken from the Saints, and they shall fit still in submission and silence, waiting for the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to come and reveal himself to them; <hi>then they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hos. 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and seek the Lord their God, and</hi> David <hi>their King, and fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter dayes:</hi> that is,

every Saint is yet running about, changing their wayes, and gadding abroad after one of these three, Men, Means, and <note place="margin">Jere. 2. 36.</note> Self. But the Saints after they are wearied out with their whoredoms, shall return to their first husband, to <note place="margin">Hosea 2. 6, 7.</note> God their Maker; of whom they first proceeded and came forth, and shall see God in their flesh; that is, <hi>David</hi> their King. This I have been seeking, and by seeking I finde in the Scriptures, these seven things taught by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>First, That Christ is a mystery, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the mystery is Christ in us the hope of glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the riches of the glory of this mystery was kept secret, since the world began, hid from ages and generations, and not made known to the sons of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That this mystery of Christ in us the hope of glory, was manifested by revelation to the Apostles, and Prophets, and primitive Saints by the Spirit, <hi>Ephes</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 26.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That what was manifested to them of the mystery of Christ, was onely made known in part then to the Saints, yea, to the Apostles themselves; who as they <note place="margin">

In <hi>Abel,</hi> the first beleeving Saint, Christ was slain; and as <hi>Paul</hi> said of himself, <hi>I fill up what is behinde of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh:</hi> So the Saints who were also from the beginning, suffered what was before of the afflictions of Christ in their flesh. Thus Christ hath been the onely man of sorrows, and is still suffering, till he shall rise in us. This neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> had attained to, to know Christ risen in them: <hi>Paul</hi> knew in part Christ, <hi>and him crucified,</hi> and desired to know also more fully the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of his sufferings (yet he knew not this so as those, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12 11. <hi>Who overcame by the blood of the Lamb,</hi> who saw their sufferings to be the sufferings onely of the Son.) But as for Christ risen in him, <hi>the resurrection of the dead, Paul</hi> knew not, nor was yet perfect, knowing not himself and the Son, one perfect man: Neither did <hi>Peter</hi> (though he suffered for Christ, and Christ in him) see the day of Christ, or Christ as the day star risen in his heart; no, this was not to be revealed till the last times: When Christ should be so conceived and brought forth of a woman (the weakest Saint) that the weakest Saint should see, not onely Christ in them the hope of glory, Christ formed in them, brought forth in them, living in them, dying in them; but Christ rising in them, and revealing himself so gloriously, as if he should say, <hi>I am the root, and the off-spring of David,</hi>

This is plainly foretold in the old Prophets, and in that last Prophet of the New Testament, who speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things to come in the apostacy and dayes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, saith, <hi>That he saw a book written within, and on the backside sealed with seven seals; and no man in heaven or earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book, nor to look thereon, Revel.</hi> 5. 1, 3. This Book is the mystery of Christ, the Word of God, and the Book of God, in whom both the will and good Will of God, are written, and by whom all the counsels, decrees, and deep things of God are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; the mysteries of heaven, and all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, are hid in him, yet manifested, as I said, to the Apostles and Prophets, and primitive Saints: But the Book was since sealed, and that with seven seals; that is, perfectly sealed, and sealed from the seven Churches; that is, from all the Churches comprised under the number of seven (for the seven seals hath reference to those seven Churches) now no Church; yea, no man in heaven or earth,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43228:7"/>
or under the earth, none in Church-fellowship, or not in fellowship; no man of never so high apprehension, or deep discoveries of spiritual things could open or read the Book, or look thereon, that's more; not look thereon, that is since the apostacy; no man hath had scarce an outward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not a knowledge of the mystery of Christ in the Letter, much less in the Spirit; not seen what was written without, much less within. This the old Prophets spake by the Spirit also, <hi>Isai.</hi> 8 16, 17 <hi>Binde up the Testimony, seal the Law among my Disciples:</hi> The Testimony is the Book, the Word in the Letter, the Law is the Spirit, the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ; the mystery of Christ both in the Letter and Spirit of life, were bound and sealed, and that from the Disciples of Christ; and therefore as <hi>John</hi> wept, so <hi>Isaiah waits for him who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and looks for him;</hi> that is, for Christ, in whose face the glory of God shines, that was hid from the whole Church, the house of <hi>Jacob.</hi> So <hi>Isaiah</hi> 29. 10, 11. <hi>The vision of all is become as a Book that is sealed, that neither learned, nor unlearned could read it:</hi> Neither Prophet, nor Ruler, nor Seer, no Prophet in the Church, no Ruling Elder, nor the most seeing spiritual Member of the Church could see it to the Mystery, nor look thereon; yea, the v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall be hid;</hi> that both Fathers, Doctors, and Divines could not read the Book, nor look thereon; yet there is a promise, Verse 18. <hi>That in that day the ears of the deaf shall hear the words of the Book: They that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,</hi>

               <hi>and they that murmured, shall loarn doctrine,</hi> Verse 24.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That Book which was sealed before, shall be open again, and so it is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 1, 2. There the little Book is open. The mystery of Christ in us, is called a little Book, in opposition to those huge Tomes and mighty Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of Fathers, Councels, and Commentators, Treatises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have been all the dayes of Antichrist; But in the day of Christ, when Christ shall appear in the Saints, then shall the Mystery be but a little Book; 'ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no more then God manifest in mans flesh; if a man could manifest this Mystery to the World, as the Apostles could, there would be an end of the Church controversie this day; for without controversie, great is the mystery of godlinesse, God manifest in flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is that I would say, That the mystery of God shall be more gloriously revealed in the last times, after Antichrists destruction and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Saints from the apostacy, then ever it was by the Apostles themselves at first. This I have shewn more fully in our private speakings, and shall, if called to, give a publike account.</p>
            <p>But now it is enough, that when the seventh Angel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to sound, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath declared by his servants the Prophets, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 7. What is the mystery of God, but the man Christ Jesus?—how that man is God; how God is manifest in mans flesh; this hath been declared by the Prophets more fully, then in the writings of the Apostles, excepting <hi>John;</hi> and he gives but some hints of that high and heavenly Mystery, which the Scriptures of the Prophets do more gloriously speak out, by whom the Mystery is revealed, though not to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 27. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13. compared. And as the Prophets did minister not to themselves, but to the Apostles; so the Apostles do minister many things of the mystery of Christ, not to themselves, but to us in these last times, to whom the mystery of God shall be fulfilled, which was to them revealed but in part, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 7.</p>
            <p>I date not say, that any thing of this Mystery is revealed

to me, nor yet dare I deny the teachings of God: But what I have taught, as I would no man to trust me; so I wish all men to try me, and to hold fast that which is good: This is all that I know of this yet, if yet I know any thing:</p>
            <p>First, That the Son and the Saints make one perfect man, and that the fulness of the Godhead dwells in both, in the same measure, though not in manifestation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the fulness of the Godhead shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the flesh of the Saints, as in the flesh of the Son.</p>
            <p>These two things, which others see as Heresie and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, seems to me as Truths, both in Scriptures, and by that Spirit which speaks in me: If any man can convince me by proofs or power of Argument, I shall submit and be silent.</p>
            <p>But because I am forcibly commanded and called forth to speak in publike, I shall according to the power of God in me, do these two things: First, Prove the Doctrines by plain Scriptures. Secondly, Then propound my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from thence.</p>
            <p>My proofs for the first are from Christ and his Apostles, both to me teach this one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That the fulness of the Godhead dwells in the Saints, as in the Son, in the same measure, though not in the same manifestation, he being in this last sense Anointed above his fellows, and God manifest in flesh; But seeing we are his Brethren, we <note place="margin">

the Godhead is in both, in the same measure; Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self witnesseth in those words, <hi>John</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled: ye beleeve in God, beleeve also in me.</hi> The Saints before Christs beleeved on God in Covenant, but not on God in Christ; that was the mystery which <hi>Moses</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 33. 18.</note> himself saw not, nor should see the glory of God in the face of Christ; for all that doctrine of Free-grace and Mercies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was but Gods back parts: but now saith Christ, <hi>Ye beleeve in God, beleeve also in me;</hi> that is, beleeve on God by me; for as Christ is onely the Way to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Verse</hi> 6. so the Father onely is the end and ultimate object of all our Christian knowledge, faith, and worship: therefore Christ addes this Verse 2. <hi>In my fathers house are many mansions;</hi> what is the Fathers house? but the Father himself, God himself, the fulness of the Godhead: there are mansions in it; there is not onely a mansion for me saith Christ, in God, but mansions for you also in him, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you:</hi> But how doth he prepare a place for them in the Godhead with himself? Why, 'twas by going to God, going to the Father to receive the promise of the holy Spirit. Why? Christ received the Spirit before in <note place="margin">Acts 2. 33.</note> the fullest measure; yea, but not in that full manifestation: he was the Son before, but not declared so to be the Son of God, but by the resurrection; God was in his flesh at his first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but God was not so manifest in flesh, till he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up to glory, and received the promise of the Spirit, to shed it forth also on every beleever to bring them to God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: <hi>For if I go, I will come again, and receive you to my self, that</hi>

               <hi>beleeveth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works then these shall he do, because I go to the Father:</hi> that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43228:9"/>
is, <hi>he that beleeveth on me,</hi> as saith the Scriptures; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth so on the Son, that he seeth himself with the Son in <note place="margin">Joh. 7. 38 and 17. 20, 21.</note> God, and God in him, as in the Son; he shall do greater works then the Son did in the dayes of his flesh: as we see <hi>Peter</hi> did convert more at one Sermon, then Christ did all <note place="margin">Act. 2. 41 and 3. 19.</note> his life long; and the Apostles gave the Spirit by the laying on of hands, which Christ did not whilest he lived in flesh: Again saith he, <hi>John</hi> 14. 18. <hi>I will not leave you comfortless, I will come to you, I will not leave you Orphanes, or fatherless, you shall have a father as well as I, when I come to you in spirit,</hi> (not his coming at the last day, that was a long time, the Apostles should not live to that, but) <hi>yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but ye see me:</hi> The world a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Christian can see no further then Christ in flesh, when that is gone the world sees him no more, <hi>but ye see me.</hi> How? <hi>Because I live, ye shall live also;</hi> that is, ye see me in God, and living in God onely; and because I live, ye shall live in God also; <hi>For our life is hid with Christ in God,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> saith: 'Tis in God our life is, and as the Son lives, <note place="margin">Col. 3. 3.</note> for 'tis with Christ, though this be yet hid: <hi>But in that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you, John</hi> 14. 20. That is, in the day of Christs coming, and appearing in us, we shall know that as he is in the Father, and hath his being in God onely, so we also shall see, that we are in him, and he in us; and that we have the same being in God: <hi>We shall appear with him in glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>This is plainer expressed, <hi>John</hi> 17. 21. In Christ his last prayer to his Father for those given him; <hi>Neither pray I for these alone; but for them also that shall beleeve on me through their word,</hi> (beleeve in the sense before said) <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us:</hi> One in Glory, one in the Godhead; so it follows, <hi>John</hi> 17. 22. <hi>The glory which thou gavest me, have I given them.</hi> Whats the glory which the Father gave him? God himself, the Father gave himself, as 'tis <hi>Verse</hi> 5. <hi>And now Father, glorifie me, with thine own self, the glory which I had with thee before the world was:</hi> That glory was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43228:9"/>
then given, and that glory which God gave the Son, the same is given the Saints: The glory is given already to them, though they enjoy it not, nor that glory revealed in them, nor the Godhead yet manifest in their flesh: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ prayes there, not for the matter of glory, as if that were not yet; but for the manifestation of that glory. Whats the glory? First, Perfect union; <hi>That they may be one, as we are one; as perfectly and fully one.</hi> Verse 23. <hi>I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one, that the world also</hi> (as well as they) <hi>may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</hi> That's the second part of glory; The same love God bears to the Saints, as to his beloved Son, as hearty and as high a love, as intense, and eternal for extension also, as full expressions of love go forth from God to the Saints, as to the Son; yea, more in the Letter is said of them, though it be the same love in Spirit with the Son also. How do the Prophets powre forth all the tender heartedness, and truest love of God on the Saints saying, besides many other woing words, that he their Maker, is their Husband, and they his <hi>Hephzibah</hi>

Because the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 17.</note> God in our flesh: This again is a third story of that glory the Saints are taken up with the Son, not onely perfect union with the Father, and sulness of love, but living for ever also with the Son in God; for that's the meaning of that <hi>Verse</hi> 24. <hi>Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me, may be with me where I am; in the same mansion, in the same place;</hi> that is, (as I said) in the fulness of the Godhead; in all the fulness of God, that they may behold this, he sayes, <hi>That this may be manifest to them, and the world also;</hi> for the Saints sit with the Son already in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

places, yea, are with him at the right hand of God, and therefore are said to dwell in Heaven; whom therefore the Dragon doth blaspheme, even God and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven; that is, the Saints who <note place="margin">Revel. 13. 6, 7.</note> are the Tabernacle of God, in whom God dwells; and so they blaspheme God in them, calling them for this blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers. But let us hear what the Apostles of Christ can say for this. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for the <hi>Ephesians, That they may comprehend with all Saints, what is the bredth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth all knowledge, that they may be filled with all the fulness of God, Ephes.</hi> 3. 18, 19. Here's a great word and wonderful Glory, a Mystery that hath all dimensions in it; such a height, that no carnal man can reach unto; a depth that none can dive into; a length that none can compass the end thereof; and such a bredth, that none can comprehend with all their vast understandings; yet he prayes, that they with all Saints of the lowest size, the least capacity may comprehend and know the love of Christ that passeth all knowledge; that is, the love of God in Christ, (as the <hi>Geneva</hi> notes well) that we may be filled with all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God; that is, that all the fulness of the Godhead, may be manifest to them and others also: That he prayes for, For they were already filled with all the fulness of God. Again, the Apostle is plainer in his proof, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2, 9, 10. where he speaking of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ, so we read, but falsly as in other places of this nature; as if there were first God, the divine Nature, then the Father, then Christ; whereas 'tis in Greek, The mystery of that God and Father, there's the first, and then of Christ, as also 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 11. Now God himself, and the Father; 'tis, now that God himself and Father, or as the <hi>Geneva</hi> reads in both places, the mystery of God even the Father, that's the first part of the mystery; then the mystery of Christ is the second, what's that? <hi>In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are compleat in him;</hi> compleat, 'tis in the Greek, ye are filled; <note place="margin">Col. 2. 9, 10.</note>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:43228:10"/>
with what? with all fulness of the Godhead, as we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. For as it pleased the Father that all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should dwell in the Son, so its his pleasure the same ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and measure should dwell in the Saints; though the Son hath in all things the preeminence in manifestation, yet the fulness of the Godhead shall be also manifested in the Saints; which is my second to prove, That the fulness of the Godhead shall be also manifest in the flesh of the Saints, as in the Son.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the first falling away, and apostacy of Churches, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 1.</note> was in doctrine, not in worship; so the first doctrine which was darkned with the smoke of the bottomless pit, <note place="margin">Revel. 9. 2.</note> with the spirit of Antichrist, it was the Sun: The Son was darkned, and so the Father also; <hi>for he that denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father.</hi> Now here's the first deceit of Antichrist in denying the Father and the Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 22.

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:43228:11"/>
But Antichrist is a liar; though in a form of words father, and son is confessed; yet in truth, in power, and spirit, they deny both. They deny the Father in the Son, and deny the Son in the Saints; denying God in Christ, and the Father all in all in his flesh: For God, even the Father, the everlasting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">

               </note> was born and brought forth in that flesh; God in flesh lived with men, and in flesh God gave his life for men, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing the Church with his own blood; 'twas God rose, and God ascended in flesh; yea, the Son was nothing, but as he was in God; the Son could do nothing of himself, but the Father in him did all the works; and as God was in Christ, and God all in all in his flesh, so Christ in us all in all in our flesh; Christ the man-childe is brought forth in us, liveth in our flesh, suffers in us, and shall rise in us, and we shall ascend also with him; for as the two witnesses (those few Saints who yet are a full witness for Christ, and against Antichrist) were killed in the City where our Lord was crucified, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 8.

            <p>Secondly, Antichrist denies Christ to be come in flesh, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 3. Not to come in flesh of the Virgin made of a woman; this all carnal Christians confess in their Creed: But Antichrist denies Christ to be come in our flesh, and our flesh to be anointed of God, and with God; for thats <note place="margin">1 John 4. 4.</note> Christ the anointed of God, God manifest in flesh: Now God was ever manifest in the flesh of the Saints, though they knew it not before; and the flesh of the Saints is the anointed of God, anointed with all the fulness of God; for so it follows. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Ye have an unction from the holy One, whereby ye know all things;</hi> that is, as he that is born of God sinneth not at all, because the seed remaineth in him, there is a principle, the Son, the Word, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Seed is in them: so he that is born of God, in whom God is brought forth, knoweth all things; because there is a power in him, God in his flesh teaching him all things, thats the unction.

This is <hi>Babylons</hi> destruction; first by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al divisions, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 10. 26. as the Churches divided: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the manifestation of the anointing, the discovery of Christ in the midst of the Church, <hi>God</hi> in their flesh: <hi>In that day</hi> (the day of Christ) <hi>his burden shall be taken from of thy shoulder, and the yoke from of thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed, because of the anointing, Isaiah</hi> 10. 27. This is the glorious liberty of the sons of <hi>God,</hi> the manifestation of the sons of <hi>God,</hi> which we hope for, <hi>God</hi> to be manifest in our flesh, then Christ comes in flesh: and thus, if the Son shall make ye free, ye shall be free indeed; but <hi>ye are of God, little children</hi> (the least Saint is of <hi>God,</hi> as the Son is of <note place="margin">1 John 4. 4.</note> the Father) and ye <hi>have overcome them;</hi> that is, (the wisest and most powerful Impostors of Antichrist) for <hi>greater is he in you; then he that is in the world;</hi> that is, Christ in you, <hi>God</hi> in your flesh; who is greater then all; whose very fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 3, 8.</note> and weakness is wiser and stronger, then all the strength and wisdom of men, and whose wisdom and strength shall be manifest also in the most foolish and feeblest Saints.

               </note> honor, and glory, as I said, shall be manifested in the Saints.</p>
            <p>First, His power, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 26, 27. <hi>He that overcometh, to him will I give power over the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken in peeces, even as I have received of my Father.</hi> See here the power of the Son, manifested in the Saints; for so the second <hi>Psalm</hi> speaks of the Son, <hi>The Kings of the earth, and the rulers, stand up against the Lord, and against his Christ;</hi> who is Christ the anointed of <hi>God?</hi> But the Saints with the Son, <hi>Verse</hi> 3. Who would think that poor Saints should have such power, yea, such honor have all the Saints, as <hi>to binde Kings in chains, and Nobles with links of iron; and to execute the judgement written of the Son, Psal.</hi> 149. 8, 9. Who beleeves that all the blood shed, and slaughters this day in the world; the dashings of Kings and Kingdoms one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, is done by the Saints, though they stir not,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43228:12"/>
but are quiet in the land; yet the Lord goes forth of them, working all, and wasting all by them, by the weakest Saints. <hi>Thou worm Jacob, thou shalt thresh mountains, and beat the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isai. 41. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>hills to chaff:</hi> that is, as another Prophet phraseth it, <hi>O Jacob,</hi> that is, the weakest Saints; for <hi>Israel</hi> is the name of power, but <hi>Jacob,</hi> thou art my battle-ax and weapons of war, with <note place="margin">Jere. 51. 20, 21.</note> thee will I destroy Nations, and dash Kingdoms in pieces like a Potters vessel: This the Saints have done, and do still, God in them doing all in all: Though this be not yet mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in them, nor to the world, yet it shall be, saith the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, The Saints shall have the same power manifest in them as in the Son.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The honor also of the Son shall be manifest in the Saints; <hi>He that overcomes, shall sit with me in my throne; as I overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. Revel.</hi> 3. 21. What's the throne of Christ, but the honor given him of God, to raign and to judge also? The Saints shall have both, not onely a rod or scepter of Iron to break Nations, but a scepter of Gold, of Righteousness to rule Nations; and that Nation which will not serve thee, shall perish, and be utterly wasted: Who will not <note place="margin">Isai. 60. 12.</note> serve God in the Saints? But then again, The Saints shall judge also with Christ (not by approbation onely, as Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who sit on the bench with the Judge) but the Saints as the Son shall sit in the same judicial throne: The Saints <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 3.</note> shall judge the world, yea, Angels; not onely the world, common Churches, with all their worships, but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Churches also the Saints shall judge; as Christ judged none more hardly then the Priests, and Elders of the people.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 7.</note> 
               <hi>will be his God, and he shall be my Son.</hi> Here's the glory of the Son; that he is appointed heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. This glory is given to the Saints also, though the Saints know it not, no more then a crowned Childe in the cradle knows he is a King. Here's the mystery of Christ, and of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43228:13"/>
a beleeving Christian also: <hi>Who is he that overcometh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 John 5. 5.</note> 
               <hi>the world? but he that beleeveth that Jesus is the Son of God,</hi> beleeveth in that sense I said before.</p>
            <p>'Tis strange, that the Saints who dare not judge any man, yet are said to judge all things, and to be judged of no man; that they who hurt no man, should be said to destroy all men; that those who have nothing, should be said to be heirs of all, and inherit all things; how could this be? but that the Son is in them, God in their flesh; and so he is their God, and they are not onely his sons, but his Son. This seems to be a truth in it self, though not manifest to them till they overcome.</p>
            <p>This overcoming is seven times repeated, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. and 3. and once more here, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 7. There's a mystery in that also, in this overcoming, what is it, and what is the thing to be overcome? In a word, 'tis the number and name of the Beast that the Saints must get victory of, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 2. But what's the Beast, his name, and number? 'tis the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">Revel. 13 18.</note> of a man, that's more mysterious yet: But sure 'tis cleer, That every man is brutish in his knowledge; and though vain man would be wise, yet man is born but a wilde Asses colt; yea, <hi>Man in honor understandeth not, but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 49. 20.</note> 
               <hi>is like a beast that perisheth:</hi> So that man is the Beast, who counts himself wise, or to have the knowledge of a man, which the wisest man, even <hi>Agur</hi> the Prophet would not own, when he was to speak of <hi>Ithiel,</hi> and <hi>Ucal;</hi> that is, <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 2, 3.</note> of Christ, and God in Christ; for <hi>Ithiel</hi> is the same with <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, God with us;</hi> and <hi>Ucal</hi> is a name, signifying <hi>power,</hi> as Christ is the wisdom of God, and power of God: So then, when man sees onely of the humanity in himself, the wisdom of man or power of man, and sees not <hi>God</hi> all in all, and the Godhead in him; This is the Beast, this the number of his name, the number of a man; when we shall overcome this, this manhood, this self, and submit to the Godhead in us; when we shall see <hi>God</hi> onely manifest in our flesh, and the flesh nothing, profiting nothing, having
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43228:13"/>
no power, nor wisdom; when thus we deny our selves, follow me, saith Christ; follow him who is our forerunner, and gone before into the holiest, into the fulness of the Godhead with him; then we are said to overcome and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things. God is our God, and we are his Son, then this shall be manifest; for <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 3. we shall see his face, and his name shall be in our foreheads, as the Fathers name with Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14 1. so the name of Christ also shall be read in our foreheads. Men shall see the Saints as the Son, That's <note place="margin">
                  <p>Revel. 3. 12.</p> 
                  <p>Revel. 22. 4.</p> 
                  <p>Isa 62. 2.</p> 
                  <p>Isai 65. 15.</p>
               </note> his new name, which he will write on us; and we shall be called by another name, by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name. Mens mouthes have still formed new names on the Saints, as from the beginning so of late: In Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, the Saints suffered as Protestants; in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> as Professors; in King <hi>James</hi>'s as Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; in King <hi>Charli</hi>'s as Separatists; in our days as Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Heretikes, and Blasphemers: But the Lord God will give us a new name shortly himself, when <hi>ye shall leave your name as a curse to my chosen; for the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name, Isaiah</hi> 65. 15.</p>
            <p>So far concerning the proof of those Truths, so far as I conceive them to be. Now I shall come to the Arguments, which are three; the first from the Old Testament, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond from the New, the third from both:</p>
            <p>The first Argument is from <hi>Isaiah</hi> 61. thus,</p>
            <p>Those who are the anointed of God with Christ, to preach the Gospel to the world, whom the world shall own as the onely Ministers of God, and honor as the Son, they have all the fulness of the Godhead as the Son: But the Saints are the anointed of God with Christ, to preach the Gospel to the world, and the world shall own them as the onely Ministers of God, and honor them as the Son.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Saints have all the fulness of the Godhead with the Son.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:43228:14"/>
There are four parts in the Argument to prove in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>First, The Saints are the anointed of God with Christ, that's plain, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 61. 1, 3. The same spirit or oyl powred forth on the Son, is powred forth on the Saints, and that in the same fulness:</p>
            <p>For secondly, They are anointed with him to preach the Gospel to the world; the Spirit was on him, that he might preach to the world, and they shall preach to the world also; for <hi>they shall build the old wastes, and shall raise up the former desolations, they shall repair the waste cities, the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of many generations, Verse</hi> 4. What wastings hath war made, not onely in the visible world, but the invisible? in the inward man are more wastes; and for many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, men have been desolated of that glory once given them. Now to repair all things in the world visible and invisible, to build up the ruines made, not by <hi>Rome,</hi> but even by the most reformed Churches; to raise up a new building, a city for God to dwell in, this is the work of the Son one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet the Saints shall do it also; but I beleeve the world shall be a little more wasted first.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The world shall then own the Saints as the onely Ministers of God. <hi>Verse</hi> 6. <hi>Ye shall be called the Priests of the Lord, and men shall call you the Ministers of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>All that see them shall acknowledge, that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed, Verse</hi> 9. Now the blessed Seed <hi>is Christ, Gal.</hi> 3. 16. He speaketh not of Seeds, as of many, but of One, the Seed, <hi>which is Christ.</hi> All the Saints being many (in fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh) make up but one Christ (in Spirit); yea, God even the Father that eternal Spirit, shall be manifest in their fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sh, as in his: That not onely themselves shall see it; but all men shall say, <hi>that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed.</hi>

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43228:14"/>
is set forth, not that any man should approve, but prove it; not to justifie himself, but to be judged of all. He will not mention any thing in the Dispute at present, being content to suffer in silence, and fit still in his own abhorrency, while others walk in their honor, and applause, which he doth not envy them; for they have their reward, and he his wages, That all men speak evil of him; yet could he with a few words wipe of all his personal wrongs, but then he should be sprinkle others with some spots and shame, which he is loth to do. Let the true God who judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, cleer up all mens falshoods (and truth also) in his due time.</p>
            <p>This is all he hath now to say, That as he first professed, he knew nothing, nor maintained any thing as Dogmatical, but onely delivering his minde, drawn out to speak, because he should not be silent; so he confesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not yet carried out of the way of further inquiry, and seeking the Truth, that God shall teach him, and not men; wishing all the Saints were in that way, to cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <note place="margin">
