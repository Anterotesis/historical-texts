            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Death of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Calamy,
Not known to the Author of a long time after.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>ANd must our Deaths be silenc'd too! I guess</l>
               <l>'Tis some dumb Devil hath possest the Press;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Calamy</hi> dead without a Publication!</l>
               <l>'Tis great injustice to our <hi>English</hi> Nation:</l>
               <l>For had this Prophet's Funeral been known,</l>
               <l>It must have had an Universal Groan;</l>
               <l>Afflicted <hi>London</hi> would then have been found</l>
               <l>In the same year to be both burn'd and drown'd;</l>
               <l>And those who found no Tears their flames to quench,</l>
               <l>Would yet have wept a Showre, his Herse to drench.</l>
               <l>Methinks the Man who stuffs the Weekly Sheet,</l>
               <l>With fine New-Nothings, what hard Names did meet.</l>
               <l>The Emp'ress, how her Petticoat was lac'd,</l>
               <l>And how her Lacquyes Liveries were fac'd;</l>
               <l>What's her chief Woman's Name; what Dons do bring</l>
               <l>Almonds and Figs to <hi>Spain</hi>'s great little King:</l>
               <l>Is much concern'd if the Pope's Toe but akes,</l>
               <l>When he breaks Wind, and when a Purge he takes;</l>
               <l>He who can gravely advertise, and tell</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Lockier</hi> and <hi>Rowland Pippin</hi> dwell;</l>
               <l>Where a Black-Box or Green-Bag was lost;</l>
               <l>And who was Knighted, though not what it cost:</l>
               <l>Methinks he might have thought it worth the while,</l>
               <l>Though not to tell us who the State beguile,</l>
               <l>Or what new Conquest <hi>England</hi> hath acquired;</l>
               <l>Nor that poor Trifle who the City fired;</l>
               <l>Though not how Popery exaits its head,</l>
               <l>And Priests and Jesuits their poyson spread;</l>
               <l>Yet in swoln Characters he might let fly,</l>
               <l>The Presbyterians have lost an Eye.</l>
               <l>Had <hi>Crack</hi>—'s Fiddle been in tune, (but he</l>
               <l>Is now a Silenc'd Man as well as We)</l>
               <l>He had struck up loud Musick, and had play'd</l>
               <l>A Jig for joy that <hi>Calamy</hi> was laid;</l>
               <l>He would have told how many Coaches went;</l>
               <l>How many Lords and Ladies did lament;</l>
               <l>What Handkerchiefs were sent, and in them Gold</l>
               <l>To wipe the Widows eyes, he would have told;</l>
               <l>All had come out, and we beholden all</l>
               <l>To him, for the o'reflowing of his gall.</l>
               <l>But why do I thus Rant without a cause?</l>
               <l>Is not Concealment Policy? whose Laws</l>
               <l>My silly peevish Muse doth ill t' oppose</l>
               <l>For publick Losses no Man should disclose;</l>
               <l>And such was this, a greater loss by far,</l>
               <l>One Man of God then twenty Men of War;</l>
               <l>It was a King, who when a Prophet dy'd,</l>
               <l>Wept over him, and Father, Father cry'd.</l>
               <l>O if thy Life and Ministry be done</l>
               <l>My Chariots and Horsemen, strength is gone.</l>
               <l>I must speak sober words, for well I know</l>
               <l>If Saints in Heaven do hear us here below,</l>
               <l>A lye, though in his Praise, would make him frown,</l>
               <l>And chide me when with <hi>Iesus</hi> he comes down</l>
               <l>To judge the World.—This little little He,</l>
               <l>This silly, sickly, silenc'd <hi>Calamy,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Aldermanbury</hi>'s Curate, and no more,</l>
               <l>Though he a mighty Miter might have wore,</l>
               <l>Could have vi'd Interest in God or Man,</l>
               <l>With the most pompous Metropolitan:</l>
               <l>How have we known him captivate a throng,</l>
               <l>And made a Sermon twenty thousand strong;</l>
               <l>And though black-mouths his Loyalty did charge,</l>
               <l>How strong his tug was at the Royal Barge,</l>
               <l>To hale it home, great <hi>GEORGE</hi> can well attest,</l>
               <l>Then when poor Prelacy lay dead in its nest;</l>
               <l>For if a Collect could not fetch him home,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> must stay out, that Interest was mum.</l>
               <l>Nor did Ambition of a Miter, make</l>
               <l>Him serve the Crown, it was for Conscience sake.</l>
               <l>Unbrib'd Loyalty! his highest reach</l>
               <l>Was to be Master <hi>Calamy,</hi> and preach.</l>
               <l>He bless'd the King, who Bishop him did name,</l>
               <l>And I bless him who did refuse the same.</l>
               <l>O! had our Reverend Clergy been as free</l>
               <l>To serve their Prince without Reward, as he,</l>
               <l>They might have had less Wealth with greater love:</l>
               <l>Envy, like Winds, endangers things above;</l>
               <l>Worth, not Advancement, doth beget esteem.</l>
               <l>The highest Weathercock the least doth seem.</l>
               <l>If you would know of what disease he dy'd,</l>
               <l>His grief was Chronical it is reply'd.</l>
               <l>For had he opened been by Surgeons art,</l>
               <l>They had found <hi>London</hi> burning in his heart;</l>
               <l>How many Messengers of death did he</l>
               <l>Receive with Christian Magnanimity!</l>
               <l>The Stone, Gout, Dropsie, Ills, which did arise</l>
               <l>From Griefs and Studies, not from Luxuries;</l>
               <l>The Megrim too which still strikes at the Head,</l>
               <l>These He stood under, and scarce staggered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Might he but work, though loaded with these Chains,</l>
               <l>He Pray'd and Preach'd, and sung away his pains;</l>
               <l>Then by a fatal Bill he was struck dead,</l>
               <l>And though that blow he ne're recovered,</l>
               <l>(For he remained speechless to his close)</l>
               <l>Yet did he breath, and breath out Prayers for those</l>
               <l>From whom he had that wound: he liv'd to hear</l>
               <l>An Hundred thousand buried in one year</l>
               <l>In his Dear City, over which he wept,</l>
               <l>And many Fasts to keep off Judgments, kept;</l>
               <l>Yet, yet he liv'd, stout heart he liv'd, to be</l>
               <l>Depriv'd, driven out, kept out, liv'd to see</l>
               <l>Wars, Blazing-Stars, Torches which Heaven ne're burns,</l>
               <l>But to light Kings or Kingdoms to their Urns.</l>
               <l>He lived to see the Glory of our Isle,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>London</hi> consumed in its Funeral pile.</l>
               <l>He liv'd to see that lesser day of Doom,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>London,</hi> the Priests Burnt-sacrifice to <hi>Rome;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That blow he could not stand, but with that fire</l>
               <l>As with a Burning Fever did expire.</l>
               <l>Thus dy'd this Saint, of whom it must be said,</l>
               <l>He dy'd a Martyr, though he dy'd in's bed.</l>
               <l>So Father <hi>Ely</hi> in the Sacred page</l>
               <l>Sat quivering with fear as much as age,</l>
               <l>Longing to know, yet loth to ask the News</l>
               <l>How it far'd with the Army of the <hi>Iews.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Israel</hi> flies, that struck his Palsie-head,</l>
               <l>The next blow stunned him, Your Sons are dead;</l>
               <l>But when the third stroke came, The Ark is lost,</l>
               <l>His heart was wounded, and his life it cost.</l>
               <l>Thus fell this Father, and we well do know</l>
               <l>He fear'd our Ark was going long ago.</l>

               <l>There his blest Soul beholds the face of God,</l>
               <l>While we below groan out our <hi>Ichabod:</hi>

               <l>Vnder his burned-Church his Body lies,</l>
               <l>But shall it self a glorious Temple rise;</l>
               <l>May his kind flock when a new Church they make,</l>
               <l>Call it St. <hi>Edmundsbury</hi> for his sake.</l>
