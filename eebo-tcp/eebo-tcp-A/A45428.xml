            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> 1. That all ſinnes in the world, be they never ſo great, of what <hi>ſort</hi> or <hi>kind</hi> ſoever, if they be <hi>retracted</hi> with true <hi>repentance,</hi> ſhall certainly be <hi>forgiven;</hi> (for that any <hi>act</hi> of ſin ſhould be <hi>irremiſſible,</hi> they that affirme doe it on this ground that they that <hi>commit</hi> that act ſhall never truly <hi>repent,</hi> implying that if they did <hi>repent,</hi> it would be <hi>remiſſible)</hi> and in this the onely difficulty will bee, 1 What <hi>true repentance</hi> is: And 2. Whether that be <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the obtaining <hi>pardon</hi> for <hi>every</hi> ſinne.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, I anſwer, that true <hi>repentance</hi> is a <hi>change,</hi> a <hi>through change of mind,</hi> (called in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the ordinary ſtyle of <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Divines,</hi> the <hi>new creature,</hi> being <hi>regenerate, converſion, ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, forſaking of ſinne, mortification, habituall ſanctification, ſincere, faithful reſolution of new life, reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, amendment,</hi>

                     </gap>, as it ſuperaddes to <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) and what ever doth not amount to thus much is not <hi>true ſaving repentance,</hi> to which the <hi>promiſes</hi> or mercies of <hi>Chriſt</hi> doe appertaine. And ſo conſequently many ſpecious pretenders to that Title are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Such are bare ſorrow for ſinne, ſuch the <hi>votum poenitentiae,</hi> the wiſhing they were penitent, ſuch a bare <hi>warring</hi> of the <hi>law of the mind againſt the law of the members,</hi> whil'ſt we are <hi>carried captive to the law of ſinne;</hi> and many the like.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>ſecond,</hi> I muſt anſwer by diſtinguiſhing the <hi>equivocalneſſe</hi> of the queſtion. For the meaning of it may be, 1. Whether <hi>amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> or <hi>forſaking,</hi> or <hi>overcoming</hi> every <hi>particular</hi> ſinne be <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96487:3"/>
to the obtaining of <hi>pardon</hi> for that <hi>ſinne,</hi> whether it be of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi> or otherwiſe: and if that be meant, I anſwer, No. For that ſome ſinnes are of that nature, that as long as we have this <hi>mortall infirme fleſh</hi> about us, we can never hope to be <hi>rid of</hi> them to <hi>get victory</hi> over them: ſuch as for which the <hi>ſacrifices</hi> were appointed to be offered under the <hi>law,</hi> and for which <hi>Chriſts ſacrifice</hi> once offered is a perfect <hi>expiation;</hi> and theſe by the tenour of the <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> or through the <hi>mercy</hi> of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall never bee <hi>imputed</hi> to the <hi>penitent ſinner;</hi> I meane to him who hath <hi>amended</hi> all others, and <hi>humbled</hi> himſelfe before <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>beſought</hi> his mercy in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by <hi>faith laid</hi> hold of it for theſe, which though he labour againſt them <hi>ſincerely,</hi> he cannot throughly <hi>amend</hi> or <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the meaning be, ſecondly, Whether the <hi>actuall amending</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> of all his knowne ſinnes which conſequently may by the Chriſtian be amended, be required neceſſarily to make a man capable of the <hi>pardon</hi> even of his ſinnes which cannot be <hi>amended;</hi> I anſwer, that it is very probable to be ſo. Becauſe <hi>Chriſts ſufferings</hi> ſeeme not be <hi>advantageous</hi> (at all, not ſo much as to the waſhing away of <hi>humane frailties)</hi> to any but thoſe who <hi>are in Chriſt, i. e. to new creatures,</hi> who alone are ſo; however that will not bee a materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſcruple, though it ſhould be left <hi>diſputable,</hi> as long as this other propoſition be taken for infallible (which is ſo) that <hi>except we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent we ſhall all periſh, i. e.</hi> that he that hath not forſaken all <hi>wilfull</hi> ſinnes, ſhall (whether for his <hi>wilfull</hi> ſinnes onely, or his <hi>wilfull and frailties</hi> both together, it matters not) be certainly <hi>condemned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the anſwering of theſe two <hi>queſtions</hi> ſo much hath been <note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> gained, as that we may make another <hi>generall reſolution,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ſecondly, that ſome <hi>ſinnes</hi> are <hi>reconcileable</hi> with a true <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, convert, regenerate eſtate,</hi> others are <hi>not.</hi> And conſequently ſome not <hi>deſtructive</hi> under the <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> though others are.

                  </p>
                  <p>For any more <hi>particular knowledge</hi> of them, every man will <note place="margin">Sect. 38.</note> beſt be able to <hi>adviſe</hi> himſelf, when he hath tryed his actions by this <hi>touchſtone,</hi> that [Thoſe onely are ſinnes of <hi>infirmity,</hi> when our <hi>ſincere endeavour</hi> and <hi>induſtry</hi> and the uſe of <hi>grace</hi> given us, and <hi>prayer</hi> for more <hi>grace,</hi> and other <hi>meanes</hi> preſcribed us, are not able to free us from <hi>ſome acts</hi> of thoſe ſinnes, or when all our <hi>failings</hi> in <hi>endeavour</hi> &amp;c. are but conſequents of <hi>humane frailty,</hi> not <hi>of wilfull ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of theſe that which I ſhall ſay for cloſe, will, I conceive, be matter of as much <hi>comfort,</hi> as the former part was of <hi>diſcomfort</hi> to any. To wit, that through the <hi>mercy</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the <hi>Second Covenant, Infirmities unconquered, unforſaken, ſticking</hi> to us till our very <hi>deaths,</hi> may be and ſhall be moſt certainly <hi>pardoned</hi> to them, that have nothing elſe to be charged on them. <hi>i. e.</hi> by whom all wilfull ſinnes be <hi>ſincerely forſaken,</hi> and for <hi>infirmities</hi> 1. their ſoules <hi>humbled</hi> in <hi>confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>contrition, 2. pardon</hi> humbly <hi>begg'd</hi> in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> name, and 3. <hi>ſincere endeavour</hi> uſed againſt them; they ſhall I ſay be <hi>pardoned,</hi> if not ſo farre as not to be <hi>puniſhed</hi> in this life, yet ſo farre as not to <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> here, or viſion of <hi>God</hi> hereafter, though they be here ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wholy <hi>overcome,</hi> or put off.</p>
                  <p>This I would make the interpretation of that <hi>diſtinction</hi> of a <hi>generall</hi> and <hi>particular repentance,</hi> ſo ordinary among Divines, that the <hi>particular repentance</hi> ſhould not onely deſcend to <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular wilfull</hi> ſinnes, eſpecially thoſe that are committed after the receiving <hi>knowledge of the truth,</hi> but alſo extend to the <hi>actuall forſaking</hi> of them; but the <hi>generall repentance</hi> belong onely to <hi>ſinnes of infirmity;</hi> and that 1 without <hi>deſcending</hi> to all <hi>particulars</hi> of that kind, 2 without <hi>extending our ſorrow</hi> &amp;c. for them to <hi>actuall forſaking.</hi> For the <hi>ſacrifices</hi> of the law being appointed to be offer'd for theſe <hi>ſinnes,</hi> but not for <hi>wilfull,</hi> argue that Chriſt typified by thoſe <hi>ſacrifices, when we were weake, dyed for us,</hi> and by his death hath obtained <hi>pardon</hi> (for all that <hi>walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit)</hi> for all their ſinnes of <hi>weakeneſſe,</hi> on termes onely of humiliation, <hi>particular,</hi> or, where that cannot be, <hi>generall confeſſion, prayer for pardon,</hi> and <hi>affiance in Chriſt</hi> for that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96487:13"/>
pardon, without any <hi>actuall overcomming</hi> or caſting off, or <hi>getting rid</hi> of them, (which in <hi>wilfull</hi> ſinnes muſt be ſuperadded to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer), ſo, that he that at the time or minute of his <hi>death</hi> ſhould be guilty of one of them, it would not hinder his <hi>ſalvation,</hi> any more then the ſame would be inconſiſtent with a <hi>regenerate juſtified e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi> in time of life.</p>
                  <p>So that the concluſion may be ſafe and cleare. A true Chriſtian may ſafely live and dye with <hi>ſins of infirmity</hi> about him, but live or continue in any <hi>wilfull</hi> ſinne, much leſſe dye he cannot, or if he doe, he ceaſeth to be ſuch. <hi>He that is borne of God ſinneth not,</hi> and <hi>he that doth ſinne is the ſervant of ſinne.</hi> Some <hi>ſpots</hi> there are which are not the <hi>ſpots of ſonnes, Deut.</hi> 32. 5. and they that are guilty of them, may be <hi>reſolved,</hi> either never to have right unto, or if they had, to have <hi>forfeited</hi> all their <hi>priviledges</hi> of <hi>Saintſhip here,</hi> (ſuch are <hi>juſtification,</hi> &amp;c.) and <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>benefits</hi> of it <hi>hereafter.</hi>

Onely from that latter interpretation, which I ſuppoſe will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, I ſhall take the hint to ſay that which though the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation be not admitted, will yet be without contradiction
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96487:17"/>
true, that how <hi>impoſſible</hi> ſo ever it be for ſuch an one to <hi>recover himſelfe,</hi> or for the ordinary meanes to worke upon him, yet 'tis ſtill <hi>poſsible,</hi> that God may by ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi> meanes of <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall husbandry recover</hi> and <hi>reduce</hi> that man. All that is here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed is onely this, that there is no promiſe that he will, and the thing is onely in the <hi>hands,</hi> the <hi>free hands of God,</hi> not ſo much as <hi>conſtrained</hi> by a <hi>promiſe,</hi> and ſo no ground either of <hi>depending</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it for my ſelfe that God will doe it for me, or <hi>prejudging</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that for them he will not doe it.</p>
                  <p>I can foreſee but one objection now producible againſt the <hi>probability</hi> of this interpretation, and it is this, that this <hi>impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of doing any good by our owne <hi>naturall ſtrength</hi> without Grace is ſo <hi>univerſall</hi> a truth, that it cannot be here appropriated to this one caſe of <hi>apoſtaſie</hi> or <hi>recidivation</hi> of the <hi>regenerate.</hi> For the <hi>regenerate, remaining</hi> ſo, can doe no <hi>good</hi> thing without it, and thoſe that are not yet <hi>regenerate</hi> are as unable to <hi>convert</hi> themſelves, as theſe are to <hi>recover</hi> or <hi>renew.</hi> To which though I might anſwer, that the inſtancing in this <hi>particular,</hi> is moſt (and only) proper to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preſent purpoſe, who ſpeakes to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> who were either thus <hi>fallen</hi> or in danger thus to <hi>fall,</hi> (and therefore though the <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> might be extended to thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet we have no reaſon to expect, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhould ſo farre <hi>recede</hi> from his buſineſſe in hand as to doe it, and ſo the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> will be of no force) yet will the <hi>anſwer</hi> be more <hi>cleare</hi> and <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> if I adde, that indeed that which is here ſaid, is <hi>proper</hi> onely to this <hi>kind</hi> of ſinners, the relapſt regenerate. For of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> not ſo falne, it is moſt certaine and agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-doctrine to affirme, that by the <hi>ſpirit of Chriſt he can do all things,</hi> that he hath <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> and by that <hi>ſufficient ſtrength</hi> to doe what God in the <hi>Goſpell requires</hi> of him, and therefore 'tis affirmed of <hi>him, i. e.</hi> his <hi>perſon</hi> thus enabled, that he is thus able; and conſequently he is every where <hi>exhorted</hi> to doe accordingly, to <hi>worke out his ſalvation, to ſtand,</hi> to <hi>quit himſelfe like a man,</hi> to <hi>purifie himſelfe,</hi> and a hundred the like, which (every one) ſuppoſe him to have <hi>grace</hi> by which to doe it.</p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>unregenerate,</hi> though indeed he having no <hi>grace,</hi> can as yet doe nothing, yet ſome <hi>promiſes</hi> there are in the <hi>new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of giving of grace to him, (mention of giving Chriſt <hi>for

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>To which purpoſe 'tis obſerved generally by <hi>Divines</hi> from theſe, and the like grounds, that there is to every wicked man a <note place="margin">Sect. 12.</note> time when the <hi>meaſure of his iniquities are filled up,</hi> and Gods patience in waiting for him ſo wearied out, that he gives over <hi>calling,</hi> or <hi>expecting,</hi> or <hi>waiting</hi> his <hi>repentance.</hi> This was wont to to be called by the <hi>Jewes the meaſure of judgment, i. e.</hi> a pitch of ſin, upon which <hi>judgment</hi> infallibly followed, <hi>deſtruction</hi> of whole Kingdomes, and the like.

                  </p>
                  <p>2. That it is a <hi>ridiculous</hi> thing, for a man to reſolve to <hi>live</hi> well upon no other conſideration, but becauſe the time is come when he thinkes he ſhall <hi>dye.</hi> The very <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>reſolution</hi> being contrary to the <hi>performance</hi> of it, the <hi>condition</hi> of all his good <hi>life,</hi> a <hi>preſumption that</hi> he ſhall not <hi>live.</hi> And not only <hi>ridiculous,</hi> but <hi>null;</hi> 'twill be but an act of <hi>reaſon</hi> &amp; <hi>juſtice</hi> to himſelf, to <hi>change</hi> the <hi>reſolution</hi> when the <hi>motives</hi> are <hi>changed,</hi> and a contrary <hi>impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>unkindneſſe</hi> to adhere to the concluſion, when the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> are <hi>confuted,</hi> and to doe that which he <hi>reſolved,</hi> when that upon which the <hi>reſolution</hi> was made, (ſelfe-love and carnall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and intereſts) ſhall as much <hi>oblige</hi> him to make contrary <hi>reſolutions;</hi> the <hi>invitations</hi> of the <hi>fleſh</hi> being as <hi>perſwaſive</hi> in <hi>health,</hi> as the <hi>terrours</hi> of <hi>hell affrighting</hi> in <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> the preſent <hi>pleaſure</hi> now as ſtrong an <hi>argument</hi> as was then the approaching <hi>paine,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when the <hi>pleaſure</hi> hath the <hi>advantage</hi> of being repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>alone,</hi> without the <hi>rivall;</hi> which was the only <hi>meanes</hi> by which the other came ever to prevaile. From ſuch grounds of diſcourſe as this, what can be expected of this <hi>ſick reſolver,</hi> but that he <hi>reſume</hi> his <hi>ſinnes</hi> with his <hi>health,</hi> leave his new <hi>vowes</hi> in that bed, where firſt he tooke them up, diſcharge his <hi>feares,</hi> and his <hi>good motions,</hi> his <hi>Phyſitian</hi> and <hi>Confeſſor</hi> together.</p>
                  <p>3. That a <hi>deſire of dying well,</hi> of having <hi>heaven</hi> in another world, may then eaſily be miſtaken for that reſolution.</p>

                  <p>6.

He that is ſicke, and is aſſured that ſuch a <hi>potion</hi> will cure him, <hi>reſolves</hi> firmely he will take it, &amp; is perhaps at that time perſwaded that this <hi>reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is <hi>ſincere,</hi> &amp; yet when the <hi>potion</hi> comes, and proves extreme of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to the taſt, he will rather <hi>dye</hi> then ſwallow it; This argues the <hi>reſolution</hi> either not <hi>largely</hi> enough <hi>extended,</hi> or not <hi>deepely</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <hi>radicated;</hi> he had only digeſted the <hi>potion,</hi> as phyſick, but not as loathſome, as preſcribed for his <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>foreſaw</hi> not then (or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not <hi>courageous</hi> enough to <hi>overcome)</hi> the <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> of it.</p>
