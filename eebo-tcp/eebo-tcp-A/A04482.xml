            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But ye say, I alledge Gelasius otherwise then I fynde him, and hereof your frends haue made much a do. I se, it muste be a very small fault that shall escape your eyes.

not for nought, that childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Scholes were wonte to fynde a difference betwene these two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posicions <hi>comedi bis pane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and <hi>bis panem comedi.</hi> But I perceine the faut was such that ye were loth to make mater of it. If I had alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any part of the sence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wryter, I trow, I had ben lyke to heare more of it.</p>
                  <p>I remember what a clappinge of handes, and stamping of fete, ye made at Oxen. agaynst that notable godlye learned man, the Archebishop of Cantorburye, for that he, alledging a place oute of Saint Hilarie, had chaunged but one letter, and wrytten, <hi>verò,</hi> in stende of <hi>verè,</hi> Ye triumphed ouer hym, and poynted hym to the people, and called hym a falsarie, a wrester, a corrupter of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.
<pb facs="tcp:8241:65"/>
And yet afterward it was founde, and wil yet appere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two of your owne doctours Steuen Gardiner, &amp; Smith in their owne printed bokes had chaunged the same letter, &amp; written, vero, aswel as he.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, God be thanked ye will not geue me cause to fynde such fault with your allegations, for ye are able to alledge nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>But it were to lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to shew how many times, and how shamefully, the wryters of your syd haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the old doctours.

                  <p>I Matueile muche that any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld doubt at this.

                  <p>S. Ambrose in his tyme, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed to the people of Italy in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, and as it is to be thought, the people vnderstode him.</p>

S. Gregory, in his sermons vsed the latin tong to the people, &amp; I trow he spake not al in vain. I marueil why ye doubt not aswel, whether the commen Greke people vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stod Demosthenes, or Aeschines: or the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> latin people vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode Cicero, or Hortensius, when they spake vnto them in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tong.</p>

                  <p>Chrisostom of his tym sayth thus: <hi>Ne mireris, si in sacris nostris, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, cum sacerdote colloquatur?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Maruil not, saith he, if that in our prayers the Priest and the people talke together.</p>
                  <p>Augustin of his tym, saith thus: <hi>Non est opus loquutione cum ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,

                  <p>But, because ye be a doctoure of law, I would not haue you forget Iustinian the Emperour, the first compyler of your lawes. He, if ye be remembred, commaunded the Bishops that they should set forth the commen prayers in ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voice, and that, as he sayeth: <hi>Vt maiori deuotione audientium animi effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur.</hi> That is, that the mindes of the heares may be striken w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more deuocion.

vnderstanding of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> praiers should enkendle deuocion in the hartes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hearers. For I beleue, he had neuer heard say, that ignoraunce shoulde be the cause of true deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, as ye boldely auouched in the disputtacion at westminster, in the hearinge, and wonderinge, of the most part of the honourable, and worshipful of this realm. I know not by what secrete Reuelation ye learned this first. For your owne Counsels say. <hi>Ignorantia mater est cuuctorum erroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> That is to say, ignoraunce is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mother of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner errours. And the same words ye haue alledged in your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. <hi>Distin. 38.</hi> &amp; are very agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto Christes wordes in the Gospel. <hi>Erratis nescientes Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras:</hi> ye are in errour, because ye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not the Scriptures.</p>

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:8241:72"/>Origenes, one of the oldest doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church, saith thus: <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum est Diabolo, si quem videat legere sacras literas: possidet enim omnes qui versantur in ignorantia.</hi> It is a skourge (saith he) &amp; a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the deuell, if he se any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> read the Scriptures: for he hath power vpon all them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>S. Cyril saith, <hi>Pueri nostri le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt sacras literas, &amp; ex eo fiunt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiosissimi.</hi> Our childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saith he, read scriptures, and therof they be cum deuout and holy.</p>
                  <p>And what needeth mo allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? your owne Doctour, Lyra, saith. <hi>Si populus intelligat ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem sacerdotis, melius reducitur in Deum, &amp; maiori deuotione respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det, Amen.</hi> That is, if the people vnderstande the Priest, they are

It muste needes be a miserable cause that is grounded only vpon ignorance, for no man hateth the light, but he that doth euel. Christ said to the Pharisies, this is your time, and the power of Darkenes yf the people had vnderstandyng of the truth, they wolde not suffer you thus to leade them into error as ye do, and haue done.

On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse ye wil happely say, as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> did, that God hath reuealed both mo thinges, and also better thinges vnto you, then euer he did vnto his Apostles: or els, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheus</hi> said, that the Apostle sawe nothing, but onely in <hi>speculo, &amp; in aenigmate:</hi> or as your doctour Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uester Prierias saith, <hi>Indulgentiae non habent authoritatem ex verbo Dei, sed habent authoritatem ab Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia Romana, quia maior est.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, sayth he, haue no ground of gods worde, but they haue theyr grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Rome, which is a great deale more.

is not a ceremony, but a part of the Sacrament. And as good right as ye had to take that part away, so good right had ye to take away also the other, and so to leaue the people nothing atal. And therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> old father Gelasius, saith, <hi>aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegra percipiant, aut ab integris ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceantur,</hi> ether let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, vnder both kindes, or els let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be put from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole.

                  <p>Again, for any one man to take vpon him to be vniuersal Bishop of the hole churche. S. Gregorye sayth, it is both against the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christ, and also against the olde canons, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Therfore saith S. Paule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: shall I praise you for thus doing? in this thing surely I may not praise you. For I see your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations &amp; comen metings are not to the better, but to the worse.</p>
            <p>For a redresse hereof he calleth them back to the first originall, &amp; to the institution of Christe from whence they were fallen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For I, (saith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) being amongst you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered you none other thinge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I had receiued of the Lorde.
<pb facs="tcp:8241:124"/>
That thinge he thought meetest for you. And therfore with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same ought you also to be contented.</p>
            <p>Thus, when soeuer any order geuen by God is broken or abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the best redresse therof is, to restore it again into the state that it first was in at the beginning.</p>
            <p>Thus when the Temple of god at Hierusalem was so shamfullye difordred by the priestes and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was become a caue of theues. Christe for reformation therof, called them backe again to the first erection of the temple. <hi>Scriptum est: Domus mea Domus orationis vocabitur.</hi> It is written (saith Christ) in the Scriptures: My house shalbe called the house of prayer. Thus was the temple of God vsed at the beginning and thus ought it to be vsed now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:8241:124"/>Thus when Christ was appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Scribes and Pharises in the case of diuorse, whether he thought it lawful for a man to put his wyfe from him for euery light cause, &amp; to mary another, he made them answer by the first institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ordinaunce of mariage. <hi>A prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio non fuit ita. Scriptum est: Eru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t duo in carne vna.</hi> It was not so (saith Christ) at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginninge. It is written. They shalbe two in one fleshe. Now therefore they are not two, but one fleshe. As if he shoulde haue said: This is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce of God my father. Thys may not be broken for your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures sake, but must remayne in strength, and last for euer.</p>
            <p>This S. Paule, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians might the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that they had vnreuerently

missensed the Lords supper, &amp; be the more willynge to redresse the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laied Christes first institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before theyr eyes, as a true patern whereby the sooner they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse it. Lokes (aith he) what thig I receiued of the Lorde, the same thing I delyuered cuer faithfully vnto you. I gaue you not any pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sy, or deuise of mine own, but that thing only that Christ had before deliuered me. This rule is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Hereby your doings may best be tryed? This, I iudge, to be the very true meaning of these words of S. Paule.

            <p>Wherfore as I said afore I haue thought it nedefull to intre at sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what herof at this tyme, &amp; haue good hope through Goddes grace so to laye forth the whole matter, not with eloquence of words, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> simplicity of the truth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it maye be plaine both vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue forsaken the masse, for what cause, and howe iustly they haue forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, and also vnto them that as yet delite in it, what maner of thinge it is that they delyte in.</p>
            <p>I knowe, sum man wil saye, for as much as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sacrament is a holy thing, the ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christ, the high mistery of his death, &amp; of our

saluation, to remain in the church for euer. Therfore it cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be abused, &amp; all that we speake this day in this behalfe, we speak of malice, and not of truth.</p>
            <p>True it is the sacrament is an holy thing, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ordinaunce of Christ, the mistery of our saluation: yet is there nothing so good, no ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce so holy, no mistery so heauenly, but through y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> foly, &amp; frowardnes of man, it may be abused.</p>
            <p>The Serpent that was set vp by Moises in the wildernes was an holy thinge, for it was a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; a figure of Christ hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the crosse: yet was it abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. The Gospell of Christe is an holy thynge, yet S. Paule sayth to the Philippians, there were sum then that preached it for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and contention, doing therby
<pb facs="tcp:8241:129"/>
seruice not vnto Jesus Chryste, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they professed in their mouth, but vnto theyr owne bellye. And thus beyng holy in it self, yet was it shamefully abused.</p>
            <p>And what thing is there s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye as the name of God? and yet what thing is there so often taken in vain, or somuch abused?</p>
            <p>But to cum neare to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the sacrament of Baptyme is an holy thinge: yet hath it ben abused, and that in the churche of God: yea, euen at the beginnynge of the churche: euen when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles of Christ were yet a lyue, and the bloude of Chryste, as yet fresh &amp; greene before theyr eyes.</p>
            <p>In S. Paules tyme there wer sum that baptised for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> dead: after that, there were sum that baptised such as wer alredy dead: &amp; sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            <p>Others there were that bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before they were borne, beynge as yet in theyr mothers womb. Which thing is mencioned and reproued by S. Augustin.</p>

               </gap>t abuses.</p>
            <p>Thus the sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, not withstanding it were a holy thing yet was abused.</p>
            <p>The sacrament of the brekinge of Christs body, &amp; the sheading of his bloud is an heauenly mistery, and an holy thing, yet hath it ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes ben abused, and that in the
<pb facs="tcp:8241:130"/>
Primitiue churche, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chryste semed to be in hyghest perfection.</p>
            <p>In the time of Tertullian, and of S. Ciprian, which was athou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and four hundred yeres ago, wemen commenly toke the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment home with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theyr nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, &amp; layed it vp in theyr chests, and receiued a portion of it in the morning before other meats.</p>
            <p>This was an abuse of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, &amp; therfore was it broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In S. Ciprians and S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines tyme, yong babes, as sone as they were Baptised, receyued the Communion. But that was a great abuse. For by the doctryne of S. Paule, the holy misteryes ought to be geuen vnto none, but onely vnto suche, as be able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the meanyng therof, to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8241:130"/>
sudge the Lordes body, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his death. And therfore now infantes, when they be baptised, receyue not the Communion. In the tyme of S. Hierom, sum por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was sent from the churche to the newe maried man, and to his wyfe to be receyued at home.</p>
            <p>This was a disorder of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and therfore now is not vsed. S. Ireneus (sayth) that one Marcus a necromanser was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to enchaunte the cup of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christes bloud, so that the liquour should seeme to increase &amp; multiplie, &amp; from a litle to growe to a great quantitie. This also was an horrible abuse of Christes holy sacraments.</p>
            <p>Summe of late tyme, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the communion for theyr
<pb facs="tcp:8241:131"/>
purgation to cleare them selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste sum notorious slaunder. And then the priest chaunged the wordes which comenly be vsed at the ministration, (and said thus:) <hi>Corpus domini nostri Iesu Christi sit tibi ad purgationem.</hi> Sum o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue vsed to hang the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> before theyr breastes, for a protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the assaultes of the deuel, &amp; all other wordly enemies. S. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ministred the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto a woman that was dead, &amp; it may well be thought that other did so as well as he: For it is forbidden by generall consent, in two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles, thone holden at <hi>Antifrodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum the other at Carthage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No man can lightly denye but these were greate abuses. For Christ appointed not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8241:131"/>
of his laste supper that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should beare it home, &amp; kepe it in their chests nor that it shulde be sent home to new maryed men and wemen, to be receyued in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall, nor that it shuld be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to babes and infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tes, that knewe not what it ment: nor that Inchaunters or Necromansers shoulde therby auaunt their dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable practises: nor y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men shoulde therby discharg them selues from slaunder: nor that it shuld be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before mens brestes, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about as a shielde against the Deuel, nor that it should be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred vnto dead men or women, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>losed vp in theyr mouthes, &amp; layd with them in theyr graues. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such as bare the name of Chryst, &amp; trusted to be saued by his bloude, shoulde communicate together, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:8241:132"/>
solace them selues in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of his death.</p>
            <p>This Christ himselfe hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do this, he saith, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of me. Thys is the very true &amp; lawfull vse of the holy Communion of Christes body and bloud, and all others are abuses.</p>
            <p>We se therefore, that albeit the sacrament be an holy thinge, and an heauenly mistery, yet that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it may many waies be abused.</p>
            <p>But what nede we so manye proues in a thinge that is so eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Saint Paule hymselfe saw the abuses thereof in his tyme. S. Paule hymself, euen in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng of the Churche, wythin forty yeares after Christes death, withnesseth, that euen then there were abuses crept into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8241:132"/>
and therfore repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let that be a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for you to folow.</p>
            <p>Summe man, perhappes, wil heare reply: notwithstanding the sacrament in it self, either through the wickednes, or through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foly of man, may be, and haue benabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yet neyther was there euer, nor can there be any such abuse, in the masse. For it standeth of foure special parts, godly doctrine, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consecration, godly receyuinge of the sacrament, and godly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In conclusion, it is so heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; so godly a thing, that no foly,
<pb facs="tcp:8241:133"/>
or wickednes can enter into it.</p>
            <p>These thinges, good brethern, I know haue ben ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of such places as this is, &amp; stoutly auoutched in your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.

<pb facs="tcp:8241:135"/>
wherin commenly the masse hath ben vsed: of the Communion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kynd: of the Canon: of the adoration of the sacramente: and of the priuate masse. And of these things I inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to speak, although not so largely, and with so manye words, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause would require: yet, by Goddes grace, so simply &amp; so truely, that who so will be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with truth or reason, shal sone perceiue there hath ben abuses in the Masse. And if there were but one of these abuses in it, yet were it worthy to be spoken of, and to be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. But if we shall plainly see with our eyes, that all the er, rours, &amp; disorders, besyde a great number els, whyche I wyllingly passe by, haue ben in the masse, (O good bretherne,) let vs not then thinke, that so many godly men, in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8241:135"/>
these our dayes, haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>against it without cause.</p>
            <p>First, as touching y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vnknow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n and straung tong y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath ben vsed in the Masse, S. Paules counsel and commaundement, is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that what so euer is done, or sayd, in the congregation shoulde so be done and sayd, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets may haue confort thereby, &amp; yelde thankes vnto God, and saye Amen. But the same saint Paul saith, if thou make thy prayer in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> congregation with thy spirite, or noyce of a straung wordes, howe shal the vnlearned man thereunto saye Amen? For he knoweth not what thou sayest. For not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dig thy praier, perhappes be good, pet hath the other no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it. And therefore (he saith)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> farther, I had leuer vtter fyue
<pb facs="tcp:8241:136"/>
words in the congregation wyth vnderstanding of my meaning, so that the reast may haue instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therby, then ten thousand wordes in a straunge &amp; knowen tong.</p>
            <p>Saint Angustine wrytynge vpon the Psalmes (sayth) thus. <hi>Oportet nos humano more, non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicularum ratione cantare, nam &amp; Merulae, &amp; Psipttaci, &amp; Corui do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centur sonare quod nesciunt.</hi> We must, (sayth S. Augustin) in the prayers that we make to god, not chirpe lyke birdes, but synge lyke men. For Popinioyes, &amp; Rauens, and other birdes are taughte to syng, they know not what.</p>
            <p>Iustinian a christian Emperor made a strait constitution, that all Bishops and priestes should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the words of the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with open voyce, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the people might say. Amen.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8241:136"/>
And to passe by all other authory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and examples in thys behalf, before the church grew to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all christian men through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the worlde made theyr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayers, and had the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in theyr owne commen and known tong. But in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> masse, as it hath ben vsed in thys later age of the worlde, the priest vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the holye misteries in suche a language, as neyther the people, nor oftentymes himself vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the meanynge. And thus the death of Christ, and hys passion, is setforthe in suche sorte, as the poore people can haue no conforte or frute therby, nor geue thankes vnto God, nor saye, Amen. Of all that holy supper, and most confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ordinaunce of Chryst, there was nothing for the simple soules
<pb facs="tcp:8241:137"/>
to consider, but only a number of gestures and countenaunces, and yet neither they, nor the Pryeste knewe, what they mente. Thinke you this was Christes meanyng when he ordeyned the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion fyrst? Thinke you that s. Paule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued these thynges of the Lorde and deliuered the same to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? O good brethern, Christ ordeyned the holy sacramente for our sakes, that we might therby, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> misteries of his death, &amp; know the price of his bloud.</p>
            <p>Touchinge the second abuse of the communion vnder one kind it would be long to say, so muche as the place woulde seme to require. For, besydes the Institution of Christ, &amp; the wordes of S. Paul, whyche to a christian man maye seme sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it was vsed through
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8241:137"/>
out the whole catholike churche, sixe hundred yeares after Christs ascension, vnder both kinds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception. But in one word, to say, that may be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for a wise man to consider: Gelasius, an olde father of the churche, and a bishop of Rome, sayth that to minister the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vnder one kind, is open sacriledge. His wordes be these: <hi>Diuisio vnius eiusdémque mysterii sine gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di sacrilegio non potest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenire.</hi> I trust I shall nede no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euidence, to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the masse, in this part, hath ben abused. The third point y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I promised to speake of, is the canon, a thing, for many causes, very vain in it self, &amp; so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certein, that no man can readilye tel, on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to father it. S. Paule saith, <hi>scio cui credidi, &amp; cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>First the priest in the Cannon, desyreth God to blesse Chrysts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as though it were not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blessed alredi.

            <p>Therfore S.

The eating therof, &amp; the worshipynge must ioyne together. But where we eate it, there must we worshyp it? Therfore must we worshyp it syttyng in heauen. So sayth the olde doctour, &amp; father, s. Chrisosto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Vbi cadauer, ibi aquilae, Cadauer, do mini corpus est: Aquillas autem nos appellat: vt ostendat, oportere illum ad alta contendere, qui ad hoc cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus accedit.

Where soeuer is the carcase, there be the Egles: The carcase is Christes bodye: vs he calleth the
<pb facs="tcp:8241:146"/>
Egles: to declare, that, whosoeuer wil, approche neare to that bodye must geat a lofte. For this is a banket for Egles, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> soare a high, not for Iayes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kepe the ground. Christes body is in heauen. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore must we direct our hartes: there must we feede: there must we refrcshe our selfe: &amp; there must we worship it.</p>
            <p>So sayth, S.

            <p>So sayth saint Ambrose. <hi>Non super terram, nec in terra, nec secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum<note place="margin">In Luca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ca. 2. 4.</note> terram te quaerere debemus, si

            <p>Thus did the olde Catholike fathers worship y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bodye of Christ. Thus may we also worship it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely, and without perill.</p>
            <p>But to geue Goddes honor to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sacrament is a thing both latelye brought into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> churche, vnknown &amp; straunge, to the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctors, and as the scholemen, and the greatest mainteiners of it, haue them selues confessed, an occasion of idolatry, and full of daunger.</p>

            <p>S.

For in the commen pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that be vsed about the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, the priest and the people both in voyce &amp; hart shoulde ioyne together. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the priest hath once done the consecration, &amp; the people should, at his hand receiue the communion, the Masse boke it selfe, biddeth him to breake the breade in three parts.

            <p>These words are the very lyke I remember I spake here openly before you all. And these be the things, that sum men say I haue spoken, and cannot iustify.

            <p>Sum others say, the prieste maye communicate for the people, and that is as meritorious vnto them, as if they had communicate them selfe. But what commission hath the prieste so to do? or from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? or what certeyne knowledg

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8241:173"/>
both together. S.

S. Iames spake out the words of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration distinctly and plainlye: They in theyr masse, suppresse the same wordes and kepe them close.

Saint Iames in his masse, preached and setforth the death of Christ: They, in theyr masse, haue onely a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of dum

gestures, and ceremonies, whych they themselfe vnderstand not, &amp; make no maner me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of Christs death. Saint Iames Masse was full of knowledge: Theyr Masse is full of ignoraunce.</p>
            <p>S. Iames masse was full of consolation. Theyr masse is ful of superstition. When S. Iames said Masse, the people resorted to receyue the sacrament. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they say Masse, the people resorteth to loke vpon onely, and to beholde the sacramente. And to conclude. S. Iames in his masse, had chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes institution: They, in theyr masse, haue welnere nothing els but mannes inuention.</p>
            <p>Suche difference ye maye see, betwene S. Iames Masse and theyrs, O that Saint Paul were now alyue, &amp; saw the behauoure,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8241:174"/>
and order of the prieest, at theyr masse. Thinke ye, that he woulde take it &amp; accompt it, for the Lords supper? When he had espied, but one fault in the holy communion, amongst y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Corinthians, streyght waye he rebuked them, and called them backe to Christes institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thys (sayth he) I receyued of the Lord, and the same, I gaue ouer, vnto you.</p>
            <p>But if he saw the disorder that we haue seene, woulde he not be moued asmuche against vs now, as he was sumtyme, against the Corinthians? wold he not pull vs backe to the institution of Chryst, as he did them? Would he not say vnto vs, did I euer teache you, to minister the holy Communion, in a straunge laugage? did I euer teache you, to receyue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,

            <p>Did I euer teache you, to say Masse, or to receyue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the people? Did I euer teache you, the idle folyes of your cannon?

            <p>Be these the thynges, that I deliuered you? Be these y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thyngs, that I receiued of the Lord? This would Saint Paule say vnto vs, if he were nowe alyue.

            <p>Oure owne inuentions, and phantasies, wherewyth we had filled the Masse, were so manye, and so grosse, that they quyte co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and shadowed the death of Christ, and the holye misteryes of our saluation.</p>
            <p>Therefore we coulde not truly say, these thinges Paule deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs, or these things Paule
