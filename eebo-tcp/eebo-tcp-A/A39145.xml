            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>A piller of the fatal Building's down,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Sampſon</hi> Death at laſt has overthrown;</l>
            <l>And now the whole fatal pyle begins to ſhake,</l>
            <l>And the <hi>Phyliſtian</hi>-Lords ſtout Hearts to ake:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Dagon</hi>'s great Houſe, their fell <hi>Conſpiracy</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To totter and to ſhake they now do ſee;</l>
            <l>And every <hi>Plotter, Truth</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> dreads,</l>
            <l>Now Ruine's tumbling on their Impious Heads.</l>
            <l>Long with vain Hopes, they did themſelves ſupport,</l>
            <l>And with the <hi>Gyant</hi> Death, they made but ſport;</l>
            <l>Their dear delightful <hi>plot</hi> they ſtill did mind,</l>
            <l>And thought both <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſtill were blind;</l>
            <l>Yes, they are blind, for they impartial are,</l>
            <l>They ſee not <hi>Bribes,</hi> and no Man will they <hi>ſpare:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>No more regard the <hi>Greateſt</hi> than the <hi>Leaſt,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Cut down the <hi>Guilty Lord,</hi> as well as <hi>Prieſt,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Stafford</hi> ſell, a <hi>piller</hi> of the <hi>plot,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whoſe <hi>Name</hi> muſt now as in a Dunghill rot,</l>
            <lg>
               <l>And blotted be with <hi>Infamy</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Once in the <hi>Engliſh Anuals</hi> of great <hi>Fame,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Joyn'd with the title of Great <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <l>Tho' great he was in <hi>Glory,</hi> and in <hi>pride.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He loſt his Head, and on a <hi>Scaffold</hi> dy'd;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Stafford</hi> of <hi>Southwick</hi> too, no better ſped,</l>
            <l>Who at <hi>Bridgwater</hi> alſo loſt his Head.</l>
            <l>But ſomething may be ſaid in their Applauſe,</l>
            <l>For both of them dy'd in a better Cauſe:</l>
            <l>The Firſt, by th' bloody Tyrant <hi>Richard</hi> fell,</l>
            <l>The laſt, by th' Hands of ſuch who did <hi>Rebell:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But our <hi>Staffoed,</hi> 'gainſt whom <hi>Juſtice</hi> crys,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Treaſon</hi> 'gainſt his <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> dyes.</l>
            <l>Sad is the <hi>Exit,</hi> I confeſs for <hi>Him</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whoſe <hi>Birth,</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs</hi> do enhaunce his crime:</l>
            <l>When <hi>He,</hi> whoſe <hi>Honour, Peerage,</hi> and <hi>Renown,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Should be <hi>Supporters</hi> to uphold the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Forgetting <hi>Honour, Oaths, Obliegements</hi> too,</l>
            <l>With traiterous Heart, <hi>Rebellion</hi> did purſue.</l>
            <l>O! could <hi>Religion</hi> to ſuch <hi>Crimes</hi> perſwade!</l>
            <l>And all the Rights of <hi>Honour,</hi> thus invade!</l>
            <l>What frantick <hi>Spell</hi> on <hi>Conſcience</hi> could intrude?</l>
            <l>What Words of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> could <hi>Honour</hi> thus delude?</l>
            <l>Twas <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf, that blinded thus their eyes,</l>
            <l>With <hi>Sorceries,</hi> in <hi>Jeſuits</hi> diſguiſe,</l>
            <l>Who did perſwade it was a Glorious thing,</l>
            <l>To cut the <hi>Throat</hi> of an <hi>Heretick</hi> King.</l>
            <l>O let it be into Oblivion Hurl'd,</l>
            <l>And Baniſh'd ever from the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World;</l>
            <l>Let that damn'd <hi>Doctrine</hi> down to Hell deſcend,</l>
            <l>With every one that dares it to defend.</l>
            <l>O! poor deluded <hi>Stafford,</hi> that was brought</l>
            <l>By jugling <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to have ſo damn'd a thought;</l>
            <l>Who thought by Horrid <hi>Crimes</hi> to gain Applauſe,</l>
            <l>Advanceing what he judg'd a Glorious <hi>Cauſe;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For which he durſt commit ſo ſtrange a ſin,</l>
            <l>To Kill his <hi>King,</hi> to bring's <hi>Religion</hi> in.</l>
            <l>But <hi>God</hi> who <hi>Kings</hi> infoldeth in his Arms,</l>
            <l>Kept ours ſafe from all their <hi>Spells</hi> and <hi>Charms,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And may his <hi>Eyes</hi> be open now to ſee</l>
            <l>The horrid depth of all their <hi>Treachery:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For <hi>Stafford</hi> now himſelf could do no leſs,</l>
            <l>Than th' horrid <hi>Plot</hi> (ſo long deny'd) Confeſs;</l>
            <l>So plain his <hi>Guilt</hi> did to his <hi>Peers</hi> appear,</l>
            <l>That fill'd him with <hi>Confuſion, Shame,</hi> and <hi>Fear;</hi>
            </l>
            <lg>
               <l>That he could not like a bold <hi>Jeſuit</hi> dye,</l>
               <l>Nor with their <hi>Impudence</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> deny,</l>
               <l>And leave the <hi>VVorld</hi> with a notorious <hi>Lye.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <l>If <hi>pitty</hi> could be unto Traytors due,</l>
            <l>The <hi>VVorld</hi> would give it to your <hi>Age</hi> and You.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Juſtice</hi> for <hi>Example</hi> muſt be done,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Law</hi> like living ſtreams, its courſe muſt run,</l>
            <l>For where 'tis ſtop'd, it ſwells beyond its bounds,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Kingdoms</hi> ſoon with its undation drowns.</l>
            <l>We hope that <hi>Stafford</hi> may his <hi>Crimes</hi> repent,</l>
            <l>And tho' not <hi>Here,</hi> elſe where be <hi>Innocent:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When all his <hi>Earthly Crimes</hi> are purg'd away,</l>
            <l>And he has better learn'd how to obey.</l>
            <l>We'l leave his <hi>Soul</hi> to God, but may he be</l>
            <l>Set for <hi>Example</hi> of foul <hi>Treachery:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That <hi>Traytors</hi> by him, their <hi>Reward</hi> may Read,</l>
            <l>Who ſtill for <hi>Murther,</hi> and for <hi>Treaſon</hi> Bleed.</l>
