            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </list>
            <p>By this means Country Gentlemen may have the benefit of Trade, without Skill or Trouble, and a Stock provided for them alſo, with the probable encreaſe of above 1000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> as an Addition to their preſent 200 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To prove the Premiſes Practicable, it is to be Conſider'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That no Nation can have too much Money: becauſe, as Money encreaſeth, ſo do the Uſes of it, for plenty of Money raiſeth the price of Land, in Rent and Purchaſe. The worth of Land encreaſeth the Expences of Landlords, who are the firſt Perſons to be conſidered in every Country, becauſe, Lords of the Soil, Landlords Expences augment Trade, and Trade Money.</p>
            <p>This appears in comparing <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> with <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lands of which laſt (though of a fruitfull Soil) yield not near ſo much Money <hi>per Ann. per</hi> Acre, as Lands here in <hi>England,</hi> or in <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe they have but little Money, and high Intereſt, never above half a Million in Coin.</p>
            <p>Plenty of Money encreaſeth the number of People, by encreaſe of Buſineſs, and that makes Conſumption, of which, there can be no end, if there be the Means, for Five Men can conſume, if they have the Means, more than Five Hundred that have it not; which likewiſe further appears by the Rich in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Poor in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Izeland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That this Nation hath by far too ſmall a quantity of Money. This cannot be denied, for Taxes are paid with difficulty: Many good Works (acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ſo) lye unattempted: and Land, and moſt of our Native Product fall in value..</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note, That Money, whilſt Hoarded, is of no more Benefit to the Nation, than when in the Mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That Tickets, Tallies, or Bills of Exchange, upon a ſound Fund, are Equal, if not Superior, in Uſe and Value to the beſt Money of Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>This appears by the long practice of Tallies, and the late Borrowing Orders, and Merchants, and Bankers Bills, which laſt, notwithſtanding their uncertain Fund, and frequent Failure, do, for the conveniency of Trade, currently paſs for Money; for none would give Money for their Bills, if they were not judged better, or at leaſt as good.</p>
            <p>And the only reaſon why ſuch common Credit is not at preſent as current as Money, and as willingly received, is, becauſe the Fund is not ſo well known; and becauſe a Twenty Pound Bill cannot be divided into ſmaller Sums; for if it could, there is no doubt, but it would be as current, for they who ſcruple not the Credit of a Twenty Pound Bill, would never boggle at the ſame Credit for a Five-Shilling Bill, if worth the Writing: So that Bills are not received, as is generally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, becauſe they can have Money for them, but they are turn'd into Money, becauſe they cannot be divided, as ſmall Occaſions require, or becauſe the Fund is unknown, or not laſting.</p>
            <p>That the Tickets hereunder Propoſed, will be for the Payment of great Sums, and then the preſent Gold and Silver will the better ſupply ſmaller Payments.</p>
            <p>4. That that Fund is ſufficient for the Credit current upon it, which is able to
<pb facs="tcp:98658:2"/>
call it all back within the limited time; and if we have Land Security ſettled by Parliament, to pay every Bill in time, none can be a looſer by receiving them, being till then current.</p>
            <p>5. That a Mortgage Deed, were there a Regiſter, would be as transferable as Gold and Silver in Trade, and in Uſe and Value by much preferable to Money, or Bankers Bills, for none now refuſe the Aſſignment of a good Mortgage, that have Money enough, and want it not for ſmaller Sums; but it would be much better, if transfer'd without Charge and Formalities.</p>
            <p>That the Tickets of Credit intended to be propoſed, are to be as Regiſtred Mortgages by a publick Sanction, and as transferable as Money without Charge or Trouble, and leſs ſubject to be Counterfeited.</p>
            <p>That ſuch a Fund ſettled by Act of Parliament, upon the Eſtates of ſuch private Perſons as are willing to be Engaged, cannot, till all the Tickets Charged upon them are paid off, be alter'd by any change of Government, or future Parliaments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a total Diſſolution of all Titles; this being a private Contract, confirm'd by a Publick Act, upon particular Eſtates, for Payment of Tickets diſperſed amongſt the People in General.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Advantages of this Propoſal are, briefly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Church, by augmenting of Tythes.</p>
            <p>To the King by encreaſe of Cuſtoms, and Exciſe, and Shares in the Stock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>To the Government, by the Loan of a Million upon this Tax at 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and and ſo from time to time for Three or Four Years, if there be Occaſion.</p>
            <p>To the Nation by an enlarged Trade, and encreaſe of People in General, and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Particular.</p>
            <p>To the Lords, Gentry, and other Free-holders by this enhauncing the value of their Eſtates both by Fine or In-come, Rent, Purchaſe, and Trade.</p>
            <p>To the Judges and Lawyers, by ſettling of Titles.</p>
            <p>To the People in General, by improving their reſpective Trades and Dealings, and enabling them to pay their Taxes; and by adding in a manner, ſo many new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to the Nation equal to Land.</p>
            <p>And all this without the leaſt Dammage to any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A ſhort account of the Cauſes of the Miſcarriages of former attempts, for a <hi>Fiſhing</hi> Trade, and of the manner, of preventing the like for the Future, by the following Method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vaſt Summs of Money have been expended, endeavouring to Erect and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Fiſhery, ſo as to make it a National Good, as well as gainful to the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers. Theſe Endeavours have been hitherto vain, being as often Defeated as Attempted. Nor can the like Deſign, on the ſame Baſis, ever in Future times, but find an equal diſappointment; And that for the following Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <list>
               <item>1. Becauſe the conſtant, beſide contingent Charges of a Company (as hitherto founded) is and muſt neceſſarily be a very great expence and burthen to the Stock or Fund: And yet the Profit hazardous and uncertain.</item>
               <item>2. For that we are to contend for the Exporting, which is the Grand and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Trade, with thoſe more experienced than our ſelves, thoſe that can build, and ſail cheaper, that pay leſs Intereſt, and are content with leſs Profit.</item>
               <item>3. Thoſe that can carry their Fiſh cheaper to a Forraign Market, will ſell to profit; while others, hoping for a time to anſwer the Coſt, keep their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity till it periſhes and is loſt.</item>
               <item>4. That the knowing and skilful men in a Company, (perceiving early that the Trade will not turn to account) ſell out at the beſt Rate they can: to whom ignorant men Succeding, perfect, and haſten the Ruin of it.</item>
