         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As certainly, as if both Name and Picture, with a <hi>Nos quoque floruimus,</hi> — had been ſet to the Title-page of it. It hath ſo much of his Likeneſs as to own the Father, and ſo reſembles others of his <hi>undoubted</hi> and <hi>declared Off-ſprings,</hi> as to leave no room for heſitancy about it, to any one that is but a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with his Way and Writings. — But to ſatisfy the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that I have not wrong'd him, I will ſuggeſt ſome matters here of eaſy obſervation.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt</hi>; I note in the <hi>General</hi> the <hi>Imperious Stile of the Man,</hi> aſſuming to himſelf as Head of the Non-conforming Brotherhood, ſpeaking in their Name, and upon every occaſion, charging and counſelling of them. But more peculiarly I obſerve, what he tells us of himſelf, [<hi>Apt to ſpeak ſharply againſt the Humors and Weakneſs of Religious People:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 126.</note>] Which is a Commendation hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be given to <hi>any other</hi> of the Way beſides.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly</hi>; What think you of this? In the Preface to his <hi>Cure of Church-diviſions,</hi> he hath it thus: <q>[If the Fierceneſs of any contradict what I ſay, I only add, that it is not an <hi>unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> Perſon that ſpeaketh it; and one who through the Mercy of God hath long kept a <hi>numerous Flock,</hi> in <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>

And,
<q>[I can confidently ſay, that when I had a Paſtoral Charge, where I needed many Aſſiſtants, if I had known where that Man lived, whom the People would have loved,<note place="margin">☞</note> honoured, and profited by <hi>more than my ſelf,</hi> I would have <hi>rid night and day</hi> to get him to be the Man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And yet for all that, it ſeems he needed not to have rid <hi>many Miles</hi> neither; for it follows immediately:
<q>— [And when I have heard my <hi>Neighbour-Miniſters,</hi>

<q>hindring them from following the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of wiſer and more experienced Men.

                  <q>— [Till the <hi>new Doctrine</hi> about Infants was brought into the <hi>new Rubrick.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☞</note>]</q>
If you differ not at all from the <hi>old Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>old Rubrick,</hi> as you would ſeem to tell us, there needs no queſtion about the <hi>new</hi>; for let us view them well together.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Old Rubrick</hi> thus:
<q>That no Man ſhall think, that any Detriment ſhall come to Children, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of their Confirmation: he ſhall know for a Truth, that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by God's Word, that Children, being baptized, have all things neceſſary for their Salvation, and be undoubtedly ſaved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>New</hi> more ſhortly, thus:
<q>It is certain by God's Word, that Children which are baptized, dying before they commit actual Sin, are undoubtedly ſaved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Where indeed the <hi>Preface</hi> of the former is omitted, but nothing is taught for a Truth, <hi>certain by God</hi>'s <hi>Word,</hi> but what was ſo acknowledged before: For the Omiſſion of that one Clauſe, [<hi>have all things neceſſary to their Salvation,</hi>] is ſufficiently included in, [<hi>are undoubtedly ſaved</hi>]: and the inſerting that other, [<hi>dying before they commit actual Sin</hi>] tends rather to <hi>reſtrain,</hi> than to enlarge the Propoſition, as the impartial Obſerver will eaſily judg.</p>
               <p>And yet, forſooth, this <hi>new Doctrine,</hi> as he ſlanders it, ſticks much with them, who avouch themſelves not to differ at all from the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> till that <hi>new Rubrick</hi> which contains it, was introduced. And here is the Sum of his <hi>Doctrinal Corruptions,</hi> in the Plural Number,<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> which we had mention of before. And he hath yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fling</hi> at it before the end.
<q>[I read in the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> of ſomething about Infants <hi>certain by the Word of God</hi>;<note place="margin">Pag. 75.</note> but I never read, in what Chapter or Verſe it was.]</q>
Now muſt he not evidently affirm as much of the <hi>Old,</hi> if he agree unto it, as he would be thought to do? Is it not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48290:30"/>
there as expreſs, <hi>He ſhall know for a Truth, that it is certain by the Word of God?</hi> Is not that <hi>Fanatick Exception,</hi> every whit as pertinent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable there? ['But I never heard in what Chapter or Verſe it was] What need of this, I pray, to either? What Chapter or Verſe? As if Scripture Sence and Conſequences were not as truly the Word of God, as Scripture-Words, and expreſs Aſſertions? That which is there <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeticè,</hi> as well as that which is there <hi>axiomaticè,</hi> as ſome love to ſpeak. Or as if Holy Scripture were not, before Chapter and Verſe were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in it. — But this is the doughty way of arguing, which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have furniſhed the other Sects withal againſt themſelves: <hi>What Chapter and Verſe ſaith ſo and ſo?</hi> And this great Rebuker of other Sectaries, ſeems mightily taken himſelf with it.<note place="margin">Pag. 75.</note>
                  <q>[What Chapter and Verſe ſaith, that only <hi>Subſcribers, Swearers, Declarers,</hi> and <hi>Conformers,</hi> are the Church of Chriſt; and thoſe that <hi>fear an Oath and Conformity,</hi> are none of it?]</q>
