         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS so <hi>Unusual</hi> a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,</hi>
to make a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of your Quality a
<hi>Judge</hi> in a Philosophical
Controversie, that it will be <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd</hi>
at by those who do not know
you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, I fear, scarce Accepted by
your self. Such Studies do so seldom
colour with the Profession of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that He must be much <hi>rais'd</hi>
above the <hi>Common,</hi> who can merit
the Esteem of being fit for such an
Umpirage. To be held, not only a
<hi>Lover</hi> of Learning, but a <hi>Discerner</hi>
too in that <hi>Highest</hi> Sort of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
is such a <hi>Starry Embellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to a Noble Extraction, and
sets such a <hi>Deep Stamp</hi> of Honour
upon it, that it gives a <hi>Double Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
of Excellency to such Illustrious
Persons, and <hi>ranks</hi> them in the <hi>First</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100531:3"/>
               <hi>File</hi> of <hi>Heroes.</hi> In the Time of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
when the <hi>Roman</hi> Learning
was in its <hi>Zenith,</hi> such Famous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
might have been easily met
with; but they are so Rare <hi>now-a-days,</hi>
that they seem <hi>Uncouth,</hi> and
look like <hi>Monsters:</hi> And such, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
they are, in <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Phrase;
that is, <hi>Monsters of Perfection.</hi>
Great Men do generally, <hi>now,</hi> so <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue</hi>
Learning, and 'tis so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicably-Little</hi>
in their Eye, as if
they took a <hi>View</hi> of it at the <hi>Wrong</hi>
End of the <hi>Prospective.</hi> The Noble
Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> the Honourable
Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and some few others,
have rescu'd the <hi>Universality</hi> of their
<hi>Peers</hi> from this Imputation: But,
now that they have left us, <hi>such</hi>
Personages are so very <hi>thin-sown,</hi>
that, for any thing we see, there are
but Few left, besides your self, who
give us any Prospect of keeping alive
a <hi>Succession</hi> of Men, endow'd with
that <hi>Renowned Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100531:3"/>
Yet, <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> are
such <hi>Ignoble</hi> Blemishes, that KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE,
<hi>in Common,</hi> does still up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it self, with the Generality of
Mankind, in a <hi>Fair Esteem:</hi> But,
this Thing, call'd [PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY,]
looks like such a <hi>Bug-bear</hi> to
most of our Modern Great Ones, that
the very <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Sound</hi> of it
puts them in a Marvellous <hi>Fright;</hi>
whence, 'tis no wonder Men <hi>do not
love,</hi> or esteem <hi>Amiable,</hi> what they
<hi>fear,</hi> and look upon as <hi>Hideous.</hi>
Whereas, indeed, the Study of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
is no more but the <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of our <hi>Reason,</hi> (by which we
are <hi>Men,)</hi> in <hi>Reading,</hi> and (to a
fair Degree) <hi>Understanding</hi> the
Book of the World; or, in Knowing
those Things, with which, whether
we will or no, we <hi>must</hi> Converse,
and be Concern'd <hi>daily.</hi> Certainly,
their Palate is much <hi>out of Taste,</hi>
who cannot <hi>relish</hi> a <hi>Benefit</hi> so <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
to our <hi>Soul;</hi> but think it below
<pb facs="tcp:100531:4"/>
the Station of a <hi>Gentleman, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi>
it. I could wish such Men
would please to reflect upon <hi>what</hi>
kind of Objects their Thoughts and
Affections are <hi>employ'd,</hi> while they
<hi>neglect</hi> This. I believe it would
<hi>shame</hi> their <hi>Choice,</hi> if they duly
consider'd what <hi>Empty Toys</hi> they
pursu'd, and <hi>preferr'd</hi> before this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid</hi>
and <hi>Substantial</hi> Good. PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOSOPHY,
truly such, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, is far from being such a
<hi>Frightful Thing</hi> as their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
paints it; being only <hi>Plain,</hi>
Natural Reason, <hi>Polish'd, Better'd</hi>
and <hi>Elevated</hi> by <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Reflexion:</hi>
So that they who check at the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> ought, with
much better Reason, find fault with
the Teaching Persons of Quality to
<hi>Sing, Dance</hi> or <hi>Play on the Lute:</hi>
Unless they think it very <hi>Prudent,</hi> and
<hi>Expedient,</hi> to give our <hi>Voice, Feet</hi>
and <hi>Fingers</hi> the best Advantages we
can, to perform their Actions <hi>artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100531:4"/>
and <hi>exactly;</hi> but, that 'tis
a very <hi>Needless Folly</hi> to perfect the
<hi>Knowing</hi> Power of our <hi>Soul;</hi> and
wondrous <hi>Wise,</hi> to let it still <hi>doze</hi>
on sluggishly, in its Home-spun <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Rudeness,</hi> and lie wholly <hi>Uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated.</hi>
Nay, such Gentlemen would
be much offended their Houses should
not be <hi>clean Swept,</hi> and <hi>Garnish'd;</hi>
yet, they are not, in the least, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
that <hi>Cobwebs</hi> should hang in
the Windows of their <hi>Intellect,</hi> and
<hi>Dusty Ignorance dim</hi> and <hi>blear</hi> the
<hi>Sight</hi> of the Noble Inhabitant.</p>
            <p>But, where is this Philosophy all
this while? Or, Is there, indeed,
any such Thing in Nature? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Glorious Attributes some have
given it, they all Agree in this,
that it is the <hi>Knowledge of Truth:</hi>
If so, then, as <hi>Truth</hi> can be but
<hi>One,</hi> so it should follow, that <hi>

               <hi>Pretended;</hi> and, consequently, in
reality, <hi>Fabulous,</hi> and <hi>Erroneous.</hi>
Where, then, shall we certainly find
this <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>only-True</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy?
Multitudes of Sects did, of
old, <hi>set up</hi> to drive the <hi>Trade</hi> and
Profession of Philosophizing: But,
they all <hi>Broke,</hi> and <hi>shut up Shop,</hi>
having but a very few <hi>Chance-Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers;</hi>
except that Great Man,
(whom St. <hi>Hierome</hi> calls, <hi>Ingenii
Humani Finis,) ARISTOTLE.</hi>
He, I say, alone, has got <hi>Quiet
Possession</hi> of the Schools, for a long
time; and, ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> now strengthen'd his
Title, by an <hi>Immemorial Prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption:</hi>
Nor did any Pretender of
Note put in his Claim against him, till,
in our Days, the admirably-Ingenious
<hi>CARTESIUS</hi> declared himself
his <hi>Competitor.</hi> Till then, <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
being drawn into different Senses,
by his Many-minded Commentators
amongst the Modern School-men, those
Men who were of Sharp Wits, and
<pb facs="tcp:100531:5"/>
hated <hi>jurare in verba—</hi> were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to turn <hi>Scepticks;</hi> and began to
think that Truth was either <hi>flown to
Heaven</hi> in <hi>Astraea</hi>'s Coach; or, (as
some Antients thought,) was <hi>in puteo
defossa;</hi> or else, if she were <hi>above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground,</hi>
that she was sequester'd in
some Terrestrial <hi>Paradise;</hi> so that
none could get Knowledge of her <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,</hi>
or <hi>come at her.</hi> In this
juncture, to rescue the Flower of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
from falling into perfect Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism,
and to encourage them still to
hope for Truth in Philosophy, there
arose, very opportunely, those Great
Men, <hi>Thomas Albius,</hi> Sir <hi>Kenelm
Digby,</hi> and <hi>Cartesius;</hi> who were,
all of them, in a manner Contemporary:
All of them promis'd <hi>Science,</hi> which
kept up those Men's drooping Spirits
from <hi>Despair of Truth.</hi> The former
Two of these, in many of their main
Principles, declar'd themselves <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelians;</hi>
as also did those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
<hi>their</hi> Philosophy: Whereas, <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100531:6"/>
ravell'd <hi>all</hi> the Schemes hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
woven by <hi>others,</hi> moulded <hi>all</hi> the
World in a <hi>New Frame;</hi> and set up
for his <hi>Single Self,</hi> without any <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner.</hi>
By which you see, Sir, that
your Task, which seem'd at first so
Vast, and Endless, is reduc'd, and
confin'd to this <hi>One Enquiry; viz.</hi>
to determin (in your <hi>own Thoughts</hi>
at least, whether you think fit to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Sentence,</hi> or no) which Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>viz. these</hi> Followers of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
or of <hi>Cartesius,</hi> are <hi>True Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</hi>
On which side soever the Lot
falls, it follows of course, that, since
they contradict one another, the <hi>Other,</hi>
let them Talk and Write as long as
they will, are, in reality, <hi>None.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still you will complain, that even
<hi>This</hi> is <hi>beyond</hi> the Extent of your
Narrow Province, and <hi>exceeds</hi> the
<hi>Purlew</hi> of your Reading, and Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too. But I dare assure you, Sir,
that this present Debate is of that
nature, that it requires no more to
<pb facs="tcp:100531:6"/>
Decide it, than a Fair Stock of Clear
and Penetrative <hi>Natural Reason;</hi>
in which your <hi>Discerning Genius</hi>
(besides what <hi>Acquisition</hi> may have
added to it) is well known to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding,</hi>
and no way <hi>Deficient.</hi>
To perform this, there needs no <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous</hi>
and <hi>Tedious</hi> Turning over
all the <hi>Books</hi> writ by both Parties,
or Scanning the <hi>Force</hi> of their <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
Providence would be wanting
to Mankind, were there <hi>no other</hi> Way
than <hi>this</hi> left us, to know where <hi>Truth</hi>
is to be <hi>found:</hi> Nor would Man's Life
be <hi>long enough</hi> for such an <hi>Endless</hi>
Task. I know not what <hi>Untoward
Ways</hi> Men, who love <hi>much Talk,</hi>
have fram'd to themselves, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into the World: But, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the GOD of <hi>Truth,</hi> who envies
not to Mankind his Best Natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<hi>Exact Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>True
Science,</hi> has furnish'd us with a <hi>more
Compendious,</hi> and <hi>more Sure Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi>
if we will but follow it: Which
<pb facs="tcp:100531:7"/>
is, to examin <hi>which</hi> Party, <hi>what</hi>
Book, <hi>what</hi> Discourse has <hi>Right</hi>
PRINCIPLES; and, which <hi>not.</hi>
If two Mathematicians <hi>follow</hi> their
<hi>Principles,</hi> and yet <hi>differ</hi> in their
<hi>Conclusions,</hi> we may be sure the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Principles of one of them are
<hi>no</hi> Principles <hi>at all:</hi> And the <hi>same,</hi>
for the same reason, holds in <hi>all other</hi>
Sciences. But, how shall we know who
has True, or <hi>Right Principles?</hi> Most
easily, by Examining the FIRST
PRINCIPLES either Side pretends
to. For, if the <hi>First Principles</hi> may be
Fallacious, and, consequently, <hi>None;</hi>
then the <hi>Second Principles,</hi> which
<hi>depend</hi> on the <hi>First,</hi> can be <hi>none</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and, so, they will be unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
convinc'd to have <hi>no Kind of
Principles at all.</hi> Nor is it possible
for any Man to be Ignorant, whether
the <hi>First Principles,</hi> or <hi>First Truths,</hi>
which are to be the RULE of knowing
<hi>all other Truths,</hi> be <hi>truly such;</hi>
because <hi>These</hi> must be <hi>Self-evident,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100531:7"/>
most <hi>Firmly Grounded, Unmistaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and <hi>necessarily Assented to,</hi> by
<hi>All Mankind;</hi> as is demonstrated in
the Following Treatise; and, indeed,
is Evident by <hi>Common Reason.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
If either Side would pass upon us
<hi>Gratuitous,</hi> or <hi>Unprov'd Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi>
for <hi>Principles;</hi> or decline the
Way of <hi>Connexion</hi> of our Simple Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
in which all <hi>Truth</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
consists; and, without which, all
Discourses must be necessarily <hi>Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:</hi>
Lastly, If the RULE <hi>of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Truth</hi> which One Party assigns, be
such, that even Learned Men may be
<hi>Mistaken,</hi> and <hi>Deceiv'd,</hi> while they
think they <hi>follow it;</hi> in all these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
I say, 'tis <hi>Incontestably Evident,</hi>
that that Party are <hi>no Philsophers:</hi>
nor can know <hi>any thing at all,</hi> if <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
be not Kinder to them, than their
own <hi>Unprincipl'd</hi> Doctrine.</p>
            <p>You see, Sir, by this time, that a
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> endow'd with a <hi>far less</hi>
Perfection of Understanding than your
<pb facs="tcp:100531:8"/>
self is Master of, may, by these Tests,
determin, who <hi>are</hi> True Philosophers,
who <hi>not:</hi> As also, how all <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>
in Philosophy may be easily <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi>
how all Occasions of Wrangling
about <hi>particular</hi> Tenets, may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and, lastly, how the <hi>Fiercest Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers,</hi>
if they really seek after <hi>Truth,</hi>
may be <hi>Reconcil'd,</hi> and <hi>Satisfy'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the Business of this following
Paper, to let you into the Certain
Knowledge, what Kind of Propositions
are the <hi>First Principles,</hi> and the
<hi>Rule of Knowing all Truth</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
The <hi>First Step</hi> we take into
our <hi>Inmost</hi> Thoughts, we meet with
and discover these <hi>Primary Truths:</hi>
whose <hi>Self-Evidence</hi> is the <hi>Earliest
Light</hi> that <hi>dawns</hi> to our Soul, as soon
as over her <hi>Power</hi> of Knowing <hi>awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens</hi>
into <hi>Action.</hi> 'Tis a Subject, tho'
<hi>most</hi> Necessary, and of the <hi>highest</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
yet <hi>neglected</hi> by Writers hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.
Two or three have, indeed,
<hi>spoken</hi> of it; but, none I know of, has
<pb facs="tcp:100531:8"/>
handl'd it <hi>professedly,</hi> and <hi>at large.</hi>
Tho' it be <hi>Dry,</hi> and requires <hi>Chawing</hi>
ere it becomes <hi>Nutritive;</hi> yet, I dare
presume, it is <hi>Solid,</hi> and not at all
<hi>Windy.</hi> Even, <hi>Seeds,</hi> when first
planted, are <hi>Dry;</hi> which, yet, hinders
them not from yielding a <hi>Large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi>
afterwards: The First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are the <hi>Seeds</hi> of all <hi>Truths;</hi>
which, by how much their <hi>Roots</hi> are
laid <hi>Deeper,</hi> so much <hi>Higher</hi> they
Rear and Extend their <hi>Branches.</hi> The
Present I offer you, is <hi>Small;</hi> but the
Little it contains, (as far as concerns
this Subject,) is wrought entirely out
of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Reflected Reason,</hi>
without being beholding at all to the
Dishonourable Task of <hi>Transcribing;</hi>
as some Pieces, I could name, are. I
dare undertake, that the Reasons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
here, are so <hi>firmly Grounded,</hi>
that they can fear no Opposition but
<hi>Drollery,</hi> the last Effort of <hi>Nonplust
Reason.</hi> You will not expect <hi>Fine
Language,</hi> in a Matter that cannot
<pb facs="tcp:100531:9"/>
bear it. <hi>Self-Evidence</hi> is so <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Luminous,</hi> that nothing can make
it <hi>more Glossy:</hi> Nor is all the <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>
in the World able to do these
<hi>First Truths</hi> any Service at all: All
Attempts to <hi>burnish</hi> or <hi>varnish</hi> them,
do, instead of doing this, <hi>dawb</hi> and
<hi>hide</hi> them; as <hi>Painting</hi> does a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Beauty.</hi> The Sum is; The whole
Controversie, now agitated, is this;
Whether of these two Philosophies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid
is built on <hi>more Evident
Principles;</hi> or, has a <hi>more</hi> Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and Unmistakable <hi>RULE</hi> of
<hi>Knowing;</hi> And, your <hi>Steady,</hi> and
<hi>Equally-poiz'd</hi> Iudgment, is request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>hold the Scales.</hi> What the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle</hi>
I here send you, <hi>wants</hi> in <hi>Worth,</hi>
is, I am sure, abundantly <hi>supply'd</hi> by
the <hi>sincere Respects,</hi> which are, at
the same time, presented you by,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Much Honoured SIR,</salute>

               <salute>
                  <hi>Honoured</hi> SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>1. I Give you many Thanks for
your kind Visit. Had you
known how welcome it was,
I am confident you would
have accepted my kind Invitation,
and have gratify'd my Request that
you would repeat it often. But your
exceeding Modesty and Civility, did,
it seems, fear that might be a <hi>Trouble,</hi>
which, I do heartily assure you, was
esteem'd by me as a high <hi>Favour.</hi> Of
which I thought I could give you no
better Testimony, than by letting you
see that I am not willing that small
Scantling of your Conversation you
then allow'd me, should be lost.
Wherefore, I thought it not amiss to
give you a Rehearsal of it, as far as
my Memory reaches at such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
and withal, my Sentiments of
the several Particulars then touch'd
upon; what my First Thoughts of them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100531:10"/>
were <hi>then,</hi> and my Second Thoughts
<hi>since:</hi> Not debarring myself the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of adding some farther Reflexions
that occurr'd to me, while I was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this Paper; because the Treating
of <hi>many</hi> Things <hi>confusedly,</hi> ere any <hi>one</hi>
was concluded, made the Tenour of
our Conference <hi>Uneven,</hi> and <hi>Shatter'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
For, in Discoursing of Principles, a
<hi>Slow</hi> Pace is the <hi>Surest;</hi> and, when
<hi>Wit</hi> is too <hi>Nimble,</hi> it hazards to <hi>lame
Reason</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> to <hi>keep pace</hi>
with it.</p>
            <p>2. I must confess, Dear Sir, That
when I heard you discourse, you did
it so ingeniously in the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Way
of Wit, which consists in <hi>Explicating</hi>
and <hi>Doubting,</hi> and seems to exclude
<hi>Proving,</hi> that I did not see how the
Great <hi>Cartesius</hi> himself could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
his Doctrine better: For, he
could not have <hi>Doubted</hi> more scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
than you did; nor, I think,
have <hi>Explicated</hi> himself more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously.
You <hi>guarded</hi> his Doctrine so
warily, that it was scarce possible to
<hi>attack</hi> it. Tho', that I may not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you, I cannot say you did this by
the <hi>Evidence</hi> of any Proposition you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100531:10"/>
               <hi>Advanc'd,</hi> but by your <hi>Ready Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
against any thing that Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
could <hi>oppose;</hi> at least, taking them
as manag'd by one no better skill'd
than I am. Your Cause seem'd to me,
as if it had been secur'd in some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle;
made Impregnable, not by means
of the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Methods of Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
us'd in <hi>Lawful</hi> War; but, (which
is against the <hi>Old Laws</hi> of Arms,) by
a kind of <hi>Enchantment.</hi> Your Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks,
Entrenchments and Redoubts
lay so cunningly <hi>hid</hi> in your Way of
<hi>Ideas,</hi> that they were altogether <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;</hi>
so that the most quick-sighted
Engineer living could not <hi>discern</hi>
them, or take any <hi>sure Aim</hi> at them:
Much less such a Dull Eye as mine;
who, tho' I bend my Sight as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and steadily as I am able, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
for my Heart, see what kind of
Things those <hi>Spiritual Ideas</hi> are. And,
which leaves me in a helpless Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as to that Particular, such very
Ingenious <hi>Cartesians</hi> as Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi>
who, having por'd so long upon them,
should be best acquainted with them,
and therefore best qualified to inform
me <hi>what they are,</hi> gives me no Account
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100531:11"/>
of them; unless we can think there
may be such Things as are made up of
<hi>Contradictions,</hi> and altogether <hi>Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
As you may see in the 2d <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
of my <hi>Ideae Cartesianae Expensae,
§§.</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>3. Now, Sir, This looks like a kind
of <hi>Rosycrucianism</hi> in Philosophy, to
build all your Doctrine on <hi>Ideas,</hi> and
yet keep the <hi>Secret</hi> among your selves,
and <hi>conceal</hi> from us <hi>what</hi> those same
Ideas <hi>are.</hi> Indeed, our Doctrine, which
makes our <hi>Notions,</hi> Conceptions, or
Simple Apprehensions, to be <hi>the very
Things objectively in our Understanding,</hi>
seems very Abstruse to those who
guide themselves by <hi>Fancy,</hi> and not
by <hi>Connexion of Terms;</hi> in regard it
depends on the Manner of Operating
proper to <hi>Spiritual Natures;</hi> which is
above our Common Speculation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Natural</hi> Subjects, and is only
reachable by those who are well vers'd
in <hi>Metaphysicks:</hi> Yet, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I tell you plainly <hi>(Preliminary 2d.)
what</hi> these Notions <hi>are:</hi> I explicate
them fully, so that none can doubt
what I mean by them: Nay, more;
I bring there many (at least pretended)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100531:11"/>
               <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> to <hi>prove</hi> they <hi>must</hi> be
such; none of which Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>
(if he do, indeed, differ from me in that
Point) has thought fit to solve. This
being so, you would very much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me, if you would help me to the
sight of any <hi>Cartesian</hi> Author, who
has so clearly and candidly given us
his Thoughts concerning your <hi>Ideas;</hi>
who has fully <hi>explain'd</hi> their Nature,
<hi>defin'd</hi> them, and attempted to <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi>
they <hi>must be such.</hi> Which if
it be not done, all other Sorts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
in the World have reason
to complain that they are very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dealt with. For your Method calls
into Doubt, in a manner, <hi>all</hi> the Ways
of Knowing held by Mankind, till
<hi>Cartesius</hi>'s Time: And you would have
us renounce all our former Judgments,
and accept nothing for Certain, but
what appears to us by <hi>your Way</hi> of
IDEAS; and yet you will not give us
a Clear and Distinct Knowledge, <hi>what
your Ideas are,</hi> nor <hi>demonstrate</hi> them to
be <hi>such</hi> as you would have us believe
them to be: Without which, perhaps
there are no such Things as those <hi>Ideas</hi>
of yours; nor, consequently, is your
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100531:12"/>
               <hi>Way</hi> of Philosophy, building all our
Science upon such <hi>Ideas,</hi> any Way <hi>at
all.</hi> But, to return to our Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>4. Foreseeing I should not be able
to give Satisfaction to your Acute Wit,
without beginning from the very Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-Ground
of all Truth, (to do
which my own Genius also inclin'd
me,) I alledg'd, That it was manifest
we could neither speak <hi>True</hi> nor <hi>False,</hi>
without <hi>Affirming,</hi> or <hi>Denying,</hi> (which
we use to call <hi>Formal Truth;)</hi> and
therefore, that Truth was no where
to be found, but in such Speeches as
were <hi>Affirmative,</hi> or <hi>Negative:</hi> Which
kind of Speeches Logicians call <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</hi>
Also, That all <hi>Truth,</hi> if Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively
express'd, consists in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi>
of the two main Parts of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
which Logicians call, its
<hi>Terms,</hi> or <hi>Extremes;</hi> and that, for the
same reason, if those <hi>Terms</hi> were <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected,</hi>
the Proposition was <hi>False.</hi>
I flatter'd my self, you would become
Convinc'd <hi>thus far;</hi> the <hi>Ground</hi> I built
on being <hi>Unavoidable,</hi> my <hi>Deductions</hi>
thence <hi>Immediate,</hi> and the <hi>Consequence</hi>
Clear and <hi>Undeniable.</hi> But you were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100531:12"/>
too hard for me in your <hi>Doubting</hi>
Way: For, you gave some small Stop
to my Proceeding, by your Dis-like
of the Word <hi>[Proposition]</hi> as savouring
of the Way of the Schools. This a
little surpriz'd me: For, I conceiv'd,
that since <hi>Words</hi> were only intended to
signifie our <hi>Meanings,</hi> there could be
no Reason why the <hi>Word</hi> should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
any, so it was declar'd what was
<hi>meant</hi> by it; which, the <hi>Common U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage</hi>
of it by Philosophers, for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Centuries, had, I thought, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
manifested, and warranted.
This gave me Occasion to explain my
self; and to declare, that I meant no
more by the Word <hi>[Proposition,]</hi> but
<hi>A Speech that Affirms, or Denies.</hi> I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
That therefore, such Speeches, if
<hi>Affirmative,</hi> (and the same, <hi>mutatis
mutandis,</hi> is to be said of <hi>Negative</hi>
ones,) must consist of something <hi>that
is Affirm'd,</hi> something <hi>of which, is Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,</hi>
and some Word <hi>which Affirms</hi>
or expresses the <hi>Affirmation.</hi> Which
three Parts of a Proposition, Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
agree to call <hi>Predicate, Subject,</hi>
and <hi>Copula.</hi> These plainest. First Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
I was forcd to begin with;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100531:13"/>
not out of any Apprehension you did
not know them; but, out of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you would admit the <hi>Words,</hi> after
such an Explanation of them; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
otherwise, I should want Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
to discourse with you, in a
Subject of this nature.</p>
            <p>5. What follow'd immediately, I
do not certainly remember; but I
think it was, That you excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that whole <hi>Artificial</hi> Way of
Discoursing; and made account there
was a <hi>more Compendious Method,</hi> or
<hi>Shorter Cut</hi> to Science: Which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
was, by Contemplating your
<hi>Ideas;</hi> by which you hop'd to arrive
at Truth, by the <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct</hi>
Appearance of it to your Mind. To
defend our Method, I alledg'd, That
it was the <hi>Way of Nature,</hi> tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by <hi>Art;</hi> as all our other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Faculties and Operations are.
That all <hi>Art,</hi> if it be Solid, and not
<hi>Fantastick,</hi> is nothing but a <hi>Deeper</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
into Plain, Honest <hi>Nature,</hi>
made by the Reflexion of our Mind.
That such Mental Speeches and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
and each Part of them, (as
was shewn lately,) were in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100531:13"/>
of all Mankind, when
they do <hi>conceive,</hi> or intend to <hi>speak</hi>
any Truth, or Falshood. That all the
Discourses about a Syllogism, made
by True Logick, (which is nothing
but Exact Reflexion upon what passes
in every Man's Mind, <hi>naturally,)</hi> is
nothing but the <hi>Dissecting</hi> an Evident
or Conclusive Discourse, made by our
<hi>Natural</hi> Faculty of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> into all
its Parts; the <hi>Placing</hi> those Parts best,
in order to <hi>Clearness;</hi> and the Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Wires,</hi> (the First
Principles of our Understanding,)
which are, as it were, th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Main

               </gap> give
Strength and Vigour to such a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
And the same may be said of
a Proposition, both as to its P<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s, and
the <hi>Connexion</hi> or <hi>Identity</hi> of its two
Terms, (the Subject, and Pr<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>icate,)
in which consists its <hi>Truth:</hi> A<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> which,

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cularly,
in the Second and Third Books of my
METHOD <hi>to</hi> SCIENCE. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
Because I saw, your Prejudice
against our Way was taken from the
Insignificant <hi>Iargon</hi> of some of our
School-men, I take leave to add, that,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100531:14"/>
let others talk as superficially of those
Matters as they please, and disparage
the true <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> by mis-mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
it, and making it look Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick;
yet I am not conscious to my
self, that I have any thing in my <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi>
but what is entirely built on the
<hi>Nature of the Thing</hi> in hand; I mean,
<hi>Notions, Propositions,</hi> and <hi>Rational Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi>
found in the Minds of <hi>all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi>
Which Way of Building on the
<hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> of which we are
speaking, is the <hi>only Ground</hi> that can
give <hi>Solidity</hi> to <hi>any</hi> Discourse: At least,
I am sure, that, if I have any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there, which has any <hi>other</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I shall renounce it, as swerving
from my <hi>Method,</hi> and my <hi>Intention:</hi>
And I do candidly here declare, that
I am oblig'd, either to bring a <hi>more
Solid</hi> Proof for that Point, or I ought
not to expect it should be well receiv'd
by any Man of Learning. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, I have that good Opinion of
your Equity, that you will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
discard a Way which is <hi>thus</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to approve it self to be <hi>Solid,</hi> and
to subsist by Arguments built on the
Firm Ground of <hi>the Nature of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100531:14"/>
Thing,</hi> because some slight Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers
of it have us'd it <hi>triflingly.</hi>
Nor would you think it reasonable,
that the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Hypothesis should be
quite rejected, upon no other Reason,
but because you think some late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have not done it the Right they
ought.</p>
            <p>6. In order to your <hi>Clear and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Perception,</hi> which you therefore
judg'd to be the <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Test</hi> of all
Truth, because we cannot but <hi>Assent</hi>
to that, <hi>as True,</hi> which we <hi>Clearly and
Distinctly see</hi> to be so, I make these
Preliminary Remarks. 1. That this is
the main Hinge of all the <hi>Cartesian</hi>
Hypothesis, which persuades them to
place the <hi>Ground of Truth</hi> within their
<hi>own Minds,</hi> and its <hi>Productions;</hi> and
not in the <hi>Things themselves.</hi> 2. That
this is the most Ingenious and Plausible
Conception, which the Great Wit of
<hi>Cartesius</hi> ever advanc'd; and therefore
it most deserves Clearing: Which is,
indeed, one main Reason why I strain'd
Courtesie a little, in publishing this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
3. That the Plausibility of it lies
chiefly in this, That every Man must
grant the <hi>Truth</hi> of that Proposition, as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100531:15"/>
it lies: For, Who can deny, but that
what I <hi>see</hi> to <hi>be True, is True?</hi> This
being full as Evident, as that I <hi>cannot see</hi>
what <hi>is not.</hi> This, then, is a plain
Truth, and might deserve the Name
of a <hi>Subordinate Rule;</hi> were it <hi>Certain,</hi>
or <hi>prov'd</hi> first, that we could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be <hi>Mistaken</hi> in thinking we <hi>have</hi>
a <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct</hi> Perception of a
Thing, when we have it <hi>not.</hi> Mr. <hi>Le
Grand</hi> confesses, this may happen when
the Will is Byass'd, or Men are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful;
(and how frequent is that?)
And we shall give many Instances af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
how we are deceiv'd in <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other</hi> Occasions. 4. That this <hi>Clear</hi>
and <hi>Distinct</hi> Perception, the <hi>Cartesians</hi>
so much speak of, and value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon, tho' the <hi>Expression</hi> be <hi>New,</hi>
is no more in reality, but <hi>Perfect Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of an Object:</hi> For, the seeing any
Object <hi>Clearly,</hi> is the seeing it <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently;</hi>
nor can we see <hi>It</hi> evidently, if
<hi>that</hi> Object, or <hi>It,</hi> be <hi>Confounded</hi> with
<hi>others,</hi> and not seen to be <hi>Distinct</hi> from
them. Wherefore, this Phrase, of
<hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct Perception</hi> is a meer
<hi>Amuzement;</hi> and, being <hi>New,</hi> makes
the Readers apt to conceit that it is a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100531:15"/>
lately-found-out Discovery of some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of <hi>Thing,</hi> or some <hi>New Method,</hi> of
which <hi>all former</hi> Philosophers were hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
ignorant; whereas, 'tis the self-same
with <hi>Perfect Evidence of some Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Object;</hi> which all the Learned
Part of Mankind have <hi>ever us'd,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cartesius</hi> was born; nay, have
allow'd, and held also, That no Man
could <hi>refrain from Assenting</hi> that the
Thing, or Mental Proposition, is <hi>True,</hi>
when with Perfect Evidence It is <hi>seen</hi>
to <hi>be so.</hi> Wherefore, this last Point
will not, I hope, break Squares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Cartesians</hi> and me; for,
thus far we agree in our <hi>Meanings;</hi>
however, I except against the Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Expression,</hi> which would seem
to intimate something Extraordinary
in the Method you pretend to have
first found out, and introduced; and
which, by your Carriage, you seem
to <hi>appropriate</hi> to your selves, as singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>yours.</hi> 5. These Things being
so, it follows, that the <hi>First Rule</hi> of
our Knowledge of all Truths whatever
must be <hi>Common</hi> to <hi>all</hi> Knowing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the World: It must also be
the most Evident that can be, or <hi>Self-evident;</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100531:16"/>
so that none can <hi>disagree, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
or <hi>be Deceiv'd</hi> in it, but <hi>must See</hi>
and <hi>Assent</hi> to it, in despite of any
Weakness of the Understanding, or
any Byass or Obliquity of the <hi>Will;</hi>
as we shall see hereafter <hi>our</hi> Rule <hi>is,</hi>
and <hi>must be.</hi> And the Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this Rule being that, by means
of which, a Creature made for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is <hi>capable</hi> of knowing <hi>any thing;</hi>
it follows, that, if it lay in any Man's
power to be <hi>Ignorant</hi> of this Rule, or
to <hi>dissent</hi> from it, or be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in it,
it would be in his power, not meerly
to <hi>pervert,</hi> but utterly to <hi>destroy</hi> and
<hi>unmake</hi> the Nature given him by God;
and, of <hi>Cognoscitive</hi> or <hi>Capable of
Knowledge,</hi> make it <hi>Uncognoscitive</hi> or
<hi>Incapable</hi> of Knowing any thing;
which, the Natures of Things being
<hi>fix'd</hi> by God's Wisdom, to <hi>be what
they are,</hi> 'tis as impossible for any Man
to do, as it is for him to put off his
own Individuality, and not <hi>be the same
Person he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. These Notes premis'd, I come
closer to examine your <hi>Rule of Truth.</hi>
You say, If you <hi>Clearly</hi> and <hi>Distinctly
see</hi> that a Thing is <hi>True,</hi> you do thence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100531:16"/>
               <hi>certainly know</hi> it to <hi>be so.</hi> I allow the
Conditional Proposition; for, 'tis Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to <hi>see</hi> that which is <hi>not to be
seen;</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o <hi>know</hi> that to be <hi>True,</hi>
which is <hi>not-True.</hi> The only Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
then, is, Whether this be a <hi>Rule
of Truth;</hi> Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> very rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
granting, <hi>p.</hi> 92. there goes more to
constitute a <hi>Rule of Truth,</hi> than to be
<hi>True?</hi> In order to the Clearing of
which, I ask: Was it True <hi>before</hi> you
saw Clearly and Distinctly it <hi>was True?</hi>
Or, Did it <hi>become</hi> True by your <hi>seeing</hi>
it (as you phrase it) Clearly and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
<hi>to be True?</hi> If it <hi>were</hi> True
<hi>before</hi> you thus <hi>saw</hi> it to be True;
then, 'tis unavoidable, there was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi>
Rule, or Reason, for that Truth
which <hi>anteceded</hi> your <hi>Seeing</hi> it to be
such; and therefore, your Clear and
Distinct Perception could not be the
<hi>Rule</hi> of Knowing <hi>that</hi> Truth, being
<hi>Subsequent</hi> to it. And, if you say, it
<hi>became</hi> True by your <hi>Seeing</hi> it Clearly
and Distinctly, then it was <hi>not</hi> True
<hi>before;</hi> and then, you saw that to <hi>be</hi>
True, which <hi>was not</hi> True; that is,
you saw it to be <hi>otherwise,</hi> than, in
Effect and Reality, it was. And, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100531:17"/>
that pretended Sight or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is so far from being <hi>A Rule of
Truth,</hi> that it is a palpable <hi>Errour</hi> and
<hi>Mistake;</hi> and therefore, all the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
issuing from it must be <hi>False.</hi>
Which, instead of Constituting it <hi>A
Rule of Truth,</hi> would make it, indeed,
<hi>A Rule of Falshood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. To make this yet plainer, please
to reflect, that this Clear and Distinct
Perception is such an <hi>Act</hi> of your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
and that all <hi>Acts</hi> have
their <hi>being such,</hi> from the <hi>Object</hi> of
those Acts. For, the Faculty or <hi>Power</hi>
of Understanding was, <hi>of it self,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
and <hi>Indetermin'd</hi> to All and
Every <hi>Particular Act:</hi> And, since no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is <hi>Indetermin'd,</hi> nor any Act
<hi>in Common,</hi> can <hi>Be;</hi> it follows, that
the <hi>Being,</hi> and being <hi>such,</hi> of each <hi>Act,</hi>
depends <hi>formally</hi> on the <hi>Object,</hi> and is
<hi>such in particular,</hi> as that Object, which
<hi>informs</hi> the Power, is. Wherefore,
when you see a Thing to be <hi>True,</hi> that
which you saw <hi>thus</hi> Clearly and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
<hi>True,</hi> must have been <hi>thus</hi> True
<hi>before</hi> you saw it to <hi>be so.</hi> Whence,
we ask, What was that which made
the Object you <hi>perceiv'd-to-be-true,</hi> to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100531:17"/>
               <hi>be</hi> True? Or, What was the Rule of
Truth to that Object that <hi>was</hi> True,
ere you saw it to <hi>be such?</hi> Must not
the Object <hi>be such,</hi> ere you can <hi>know</hi>
it <hi>to be such?</hi> Or Clearly and Distinctly
<hi>Perceptible to be such,</hi> before you can
Clearly and Distinctly <hi>Perceive it to be
such?</hi> If not, then you must say, you
can <hi>know</hi> what is <hi>not to be known,</hi> or
Clearly and Distinctly <hi>perceive</hi> what is
not Clearly and Distinctly <hi>to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd:</hi>
Which is a perfect Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>9. For Instance; Since Truth is no
where to be found, but in such
Speeches as <hi>Affirm,</hi> or <hi>Deny,</hi> that is,
in <hi>Propositions;</hi> let us put some Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
which you thus Clearly and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
<hi>perceive to be True,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as was lately demonstrated) must
have <hi>been</hi> True <hi>before</hi> you <hi>saw</hi> it to <hi>be
so.</hi> Does it not clearly follow, that,
Either <hi>that</hi> Truth must have been <hi>made
Evident</hi> by <hi>Another,</hi> and that again by
<hi>Another,</hi> and so <hi>in infinitum;</hi> (by
which means, <hi>nothing at all</hi> could ever
be seen to be <hi>True;)</hi> or else there
must have been some <hi>First</hi> kind of
Truths, whose Noon-day Evidence
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100531:18"/>
imparts Evidence to <hi>others,</hi> and is it
self <hi>Visible,</hi> or (if you please) Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Distinctly Perceptible to <hi>all
Mankind;</hi> and <hi>forces</hi> them, at first
sight, to <hi>Assent</hi> to its Verity? Now,
if some such <hi>First</hi> kind of Truths can
be found, which, by their <hi>Absolute
Self-Evidence,</hi> do, as Objects of our
Understanding Power, necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
the Understandings of <hi>all
Mankind,</hi> to <hi>Assent;</hi> and do withall
<hi>influence</hi> All our <hi>other Truths,</hi> and our
<hi>Knowledge</hi> of them; then (our <hi>Act of
Perception</hi> being clearly <hi>Excluded</hi> from
being the <hi>Rule of Truth)</hi> these <hi>First
Truths</hi> have all the Requisites that can
be imagin'd for a <hi>Ratio cognoscendi Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem,</hi>
or a <hi>Rule of Truth;</hi> since they
self-evidently manifest to us their <hi>own</hi>
Truth; and <hi>by it,</hi> give us Light to
know <hi>all others.</hi> Let us pursue then
the Quest of these <hi>First Truths.</hi> Our
Discourse, because it concerns and
antecedes <hi>all other</hi> Knowledges, and
all <hi>particular</hi> Truths, must necessarily
be fetch'd from the <hi>Deepest Grounds,</hi>
and therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must needs be <hi>very Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative.</hi>
But, I know I speak to him
whose Piercing Wit will easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100531:18"/>
it. Only, I beseech you, so
far to bend your Byass, which you
must needs have contracted by your
Long and Steady Meditating on your
Way of <hi>Ideas,</hi> till you <hi>reduce</hi> any <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity</hi>
that may have prepossess'd your
good Judgment, to a <hi>Rectitude,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency;</hi>
and then I cannot doubt,
but I may do you some Service, even,
perhaps, against your Will: For, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
if Clear, and well penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
does oft-times <hi>force</hi> Assent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Will repugns, or no.</p>
            <p>10. The <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Essences,</hi> of each
Piece of the World's Fabrick were in
the Mind of the Divine Architect, ere
they were made. Again; Since he
did not make them by the Hand of
some Bungling Journey-man, who
might, perhaps, <hi>deviate</hi> from his Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
or Model; but immediately, by
his own Infinite Wisdom and Power;
it cannot be doubted, but that each
Part of the Creation was fram'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
according to the Archetypes of
those <hi>Unchangeable Ideas;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was perfectly <hi>Establish'd</hi> in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Essence, or Nature, as those
Original Ideas were; that is, they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100531:19"/>
were fix'd <hi>to be what they are,</hi> by an
<hi>Inerrable</hi> Hand; in which consists that
which we call their <hi>Metaphysical Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
Wherefore, since all Truth, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally,
Primarily</hi> and <hi>most Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi>
consists in this <hi>Metaphysical Verity</hi>
of Things, it being the <hi>Immediate</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the <hi>Divine Wisdom;</hi> it follows,
that the First <hi>Formal</hi> Truths that can
be in our Minds, (which, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are the <hi>Rules,</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> to all
others,) must be those which <hi>speak,
express,</hi> or <hi>Affirm</hi> this Metaphysical Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or, that the Things <hi>are what they
are.</hi> Which kind of <hi>Self-evident</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
can therefore, be no other than
those we call <hi>Identical.</hi> This is most
Evident, and Incontestable: For, since
this <hi>Metaphysical Verity,</hi> which (next
to the Divine Maker of all Things,
from whom it <hi>immediately</hi> proceeded)
is the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>all Truth,</hi>
does consist in this, That Things are
<hi>Fix'd</hi> in their Essences, or <hi>are what they
are;</hi> 'tis Impossible to <hi>speak</hi> this Truth,
or make it a <hi>Formal Truth,</hi> by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Denying, (that is, by putting
it into a <hi>Proposition;)</hi> but by Affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>they are what they are;</hi> which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100531:19"/>
is most evidently an Identical Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>11. Hitherto, then, it is undiscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
how it can, with any Shew of
Reason, be deny'd, that the <hi>Self-Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
that so visibly shines in <hi>Identical
Propositions,</hi> bids fair towards their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>First Rule</hi> of Knowing all
Truths; or, which is the same, the
First Principle to all other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.
For, 1. There cannot be any
so <hi>great</hi> Clearness, or Evidence, as is
<hi>Self-Evidence;</hi> nor so <hi>Close Connexion</hi>
of the Terms in any Proposition, or
Speech, that expresses Truth, as is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Identity,</hi> or <hi>Self-Connexion;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in this, That the <hi>Thing,</hi> or <hi>Mode</hi>
of Thing spoken of, <hi>is what it is,</hi>
or, <hi>is its self.</hi> 2. 'Tis Impossible any
thing else can be so <hi>Solid,</hi> or so <hi>Firmly
Establish'd;</hi> being immediately built
on the Unchangeable <hi>Metaphysical Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
it self; or rather, being <hi>It,</hi> spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and express'd: Which Verity (as
was shewn) is imprinted in the <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of every Created Thing, by the
<hi>Immediate</hi> Hand of <hi>Essential Truth.</hi>
Whence it is so nearly ally'd to that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Truth</hi> it self, that it is remov'd but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100531:20"/>
               <hi>one</hi> Degree from it. 3. By reason of
this Connatural and Immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
from that Brightest and most
Glorious Luminary of all Knowledge,
<hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> who is <hi>Candor
Aeternae Lucis,</hi> and Infinitely Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible;
it <hi>forces</hi> the Assent of <hi>all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>
to its Verity. Insomuch, that no
<hi>Disease</hi> can so pervert a Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which has the least Use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as to <hi>deny</hi> it, or <hi>doubt</hi> of it; nor
<hi>suspend</hi> their Judgment concerning it:
Nor can the highest <hi>Passion</hi> of the most
Profligate Wretch living, hurry his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
into the Admittance of
such a <hi>Folly.</hi> No <hi>Scepticalness</hi> can call
the Truth and Certainty of it into
<hi>Question.</hi> No Whimsical <hi>Speculation</hi>
can inveigle any Man into a Conceit,
that it <hi>can be False.</hi> No <hi>Opposition</hi> can
make head against it; since, whatever
can be alledg'd to overthrow it, must
needs appear to be <hi>less Evident</hi> than <hi>It;</hi>
and, therefore, <hi>Unable</hi> to <hi>shock</hi> it. No
subtil <hi>Distinction</hi> can <hi>impair</hi> its Truth;
or pretend it is True <hi>in One Respect,</hi>
but not <hi>in Another;</hi> since it is Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to distinguish the Copula <hi>[is;]</hi>
the Notion of Existence being so <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100531:20"/>
Simple,</hi> and <hi>most Formal,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible,</hi>
that it can admit of no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
into <hi>Divers Formalities;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to One of which, it may be
<hi>True;</hi> according to Another, <hi>False.</hi>
Nor can it prejudice any <hi>such</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
to Distinguish its <hi>Subject,</hi> or
<hi>Predicate;</hi> since whatever Distinction
can fall <hi>here</hi> upon the <hi>Subject,</hi> must
fall upon the <hi>Predicate</hi> too; both of
them being the <hi>self-same Notion.</hi> By
which means, the <hi>Identicalness</hi> and <hi>Self-evidence</hi>
of the Proposition will be still
the same <hi>after</hi> the Distinction is given,
as it was <hi>before.</hi> So that 'tis Impossible
to <hi>imagin,</hi> that any thing can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
which can, <hi>in any Regard,</hi> or
<hi>in any Degree,</hi> vye with <hi>Identical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;</hi>
either in being so <hi>Solidly
Grounded,</hi> or so perfectly <hi>Clear, Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
Unmistakable,</hi> and plac'd above
the reach of <hi>any possible Attack.</hi> Nor
did <hi>Cartesius</hi> himself, amongst all the
Evident Things he <hi>call'd into Doubt,</hi>
in the least <hi>Question</hi> the Evidence and
Truth of <hi>such</hi> Propositions, <hi>formally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd:</hi>
Nor could he have done it,
without utterly <hi>Destroying,</hi> at the same
time, the Certainty of <hi>all</hi> he could
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100531:21"/>
have said; nay, even of his own First
Principle too; as will be seen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
From all which Considerations,
(any <hi>One</hi> of which might suffice,) I
may Safely and Evidently conclude,
that, in point of <hi>Evidence</hi> of its <hi>Truth,</hi>
and <hi>Stability</hi> of its <hi>Grounds,</hi> nothing
can be any way comparable to the
Light which strikes the Eye of our
Understanding, by its steady Rays e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
from these Self-evident, or <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Propositions: Which goes very
far to the Entitling <hi>These,</hi> and These
<hi>only,</hi> to be the <hi>Rule of Knowing all
Truths,</hi> or the First Principles to <hi>all</hi>
Science, in whatever particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
not excepting even <hi>Metaphysicks</hi>
it self.</p>
            <p>12. Notwithstanding all that has
been so fully evinc'd hitherto, I have,
as yet, done but <hi>half</hi> my Business; or
rather, the <hi>better half</hi> is still left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.
For, a <hi>First Rule,</hi> or <hi>First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
requires <hi>Another</hi> Quality, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to it self, to <hi>compleat</hi> its Notion,
besides its being thus <hi>Solidly Grounded,</hi>
and thus <hi>Supreamly Evident;</hi> which is,
That All other Truths, or Knowledges,
must be <hi>Rul'd,</hi> or <hi>Principl'd</hi> by <hi>It:</hi> It
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100531:21"/>
must have an Universal Influence over
<hi>all other</hi> Knowledges, and <hi>impart</hi> its
Light to <hi>them.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> Qualities
will, I believe, be granted to <hi>Identical
Propositions,</hi> by every Attentive Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
who knows what belongs to
Logick, or Reason reflecting on it
self; and is, withall, but meanly vers'd
in Metaphysicks. This <hi>later</hi> Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
will be deny'd by <hi>many,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
by <hi>most;</hi> nay, will be fancy'd,
and abetted by <hi>very Few.</hi> For, every
one's Genius does not lead him to spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
so <hi>deep;</hi> and there are scarce
<hi>any</hi> who have <hi>propos'd</hi> this highest and
nicest Point, much less handl'd it <hi>at
large;</hi> tho' <hi>divers</hi> have given the
<hi>Grounds</hi> whence it <hi>must follow.</hi> The
Reason of this General Dis-like of
<hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> is, because they
have such a <hi>Dry Meen,</hi> and <hi>Contemptible
Aspect;</hi> so unlikely to give us the least
kind of Instruction, or Light, to
know any thing but their own Insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
Selves, that nothing seems
more <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> than for any Man,
who is to teach others, even to <hi>propose</hi>
such Insipid Sayings as a <hi>Means,</hi> much
less as a <hi>Rule,</hi> to gain the Knowledge
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100531:22"/>
of any Truth whatever; nor is it Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
how we can come to know
any thing, or <hi>work out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> any new
Knowledges, by making use of such
<hi>Blunt Tools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think I have said the worst against
them, that the keenest Adversary can
alledge. It remains, then, to shew
how I can clear them of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful
Character; or make out
that they have such a <hi>General Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
over <hi>all other</hi> Truths, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>13. I demand, then, of my Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
whether it be not Fundamentally
necessary in all Discourses about what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Truth, to <hi>attend</hi> still, and keep
an Eye <hi>directed</hi> to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the
Thing or <hi>Subject</hi> about which we are
Discoursing, and to take special Care
we do not <hi>deviate</hi> from it? I do not
think any Scholar living, attending to
his Natural Thoughts, or Common
Sense, will deny this. For, if any
Discourse makes the Thing be <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than it is,</hi> it must necessarily be
<hi>False;</hi> and expose the Author of it to
speak manifest <hi>Contradictions.</hi> Now,
I do no more but this, while I make
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100531:22"/>
Self-evident or Identical Propositions
to be the <hi>First Rules,</hi> or <hi>First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of all other Knowledges: All I
do, is, to keep a heedful Eye to the
Nature of the <hi>Thing,</hi> and its <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Verity.</hi> Only, because it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to every Reflecter, that all our
<hi>Discourses</hi> are made up of <hi>Propositions;</hi>
nor can a <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Principle</hi> be express'd,
but by such Forms of Speech; nor is
the <hi>Comparative,</hi> or (as I may say)
the <hi>Compositive</hi> Nature of our Soul sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd,
till it has brought the Object
it would Discourse about, into some
<hi>Formal Truth,</hi> (her only Perfection in
this State,) which is express'd by a
<hi>Proposition:</hi> Hence, we become forc'd
to put the <hi>Nature of the Thing,</hi> or its
Metaphysical Verity, into <hi>such</hi> a Frame
of Speaking; so to fit it for Discourse:
which 'tis Impossible to do, but that
Speech, or Proposition, whether we
will or no, must be an <hi>Identical</hi> one.</p>
            <p>14. As for their seeming so Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and Dry, this happens because
of their most perfect <hi>Simplicity,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
as <hi>little</hi> Composition in them as
is possible; or rather, <hi>none at all,</hi> but
what is in the <hi>Form</hi> of Expression; I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100531:23"/>
doubt not but your Acute Judgment
is well aware, that the first <hi>Stamina,</hi>
in what kind soever, are, and must be,
the <hi>most Simple;</hi> and, therefore, such,
that, should Nature stop her Course
there, and proceed no farther, they
would be the most Insipid, and Useless
Things in Nature. And yet, from
such <hi>Simple</hi> Beginnings, or (to use
<hi>Virgil</hi>'s Expression) <hi>tenues orsus,</hi> all the
<hi>most Perfect</hi> Productions in <hi>Whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
have their <hi>Rise:</hi> Nor could any
Work of hers ever arrive at Maturity,
or attain to that Admirable Frame it
afterwards <hi>grows up to,</hi> unless it had
had at first such a <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Shapeless
Origin.</hi> The same happens in the First
<hi>Stamina</hi> of all our Succeeding Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges:
They are so Simple, and have
such an Odd, Bald and Unfledg'd Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
that we know not what to
make of them, when we regard them
only in themselves; or, what <hi>Use</hi> they
<hi>are</hi> of in the Acquisition of Science;
yet, without such Simple Beginnings,
<hi>fore-laid</hi> in our Knowing Power, no
<hi>Distinct</hi> Knowledge at all could be had
of any other Thing; as will most
Clearly appear shortly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100531:23"/>
15. We may observe, that, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
we are not so Sensible of <hi>Goods,</hi>
as of <hi>Harms;</hi> because the Former,
thro' the Generous Bounty of GOD's
Good Providence, are of <hi>so many kinds,</hi>
surrounding us on all sides, that they
are <hi>Common,</hi> and <hi>Quotidian;</hi> whereas,
the Later are <hi>Seldom,</hi> and (as it were)
<hi>Casual:</hi> Whence, <hi>These</hi> are <hi>Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
and apt to strike our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<hi>smartly,</hi> and <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rce</hi> us to <hi>take notice</hi>
of them; which <hi>Those,</hi> being <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and <hi>Customary,</hi> do not. To breed
then a due Reflexion, what <hi>Good</hi> those
<hi>First Truths</hi> now spoken of, laid up in
our Minds, do us, we will consider
what <hi>Universal Mischiefs</hi> their proper
<hi>Opposites, [Contradictions,]</hi> would do
to <hi>all</hi> our Knowledge; and what a
<hi>Malignant Influence</hi> they would have,
not only to pervert all our <hi>Actual</hi>
Knowledge, but to destroy our very
<hi>Power</hi> of knowing <hi>any thing.</hi> Let us
suppose then, that those two Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>[What is, is not;]</hi> and <hi>[A Thing
is not what it is,]</hi> which are the proper
Contradictories to those Chief Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals,
<hi>[What is, is;]</hi> and, <hi>[A Thing is
what it is;]</hi> to be, both of them, <hi>True:</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100531:24"/>
Would it be possible, in that Case, to
speak a Word of <hi>Truth;</hi> or, to <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
at all; but, instead of speaking
consequently, to talk a Hotch-potch
of <hi>Incoherent Nonsense?</hi> For, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Affirm any thing to be <hi>True,</hi> but
by means of the Copula <hi>[is,]</hi> in whose
<hi>Connecting</hi> or <hi>Identifying</hi> Sense, all Truth
most Formally consists: Wherefore, if
that Word, or the Notion it signifies,
were <hi>Chimerical,</hi> and might be the
same with <hi>[is not,]</hi> then, since there
can be no <hi>Middle</hi> between them, all
we affirm might be False. And, since
the <hi>Subject</hi> we speak of, must either be
some <hi>Thing,</hi> or some <hi>Mode</hi> of Thing;
all that we speak of that Thing would
go to wrack, and be <hi>False,</hi> in case the
<hi>Subject</hi> of our Discourse, or Speech,
were not <hi>Distinguish'd</hi> from <hi>all other</hi>
Things or Modes; that is, if it <hi>were
not it self only,</hi> but <hi>Another,</hi> all the
while. Since then, the <hi>Contradictories</hi>
to these two Identicals now spoken of,
have such an <hi>Universal Influence,</hi> that
they constantly <hi>set up</hi> Errour, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi>
Truth; 'tis manifest, that <hi>Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Propositions</hi> (their Contradictory
Opposites) do, for the same reason,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100531:24"/>
of their own nature, tend to <hi>abet Truth'</hi>
and <hi>destroy Errour;</hi> and therefore they
are deservedly entitled to be the <hi>Rule
of Truth;</hi> the <hi>Influence</hi> they have over
<hi>all</hi> Truths being full as <hi>Universal,</hi> as
<hi>Contradictions,</hi> their Opposites, have,
to induce Errour.</p>
            <p>16. But nothing can more victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<hi>confute,</hi> or more unanswerably
<hi>convince</hi> an Adversary, than to shew
that he must be forc'd, for his own
Interest, to <hi>admit</hi> the Truth of that
Tenet which he <hi>opposes.</hi> Ask, then, a
<hi>Cartesian,</hi> how he knows any <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
Truths; or (which is the same)
how he knows that such Predicates,
or Attributes, do belong to such a
Subject? He will answer, Because he
finds those Predicates in the <hi>Idea</hi> he
has of such a Thing, or such a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Very good, replies the other:
But, how shall we know that the Idea
you have of that Thing is not <hi>Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,</hi>
and involves in it <hi>many other</hi>
Things, as well as <hi>That?</hi> Which, if
it does, your Discourse, applying it to
<hi>That</hi> Thing <hi>only,</hi> must needs be Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent,
and <hi>False.</hi> Your only Answer,
in this Case, can be <hi>This,</hi> That each
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100531:25"/>
Idea you have is <hi>Distinct</hi> from <hi>all other</hi>
Ideas, and has its Metaphysical <hi>Verity</hi>
and <hi>Unity</hi> peculiar to it self, or (which
is the same) <hi>is its self only;</hi> which is
an <hi>Identical Proposition,</hi> and speaks, or
expresses the <hi>Metaphysical Verity</hi> of each
Idea you have. Now, say I, hence
appears evidently, that this Truth, <hi>viz.
[Every Idea is it self only,</hi> or <hi>no other;]</hi>
which is an <hi>Identical Proposition,</hi> is the
<hi>very First Truth</hi> you can have; and,
that on it depends, Fundamentally,
your whole Doctrine by way of <hi>Ideas:</hi>
For, if this be False, 'tis most Evident
that your Ideas can give you no <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi>
Knowledge of any <hi>Thing,</hi> or
<hi>Mode</hi> of Thing; that is, they could
enable you to know <hi>Nothing at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. You will say, perhaps, it is not
Needful to <hi>put, lay</hi> or <hi>propose</hi> so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
those Identicals, they being so
very Clear, of themselves, to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
I reply, 1. That this comes
over to me, as to what relates to their
<hi>Clearness,</hi> and <hi>Self-Evidence,</hi> and abets
my Position. 2. That, certainly, That
is <hi>most needful,</hi> on which, as was now
shewn, <hi>all depends.</hi> You must, then,
have those Identicals <hi>in your Mind,</hi> at
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100531:25"/>
least <hi>Understood,</hi> and <hi>Presuppos'd,</hi> tho'
you express them not. 3. You must
be forc'd to <hi>express</hi> them if you come
to <hi>discourse</hi> rigorously, and reduce
your Thesis to the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
Truths; without doing which,
(especially, if you hap to encounter
with a Sceptick,) nothing can be <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi>
Decided, or Concluded. 4. The
Point is, That 'tis most <hi>Needful</hi> to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi>
them, nay, <hi>Unavoidable,</hi> when
the Question, <hi>[Which is the First Truth
that can be,</hi> which gives Light to <hi>all</hi>
others,] is in Agitation; as is our Case
at present: You must be forc'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that the Truth of these Identicals
is <hi>Antecedent</hi> to all the following
Knowledges you can have by your
Ideas; that, thence, you can know No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
unless this be <hi>Presuppos'd,</hi> and
<hi>Foreknown;</hi> and that, therefore, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
<hi>all</hi> your <hi>Future</hi> and <hi>Dependent</hi>
Knowledges, after its Fashion; and
<hi>gives</hi> and <hi>secures</hi> to them all the
Strength, Distinction and Evidence
they have. Whence is clearly inferr'd,
that the Self-evident Light which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in such <hi>First Truths,</hi> ought to be
made, by the <hi>Cartesians</hi> themselves, the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100531:26"/>
               <hi>Rule of Knowing</hi> whatever other Truths
they can pretend to know by their
<hi>Ideas;</hi> that is, the <hi>very First Rule</hi> of
all others; that is, the <hi>Only</hi> one: For,
none can be, in Proper Speech, a <hi>Rule,</hi>
unless it be the <hi>First;</hi> all others being
<hi>regulated</hi> by that which is the <hi>First:</hi>
So that <hi>It,</hi> and only It, is the <hi>Rule;</hi> all
the rest, <hi>Ruled.</hi> And, certainly, it will
appear Evident to all Mankind, that
what is <hi>most Self-evident,</hi> as all <hi>Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals</hi>
are, were there nothing else, should
be the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Knowing</hi> all other Truths
which are not <hi>so</hi> Evident as They. Be
pleas'd, Sir, to reflect upon that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
by which you notifie, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
to us <hi>your</hi> Rule of Knowing, <hi>viz.
[That which I clearly and distinctly see to
be True, is True.]</hi> Consider, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Words are in this Proposition; and
that each Word has its Proper, or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi>
Idea, each of which Ideas must
be <hi>Distinct</hi> from all other Ideas, that
is, each of them must be <hi>the same with
its self only,</hi> (which make so many
Identical Propositions;) or else, none
of those Ideas can be possibly able to
do you any Service. So that, 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
<hi>your</hi> Rule of Knowing <hi>depends</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:100531:26"/>
on the Self-evident Light suppos'd to
be in <hi>ours.</hi> Whence 'tis Concluded,
that <hi>yours</hi> is not the First <hi>Ratio Cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendi,</hi>
the <hi>First Rule,</hi> or <hi>First Truth;</hi>
but, <hi>Ruled</hi> by <hi>ours, Grounded</hi> on <hi>ours,</hi>
and <hi>Subsequent,</hi> in the Order of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to ours.</p>
            <p>18. I do not expect, that such high
Speculations will please every Body:
But, I hope, it will plead my Pardon,
that I could not avoid it. In so <hi>Nice</hi>
a Point, as is the Settling the First Rule
of <hi>all</hi> Knowledge; or, what is the
very First, Self-evident, and most Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Grounded
Truth; no Speculation,
resolving <hi>all Dependent</hi> Truths into
that which is <hi>Absolutely-Independent,</hi>
(as the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>all Truth</hi> must be) can
be <hi>too Accurate,</hi> or laid <hi>too Deep.</hi> 'Tis
not, then, any Humour of mine, or
a kind of <hi>Trial of Skill,</hi> which mov'd
me to this very <hi>Abstracted,</hi> and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical
Way of Discoursing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, it
was the very <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>present Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
that <hi>forc'd</hi> me upon it.</p>
            <p>19. Nor was it any Care of <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching</hi>
your Acuteness, nor the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of <hi>Opposing</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Knowing
Truth</hi> introduc'd by the Great <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100531:27"/>
which put me upon this Unusual
piece of Doctrine. I had, above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years ago, upon some Hints given
me by that Second <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly-Learned
<hi>Albius,</hi> apply'd my
Speculative Thoughts to dig very deep
into this Subject, to find out the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
Center of all Truth;</hi> and I
had begun to write a very Speculative
Treatise, shewing how to <hi>reduce</hi> every
<hi>Truth</hi> into an <hi>Identical</hi> Proposition;
and every <hi>Errour,</hi> to a <hi>Contradiction;</hi>
which, I saw, lay hid at the <hi>Bottom</hi>
of every <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Falshood.</hi> This, I
say, was an <hi>Old Design</hi> of mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I thought of Opposing any, or
of being Oppos'd by any. I foresaw
also, while I was writing my <hi>Method,</hi>
that (it being more easie to be <hi>Witty,</hi>
than to be <hi>Solid)</hi> Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
would be look'd upon by very
<hi>Ingenious</hi> Men, who were not <hi>thorow-Speculators,</hi>
as <hi>Sapless, Useless,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant.</hi>
Wherefore, I did there take
some Occasions, which lay in the Track
of my Thoughts, while I was settling the
<hi>Grounds</hi> to <hi>True Science,</hi> to clear those
First Truths from such Unworthy Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehensions.
To this End, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100531:27"/>
there, <hi>B. 3. Less. 1. §.</hi> 3.
That all the Force of <hi>Consequence,</hi> in
which consists our <hi>Rationality,</hi> can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be built upon <hi>such</hi> Propositions. I
shew, <hi>B. 2. L.</hi> 2. in what their <hi>Self-evidence</hi>
consists: What is the <hi>First</hi> of
them, and their several Sorts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
I set my self to Demonstrate,
by many Arguments, from §. 11. to
the End of that Lesson, that all First
Principles must be <hi>Identical Propositions;</hi>
and (§. 19.) that plain Reason teaches
us it must be so: Which evinced, it
follows, that whoever denies <hi>these</hi> to
be <hi>Useful,</hi> must, with the same Breath,
affirm, that all <hi>First Principles</hi> are <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi>
and good for nothing; which is
a strange Position. Nay, since there
is an <hi>Order</hi> in Truths, and therefore
all <hi>Second</hi> Principles have their Force
from the <hi>First,</hi> it follows, that we can
have <hi>no Use</hi> of <hi>Second</hi> Principles, if the
<hi>First</hi> be <hi>Useless;</hi> and so, we must talk
ramblingly, and at random, all our
Lives, without <hi>any</hi> Principles <hi>at all.</hi>
I manifest the same, <hi>(L. 3.)</hi> by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
fetch'd from the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and other Sciences; and shew
<hi>what Use</hi> is to be made of them;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100531:28"/>
which is not to make them either of
the <hi>Premisses</hi> in a <hi>Syllogism;</hi> but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
our selves of them in a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I shew <hi>(B. 2. L. 2. §. 18.)</hi> that
even plain, Uncultivated Nature makes
the Vulgar <hi>recurr</hi> to them, as their
<hi>First Principles,</hi> when they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
that which is decisive of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
and <hi>Undeniable.</hi> I prove, that
all <hi>Middle Terms</hi> which are <hi>Proper,</hi> are
built upon the same Ground with
them. I endeavour <hi>(B. 3. L. 3. §§.
16, 17, 18.)</hi> to evince clearly, that All
<hi>Truths</hi> have, at the bottom, <hi>Identical
Propositions,</hi> and are <hi>Reducible</hi> to them;
and I attempt to shew, <hi>(Less. 4.)</hi> the
Way how to reduce <hi>Inferiour</hi> Truths
to those <hi>Highest</hi> ones. All which, if
I have fully prov'd, especially, that
<hi>All First Principles are Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which bears all along with it,
and is concluded there by divers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations,
on which I dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
my whole Cause, that they are
impossible to be solv'd; then, I may
safely presume, I have evinc'd, that
the <hi>Intelligibility</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> of Identical
Propositions is <hi>most Self-evident;</hi> the
<hi>Ground</hi> on which they are built, most
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100531:28"/>
               <hi>Solid;</hi> and the <hi>Usefulness</hi> or <hi>Influence</hi>
of them upon all other Truths, most
<hi>Universal:</hi> And, therefore, that they
are every way qualify'd to be the <hi>First</hi>
and <hi>Only Rule of Knowing all Truths
whatever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. To comprehend better the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of this Discourse, let us imagine
a Man <hi>devested</hi> of the Knowledge of
Identical Propositions; and then let
us consider whether he could know
<hi>any thing at all,</hi> or what he is <hi>good for.</hi>
To instance in one of them; Let us
suppose him Ignorant that <hi>A Thing is
what it is;</hi> or a <hi>Cartesian,</hi> that <hi>Each
Idea is it self, and no other;</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sense will tell every one, that
such a Man could <hi>know nothing,</hi> nor
make any Judgment or Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
any <hi>Thing,</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> either;
since <hi>that</hi> Thing, or Idea, he would
Judge, or Discourse of, is, perhaps,
all the while, for ought he knows,
<hi>Another.</hi> Whoever would see farther
the <hi>Use</hi> of Identical Propositions
brought to <hi>Practice,</hi> may please to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
how they are serviceable in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places of my three Treatises here
mention'd: Not by <hi>proposing</hi> them first,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100531:29"/>
and then <hi>Deducing</hi> and <hi>Arguing</hi> from
them, as some may mistake; but by
<hi>Reducing</hi> the Truth of my Discourses
up to those Standards of all <hi>Truth;</hi>
and by shewing these to be engag'd
in the Patronage and Support of my
<hi>Thesis;</hi> by which means, they smartly
<hi>clinch</hi> the Force and Evidence of my
Arguments, by bearing up to <hi>them,</hi>
and relying on <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. It was a well-aim'd Reach of
Speculation in Mr. <hi>Locke, [Essay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Humane Understanding, B. 2.
Ch. 32. §. 2.]</hi> where he says, that the
<hi>Metaphysical Verity</hi> of Things <hi>contains
in them a Tacit Proposition:</hi> Which I
would understand, not to be meant of
that Verity, as it is <hi>in the Thing</hi> it self;
but as it is <hi>in our Understanding,</hi> where
only Propositions <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>can be.</hi> For,
since this Metaphysical Verity is not a
<hi>Natural</hi> Notion, imprinted <hi>directly</hi> by
our Senses, it can only be known by
<hi>Reflexion.</hi> The Mind, then, careful to
be well assur'd of the <hi>Subject</hi> of which
it is to Judge, or Discourse, (without
which <hi>Pre-assurance,</hi> it could do <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,)
reviews</hi> it heedfully, and steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and then says of it, within it self;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100531:29"/>
               <hi>['Tis this, and no other.]</hi> Which is an
Identical Proposition, <hi>in Substance;</hi>
tho', for a Reason we shall give short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we put it afterwards into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<hi>more formally</hi> Identical. Why
the Soul does this, springs hence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
being naturally made to see
Truth; and no Truth (in the First
and Proper Signification of that Word)
being possible to be had, without <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,</hi>
or <hi>Denying;</hi> hence 'tis <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and <hi>Necessary,</hi> that, when it comes
to review the Object, in order to <hi>see
its Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood,</hi> it should put it
into the Frame of an <hi>Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
only which kind of Speeches are
capable to <hi>Affirm,</hi> or <hi>Deny.</hi> And this
is that I mean, when I use to say, (as
I do frequently,) that the Nature of
the Soul is <hi>Comparative,</hi> or <hi>Relative:</hi>
For, when a Proposition is molded in
the Mind, the Predicate of it is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd</hi>
or <hi>Related</hi> to the Subject, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to see their <hi>Agreement,</hi> or <hi>Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
without which, nothing can be
<hi>known</hi> to be, in proper Speech, <hi>True,</hi>
or <hi>False:</hi> In which Position, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>
perfectly agrees with me. Now, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aside <hi>Extrinsecal Denominations,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:100531:30"/>
which are not at all found <hi>in</hi> the
<hi>Thing,</hi> but meerly <hi>tack'd</hi> to it by our
Consideration; this <hi>Comparing</hi> is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>Mode,</hi> to the <hi>Thing;</hi> and,
seeing, in general, <hi>how</hi> it affects it, as
is seen in the two last Predicables of
<hi>Porphyrius;</hi> which, because Modes are
not Distinct <hi>Things,</hi> and yet differ vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Formal Notion of the
<hi>Thing</hi> it self, of which they are <hi>Modes,</hi>
can only be Connected with it <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially;</hi>
or, as Belonging to the <hi>Thing,</hi>
as their <hi>Subject:</hi> Or else, the Mind
compares the Thing to what's <hi>Formal,</hi>
or <hi>Essential</hi> to it. And this, either in
the <hi>Whole,</hi> as is found in our Identical
Propositions; for which reason, I am
forc'd to make a <hi>Sixth</hi> Predicable, in
which the <hi>Whole</hi> is predicated, <hi>entirely</hi>
and <hi>formally,</hi> of the <hi>Whole:</hi> Or else, <hi>in
Part;</hi> when some <hi>Part</hi> of the Essence
or Nature of the Whole Thing is <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,</hi>
or Compar'd to it <hi>diversly;</hi> as
is seen in <hi>Porphyrius</hi>'s Three First Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cables,
call'd <hi>Genus, Species,</hi> and <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi>
which do, all of them, <hi>in part,</hi>
belong to the Essence. These Notes
borrow'd from Logick, and premis'd,
'tis here farther to be Noted, that all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100531:30"/>
those Comparisons, or Relations the
Soul makes in whatever Proposition,
is done by that Relation, call'd <hi>Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
as is manifest from the Copula
<hi>[Est.]</hi> Wherefore, to review what
we said lately; the Predicates belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the two last Predicables of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius,</hi>
are Referr'd only according to
<hi>Material Identity;</hi> or, only as found
to belong to the same <hi>Thing,</hi> and <hi>not</hi>
as <hi>Essential</hi> to it. The three former
are related, or <hi>Compar'd,</hi> as Identify'd
<hi>Formally</hi> to the Thing; yet, still so, as
but several <hi>Parts</hi> of its Essence. The
6th is, when the <hi>Whole</hi> Thing is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
Related to, or <hi>Identify'd</hi> with
the <hi>Whole</hi> Thing; and this <hi>Entirely,</hi> or
according to all that is in the Thing.
And, this Way of <hi>Comparing</hi> or <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
the <hi>Whole</hi> Thing to <hi>its Self,</hi> is that
Relation of Identity, which is the
<hi>most</hi> Essential, <hi>most</hi> Formal, and <hi>most</hi>
Expresly such, of all other; and, is
only found in those Propositions we
call <hi>First Principles.</hi> Which Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being, for the Reasons given,
most Fully and Properly such, we do
therefore, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, call <hi>Identical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100531:31"/>
22. Whence may be seen, that the
Virtue of Identical Propositions <hi>threads,</hi>
or <hi>runs thorow</hi> all those Propositions
that are <hi>Essential;</hi> and, collaterally,
those also whose Predicates are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
and necessarily <hi>Connected</hi> with
the Essence. For, since the <hi>Parts</hi> are
found in the <hi>Whole,</hi> and all Identifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>in part,</hi> is a <hi>Part</hi> of the Identifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the <hi>Whole</hi> Thing with its
self; it follows, that Propositions, or
Truths, in which the Predicate is but
<hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Whole,</hi> are, in Reality, but
<hi>Parts</hi> of our <hi>Identicals.</hi> Nor is this
all; but the Force of every <hi>Consequence</hi>
too is Grounded on them, in which
consists all our <hi>Rationality;</hi> as was
shewn above. Whence Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> in
his <hi>Essay, B. 4. Ch. 2. §.</hi> 7. shews, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Judiciously, that every Step we
take in true Demonstrations, is made
by <hi>Intuitive,</hi> or Self-evident Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
            <p>23. Whence, 'tis Evident, that even
<hi>your</hi> Rule will force you, tho' contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to your Intention, to come over to
us; and, will oblige you to guide
your selves by <hi>Connexion of Terms,</hi>
(which is <hi>our</hi> Way,) however you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100531:31"/>
strive to avoid it. You say, that <hi>when
you Clearly and Distinctly see</hi> a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be <hi>True,</hi> it <hi>must be so:</hi> And we
say, you can never see a Proposition
to be <hi>True,</hi> but when you see its two
Extremes, (or, the Subject and Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,)
<hi>Connected.</hi> You will alledge,
you see it in your <hi>Idea:</hi> But, (as is
shewn above,) there are <hi>three Parts</hi> in
a Proposition, which have, each of
them, a <hi>Distinct Idea;</hi> in regard, the
self-same Idea which is of the <hi>Subject,</hi>
cannot be the Idea of the <hi>Predicate;</hi>
for, this would throw you upon <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Propositions,</hi> which is <hi>our Rule:</hi>
And, the Idea of the <hi>Copula</hi> is, most
evidently, quite <hi>Different</hi> from the
other Two; being, precisely, <hi>That
which Affirms,</hi> or <hi>Denies;</hi> which <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of the other <hi>does.</hi> This being so,
I beseech you to reflect, that <hi>Truth</hi>
(which is the Thing in question) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist in these Ideas, <hi>singly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd;</hi>
for, taken <hi>thus,</hi> they are, all of
them, <hi>Simple Apprehensions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which can
neither be <hi>True,</hi> nor <hi>False.</hi> It remains,
then, that you must confess, Truth
can be only in those Ideas, <hi>put together,</hi>
or <hi>Connected;</hi> nor, can they be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:100531:32"/>
but by that which only is apt
to Connect or Identifie them; <hi>viz.</hi>
by the Copula <hi>[Est;]</hi> for, these three
Parts cannot be fram'd into one
Speech, by any other manner, but by
putting the Word <hi>[Est]</hi> between them.
Wherefore, 'tis Evident, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend to <hi>see clearly and distinctly,</hi>
that any Proposition is <hi>True,</hi> (which
is <hi>your</hi> Rule to know Truth,) but by
seeing its said Terms <hi>Connected,</hi> or <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd.</hi>
I see not how you can, even
in your Way of Ideas, deny this Clear
Discourse: And, if you grant it, we
are thus far Friends. Only, we add,
that, to make such <hi>Connexions</hi> the
RULE to all others, you must allow
them to be <hi>Self-Connexions,</hi> or <hi>Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;</hi>
which is <hi>our</hi> Position. So that,
which way soever you wriggle, to
<hi>avoid</hi> our Rule, the Light of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reason, or Natural Logick, will
force you into it, whether you will
or no.</p>
            <p>24. As for the <hi>Dryness</hi> of Identical
Propositions, which goes not down
with some Men of Fancy, I have this
to add; that That which is objected
to them, as <hi>Scandalous,</hi> and <hi>Opprobrious,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100531:32"/>
is, in reality, a Great <hi>Commendation</hi> to
them. For, this Conceit of their <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
springs from their seeming <hi>too Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</hi>
Whereas, were not the very
<hi>First Principles,</hi> and the <hi>Rule of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Truths,</hi> thus most <hi>Plain, Easie</hi>
and <hi>Obvious,</hi> but needed <hi>the least Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion,</hi>
or <hi>Consideration,</hi> they would
be utterly unfit to be what they ought
to be; <hi>First Principles,</hi> and <hi>Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
Nothing pleases the Palate of
such Gentlemen, which is not <hi>New,</hi>
or such as they <hi>knew not before.</hi> Not
Reflecting, in the mean time, that
nothing is <hi>New,</hi> but <hi>Conclusions</hi> lately
Deduced; and that all First Principles
must be as <hi>Old</hi> as Nature, or <hi>Mankind</hi>
it self: Nor could they be the <hi>Rule of
Truth,</hi> which must oblige all Mankind
to see their Evidence, and Assent to
their Verity, were they otherwise.</p>
            <p>25. How pretty a Delusive Faculty
is this <hi>Fancy</hi> of ours! and, how apt,
if we be not aware, to decoy us, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Step, into <hi>Errour,</hi> by Customary
Appearances; which, by striking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon it, would fool our Reason!
Our own Thoughts, and those of
others, do, in all our Conversations,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100531:33"/>
use to come to us, clad in <hi>Words:</hi>
Whence it happens, that 'tis very
hard, liquidly and clearly to <hi>strip</hi> the
<hi>Sense</hi> from those <hi>Words;</hi> and to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>It,</hi> and <hi>nothing but It.</hi> If a Man
says, <hi>[Every Thing is Distinct from all
other Things,]</hi> none is apt to smile at
him, or impute it as Ridiculous, or
Foolish: But, if he says, <hi>[A Thing is
its self,]</hi> Witty Men can scarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their <hi>Iest</hi> at such an Idle Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And yet they are, most evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the self-same in <hi>Sense;</hi> for, that
which is <hi>Distinct from all others,</hi> must
either be <hi>its Self,</hi> or <hi>Nothing;</hi> and,
the taking away all <hi>Distinction,</hi> does,
almost in Terms, at least, most <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi>
and <hi>necessarily,</hi> put <hi>Identity.</hi> Let
us take another Instance: If one says,
<hi>[A Whole is more than a Part,]</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to such Men, wondrous Wise;
and, none blames him, in the least,
that says it, or lays it for a <hi>Principle.</hi>
But, if he says, and puts for a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<hi>[What's more than a Part, is more
than a Part,]</hi> it is good Luck if they
do not think he deserves <hi>Midas</hi>'s Ears.
Yet, both of these Propositions are the
<hi>self-same,</hi> and both of them <hi>equally,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100531:33"/>
and most perfectly Identical <hi>in Sense;</hi>
and only differ in the <hi>Manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</hi>
Which I thus shew: A <hi>Whole</hi>
consists of its <hi>Parts;</hi> and, since every
Thing <hi>is</hi> that of which it <hi>consists,</hi> A
Whole <hi>is</hi> its Parts. But, the Word
<hi>[Parts,]</hi> being <hi>Plural,</hi> signifies <hi>more
than One Part;</hi> Wherefore, <hi>[A Whole
is more than a Part,]</hi> is the same as to
say, <hi>[What's more than a Part, is more
than a Part;]</hi> which is as perfectly
Identical, as can be imagin'd. Nay,
more; If we regard it well, we shall
find, that the former Proposition had
not been known, Speculatively, to be
<hi>Self-evident,</hi> nor could have been <hi>made
out</hi> to be such, but because it is the
same with this later, whose Terms are
<hi>most formally</hi> Identical; to which, the
other is easily reduc'd.</p>
            <p>26. It will be ask'd, why we could
not let the Sense alone in its <hi>former</hi>
Dress, (which became it much better
than this other,) since it was Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
enough <hi>before?</hi> I answer; Because
the Self-evidence <hi>better appears,</hi> when it
is also brought to Terms most perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Identical; as any one may discern,
who compares the two Propositions
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100531:34"/>
now mention'd: And, hence also the
<hi>Sceptical</hi> Dissenter, or Denier, is most
<hi>forcibly,</hi> and unavoidably thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Open Contraction;</hi> for,
to Deny those Identicals, which are
such, not only in the <hi>Sense,</hi> but in the
<hi>manner of Expression</hi> too, is, to avow
a Contradiction propos'd <hi>bare-fac'd,</hi>
and in the <hi>plainest Terms;</hi> which
could not have appear'd <hi>so clearly</hi> from
the Terms of the <hi>former</hi> Proposition.
Lastly, A Brabbling <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> might
have drawn the Words, <hi>[Whole,]</hi> and
<hi>[Part,]</hi> into some sinister Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and have wrangl'd and quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
about them, by putting upon
them <hi>divers Senses;</hi> which he is quite
debarr'd of, when the Terms are <hi>thus</hi>
Identical: For, when the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>both</hi>
the Terms are the very <hi>self-same,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Sense he gives the Words of the
Subject, must be allow'd to the Words
of the Predicate too; so that he will
be put quite past his Shifts, and the
Proposition will still remain <hi>equally</hi>
Identical as it was <hi>before,</hi> maugre all
his Cavils, and Evasions.</p>
            <p>27. By this time I have, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
good reason to presume enough
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100531:34"/>
has been alledg'd by us, to prove that
our <hi>Rule of Truth</hi> is, in every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
qualify'd for such an Employ.
We will therefore, if you please, now
turn the Tables, and examine what
<hi>your</hi> Rule can pretend to; or, what it
it has in it, which can entitle it to be
such a <hi>Rule;</hi> or, in any respect, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ballance
what has been produc'd
for <hi>ours.</hi> To do which, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it, both as to the <hi>Act</hi> of your
Clear and Distinct Perception, the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Object</hi> of that Act; and, at
the same time, as to the <hi>Stability</hi> which
each of these may be conceiv'd to have
from its <hi>Ground.</hi> We will begin with
the <hi>Object,</hi> that determines your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Understanding to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi>
Particular <hi>Act.</hi> If I rightly conceive
the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Doctrine, the <hi>Immediate
Objects</hi> of your Clear and Distinct
Perception, are <hi>your Ideas,</hi> in which
appears this <hi>Truth</hi> which, you say,
you Clearly and Distinctly see. Now,
these <hi>Ideas</hi> of yours are, <hi>confessedly,</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
produc'd by a <hi>Second Cause,</hi> the
<hi>Mind</hi> it self; and not the <hi>Immediate</hi>
Work of the <hi>First Cause,</hi> on which
(as has been sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wn) <hi>our Rule</hi> is built:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100531:35"/>
Which gives <hi>ours</hi> an <hi>Infinite</hi> Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
above <hi>yours,</hi> as to the <hi>Stability</hi>
of its Ground: <hi>Ours</hi> having, for its
Solid Foundation, the Ideas in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Understanding; whence are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
<hi>Deriv'd,</hi> and by which
are <hi>Establish'd,</hi> the <hi>Essences</hi> of Things,
on which <hi>ours</hi> is Immediately Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Whereas, <hi>your Ideas</hi> are held by
your selves, to be the Creatures, or
<hi>Productions</hi> of your own <hi>Mind;</hi> which
(were it granted it <hi>could</hi> produce any
such Ideas) is a <hi>Defective Agent</hi> of its
own Nature; and, therefore, its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
so <hi>Uncertain,</hi> that it seems a
most strange piece of Doctrine, to
build all the Certain Truth and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Mankind can possibly have on
such an <hi>Unsteady</hi> Foundation. How
many Thousands, even of a fair Pitch
of Understanding, have mistaken <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fancies,</hi> for <hi>Evident Knowledge?</hi>
Must, therefore, all Truth be built on
a <hi>Mistakable</hi> Principle? Nay, more;
such Men, judging thus, by Mistake,
the Thing was <hi>Evident,</hi> taking them
as possess'd with such a Mistake, <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but Assent</hi> to it, as <hi>True,</hi> tho' it be
never so <hi>False:</hi> Must we therefore <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100531:35"/>
this Erroneous <hi>Ground</hi> of theirs,
into <hi>a Rule of Truth?</hi> Oh, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to God's Goodness, to take care,
that, since we <hi>cannot but Assent</hi> upon
such a Clear and Distinct Appearance,
we should not be <hi>forced upon Errour.</hi>
Why so? If you will needs leave the
Things his Wisdom has made, take
<hi>your own Way,</hi> and <hi>over-conceit</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of your own Faculty, in
judging you <hi>Clearly and Distinctly know</hi>
a Thing, when you do but <hi>fancy</hi> it; is
God's Providence answerable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
every over-weening Rashness of
ours? Doubtless, his Goodness is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

At least, it will be said, that
this Clear and Distinct Perception
is a Rule of Truth <hi>to us,</hi> tho' not to
Truth, consider'd <hi>in it self.</hi> But, if
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100531:36"/>
what we assent to upon that Imaginary
Ground, may still be false, for any
thing that Ground can assure us, how
can it be a Rule of Truth <hi>to any?</hi>
To return to our Ideas; The main
Point is, that it is so far from Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that there can be any such Ideas
<hi>Elicited,</hi> or <hi>Produced,</hi> by our Minds,
that there are many pretended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
against it; as may be
seen in <hi>Ideae Cartesianae Expensae, Exam.</hi>

are very many others in my <hi>Second
Preliminary,</hi> proving there can <hi>need
none;</hi> the <hi>Thing</hi> it self being objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our Understanding. To none
of which Demonstrations, I do expect
any Full and <hi>Solid Answer;</hi> but only,
perhaps, some <hi>slight Touches.</hi> I add,
that the Ideists themselves cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
amongst themselves, what kind
of Things these Spiritual Ideas should
be. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> makes them to be <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes;</hi>
Which Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> denies;
and, is so at variance with himself,
that he puts them to be many several
sorts of Things, and those <hi>Inconsistent</hi>
with one another; and so makes them
to be <hi>Chimeras.</hi> This Inconsonancy

of those Writers with one another,
and with their own selves, makes it
very Dubious that there <hi>are</hi> any <hi>such
Things</hi> as these <hi>Ideas,</hi> at all; at least, 'tis
Evident, that they who ground all
their Doctrine upon them, do not
know <hi>what</hi> they are; and, therefore,
they build all their <hi>Hypothesis</hi> on <hi>they
know not what.</hi> And, if this be so,
then the <hi>Immediate Object</hi> of their Clear
and Distinct Perception is, perhaps, a
<hi>Non-Entity;</hi> or, at least, <hi>such</hi> an Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as no Man living (nor themselves
neither) knows <hi>what to make of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28. Again; This <hi>Object,</hi> which you
Clearly and Distinctly see to be <hi>True,</hi>
must be some Mental Proposition; for,
nothing can be Formally True, but
some <hi>Speech that Affirms,</hi> or <hi>Denies.</hi>
Now, say we, 'tis most incontestable,
that the <hi>First</hi> Proposition we can make
of a Thing, is, to <hi>affirm</hi> its <hi>Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Verity;</hi> or, to say, <hi>'Tis this,</hi> (or
<hi>its self,)</hi> and <hi>no other:</hi> For, the <hi>Subject</hi>
being the <hi>Basis</hi> of all our Thoughts,
we must <hi>fix it</hi> certainly, Clearly and
Distinctly, ere we can, with <hi>Certainty,</hi>
say any thing <hi>else</hi> of it. This Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
then, say we, is such, that our
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100531:37"/>
Understanding no sooner opens its
Eye, to take a View of it, but it <hi>must</hi>
assent to it, because of the <hi>Self-evident
Identification of its Terms;</hi> whose <hi>Self-Evidence</hi>
we do therefore make our
<hi>Rule.</hi> It remains then, that you shew
us some Truth, or Proposition, which
is <hi>before</hi> this, (which we think to be
the <hi>First,)</hi> and which both makes it
self <hi>thus Visible;</hi> and also, by its Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident
Light, gives Clearness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibility
to <hi>all other</hi> Truths; and,
lastly, which is so <hi>Firmly Grounded,</hi>
that it may be a <hi>Solid</hi> First Principle,
and not an <hi>Aery</hi> and <hi>Phantastick</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.
You must then, (we say,) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
and shew us some <hi>other</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than that you have brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
which tells us your <hi>Clear</hi> and
<hi>Distinct Perception</hi> is <hi>your Rule;</hi> for,
this, you see, is already, by many Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable
Arguments, thrown out of
doors, and shewn Unfit to be a <hi>Rule.</hi>
And, till you do this, you ought not
to be offended, if we tell you friendly,
and plainly, that you have <hi>no Rule of
Truth at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29. Thus much for the Immediate
<hi>Object</hi> of your <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:100531:37"/>
As for the <hi>Act</hi> it <hi>self,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, Sir, consider on what a
<hi>Sandy Foundation</hi> you would build all
<hi>Truth.</hi> What signifies yours, or mine,
or any Man's <hi>Iudgment,</hi> that he <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Distinctly sees</hi> a Truth; or, that
he <hi>must</hi> Assent, or <hi>may not</hi> Assent to
it? What signifie these, I say, to the
<hi>Truth of the Thing?</hi> Must Truth be
built on Men's <hi>Iudgments,</hi> or their
<hi>Manner of Conceiving?</hi> What's True,
is <hi>Infallibly</hi> such; and this, by virtue
of its <hi>Grounds.</hi> Is our <hi>Iudgment,</hi> or
<hi>Manner of Conceiving,</hi> such a <hi>Certain
Ground,</hi> or <hi>Infallible?</hi> How many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
is the World full of, to prove
those Perceptions of ours, tho' judg'd
by us <hi>most Evident,</hi> to be Fallacious?
A Passionate Man, highly Injur'd, and
bent upon Revenge, <hi>judges</hi> it <hi>most E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident</hi>
that he ought to take his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Satisfaction: And, you can do
no more, but <hi>verily Iudge</hi> you have
this Clear and Distinct Perception, that
such or such a Proposition is True. I
am to presume, that those <hi>Cartesians</hi>
who stigmatiz'd me with the Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Note of being <hi>Impious against
God, &amp;c.</hi> judg'd they did <hi>Clearly</hi> see,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100531:38"/>
I was thus wicked; for, otherwise,
they left their <hi>own</hi> beloved <hi>Rule,</hi> to
<hi>blacken</hi> me; which is too high a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
for any Man to charge them with:
And yet, no Man living, as far as
my self, or my Friends, can discern,
did think so, but <hi>themselves;</hi> for, 'tis
hard to conceive, that, if others had
thought so, none of them should have
that Zeal for God's Honour, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it, or reprehend me for it: Nor
am I to doubt but they thought they
<hi>clearly and distinctly saw,</hi> that when I
said, <hi>Annihilation</hi> was <hi>Impossible,</hi> I did,
by that Doctrine, <hi>set upon God himself:</hi>
And, yet, tho' the Learned <hi>Albius</hi>
maintain'd the same, in his <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,</hi>
50 Years before, no Friend ever
admonish'd him, that by saying so, he
had fallen into a <hi>Wicked Errour:</hi> Nor
any of his Opposers, who were very
Learned Men, tho' they gather'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Propositions out of his Books,
which seem'd to sound ill, did ever
object <hi>This;</hi> whereas, had they judg'd
it Impious, they would not have spar'd
him, but have laid load upon him for
it. But, it seem'd, they all wanted
this Gift of Clear and Distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100531:38"/>
which is <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
To come to other Instances;
How frequently are People mistaken,
in <hi>thinking</hi> they have a <hi>Clear and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Perception,</hi> or <hi>Perfect Evidence!
Prejudice, Faction</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> work
this ill Effect, and make Men abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
judge they see <hi>most Evidently,</hi>
they are in the right. People far gone
in the <hi>Spleen,</hi> or a deep <hi>Melancholy,</hi> do
Assent, and Judge, perhaps, more
Firmly than you do, that they <hi>see
Clearly</hi> twenty Ridiculous Fooleries to
be <hi>True.</hi> High-flown <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> judge
the same. Pious Women, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in other Things, if much given
to Introversion, judge, they <hi>see clearly
and distinctly</hi> (nay, far <hi>more lively</hi> than
<hi>we</hi> do) many strange Things in their
Imaginary <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
that they would pawn their
very <hi>Souls</hi> for their <hi>Truth;</hi> which, yet,
are oft known, by their Effects, to be
meer <hi>Illusions of Fancy.</hi> From all which
Errours and Inconveniences, our <hi>Rule</hi>
is <hi>Free:</hi> For, who can, out of Humour,
Precipitancy, Fancy, Disease, or any
other Casualty whatever, be <hi>deceiv'd,</hi>
in Judging, that <hi>Identical Propositions</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:100531:39"/>
are <hi>True?</hi> This, then, unanswerably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<hi>ours</hi> to be the Genuin <hi>Rule of
Truth;</hi> in regard, this must be such as
all Men <hi>must</hi> be <hi>forc'd</hi> to Assent to, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
<hi>Agree</hi> in it, nor can ever hap
to be <hi>Deceiv'd</hi> in it by any Chance
whatever: Since, otherwise, the <hi>whole
Nature</hi> of those Men would be Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and good for nothing, as having
no Rule by which to know <hi>any</hi> Truth
<hi>whatever.</hi> Nay, it must be such as
may be <hi>produc'd openly,</hi> by the Asserters
of any Truth; that, by alledging <hi>It,</hi>
they may be able to convince <hi>others,</hi>
that what they maintain is a Real
Truth, and not some <hi>Phantastick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>
of their own; without which,
their Clear and Distinct Perception is
<hi>Invisible,</hi> and so can satisfie no Man;
nor clear themselves from being Self-conceited;
but, to argue like Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
who pretend they discern Things
by an <hi>Inward Light,</hi> which none can
see but <hi>themselves,</hi> nor they themselves
make it visible to <hi>others.</hi> Of which,
more hereafter.</p>
            <p>30. I beg of you, once more, (the
Point being of great Importance,) that
this Question, concerning your Rule,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100531:39"/>
may be rightly stated, and understood.
None doubts, but that, if we <hi>clearly</hi>
know a Thing <hi>to be</hi> True, <hi>it is True;</hi>
otherwise, it would follow, that we
may know what <hi>is not;</hi> or, (which
is the same,) <hi>may know</hi> that which is
<hi>not to be known.</hi> The only Question,
then, is, Whether we may not be Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in <hi>Iudging we know it,</hi> when,
indeed, we do <hi>not know</hi> it, but only
<hi>fancy</hi> it: Which is a Thing so Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
amongst all Mankind, that not
very many escape this Fault of <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening.</hi>
Wherefore, ere you can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that this Rule of yours is <hi>Useful,</hi>
and a <hi>Certain Means</hi> to know Truth,
you should first prescribe us some Self-evident
Rule, how we may <hi>know assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,</hi>
that our <hi>Iudgment</hi> that we do
Clearly and Distinctly know a Thing,
is not a <hi>Mistake:</hi> For, otherwise, we
are often apt to think we do most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>know</hi> a Thing, when we have
only a <hi>Lively Apprehension,</hi> or <hi>Fancy</hi> of
it. Besides which, this Rule must have
Force upon <hi>all Mankind,</hi> that we may
easily make it out to <hi>others,</hi> that we do
<hi>indeed</hi> and really <hi>know,</hi> and not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>presume</hi> we know, when, perhaps,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100531:40"/>
we <hi>do not:</hi> Otherwise, it will neither
give <hi>others,</hi> nor <hi>our selves,</hi> any Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
that what we <hi>imagin</hi> we know,
is <hi>True.</hi> This is the true Difficulty;
and against this, I do not discern any
effectual Provision made by you; nor
how you <hi>can</hi> make <hi>any,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
recourse to the Self-evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of the Terms in an Identical
Proposition. This Self-evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
we can <hi>produce openly,</hi> to every
Man's Eye; whereas, you cannot <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi>
your pretended Clear and Distinct
Perception to <hi>any</hi> Man: And, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when thus <hi>produced</hi> by us, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
not to be <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>acknowledg'd</hi>
by any Man, who has any Use of his
Intellectual Faculty, 'tis able to give
perfect Satisfaction to <hi>our selves,</hi> and to
<hi>others</hi> also, that we neither <hi>are,</hi> nor <hi>can
be</hi> Mistaken in our Judgment, that we
<hi>do</hi> really and indeed <hi>Know</hi> it; and, not
only <hi>Deem</hi> it. You see, Sir, where the
Difficulty pinches. That can never be
a Certain Rule to <hi>me,</hi> or to <hi>any Man,</hi>
which I can never be sure I make use
of: Now, 'tis evident by what is said
here, I cannot be assur'd I do <hi>clearly
and distinctly know,</hi> unless my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100531:40"/>
that I <hi>do so</hi> be secur'd from <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take:</hi>
For, if I be mistaken in that
Judgment, and <hi>do not</hi> clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
know, your Rule affects not
me at all; nor am I a jot the <hi>better</hi> for
it, or nearer the Knowing any Truth
<hi>by it:</hi> But, which is yet worse; 'tis
Evident from this Discourse, that there
needs <hi>another</hi> Rule of Knowing, <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi>
to yours, to guide my <hi>Iudgment</hi>
that I <hi>do</hi> clearly and distinctly <hi>know,</hi>
and do not <hi>mistake,</hi> or rashly <hi>presume</hi> I
know; as we experience, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Mankind does. Which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
concludes, that the Proposition
by which you express your pretended
Rule of Knowing, may, indeed, be a
Truth, (in case you <hi>do</hi> really know,)
but can never be a <hi>Rule of Truth</hi> to you,
me, or any Man: For, this must be
<hi>First known,</hi> or <hi>Self-known,</hi> to all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi>
or otherwise, it needs <hi>another</hi>
Antecedent Rule, to make it Useful;
and, so it is <hi>Ruled,</hi> and <hi>no Rule.</hi> Here
it is, then, that the Point <hi>sticks;</hi> and,
here 'tis <hi>like to stick,</hi> for any thing I
can imagin, in behalf of the <hi>Cartesians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>31. I am apt to apprehend, that
your Acute Wit will object, that <hi>some
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100531:41"/>
few</hi> of those <hi>Instances</hi> I alledg'd former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of Men who verily judg'd they
<hi>clearly and distinctly knew</hi> such and such
Things to be True, and yet were mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in thus Judging, do fall short of
Concluding; I mean, <hi>those</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
People in <hi>Diseases;</hi> which you
may, with some reason, think, are
known to be plain Deviations from
Nature, by an easie <hi>Criterion; viz.</hi> by
the <hi>Standard of Mankind,</hi> who have
the <hi>right Use</hi> of their <hi>Reason.</hi> Which
I shall not contest with you; nor had
I brought such as these, but that I see
your Writers bring the same against
the Certainty of our Senses; as, that
<hi>Icterical</hi> People see all Things <hi>Yellow,</hi>
and such like; which are solv'd by the
same <hi>Criterion.</hi> But, what are these
to many <hi>others</hi> which I there alledg'd;
and could press farther, were it suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Brevity I had intended. To
force that Objection home, what shall
we think of <hi>Speculative Men,</hi> and <hi>Great
Philosophers;</hi> nay, of many <hi>Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians,</hi>
who thought they had
most certainly <hi>Squar'd the Circle?</hi> They
are held to be Men in their perfect
Wits; nay, they are held to be <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:100531:41"/>
too; and, moreover, <hi>Learned;</hi> and,
which is more, both Sides offer <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations</hi>
for their Tenet; and have,
oft-times, great Multitudes that follow
them, and embrace their Doctrine.
Can it be deny'd, but that such very
<hi>Learned, Acute</hi> and <hi>Ingenious</hi> Men do
verily Judge that they <hi>clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
see</hi> their Doctrine to be True?
And yet, we are certain that, since
they <hi>contradict</hi> one another, <hi>one</hi> Side
must needs be in an <hi>Errour</hi> in that
Judgment. We will bring it yet near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
home, and lay it even at our own
Doors.</p>
            <p>32. I do not doubt, but your self
(for, I cannot suspect your Candour)
does verily judge that you <hi>clearly and
distinctly perceive,</hi> or (which is the
same) have <hi>Perfect Evidence,</hi> that <hi>your</hi>
Way of <hi>Ideas</hi> is the <hi>True</hi> Way to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
And <hi>I,</hi> on the <hi>other</hi> side, am as
fully persuaded, as that I <hi>live,</hi> that I do
<hi>clearly and distinctly see,</hi> it is so far from
being the <hi>Way</hi> to Science, that it is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Groundless,</hi> and leads to <hi>Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Errours.</hi> That <hi>you</hi> are thus persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
seems <hi>very Evident</hi> to <hi>you;</hi> for
which, I am very willing to take your
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100531:42"/>
               <hi>Word.</hi> And, that <hi>I</hi> am thus fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
I do Clearly and Distinctly see
the <hi>Contrary,</hi> besides my faithful Asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration,
I believe Indifferent Men
will think I have given sufficient Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
by bringing so many pretended
Demonstrations <hi>against your Way;</hi> and
hazarding my Credit, by <hi>vouching</hi> them
to be <hi>Conclusive;</hi> which, therefore, are
so many <hi>Sure Gages</hi> for my <hi>Sincerity,</hi>
when I declare this to be my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Add, that these Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are not like Flashes of <hi>Wit,</hi> coin'd
by my own Brain; for, then, perhaps,
I might, for some by-end of Applause,
or some such Foolery, have <hi>falsly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
they were my true Thoughts:
But, they are all built upon the Nature
of the <hi>Thing,</hi> or Subject in hand;
which being Establish'd to <hi>be what it is,</hi>
'tis beyond the Wit or Power of Man,
to make, marr, alter, or deface it; and,
should I go about to <hi>disguize</hi> or <hi>mis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present</hi>
it, 'tis easie for any Adversary to
shew, I speak Contradictions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
me to open Shame for my <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
Ignorance: For, what is <hi>against</hi>
the Nature of the Thing, makes that
Thing <hi>to be what it is not;</hi> which is a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100531:42"/>
plain Contradiction. This, then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so manifest, that I may convince
you by your own Method, Why ought
not you, by your Way of <hi>Doubting</hi> of
every thing that has any Shew or Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of <hi>Falshood,</hi> or any <hi>Uncertainty,</hi>
to lay aside, and renounce <hi>your Rule of
Truth,</hi> as <hi>Uncertain</hi> and <hi>Fallacious;</hi> since
we do <hi>both</hi> of us <hi>follow</hi> it to our
power; and, yet, since we <hi>contradict</hi>
one another so Diametrically, one of
us is, notwithstanding, in a <hi>vast Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour!</hi>
Here is <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> then,
against the Usefulness of <hi>your Rule;</hi>
and that too, as Certain, and Evident,
as that one (or both of us) is not the
worst sort of Hypocrites; that is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
himself, and his <hi>own</hi> Thoughts:
Whereas, I believe, no Man that knows
either of us, had ever such a bad Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of us. I could press this Topick
much farther; but I had rather leave
it to your Sincere and Deliberate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
            <p>33. The <hi>Rule</hi> by which we are to
<hi>know Truth,</hi> ought therefore, (as was
said,) in such a manner <hi>oblige</hi> all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to <hi>Assent,</hi> that it should be apt,
of it self, to <hi>compose</hi> all <hi>Differences</hi> in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100531:43"/>
Opinion, by Applying, and Bearing
up to it: Whereas, yours can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>none</hi> at all; but, contrariwise, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
Learned Men in an <hi>Endless Wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</hi>
We both grant, That if we <hi>see</hi> a
Thing clearly to be True, it <hi>is</hi> True;
since Common Sense tells every Man,
that none can <hi>see</hi> what <hi>is not to be seen:</hi>
Nor is there any such Mystery, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stership,
in advancing this obvious
Position; or, for magnifying <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
so highly, for <hi>inventing</hi> it; since,
I think, no Man living ever deny'd it.
The Question is, Which of us has this
<hi>True Evidence,</hi> which you call <hi>Clear
and Distinct Perception?</hi> You will say,
<hi>you have it,</hi> and <hi>I want it:</hi> I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that <hi>I have it,</hi> and <hi>you want it.
You</hi> will blame some Defect in <hi>my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
or some untoward <hi>Byass</hi> or
<hi>Propension of my Will,</hi> both which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. <hi>Le Grand, (p. 93.)</hi> can
make one deceiv'd in thinking that he
evidently <hi>perceives:</hi> And I, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, think I may, with <hi>equal</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
blame <hi>yours:</hi> And, so, we may
come to lay the Fault, either on the
<hi>Weakness</hi> of one another's <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or the <hi>Depravedness</hi> of his <hi>Will;</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:100531:43"/>
which naturally leads Men to pelt one
another with <hi>Rash Iudgments,</hi> and <hi>hard
Words:</hi> But, since we can, neither of
us, <hi>see</hi> one another's <hi>Thoughts,</hi> or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to others, how <hi>Clear</hi> they are,
which is <hi>your</hi> Way; both sides will
still remain as far from <hi>Conviction,</hi> and
the Point from <hi>Decision,</hi> as at first, for
any thing <hi>your Rule</hi> helps either of us.
And, if we set aside Propositions and
Discourses, and the shewing that their
Terms are <hi>Undeniably Connected,</hi> and
therefore, Themselves <hi>certainly True;</hi>
(which is <hi>not yo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Way;)</hi> how, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, shall Men ever come to a
<hi>Final Conclusion</hi> by dint of <hi>Reason,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being put to it to <hi>avail</hi> themselves
by <hi>Ill Words,</hi> and <hi>Passion;</hi> which (I
fear, by proceeding upon your Rule;
for, you pretend not to have produced
any <hi>Connexion of Terms)</hi> has been such
a Stickler, of late, to uphold the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian</hi>
Cause?</p>
            <p>34. This seem'd to me so Odd a
Procedure, that I begg'd the Favour of
you, to acquaint me, <hi>how,</hi> or by <hi>what</hi>
Means, you would make <hi>others</hi> know
you had, indeed, this Clear and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Perception; or, how you could
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100531:44"/>
               <hi>prove</hi> you had it, but by making use
of <hi>Propositions</hi> and <hi>Discourses;</hi> the Force
of which consists only in <hi>Affirming, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying,</hi>
or <hi>Inferring;</hi> that is, in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,</hi>
or <hi>Inconnexion</hi> of the Terms.
As I remember, your Answer was, by
<hi>Explicating</hi> to them clearly the Point,
and desiring them to <hi>Meditate</hi> upon it:
Which Way you seem'd to magnifie
very much. I could have alledg'd,
that you could not have propos'd, or
us'd, even <hi>this</hi> Way, without making
use of <hi>Propositions,</hi> and <hi>Discourses:</hi> But,
letting you proceed, I barr'd <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
if they were brought (as it here
seem'd) to evacuate any Need of <hi>Proof:</hi>
For, <hi>Explicating,</hi> as contradistinguish'd
to <hi>Proving,</hi> amounts to no more but a
kind of <hi>Rhetorical Persuasive,</hi> made up
of <hi>Similitudes, Parallels, Allusions,</hi> and
such little sorts of light, Witty Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
which may serve, and are made
use of, in a manner, <hi>equally,</hi> to abet <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi>
as well as <hi>Truth.</hi> Indeed, if the
<hi>Terms</hi> of the Question be <hi>Dubious,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
are needful, and very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site;
lest, otherwise, we level our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
at a wrong <hi>Thesis:</hi> But, if the
Point in question be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100531:44"/>
by both Parties, it must either be
<hi>Prov'd,</hi> if it be not <hi>Self-evident</hi> and
<hi>needs no Proof;</hi> or, it must remain for
ever <hi>Uncertain,</hi> and <hi>Undecided.</hi> I should
be glad to know whether, or no, you
would go about to convince such a
Man by <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Principles?</hi> If you
say, <hi>you would,</hi> and that you think <hi>you
can do this:</hi> then you wrong your Cause
exceedingly, by waving the Mention
of such <hi>Strong Supports</hi> as <hi>Principles</hi> and
<hi>Grounds;</hi> and Recurring to, and Rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on such Unsteady, Feeble <hi>Reeds</hi> as
<hi>Explications.</hi> If you say, you <hi>cannot</hi>
evince your Thesis by <hi>Principles;</hi> then
all your <hi>Explications,</hi> tho' never so
Witty, are, confessedly, <hi>Unprincipl'd,</hi>
and <hi>Groundless.</hi> If you pretend, your
Explications do <hi>involve</hi> Proofs in them;
'tis clearly for the Interest of your
Cause, to make use of the <hi>Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
part of such Discourses, and leave
out the <hi>Explicative:</hi> For, 'tis certain,
that the Argument, if a good one, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
upon some Solid <hi>Principle;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
an Explication may be without <hi>any
at all.</hi> It will therefore, to any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Man, be a strong Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> and make Men
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100531:45"/>
apt to think they have <hi>no</hi> Grounds or
Principles <hi>at all,</hi> that they do not much
<hi>pretend</hi> to them, much less <hi>build</hi> their
Discourses on them, or <hi>reduce</hi> them
to them; but seem to <hi>abdicate</hi> them,
while they place their chief Support in
<hi>Explications.</hi> In a Word; Let the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
be first <hi>Prov'd</hi> to be <hi>True,</hi> or all
<hi>Explications</hi> are <hi>Frivolous:</hi> For, to what
purpose is it to stand Explicating a
<hi>Falshood?</hi> The nature of all Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is, to give us the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
propos'd; but, let it be first <hi>Prov'd,</hi>
and <hi>Seen</hi> that it bears <hi>good Sense;</hi> for,
'tis a very sleevless Task, to stand <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating
Nonsense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>35. On this Occasion, it were not
amiss to note here a certain manner of
Writing, very frequent amongst some
Modern Philosophers; which is apt to
lead the Generality of Learners into
very great Errours. We do, all of us,
naturally affect <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we love to read Authors that are
<hi>Clear,</hi> or write <hi>clearly;</hi> as being very
<hi>Knowable,</hi> or <hi>Intelligible.</hi> But, now,
<hi>Clearness</hi> is of <hi>Two</hi> sorts: The <hi>one</hi> makes
Clear the <hi>Thoughts of the Writer;</hi> The
<hi>Other</hi> makes Clear the <hi>Truth of the Point</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:100531:45"/>
he writes of. The <hi>One</hi> expresses clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his <hi>own Meaning,</hi> when he says thus:
The <hi>Other</hi> manifests clearly, that he <hi>says
True</hi> when he says thus. The Former is
perform'd by means of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and
<hi>Witty Expressions:</hi> The Other can only
be done by <hi>Solid Principles,</hi> and by <hi>True
Logick.</hi> But, it too often happens,
that those Readers who have not a
Strong Bent to see Truth, and, with a
steady Aim, pursue it, and <hi>It only,</hi> are
so well appay'd with the Clear Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of an Author, in delivering his
<hi>own Mind;</hi> which cannot but be very
Pretty, and Taking, being, generally,
neatly clad; that they are, at unawares,
Decoy'd to think the <hi>Thing</hi> it self is
Clear, when 'tis only the <hi>Sentiment</hi> of
the Author which is render'd so Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
especially, if there be also some
<hi>slight Shew</hi> of Coherence; which sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
wants, if the Writer be a Man of
Parts. And, yet, perhaps, all this while,
were that Discourse strip'd of its Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
Gayity, and sounded to the
bottom, nothing will be found to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
its <hi>Truth;</hi> but it will appear Plain
Bald Nonsense <hi>en cuerpo.</hi> On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, it lights so, that Discourses
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100531:46"/>
that are <hi>Solid,</hi> and built all along on
<hi>Evident Principles,</hi> (only which can
clear the <hi>Truth of the Point,)</hi> do want
the <hi>other</hi> sort of Clearness, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in <hi>Explicating,</hi> to recommend them
to the Liking of the Reader. And this
happens for <hi>Two</hi> Reasons: One, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Principles</hi> do consist of <hi>Few</hi>
Words, or Notions; and those too,
such as are <hi>General,</hi> or <hi>Universal</hi> ones;
which do not admit such varying the
Phrase, or Smooth Explications, to
make them <hi>more Knowable;</hi> their Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
consisting only in the <hi>greater Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi>
of those General Terms, and
their <hi>Close Connexion.</hi> The Second Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, that those Writers who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to look <hi>deep</hi> into the <hi>Foundation</hi>
and <hi>Principles</hi> on which Truth is <hi>Groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
and are not satisfy'd with <hi>Skim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
over Questions <hi>superficially,</hi> do not
care to avail themselves by <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and the Way of <hi>Smooth Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi>
but quite <hi>dis-regard</hi> them, and
judge them only <hi>Luke-warm Words</hi> in
their present Circumstances; because
they neither conduce to the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Science, nor to <hi>Settle</hi> and
Clear the <hi>Truth of the Thesis;</hi> which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100531:46"/>
such Men see can only be done by
the <hi>Strict</hi> and <hi>Evident Connexion</hi> of
their Notions. To apply this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
I intreat you, Sir, to consider
whether the Former Sort of Clearness
be not that which the <hi>Cartesians</hi> affect;
the <hi>Second,</hi> that which we take, and
pursue. I shall hope, that whoever
peruses my METHOD to SCIENCE,
with an Attentive and Indifferent Eye,
will easily observe, that I first put my
<hi>Thesis,</hi> and then endeavour to establish
it by <hi>rigorous Proofs,</hi> drawn from the
Nature of the <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Subject</hi> treated
of in those respective Places: And that
the <hi>Cartesians</hi> do not use to take any
such Method, but place their Hopes of
recommending their Tenets to the
Reader's Approbation, in their <hi>Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
Which makes it so difficult
for a Logician to find where their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<hi>lie hid,</hi> or where they <hi>press;</hi>
of which, with just Reason, I so often
complain.</p>
            <p>36. Thus much concerning your
Method of <hi>Proving</hi> by <hi>Explicating;</hi> or
rather, of <hi>substituting</hi> Explications in
the place of <hi>Proofs.</hi> As for the other
part of your Method, which is, your
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100531:47"/>
putting Learners to <hi>Meditate</hi> long and
seriously, upon what you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to them, I lik'd that as ill as I
did that of <hi>Explicating:</hi> And, my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because, unless Men take <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
along with them, to guide their
Thoughts <hi>right,</hi> and keep an Attentive
Eye to them, while they thus <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate;</hi>
'tis to be fear'd, their long <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating</hi>
will, by its <hi>frequent Dints,</hi> so
<hi>imprint</hi> and <hi>fix</hi> what you have told
them, in their Brain; and, at length,
make it <hi>sink</hi> so <hi>deep</hi> into their Minds,
that, whether it be Right or Wrong,
it will <hi>stick</hi> there, as daily Experience
shews us; Custom, a <hi>Second Nature,</hi>
having a very powerful Ascendent
over the Understanding, to imbue us
with <hi>False</hi> Impressions, by the <hi>oft-rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated</hi>
Thinking upon any Point that
is Disputable; especially, Ingenious
Explications (as was shewn lately) too
often serving for Reasons, to those
who are not well vers'd in <hi>True Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>37. But, the main Objection I make,
is, That this Method of yours quite
<hi>overthrows</hi> the <hi>Rule of Truth,</hi> which
you intended to establish by it. For,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100531:47"/>
this <hi>Rule</hi> being that, upon which all
all our <hi>Knowledge of Truth</hi> depends,
must be so very Clear of it self, above
any thing we can add to its <hi>Highest
Evidence,</hi> that it cannot possibly need
any <hi>Explication,</hi> nor <hi>Meditation</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Nor, consequently, can any
stronger Argument be brought, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
that this Rule of yours is
not the <hi>Right</hi> one, than 'tis to confess
or pretend that it stands in <hi>need</hi> of, or,
even, can <hi>admit</hi> Assistance, or Light,
either from the one, or the other.
For, if it can need any <hi>Explication,</hi> it
follows, that it must be something <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure:</hi>
And, if it can need <hi>Poring</hi> and
<hi>Meditating</hi> upon it, ere it be <hi>admitted,</hi>
or can be <hi>known,</hi> then 'tis far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>most Self-evident:</hi> Both which ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<hi>destroy</hi> the Nature of <hi>such a Rule.</hi>
For, since we must know <hi>all other</hi>
Truths <hi>by It,</hi> its Evidence must be the
<hi>First</hi> Thing to be known; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Knowledge of <hi>its</hi> Truth must
antecede the Knowlege of all <hi>other</hi>
Truths whatsoever, and be <hi>Clearer</hi> than
They. Which being so manifest, I
wonder what Thoughts or Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
our <hi>Explicating</hi> or <hi>Meditating</hi> can
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100531:48"/>
suggest, that can do this First <hi>Rule of
Truth</hi> any Service, or give it any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
since, all others being <hi>more Obscure</hi>
than <hi>It,</hi> they may, indeed, (could they
affect it,) impart to it their own <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Obscurity,</hi> and make it <hi>less Clear</hi> and
<hi>Intelligible</hi> than it was; but, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make it <hi>Clearer,</hi> as having no <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
but <hi>far less</hi> Clearness themselves.
Lastly, As this pretended Necessity of
<hi>Explicating,</hi> and <hi>Meditating,</hi> quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades
<hi>yours</hi> from being the <hi>Genuin,
First,</hi> and, consequently, the <hi>Right</hi>
Rule of Knowing Truth; so it <hi>abets
ours,</hi> and gives it a Clear Title to be
<hi>such a Rule,</hi> since the <hi>Self-evidence</hi> of
those <hi>First Truths,</hi> express'd by Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Propositions, (which is <hi>our</hi> Rule,)
is such, as is both Impossible to be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated,</hi>
and Impossible to need <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating,</hi>
to clear it to us; but, at the
first Instant we open the Eye of our
Mind, it <hi>discovers it self fully</hi> to all
Mankind, to be <hi>most True;</hi> and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<hi>begets, forces</hi> and <hi>fixes</hi> us in a Full
and Firm <hi>Assent</hi> to its Verity.</p>
            <p>38. Perhaps it will be alledg'd, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
what I have said above,
That this Clear and Distinct Perception
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100531:48"/>
is not pretended to be a Rule of Truth
<hi>in it self,</hi> so that it establishes Truth
Fundamentally; but of Truth <hi>to us,</hi>
or, (as the Schools phrase it,) <hi>quoad
nos;</hi> that is, a Rule whereby <hi>we may
know</hi> what's Truth, what not: And,
it seems, that it cannot be deny'd to
be <hi>such</hi> a Rule, in regard 'tis Evident
that we <hi>must</hi> Assent, or hold a Thing
<hi>True,</hi> when we see clearly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>it is so;</hi> nor ought we to <hi>Assent,</hi> or
<hi>hold it to be True,</hi> unless we do clearly
and distinctly see it <hi>to be so.</hi> I answer,
That this Pretence is already fore-stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
in divers places of my former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
where it was shewn, by many
Instances, that, even in the Opinions
Learned Men held, this Guiding our
Thoughts and Judgments by what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to us a Clear and Distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
is Uncertain, and Fallacious.
Whence, in the Thesis constituting
this to be your <hi>Rule,</hi> there is tacitly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
a False Supposition; <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>z.</hi> That
that <hi>Perception,</hi> on which we solely rely, is
<hi>Unmistakable</hi> by us: For, if we may
<hi>mistake</hi> it to be <hi>really</hi> a Perception thus
qualify'd, when it <hi>is not,</hi> then our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
may be Erroneous; and, how can
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100531:49"/>
an Erroneous Judgment, in any Sense,
be <hi>True to us,</hi> or make <hi>us know</hi> a Thing
to be True? If I am to draw a straight
Line, and the Rule by which I guide
my self be sometimes <hi>Straight,</hi> and
sometimes <hi>Crooked,</hi> how is it a RULE
<hi>to me,</hi> in that Action, or Draught?
2. In constituting this Perception to
be your Rule, you begin <hi>at the wrong
End:</hi> For, seeing this Perception is
an <hi>Act,</hi> and that the Object specifies
every Act, and makes it <hi>such as it is;</hi>
the <hi>Object,</hi> or Thing, must be True <hi>in
it self;</hi> and, by being <hi>in it self</hi> True,
it <hi>thence</hi> makes our Judgment (when
we rightly conceive it) to be <hi>True al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</hi>
This Distinction, then, in our
present Case, is altogether <hi>Frivolous;</hi>
and the alledging it, <hi>Preposterous. 3. To
Perceive,</hi> is an Act of the <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and the same as <hi>To Know;</hi> and,
to <hi>Perceive Clearly and Distinctly,</hi> is the
same as <hi>to know perfectly.</hi> Whence
follows, that to say, [I <hi>know</hi> that to
be True, which I clearly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Perceive</hi> to be <hi>so,]</hi> is the very self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
Sense, as to say, [What I <hi>know</hi>
to be True, I <hi>know</hi> to be True;] or,
[I <hi>know what I know:]</hi> Which is a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100531:49"/>
good Confident Saying; and, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<hi>True</hi> too. But, nothing can be
more ridiculous, than to make <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the <hi>Rule</hi> of Knowing, or a Rule
to make a Thing <hi>True to us.</hi> To say,
[A Thing <hi>is,</hi> because <hi>it is;]</hi> or, [I <hi>know
it,</hi> because I <hi>Know it;]</hi> is more like
a <hi>Woman</hi>'s Reason, when she is <hi>Fix'd,</hi>
and <hi>Wilful;</hi> than a <hi>Rational Man</hi>'s, or
a Philosopher's.</p>
            <p>39. The Ingenious Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>
seems to go more charily to work, by
putting his Rule of Truth, <hi>(Dissert.
pag. 86)</hi> in these Terms, <hi>[Illud omne
Verum est quod clarè &amp; distinctè percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.]</hi>
He does not say, <hi>[quod percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
esse Verum;]</hi> but barely, <hi>[quod per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur.]</hi>
Which Words do not tell us,
whether he speaks of our <hi>Perception</hi>
by the First Operation of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<hi>simply Apprehending a Thing;</hi>
or of the <hi>Second,</hi> which is express'd by
a <hi>Proposition.</hi> But, this still falls into
the same: For, if he means the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
then, since Simple Apprehensions
have neither Truth nor Falsity in them,
being no more but, barely, what's
<hi>meant,</hi> or signify'd, by the <hi>Words;</hi> it
cannot follow, that what I <hi>clearly and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100531:50"/>
distinctly</hi> thus perceive, is therefore <hi>True:</hi>
For, I simply apprehend, and this clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and distinctly too, the Meaning of
these Words, [A Triangle has four
Corners;] yet tis far from being <hi>True,</hi>
being a plain <hi>Contradiction.</hi> He must
mean then, that I am to perceive the
Sense or Meaning of those Words to
be <hi>Connected,</hi> which is done by putting
them into a <hi>Proposition;</hi> and then his
Rule must run thus, [Whatever Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Apprehensions I see clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
to be <hi>Connected</hi> in a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Proposition</hi> is <hi>True:]</hi> Which
is that very Rule which we advance,
and the <hi>Cartesians</hi> would avoid. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we say, That to make this a Rule,
we must see the Parts of it <hi>Self-connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
or <hi>Self-evident;</hi> for, all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions
are made, by the Terms being
Connected by means of a <hi>Third;</hi> which
is the same as to be <hi>Deduced,</hi> or <hi>Prov'd.</hi>
But, these Connexions being, all of
them, <hi>Conclusions,</hi> they cannot pretend
to be <hi>Rules,</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> since they
must depend on such <hi>Rules,</hi> as shew
those Conclusions <hi>must follow.</hi> Again,
If he means, (as he must, if he means
any thing,) that his Rule is, That we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100531:50"/>
must see those Simple Apprehensions,
which we call the <hi>Terms,</hi> Connected
in a <hi>Proposition;</hi> then we must see, or
clearly <hi>perceive,</hi> that that Proposition is
<hi>True:</hi> And then, his Principle must run
thus; <hi>[Whatever Proposition I clearly and
distinctly perceive to be True, is known by
me to be True:]</hi> Wherefore, since to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
thus, is, to <hi>know;</hi> and that, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by <hi>Cartesius</hi>'s Words, there cited,
he speaks of what's <hi>Verum mihi,</hi> as the
Effect of his Principle; that is, of what
I <hi>know</hi> to be True; join these two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and this Principle, or Rule,
does manifestly amount to this; <hi>[That
which I know to be True, I know to be
True;]</hi> which is a most prodigious
<hi>Rule</hi> of Knowledge; and yet, this is
most evidently the Sense of it, in case
to <hi>Perceive</hi> means, to <hi>know;</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
mihi</hi> means that which <hi>I know
to be True:</hi> which, I think, is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
by any Man of Common
Sense. And, I wonder how the Great
Wit of <hi>Cartesius</hi> could imagin that any
thing could be True to <hi>Him,</hi> unless he
first saw it to be True <hi>in it self,</hi> which
it has from its <hi>Grounds;</hi> unless he
makes account, that a Thing may be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100531:51"/>
               <hi>True to him,</hi> which, <hi>in it self,</hi> is <hi>False:</hi>
Which makes those two Truths <hi>fall
out,</hi> and <hi>contradict</hi> one another, which
I ever took to be very good Friends.
This makes me wish that the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> who tells us here,
<hi>p.</hi> 92. that there goes more to a <hi>Rule,</hi>
than to a <hi>Truth,</hi> had told us, in what a
<hi>Truth,</hi> and in what the Nature of a <hi>Rule</hi>
consists; which we plainly deliver, by
affirming that a Truth consists in the
Connexion of the main Parts (or
Terms) of any <hi>Thesis;</hi> and a Rule in the
<hi>Self-Connexion</hi> of them, by Formal I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity;
whence, such Rules become
<hi>Self-evident</hi> to all Mankind, and able to
<hi>impart</hi> their Light to all other Truths
whatever. But, this shews the Genius
of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Writers: They take
what's <hi>uppermost,</hi> and descant very
prettily and gentilely upon it; which,
being Obvious, and Facil, does migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
please the Fancy of the Readers:
But, they go not to the Bottom of any
Question. They <hi>rake</hi> the <hi>Surface</hi> of
the most <hi>Difficult</hi> Points; but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>dig deep</hi> into it, to find out the
<hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> on which Truth
is <hi>built.</hi> And, I hope, the Reasons I
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100531:51"/>
have alledg'd, both here, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
will satisfie my Readers, that
it is not the ridiculous Motive of
Pique, or Humour, which makes me
give this Character of their Way of
Writing; but, meerly, the Duty
I owe to Truth, which obliges me to
do it.</p>
            <p>Thus, worthy Sir, I have us'd the
best Reason I was Master of, in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
exactly, and understanding
rightly, your <hi>Rule of Truth;</hi> and I have
endeavour'd to stop all the Starting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes,
by which the <hi>Cartesians</hi> may
think to evade the Force of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
Which done, I presume I
may take my leave of this Point, and
apply my Discourse to what follow'd
next at our Interview.</p>
            <p>40. My Design, at the beginning of
our Conference, was to convince you,
that Truth consisted in the <hi>Connexion
of the Terms,</hi> in those Speeches we
call'd <hi>Propositions;</hi> which evinc'd, I
made account I could easily prove,
that the <hi>very First Truths,</hi> which were
to give Light to all others, or be the
<hi>Rule of Truth,</hi> were such Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as were <hi>Self-connected,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100531:52"/>
               <hi>Self-evident.</hi> How your over-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
way of <hi>Doubting</hi> defeated my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and stop'd my Progress, is
seen above. Sorry to have been put
out of that <hi>Direct Road,</hi> which I saw
was the only <hi>Right</hi> one, and without
settling which, all our Discourse would
be <hi>Unconnected Talk</hi> to no purpose, I
was casting about how to get into it
again. But a Learned and Judicious
Friend of ours, who was present, sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
that <hi>[Cogito ergo sum]</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by you to be a <hi>First Principle;</hi>
and, he prest earnestly it might be
thorowly examin'd, that we might
see whether it had in it the nature of
a <hi>First Principle,</hi> or no. I was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
troubled to relinquish the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
I had prefix'd to my self; without
which, I saw, the Nature of a <hi>First
Principle</hi> could not be settled, nor
shewn: However, I yielded to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
I allow'd then, that <hi>[Cogito er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
sum]</hi> was a <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Evident Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
as are a thousand such others,
<hi>viz. Dabito ergo sum; Scribo, ambulo,
dormio;</hi> nay, <hi>Somnio ergo sum, &amp;c.)</hi>
which is what, with Unattentive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderers,
give it all its Credit, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100531:52"/>
makes them look upon us, as Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Men, who, as they apprehend,
do question this Consequence, or call
it into Doubt. But they are quite
mistaken; there is no Body that
doubts it is an <hi>Evident Consequence;</hi>
but, there is a very wide Difference
between a <hi>Consequence</hi> and a <hi>Principle;</hi>
or rather, if it be a <hi>Consequence,</hi> tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so good, it can never be a <hi>First
Principle,</hi> because, the Premisses, which
induced that Consequence, were before
it; and that Truth, on which all force of
Consequence is grounded,, (as was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above,) is before either of them.
What we affirm then is, that it is not a
<hi>First Principle,</hi> nor could be so to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesius,</hi>
when he propos'd, and made use
of it as such: And I addrest my self, to
show it had not in it, the <hi>nature</hi> of
<hi>such</hi> a <hi>Principle,</hi> nor could, with <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
be pretended such by <hi>Cartesius</hi>
himself.</p>
            <p>41. To prove this, I alledg'd, that
it is an Inseparable Property, or rather,
Essential to <hi>First Principles,</hi> that they
must manifest themselves, to be such
by their own <hi>most perfect Self-Evidence;</hi>
whereas <hi>Cartesius</hi> was forc'd to use
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100531:53"/>
very <hi>many</hi> prolix <hi>Antecedent Discourses,</hi>
to prove all else to be <hi>Dubitable;</hi> and, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
they were so, he went on, Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
farther, till he could find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that <hi>could not be Doubted;</hi> which,
he conceiv'd, was <hi>[Cogito ergo sum,]</hi>
from which he came to <hi>Conclude,</hi> that
this was the <hi>First Principle.</hi> Whence
I alledg'd, that therefore, those <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Discourses</hi> of his, which prov'd
all else to be Doubtful, were the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
or <hi>Arguments</hi> whence he drew his
<hi>Conclusion,</hi> that <hi>this</hi> was the <hi>First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
Now, I think this as Plain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as plain can be, that No Man can
evince a thing to be the <hi>First</hi> in any
kind whatever, but, because, there is
nothing <hi>before</hi> it in that kind. And,
from this consideration, I prove my
Allegation clearly; because, had not
those <hi>many</hi> and <hi>large</hi> Antecedent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
to prove <hi>all else</hi> to be <hi>Doubtful,</hi>
been <hi>True;</hi> his <hi>Conclusion, viz.</hi> that
<hi>[This is the First Principle,]</hi> could not
have follow'd, or been <hi>True</hi> neither.
For, in case the <hi>Senses</hi> had not been
thus <hi>Fallacious</hi> as still to deceive us,
perhaps, Science might have been had
from the <hi>Things without us</hi> affecting
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100531:53"/>
those Senses; nor had there been any
need to recur to the Operations of our
own <hi>Mind,</hi> to seek for the <hi>Ground</hi> of
all Truth <hi>there,</hi> because, we might
have had it from the <hi>Things in Nature.</hi>
This being so, how many Propositions
did he use all along, to prove that our
Senses might <hi>all decieve us;</hi> that we
know not certainly whether we <hi>sleep</hi>
or <hi>wake;</hi> that Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
might be all Erroneous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
All which Antecedent Propositions,
by the plain Rules of Logick, ought
to be <hi>more Evident,</hi> and <hi>more Certain,</hi>
than the Conclusion he gather'd, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
thence, <hi>viz.</hi> that Therefore <hi>This,</hi>
and only <hi>This,</hi> being Indubitable, and
Certainly Known, is the <hi>First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
Add, that this being <hi>Plain Sense,</hi>
his own Discourse <hi>overthrows</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment
of his <hi>First Principle.</hi> For,
since he <hi>had</hi> not this <hi>First Principle</hi> of
his till he had <hi>found</hi> it, nor did he
<hi>find</hi> it, till he found all else to be
Doubtful; it will be ask'd <hi>How,</hi> and
in virtue of <hi>What</hi> First Principle he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
while he was in quest of it,
<hi>more Certain,</hi> that all <hi>other</hi> things were
<hi>Doubtful,</hi> than he was of the <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:100531:54"/>
he inferr'd thence, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>[Cogito,
ergo sum]</hi> being impossible to be Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, was his First Principle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if he guided himself by no <hi>Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable,</hi>
or First Principle all along, in
those Antecedent Discourses, which
were in reality his Premisses; that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi>
of his, cannot in any Logick
<hi>follow,</hi> nor be <hi>Certainly True,</hi> nor
ought to be Embrac'd; especially, by
such a Philosopher as <hi>he</hi> was, who <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses</hi>
Doubting of ever thing, till he
came at his First Principle, that can
be <hi>in the least</hi> Dubitable.</p>
            <p>42. In Reply to this Discourse of
mine, which is grounded on the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that <hi>Cartesius</hi> guided himself
by <hi>Reason,</hi> in settling his First Principle;
and on the <hi>plainest Rules</hi> of Logick
that the Premisses must be <hi>Clearer</hi> than
the <hi>Conclusion;</hi> the former of which,
I suppose you will grant, the latter is
obvious to Common Sense; you
brought an Ingenious <hi>Explication,</hi> by
way of <hi>Similitude,</hi> or <hi>Parallel;</hi> which,
I see, are to supply the place of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi>
and <hi>Answers</hi> too, in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian</hi>
way. It was this. <q>Suppose
I see a Man making great <hi>Holes</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:100531:54"/>
in the Ground, or throwing aside
<hi>Rubbish;</hi> and that I ask him what he
is doing? He tells me, he has an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to <hi>Build,</hi> and to lay <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
for that End, and is making
Way for it. Now this Action of his
looks like an idle business, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it <hi>alone;</hi> but, if we regard his
<hi>farther</hi> Intention of Building, it is a
Wise and Necessary Preparative. And
yet this Antecedent Action, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to lay a Foundation, does
not give strength to the Building,
which is an Action quite different
from it; but the <hi>Building</hi> depends on
the Foundation it self, and on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else. And, therefore, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
by way of Parallel, that the
Antecedent Discourses of <hi>Cartesius,</hi>
need not be <hi>Connected</hi> with that First
Principle, as <hi>Premisses,</hi> to <hi>inferr</hi> it
<hi>must</hi> be such; since they serv'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to remove the <hi>Rubbish,</hi> or the
Pretended Knowledge of Things
by means of the <hi>Senses,</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd
the Mind with Preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
and, so to <hi>make way</hi> to lay
that <hi>First Foundation of Science.</hi>
               </q> I
think I have done your Parallel all the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100531:55"/>
Right you can expect: Wherefore, I
come now to examine what <hi>Force</hi> it
bears, and what <hi>Strength</hi> such a <hi>way of
Discoursing</hi> has in it; which, I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do, that I may inform those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who take such kind of <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>
for <hi>Reasons,</hi> how easily, and how
frequently they are <hi>deluded,</hi> by such
<hi>Unsteady, Inconclusive,</hi> and <hi>Illogical</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
            <p>43 First then, 'tis so certainly
known, that Similitudes do not use
<hi>quadrare per omnia,</hi> or, (as they say,) <hi>run
on four Feet,</hi> that it is grown <hi>Proverbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi>
which lays a great prejudice upon
that Way in common. 2. Similitudes
drawn from <hi>Material</hi> Things, <hi>to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material,</hi>
are particularly liable to this
Defect. They may, indeed, oft times,
serve to <hi>illustrate</hi> some Truth, as <hi>fit
Metaphors</hi> to sute with our <hi>Fancy;</hi> but
then they presuppose the Truth, which
they are to <hi>illustrate,</hi> to be <hi>known</hi> some
<hi>other</hi> Way. Whence, unless this be
done first, all they can do is to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
we <hi>know not what,</hi> which destroys
the nature of an <hi>Explication;</hi> for, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
are not intended to <hi>put</hi> the
<hi>Truth</hi> of the Point, but <hi>suppose</hi> it. 3. All
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100531:55"/>
the Actions of our Soul are, or ought
to be <hi>Rational;</hi> and have a <hi>Dependence</hi>
on one another, by the way of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
gathering <hi>Subsequent</hi> Truths from
those which <hi>preceded.</hi> Now, I think,
'tis impossible to be contested by any
Man who has read <hi>Cartesius</hi>'s <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
but that his Discourses which
anteceded his finding out this <hi>First
Principle</hi> of his, are reducible to this
<hi>Enthymem;</hi> [For these and these <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
there can no Certainty be had, as
to Speculative Knowledges, by any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
had from <hi>Outward</hi> Objects
affecting the <hi>Senses;</hi> therefore, it ought
to be sought for in some <hi>Interiour</hi>
Act of our <hi>Mind,</hi> which is most Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
and Peculiar to it,] which
he concieved was <hi>Cogitation;</hi> and thence
he laid this First Principle: <hi>[Cogito ergo
sum]</hi> Which being so, it follows ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
that the Laying this for his
First Principle, depended on the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Reasons</hi> he had, why our
Senses were not to be trusted, nor could
give us our First Notions; whence,
by reflecting on their Metaphysical
Verity, we might have those Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and First Truths, of ours. This,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100531:56"/>
I say, was evidently the Tenour of his
Discourse; because, did not those
Reasons of his, against the <hi>Sufficiency</hi>
of our <hi>Senses</hi> to give us this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
conclude; but that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all those Reasons could prove,
the Senses might still imprint on our
Mind those First Notions, his <hi>Consequent</hi>
would not have follow'd: Nor, could
he have had any Ground for recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the <hi>Interiour Act</hi> of Cogitation,
for his First Principle, in regard it had
been given to his Hand by means of
the <hi>Senses,</hi> as was now declar'd. 4. It
being then evident, that the <hi>Substance</hi>
of those antecedent Discourses was
<hi>summ'd up</hi> in the <hi>Enthymem</hi> now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
'tis manifest, that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of yours <hi>falters</hi> in the <hi>main</hi>
Particular, in which it ought to <hi>sute,</hi>
and <hi>resemble.</hi> For, in case those Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on our Mind could have been
made by means of the Senses, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said;
then those Impressions, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
being the <hi>Immediate Foundation,</hi>
on which is <hi>built</hi> all our Knowledge,
could not be call'd, or resembl'd to
<hi>Rubbish;</hi> nor compar'd to a <hi>Hole,</hi> to
<hi>lay</hi> the <hi>Foundation;</hi> for, the <hi>Holes</hi> were
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100531:56"/>
already made in those <hi>Inlets,</hi> our <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
which were Pervious to the <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums</hi>
affecting the <hi>Seat of Knowledge;</hi>
and thence, the <hi>Soul.</hi> So that your
Similitude is, in effect, the <hi>Begging</hi> the
whole <hi>Question;</hi> and can have no Force
at all, but by our <hi>Granting</hi> it; which,
I see plainly, we shall never have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to do. Rather, unless this <hi>Petitio
Principii</hi> (which is tacitly involv'd in
this Parallel) be <hi>yielded</hi> by us, or <hi>prov'd</hi>
by you, it makes against your selves.
For, by <hi>Denying</hi> all such certain Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
from the Senses, you will be
found, not to <hi>remove the Rubbish,</hi> in
order to <hi>lay the Foundation;</hi> but, to <hi>stop
up</hi> the <hi>Way</hi> to the <hi>laying any;</hi> and, to
<hi>damm</hi> up all the <hi>Holes,</hi> by which the
<hi>Materials</hi> could come into our <hi>Minds,</hi>
where only such a <hi>Foundation</hi> could
have been <hi>laid.</hi> At least, you see,
your Explication amounts to <hi>nothing;</hi>
and, that your Similitude is <hi>lame</hi> in all
its Legs, and has not <hi>one Sure Foot</hi> to
stand on. Which will, I hope, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
inform others, that this Way
of <hi>Explicating,</hi> so mightily affected
by <hi>Cartesius,</hi> and his Followers, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
Insignificant. I shall hope too,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100531:57"/>
that this Paper will light into the hands
of some Readers, who are so Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
as to discern, that this <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Way is taken up, to avoid the
Way of <hi>Rigorous Proof;</hi> which is so
Unfriendly to a Doctrine that wants
Principles.</p>
            <p>44. Whence I should give this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to all <hi>Aristotelians,</hi> that whenever
the <hi>Cartesians</hi> would obtrude upon
them their Ingenious <hi>Explications,</hi> they
would demand of them smartly, by
what Grounds they <hi>know,</hi> or will <hi>prove</hi>
to <hi>others,</hi> that what they <hi>explicate,</hi> is
<hi>True;</hi> without doing which in the
<hi>first</hi> place, <hi>no Explication</hi> ought to be
admitted. It may serve for a kind of
<hi>Currying Favour</hi> with <hi>weaker Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings;</hi>
but it can never <hi>improve</hi> any
Intelligent Man in <hi>Solid Knowledge,</hi>
nor make him one Jot the <hi>Wiser.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>45. After this, we came to argue
that other Objection of mine, That
<hi>First Principles,</hi> of all others, must be
<hi>most</hi> Clearly and Distinctly <hi>Known;</hi>
because they ought to be, of all others,
<hi>most Knowable;</hi> there being no others
<hi>before</hi> them, by means of which they
might come to be <hi>better Known.</hi> Now,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100531:57"/>
               <hi>Cartesius</hi> himself expresly confesses, that,
when he had found this First Principle,
<hi>he did not yet sufficiently understand what
[Ego,]</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi> in that Principle,
<hi>meant:</hi> Whence I inferr'd, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>[Cogito ergo sum,]</hi> could not be
to him a <hi>First Principle.</hi> This is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd,
because the <hi>Subject</hi> is the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,</hi>
and <hi>most Substantial</hi> Part in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Proposition: And, since, in <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
Things, when we do not well know
<hi>what we talk of,</hi> plain S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nse tells us,
'tis a Folly to talk <hi>at all; much more</hi> is
it Disallowable in <hi>Philosophical</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
where <hi>Exact Truth</hi> is aim'd at;
and <hi>most</hi> of all in <hi>First Principles,</hi> which
must be <hi>most Self-evident.</hi> You seem'd
to think an <hi>Obscure</hi> Knowledge of the
<hi>Subject</hi> was sufficient. But, how an
<hi>Obscure</hi> Knowledge can be either <hi>Clear,</hi>
or <hi>Distinct;</hi> much less, <hi>superlatively
such:</hi> Or, how a Proposition, whose
<hi>Principal Part</hi> is neither <hi>Clear,</hi> nor <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi>
should, notwithstanding, it self,
(as here it must,) be <hi>most</hi> Clear <hi>and</hi>
Distinct, is, I believe, past any Man's
Comprehension.</p>
            <p>46. However, I let your smooth
Explication <hi>slide,</hi> without <hi>pressing</hi> my
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100531:58"/>
Discourse too forcibly: For, it had
been something Rude, at so Civil a
Visit in my own Chamber, to push
Things forward too rigorously; or,
to seem to affect the Victory of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</hi>
But our Friend urg'd me to
bring some one Argument, that might
decisively conclude the Point. It came
into my Mind, (waving what I had
objected elsewhere,) to alledge against
it, that <hi>A First Principle</hi> must be some
<hi>One</hi> Determinate Proposition; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it was Evident that this Principle
of yours had in it <hi>Two,</hi> and those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Different</hi> ones. For, <hi>[Cogito]</hi> is a
<hi>Speech that Affirms,</hi> which Logicians
call a <hi>Proposition;</hi> and <hi>involves</hi> in it all
the <hi>Three</hi> Parts that compleat such a
Speech, being clearly the same as <hi>[Ego
sum Cogitans;]</hi> as <hi>[Sum,]</hi> for the same
Reason, <hi>implies, [Ego sum Existens;]</hi>
which is evidently a Proposition too,
and <hi>Distinct</hi> from the <hi>other.</hi> Your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was, That, notwithstanding the
manner of Expression, they made, or
amounted to but <hi>One</hi> Proposition; and
signify'd no more but <hi>[Ego sum re Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitans.]</hi>
But I reply'd, That this was
the <hi>First</hi> Proposition; and hence I a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100531:58"/>
What becomes of the <hi>Later, [Ego sum
Existens,]</hi> since the Predicate <hi>[Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens,]</hi>
is a quite different Notion from
the Predicate <hi>[Res Cogitans.]</hi> Add,
that to <hi>prove</hi> himself <hi>Existent,</hi> was the
sole Scope <hi>Cartesius</hi> aim'd at in laying
this Principle; as appears by his Words
immediately following; <hi>viz. [Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
tamen satis intelligo quisnam sim Ego
ille qui jam necessario sum.]</hi> He does not
pretend to have evinc'd that he was
<hi>Res Cogitans,</hi> but only <hi>necessarily Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent.</hi>
To enforce this the more, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that the <hi>Illative</hi> Particle <hi>[Ergo]</hi>
did shew plainly, that there were <hi>Two</hi>
Propositions; of which, the One was
an <hi>Antecedent;</hi> the Other, a <hi>Consequent.</hi>
But you would not allow that <hi>[Ergo,]</hi>
in that place, had an <hi>Illative</hi> Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
nor, as far as I could discern,
<hi>any at all;</hi> for, I am sure, if it has <hi>any,</hi>
it can have <hi>no Other.</hi> I remember, you
bestirr'd your Wit as dexterously as
any Man could in such a Cause, to
bring off <hi>Cartesius;</hi> but 'tis beyond the
Power of Wit, or Art, to do it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the most pregnant and significant
Words which Rational Creatures <hi>can</hi>
use, must, <hi>for his sake,</hi> lose their Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100531:59"/>
Which is such an Injury
to the rest of Mankind, who would be
at a strange Loss to <hi>discourse</hi> or <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi>
one another, were this admitted,
that it will never be allow'd by other
Philosophers, who are <hi>Dis-interessed,</hi>
and have not that <hi>Passionate Concern</hi> for
<hi>Cartesius,</hi> as some others seem to have.
I remember, Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> tells us, he
has spoke to some Exceptions made
against this Principle formerly, and,
perhaps, this may be one of them.
But, as I could not light on that Book
of his, so I clearly see, this Particular
is so manifest, that 'tis impossible for
any Man, in such a Case as this, to
answer to the purpose.</p>
            <p>47. And thus ended our Discourse;
In which, if you had any Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
it proceeded hence, that you
would needs undertake to defend <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesius</hi>'s
<hi>Logick:</hi> Whereas, nothing is
more Evident, than that, in the far
greatest part of his <hi>Meditations,</hi> (not
to speak of some other pieces of his,)
he regarded no <hi>Rules</hi> of Logick <hi>at all;</hi>
but meerly follow'd the Current of his
own Ingenious Thoughts, in gliding
smoothly and gentilely, from one Thing,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100531:59"/>
to another, as his First <hi>Design</hi> led him,
and in putting his Conceptions <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
I mean, according to the <hi>First</hi> sort
of <hi>Clearness,</hi> mention'd above, §. 35.
The Summ is this; Without <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
we cannot <hi>speak;</hi> and, without
<hi>Illative</hi> Particles, we cannot make use
of our <hi>Rationality;</hi> both which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
you do not seem very
willingly and heartily to admit. Had
I been of your Party, I should have
advis'd you to have flatly deny'd all
<hi>Syllogisms, Inferences, Antecedents, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents;</hi>
and, in a Word, <hi>all Logick,</hi>
and <hi>all</hi> kind of <hi>Connexion,</hi> and then
it had been impossible for any Man to
Attack you, or bring any Argument
<hi>against you;</hi> I add, nor you any <hi>for
your selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>48. The Generality of <hi>Mankind</hi> (I
wish I might not say, of <hi>Philosophers</hi>
too) being much govern'd by <hi>Fancy,</hi>
I am to expect, such a High Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as is the foregoing Discourse,
will scarce find a Civil Entertainment
amongst such Gentlemen. However,
I hope it will not displease them, if,
on this Occasion, I ask them some few
pertinent Questions; leaving the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100531:60"/>
them to themselves. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be not such Propositions; as
those I call <hi>Identical?</hi> 2. Whether
Mathematicians, and some others,
who treat of Philosophy in a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Method, have not propos'd
such before me, and made use of them?
3. Whether such Propositions are not
the <hi>most-firmly-Grounded,</hi> and the <hi>First</hi>
of all others? 4. Whether they are
not <hi>Self-evident,</hi> and <hi>force</hi> the Assent
of <hi>all Mankind?</hi> 5. Whether we can
be <hi>Deceiv'd</hi> in <hi>Iudging</hi> them Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
as we may, and often are, in
Judging that we <hi>Clearly and Distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know a thing to be True?</hi> 6. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have not an Universal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
in their Way, over <hi>all Truths,</hi>
especially all <hi>Deduced</hi> Truths; since
'tis Demonstrable, that all the <hi>Force of
Consequence</hi> is Grounded on them?
7. Whether, all these Qualifications
being shewn to be found in the Self-evident
Knowableness of Identical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
this Clearest Light, or Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibility,
which so necessarily appears
in them, ought not, with just Right,
entitle <hi>Them</hi> to be held the RULE
by which to <hi>know all other Truths?</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:100531:60"/>
Lastly, Whether this <hi>Self-evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi>
of the Terms of a Proposition,
found in <hi>them,</hi> which is <hi>Producible open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
be not a Clear Means to <hi>shew to
others,</hi> that we do not <hi>mistake</hi> when
we judge them <hi>Self evident,</hi> and <hi>True;</hi>
since all Mankind that <hi>sees</hi> them <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,</hi>
must think the <hi>same</hi> of them <hi>we
do?</hi> And, whether, on the other side,
it can possibly be shewn <hi>to others,</hi> that
our selves do <hi>Clearly and Distinctly
know</hi> a Thing to be <hi>True,</hi> without <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
finally</hi> some Proposition that
is <hi>Unmistakable</hi> and <hi>Self-evident</hi> to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>
Man? When they have duly
weigh'd each of these Particulars, and
the Proofs brought for them, I appeal
from their <hi>Fancy,</hi> to their <hi>Reason,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I have not done a Just and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Duty to Philosophy, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to settle the <hi>Rule of Truth</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so <hi>Solid</hi> and <hi>Evident</hi> a Basis; and,
whether I could have been less Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
in such a High Subject, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a Deep Inspection into the very
<hi>Center</hi> of all Truth whatever, even to
the Resolving it <hi>Finally</hi> and <hi>Connatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
into <hi>Essential Truth</hi> it self? If these
Considerations do not <hi>acquit</hi> me upon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100531:61"/>
either Account, I cannot but think my
self <hi>Unjustly Condemn'd;</hi> and, I hope,
the whole <hi>Court</hi> of Philosophers, who
are <hi>Impartial,</hi> and <hi>Sincere,</hi> will judge
the same.</p>
            <p>49. To clear me from <hi>Singularity</hi> in
this Uncommon Method of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing,
I could farther alledge, that
Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> in his <hi>Essay, B. 4. ch.</hi> 1.
§. 4. gives us this Doctrine; that <hi>The
First Act of the Mind, is, to perceive its
own Ideas; and, that One of them is not
Another;</hi> that is, that each of them <hi>is
its self</hi> only; which is an <hi>Identical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi>—That
<hi>this is so Absolutely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi>
that, <hi>without it, there could be
no Knowledge, no Reasoning,—no Distinct
Thoughts at all.</hi> Which sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
it to be the <hi>First Truth,</hi> or
RULE of TRUTH, which influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>all other</hi> Truths; since, without it,
<hi>nothing</hi> at all could be <hi>known.</hi>—That
<hi>a Man</hi> infallibly <hi>knows that the Ideas of
White, and Round, are the very Ideas
they are.</hi>—That <hi>this is the First Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or Disagreement,</hi> (that is, the <hi>First
Truth,) the Mind perceives in its Ideas.</hi>—That
<hi>Men of Art have, for ready Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
in all Cases, reduc'd this into
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100531:61"/>
those General Rules, [What is, is,] &amp;c.</hi>
In all which, (as he does in divers
other main Speculative Points,) he so
perfectly agrees with me, that, tho' I
did not proceed on <hi>my own</hi> Grounds,
I need no more but these of <hi>his,</hi> to
draw such Immediate Consequences
thence, as would establish and abet my
<hi>Thesis.</hi> Indeed, it did not lie in the
Way of that very Learned Man's Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
to reflect on the Universal
Influence Identical Propositions have
over <hi>all Truths,</hi> and <hi>all Knowledges,</hi>
whatever; and therefore, his Dis-like
of them afterwards, <hi>(chap. 8.)</hi> can be
thought to relate only to their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<hi>Uselesness:</hi> Tho', even there,
(§. 2.) he acknowledges an Excellent
Use of them too; where he says, that
<hi>[What is, is,]</hi> may serve <hi>sometimes,</hi> (he
might have said, <hi>Always when it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,)
to shew a Man the Absurdity he is
Guilty of, when, by Circumlocution, or
Ambiguous Terms, he would, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Instances, deny the same Thing of it
self; because no body will so openly bid
Defiance to Common Sense, as to affirm
Visible and Direct Contradictions, in plain
Words.</hi> To which Reflexion of his, if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100531:62"/>
this Learned Gentleman pleases to add,
That whoever discourses <hi>False</hi> on any
Subject, does, at the same time, make
that Subject <hi>not to be what it is,</hi> or (if
the Question be of some Mode) <hi>as it
is;</hi> his Penetrative Judgment cannot
but discern, that Identical Propositions
are <hi>Equally Useful</hi> in <hi>all</hi> Questions, <hi>all</hi>
Disputes, nay, <hi>all</hi> Discourses whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
if the Way of <hi>Reducing</hi> Inferiour
Truths to <hi>Them,</hi> were but well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
and cultivated.</p>
            <p>50. I much value your good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and, I perceiv'd, I was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of losing it, by a hint you gave
me, with a Dis-relishing Air, that I
call'd <hi>Cartesius</hi> a Fanatick; which you
thought very harsh. In Answer, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Charge. 'Tis one Thing to say,
that, when <hi>Cartesius</hi> was laying his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to Science,</hi> by denying his Senses,
and devesting himself of all his former
Knowledges, which (as my Author
expresses it) was no less than to <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
himself, he fell, for some few Days,</hi>
into a <hi>Spice of Enthusiasm;</hi> nay, was
<hi>brim-full of it;</hi> and fancy'd he had <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Revelations;</hi> so that he seem'd
<hi>Crack-brain'd,</hi> or to have <hi>drunk a Cup
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100531:62"/>
too much;</hi> which are the very Words
a <hi>Cartesian,</hi> who wrote his Life, has
given us, <hi>(p. 34, 35, 36.)</hi> And, 'tis
another Thing to say, he was <hi>habitual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
a Fanatick, or Enthusiast, <hi>all his Life,</hi>
and in <hi>every</hi> Action he did, or Book
he writ; the Former of which can
neither be <hi>deny'd</hi> with <hi>Truth,</hi> nor the
Later <hi>objected</hi> with any Degree of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty:</hi>
Nor does it sute with the high
Character I have given of him, in the
<hi>Preface</hi> to my <hi>Method,</hi> and the <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums</hi>
I have, upon Occasion, bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on divers of his Books. I beseech
you, Sir, be so Just, as to stare my
Case right. I was writing a ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOD
to SCIENCE, and two
<hi>other Methods,</hi> (if, indeed, they do not
fall into the <hi>same,)</hi> which look'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Extravagant, did lie cross my Way;
which, unless I remov'd, my whole
Design had been spoil'd, and of no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
I mean, that of <hi>Malbranche,</hi> which
makes all <hi>Humane Science</hi> come by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation:</hi> And, that of <hi>Cartesius,</hi>
that we must deny all our Knowledge
of Natural Truths, had by our <hi>Senses.</hi>
The settling this Later Method, had,
confessedly, lost <hi>Cartesius</hi> his Wits, for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100531:63"/>
some time; and therefore, I had good
reason to fear, that the following the
same Method might do a greater Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to <hi>others,</hi> who had not such
<hi>Strong Brains</hi> as that Great Man had;
of which too, there do not want In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
The former <hi>Method,</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by <hi>Malbranche,</hi> I saw evidently,
brought a kind of <hi>Fanaticism</hi> into Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.
For, I believe, no Man
doubts, but that the Genius of <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
is, to over-leap all <hi>Humane Means,</hi>
and to pretend that their Light of
Knowledge comes to them immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from GOD. My Fault, then, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consisted in this, that I was such a
Friend to <hi>Truth,</hi> and to <hi>Mankind,</hi> as
to endeavour (to my Power) to avert
such Mischiefs from young Students,
by fore-warning them of what had
prejudic'd <hi>others,</hi> and therefore might
highly prejudice <hi>them;</hi> and, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
those <hi>Ways to Science,</hi> that so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
thwarted <hi>mine,</hi> which, my best
Judgment told me, was the <hi>True one.</hi>
Now, this being a Task so <hi>Unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
to one in my Circumstances; and
the Confuting such strange Methods
being, with good Reason, judg'd by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100531:63"/>
me to be so <hi>Beneficial</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
without Rashness, be thought, I
did this out of a Desire of <hi>Opposing</hi>
other Learned Men; but, purely out
of Duty to <hi>my Reader,</hi> and a just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to <hi>my self.</hi> Yet, for pursuing
this Laudable and (in my Case) Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Intention, I am persecuted with
the highest Malice, by two over-zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Cartesians;</hi> who, to uphold these
Aukward and Pernicious Methods,
make no Scruple to break in upon the
most Sacred Methods of Christianity;
tho' I have done no more but cite the
Words of their own Authors. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
every Candid Reader will, hence,
easily discern, that it is not out of <hi>Pique</hi>
against their <hi>Persons;</hi> but, purely, out
of my <hi>Dis-like</hi> of their Unprincipl'd
and Dangerous <hi>Methods,</hi> that I have
oppos'd them <hi>at all.</hi> Nor have I any
Personal Reflexions upon their <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:</hi>
Nor do I charge them with <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,</hi>
but of <hi>Folly;</hi> which every An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist
in Philosophical Debates is
<hi>forc'd</hi> to object to his Adversary.</p>
            <p>51. <hi>But, am I the only Man, of our
Moderns here in England,</hi> who have
thought it the Interest of <hi>Philosophy,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100531:64"/>
and of</hi> Truth, <hi>to oppose</hi> Malbranche
<hi>and</hi> Cartesius? <hi>Mr.</hi> Iohn Keyll, <hi>of</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;
<hi>a Person of Great Wit, and
Greater Hopes, being (as I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
scarce arriv'd yet at the Summer
of his Age, has lately put forth</hi> An
Examination of Dr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> Theory of
the Earth; <hi>where, after he had, in his
Introduction, discover'd the Fopperies
of divers of the Antient Philosophers;
and of three of our Moderns,</hi> Spinoza,
<hi>Dr.</hi> More, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Hobbs, <hi>not much
less Ridiculous than the former; he
lays open that superlatively absurd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of</hi> Malbranche, <hi>which I noted
above. He gives us a Summary, and
Parallel Consequences, of his Doctrine
in that particular; which is, That</hi> We
see not the <hi>Things</hi> themselves, but only
their <hi>Ideas,</hi> which the Soul sees in GOD:—<hi>And,
that</hi> there is no possibility of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>any</hi> Bodies, except in that Being,
(GOD;) which contains them after an
Intelligible manner.—Bodies, therefore,
and their Properties, are <hi>(only)</hi> seen in
GOD; so that <hi>(says he)</hi> a Man who
reads this Book, does not really see the
Book it self, but the Idea of it, which is
in GOD. <hi>Which he deservedly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100531:64"/>
to be</hi> Unintelligible Iargon, <hi>and
a</hi> Solid piece of Nonsense. <hi>He exposes
that equally-senseless Opinion, That</hi>
Bodies, of their own Nature, are neither
heard, seen, smelt, nor tasted; <hi>and, that</hi>
when, for Example, we <hi>Taste</hi> any thing,
the Body <hi>Tasted</hi> cannot produce any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in us; but GOD Almighty <hi>takes
that Occasion,</hi> to stir up that Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in us, to which the Body does not
really concurr. <hi>So that Mankind has,
it seems, quite lost its</hi> Animality; <hi>at
least, that we are not</hi> Naturally Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Creatures, <hi>but only</hi> Supernaturally;
<hi>or, by GOD's</hi> Immediate <hi>Power ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
us such, every time we are to use
our Senses. He proceeds:</hi> According to
him, it is impossible for any Man to move
his own Arm; <hi>but,</hi> when he is <hi>Willing</hi>
to move it, GOD takes it, and moves
it up and down, as the Man <hi>Wills.</hi> If
a Rebellious Son, or Subject, murther his
Father, or his Prince, by stabbing him,
the Man himself does not thrust the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
into his Father's or Prince's Breast,
But GOD Almighty does it, without any
other Concurrence of the Man, but his
<hi>Will. It seems, our Laws are very
Unjust; which do not Hang Men for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100531:65"/>
meerly</hi> Intending, <hi>or</hi> Willing; <hi>but for</hi>
Ouvert-<hi>Acts; in which the Man himself
has no hand at all; they being, all of
them, entirely of GOD's doing. Whence
we see, that, with the</hi> Cartesians, <hi>such
Doctrine as this has</hi> no Impiety <hi>in it at
all against GOD: It</hi> comes <hi>from</hi> Them,
<hi>and so 'tis all</hi> Sacred. He proceeds, and
affirms that no Second Causes act: So that
no Body, tho' mov'd with never so great
a Velocity against another, can be able to
drive that other before it, or move it in
the least; but GOD <hi>takes that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,</hi>
to put it into Motion. At this
rate, one need not fear his Head-piece,
tho' a Bomb were falling upon it, with
all the Force that Powder can give it;
for, it would not so much as break his
Skull, or singe his Hair, of GOD did
not <hi>take that Occasion</hi> to do it.—The
most Natural Agents, with him, are not
so much as Instruments, but only <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of what is produc'd by them: So
that a Man might freely pass through the
Fire, or jump down a Precipice, without
any Harm, if GOD Almighty did not
<hi>take that Occasion</hi> to burn him, or
dash out his Brains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:100531:65"/>
52. <hi>Coming to</hi> Cartesius, <hi>whom he
calls</hi> the Great Master and Deliverer of
the Philosophers, from the Tyranny of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle;</hi>
—and the First World-Maker
of our Century, he lays the Blame at his
door, <hi>of all this</hi> presumptuous Pride <hi>of
his Followers, and their Fantastick
Philosophy; and animadverts severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon divers of his odd</hi> Placita: <hi>As,
that</hi> there is always the same Quantity
of Motion in the World. So that, if all
the Men and Animals in the World were
Moving, which most part of them can do
when they please; yet, still there would
be no more Motion in the World, than
there is in the Night-time, when they are
at Rest; and, what Motion they had
when they were Moving, must be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to the <hi>Aether,</hi> when they are at
Rest. <hi>And, whereas</hi> Cartesius'<hi>s Skill in
Geometry gave those Contrivances of
his Witty Fancy all their Credit, this
Author assures us,</hi> p. 15. <hi>that,</hi> from the
beginning to the end of his Principles,
there is not one Demonstration drawn from
Geometry; or, indeed, any Demonstration
at all, except every Thing illustrated by a
Figure be a Demonstration; for, then, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
there may be enow of such Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100531:66"/>
produc'd in his Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Works. <hi>Now, in case this be so,
then, it seems,</hi> Explications <hi>by</hi> Figures
<hi>do serve</hi> Cartesius, <hi>and his Followers,
for</hi> Demonstrations <hi>in</hi> Geometry, <hi>as well
as</hi> Explications <hi>by</hi> Words <hi>serve them for</hi>
Demonstrations, <hi>or</hi> Proofs, <hi>in</hi> other <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
—He adds, that,</hi> His great Fault
was, that he made no Use at all of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
in Philosophy.—<hi>Nay, that</hi> His
whole System was but one continual Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
upon account of his Negligence in that
Point.—<hi>That Galileo</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi> have
by the Help of Geometry, discover'd Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Truths, more worth than all <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>'s
Volumes of Philosophy. <hi>He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
his</hi> Vortices, by Mr. <hi>Newton's
Principles;</hi> who shews it impossible, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many Accounts; that the Earth, and
other Planets, should move in a Vortex.
<hi>With which most Consummate</hi> Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician,
<hi>I believe, none of the</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesians
<hi>will be willing, or able, to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or contend. And, were</hi> Cartesius
<hi>now alive, perhaps he would have as
much admir'd</hi> Him, <hi>as Himself, in his
Life-time, was admir'd by</hi> others.—<hi>He
subjoins, that,</hi> His Notion of a Vortex being
ruin'd, the whole <hi>Cartesian</hi> System must
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100531:66"/>
of necessity fall to the Ground: And, that
World, whose Origination he pretended to
have deduced from Mechanical Principles,
must be a wild Chimera of his own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
<hi>He affirms, that Cartesius</hi>'s
Discourse about the Motion of the Moon,
is so notoriously False, that there is no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack-maker,
but can demonstrate the
contrary. <hi>Farther, That</hi> the <hi>Cartesians</hi>
pretend to give a true Account of all the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature; whilst they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
so very little, that they have not
given us an Explication of any one Thing:—<hi>And,
that Cartesius</hi> has blunder'd so
much in the easiest, and most abstract
Things in Nature, that of the Seven Rules
he has given of the Laws of Motion, there
is but One of them True. <hi>Lastly, He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
that Cartesius</hi>'s Fancy of Making
a World by Mechanical Principles,—has
given the Ignorant Atheists (for, so are,
<hi>says he,</hi> most of that Persuasion) some
plausible Pretences for their Incredulity,
without any Real Ground. <hi>Where the
the Parenthesis lays such a Blemish on
the greater Part of the Followers of</hi>
Cartesius, <hi>and on his Doctrine, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioning
it, that, as I have charitably
endeavour'd, in divers places, to wipe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100531:67"/>
off that Aspersion, and have taken their
part; so, I am sorry to see now, that
'tis beyond my Power to do it. I must
own, that there have been many Ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous
Persons,</hi> Cartesians; <hi>but I am not
so well vers'd in their Catalogue, as to
to know, whether</hi> they, <hi>or the</hi> Athèists
<hi>of that Persuasion, do make the</hi> Major
Part. <hi>These are his present Objections
against</hi> Des Cartes; <hi>and, by what I
have read of this Learned Author, I
know no Man more likely to make
good what he has charged upon him,
than</hi> He <hi>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>53. You see, Sir, how much it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
the <hi>Cartesians</hi> to <hi>look to their
Hits,</hi> if they have any; and, to arm
themselves against such brisk Attacks,
tending to the Overthrow of all their
Hypothesis by way of <hi>Geometry;</hi> which
I have attempted to do by way of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical,
Physical,</hi> and <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
For, if this <hi>Opposition</hi> to <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
by <hi>Geometrical</hi> Arguments, should
come to be a <hi>Confutation;</hi> then, since
Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> tells us, his <hi>Physicks is but
a Part of the Mathematicks,</hi> his Credit,
as a Philosopher, will sink utterly; as
I am inform'd, the Esteem of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100531:67"/>
does, by large degrees, in <hi>both</hi>
the Universities; or rather, it is quite
<hi>vanish'd</hi> out of <hi>one</hi> of them already.</p>
            <p>54. For my part, let them come off
with the Geometricians as well as they
can, I will not give them much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
but, do sincerely declare, that if
they can bring <hi>any one Evident Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
either in Logick, Physicks or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks,
which they will vouch to
have the Nature of a <hi>Principle</hi> in it;
and <hi>prove</hi> that it abets any Point of
<hi>their</hi> Doctrine, as 'tis distinguish'd from
<hi>ours,</hi> I will cross the Cudgels for the
next Comer, and promise, never to
oppose them more. Fairer Offer was
never made; nor any Method ever
propos'd, that shews a greater Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Proposer in pursuing Truth,
nor that can be more <hi>Decisive</hi> of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Contest; in which, <hi>half a
Sheet of Paper</hi> will do the Business, as
well as <hi>whole Volumes.</hi> You see, Sir, I
allow my Adversaries a <hi>large Field;</hi> out
of which they may please to <hi>pick</hi> and
<hi>cull</hi> what they <hi>like best,</hi> or judge they
can <hi>best prove.</hi> If they know of any
thing that <hi>grows there,</hi> which will bear
the Test, and can approve it self by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100531:68"/>
               <hi>Principles,</hi> to be an <hi>Evident Truth,</hi> they
have Free Liberty, and a fair Occasion
to do Right to themselves, and oblige
the World; and, withall, they will do
Me an Especial Favour, (for which I
shall not be Ungrateful,) in making
me, by their Confutation, see a Truth I
never knew before. This very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
Method, I say, will shorten
Disputes, avoid all shew of Wrangling,
which is grateful to no Man; and, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<hi>conclude</hi> the <hi>whole Cause.</hi> Or, if
this does not please them; and, that
it agrees not with their Genius to stand
bringing <hi>Evident Proofs;</hi> then, let
them but meerly <hi>name,</hi> or put down
Categorically, <hi>any one Principle</hi> of
theirs, which they judge to be the
<hi>Strongest,</hi> and <hi>most Evident,</hi> of any
they have; and, which they will vouch
to be Influential upon the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
and I will undertake to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,</hi>
that either it is <hi>no Principle,</hi>
or, that it has <hi>no Force</hi> to <hi>prove</hi> any
Point of <hi>their</hi> Doctrine, nor has any
Influence upon it at all. In case this
Rational Proposal (which, if both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
do candidly seek Truth, ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be call'd an <hi>Overture of Peace,</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:100531:68"/>
than a <hi>Challenge)</hi> be as friendly <hi>Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
as it is <hi>meant,</hi> it must needs draw
upon us both the Eyes of all Learned
Men who are <hi>Lovers of Truth,</hi> and are
Weary of <hi>Long Disputes;</hi> especially, if
they be concern'd to know whether
the so much fam'd Philosophy of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesius</hi>
be <hi>Solidly Principl'd,</hi> or only <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly
Witty:</hi> And, their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be strangely rais'd, to see
what will be the Issue of a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
thus closely manag'd; our Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Combat being, by this means,
brought to the <hi>Last Trial,</hi> and a <hi>Final
Decision</hi> by <hi>Principles,</hi> which are
the <hi>Arma Decretoria</hi> or Truth. For, if
it shall hap to appear that <hi>Cartesius</hi>'s
Doctrine has not so much as <hi>any One
Principle,</hi> which is <hi>truly such,</hi> their
Cause will be quite lost, past hopes of
Recovery: But, if it subsists by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
then I must make them Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
by acknowledging publickly,
that I have foolishly over-ween'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
take the Shame to my self, for my
Rash Presumption. We may confine
our selves (as I said) to half a Sheet of
Paper: All shall be transacted by pure
<hi>Dint of Reason;</hi> and, he that uses the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100531:69"/>
least Uncivil Word to his Adversary,
and falls into <hi>Passion,</hi> shall be held to
have lost his Cause, and to be reduc'd
to a <hi>Nonplus.</hi> Every Man, acquainted
with Humane Affairs, knows that, in
some Cases, <hi>[Responsum non dictum,]</hi>
may be a sufficient Plea to justifie one
who is to vindicate his Christian Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
unjustly attack'd, without any
Provocation given to his Opposer. It
happens too, often times, that a Man
cannot clear himself <hi>fully</hi> of those Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
with which he is <hi>aspers'd,</hi> but
by laying them at the Door of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
Affronter; whose Faults, if
they be <hi>Great</hi> ones, cannot be so much
as <hi>Nam'd,</hi> but the Words which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them must needs <hi>sound harshly.</hi>
Retorted Language, in such a Case, is
only the <hi>Rebound</hi> of the Aggressor's
Violent Strokes, upon <hi>Himself;</hi> and
are not <hi>thrown at</hi> him, but only <hi>Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated</hi>
from an Object incapable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Impression. But, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
such a Replier is excusable, when
he observes such a Temper and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that he imputes no <hi>Impiety</hi> or <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion</hi>
to his Adversary; but rather,
charitably excuses him from any such
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100531:69"/>
high Crimes, even tho' he had causles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and uncharitably, imputed the same
to <hi>himself;</hi> which (as I hope every
Man will observe) is the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Character between Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>'s
<hi>Aggressive,</hi> and my <hi>Defensive.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
however such a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
against an Assaulter may, in
Prudence, seem sometimes unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
yet, certainly, it is, <hi>in it self,</hi>
neither <hi>Edifying</hi> to good <hi>Christians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive</hi>
to the <hi>Learned,</hi> nor <hi>Profitable</hi>
to the <hi>Readers.</hi> Therefore, to avoid
it for the future, and to clear <hi>Truth,</hi>
which ought to be our only Care, I
have thought fit to make this Fairest
and Civillest Overture. If it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
neither Party, in case they do
seek Truth, can be justly displeas'd.
But if it be refus'd, and that my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
resolve to pursue their former
Rude Method, I shall hope that all <hi>Wise</hi>
and <hi>Good</hi> Men will hold me <hi>Excus'd,</hi>
(I dare say, your self will,) if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Ungrateful Task of <hi>Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the Saw of Contention;</hi> but let
them still wrangle on contentedly to
<hi>themselves,</hi> and apply my Thoughts to
<hi>better Things.</hi>

55. It remains, Worthy Sir, that I
beg your Pardon for Publishing this
Paper, without acquainting you first
with my Design. But, since you are
not nam'd in it, it need not concern
you in the least, unless you please your
self. Besides, I have discours'd with
other <hi>Cartesians,</hi> of your Profession,
upon the same Subject; and, added,
for their sakes, some Passages, which,
otherwise, had not needed: So that it
cannot particularize you, in the least.
And, since this Paper has no other
Tendency, but to clear <hi>Truth,</hi> I have
reason to presume, that your Candour
would not have been displeas'd at it.
I intreat you to do me that Justice in
your Thoughts, as not to interpret
this Address, by way of <hi>Letter,</hi> to be a
kind of <hi>Challenge,</hi> or Provocation. I am
too well acquainted with the Study
and Practise, in which you are so <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably</hi>
and <hi>Successfully.</hi> employ'd, to
think it can allow you any Leasure for
an <hi>Avocation</hi> so Impertinent to your
Proper and <hi>Precise Business.</hi> I hope
my <hi>[Ideae Cartesianae Expensae]</hi> may
give you Satisfaction in divers other
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100531:70"/>
Points. But, I must bespeak your
Pardon, while you peruse it, for the
many <hi>Errata.</hi> It happen'd, that the
Compositor understood no Latin; and
(besides other Faults,) in two or three
places, he hapt to put in what I had
blotted out in amending my Copy;
and, my Circumstances were such,
that I could not always be in Town,
to correct the Press. I am,</p>
