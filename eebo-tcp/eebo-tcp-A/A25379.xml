            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But we having another Key entred our Meeting houſe again upon the 5th day following. Upon the 1<hi>ſt</hi> day after, being the 5th of this Inſtant Twelth month; 1681/2. we being again in the fear of God met, there came again four Aldermen, with the Sheriffe, and two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables and others, and after ſome Queries about the Houſe, and Abuſive and Threatning words in great Wrath, the Town

The main Goal whereof is ſo much out of Repair, that it is not fit for people to be in, and ſome of us thereby are at that Charge, that if continued long, cannot afford to bear it, by reaſon they are taken wholly off from their Imployments. So were they, in all being Twenty four perſons here Impriſoned, one whereof was upon coming here to Viſit us, and ſo was detained, being formerly Committed for the like refuſal, but had ſome Liberty: Some of them alſo are Poor, and have Families to maintain, and nothing but what they gain by their Labour to adminiſter to their Neceſſities; and other Women having Children Sucking at their Breaſt, which is ſo Cruel, that we have not known the like; and it being ſo, therefore we (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though freely given up in Patience and Cheerfulneſs here to continue the Lords appointed time, enjoying his Preſence and Peace) yet thought good as aforeſaid our Caſe to ſignify, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the King or his Councel may be acquainted with our Suffering condition, which indeed is very Deplorable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering alſo that both men and their Wives are here Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, without Liberty admitted, nor know when it will be: For it's declared that here we muſt be continued, and in time Praemunired or Baniſhed, our Adverſaries being ſo Fierce and Unmerciful towards us: And we expect more Friends alſo ſhortly to be ſent to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittment they alſo broke the Meeting-Houſe Windows, took the Forms <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out and burned them in our Burial-Yard.</p>

After ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this great Abuſe, her Husband was likewiſe taken at the ſame place, and carried before the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> &amp;c. who Committed him to <hi>Gloceſter</hi> Goal: But its ſuppoſed Friends had not been ſo ſeverely dealt withal, had the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter</hi> himſelf been at home; and we farther hear, that the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> did not allow his Servants to abuſe our Friends in that Unlawful manner: And yet when this <hi>John Boys</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Liberty before he went to Goal to ſee his Wife, who then lay ſick of the aforeſaid Abuſes, he could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
