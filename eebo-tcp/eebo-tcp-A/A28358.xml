            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I wiſh all Divines were of your temper, not to meddle with that which belongs not to them; and to anſwer your queſtion; the ſon and heir of an Earl may be, and ſo was the Lord <hi>Ruſſell: Eliz.</hi> 6. or the ſonne and heir apparent of a Baron, and ſo was Mr. <hi>Henry Brook</hi>; for the eldeſt ſon of an Earl is not a Lord, only by the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of <hi>England</hi> he is called ſo, but in any Declaration or writing he hath no more then his legall addition given.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Stud.</speaker>
               <p>The firſt thing that they require at the Kings hands, is that which was required by the Commons in the thirteenth yeer of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. to wit, that if any man of the Commons Houſe ſhould ſpeak more largely, then of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he ought to do, all ſuch offences to be pardoned, and that to be of record.</p>

                  <hi>If that be granted, then they may ſpeak of the King what they pleaſe; and he muſt be pardoned.</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55293:4"/>
pardoned, otherwiſe not; for in Queen <hi>Eliſabeths</hi> time, who gave freedom of ſpeech to all Parliaments, when <hi>Wentworth</hi> made thoſe motions that were but ſuppoſed dangerous to the Queens eſtate, he was impriſoned in the Tower, and there dyed.</p>

               <p>No more they cannot at the ſuit of any common perſon, where the offence does not touch the King direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as by a Treſpaſſe againſt another, or the like; but a man ſhall not have the priviledge of the Houſe for a criminall offence that immediatly toucheth the King.</p>

               <p>As to that queſtion, I ſhall not give you my own opinion, but I ſhall ſhew you what Preſidents have been done, if the Books be true that I go by: Sir <hi>Edward Warner</hi> (Lieutenant of the Tower) was ſent out of his houſe to the Tower for an offence done before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was ſummoned: And Sir <hi>William Cecill</hi> then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, ſaid that the Queen was then aſſured by her Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, that ſhe might commit any of the Houſe during the Parliament, for any offence againſt her Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and that they ſhewed divers Preſidents thereof; and <hi>Pearne</hi> was committed to the Marſhalſy for words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any notice given to the Houſe; and Maſter <hi>Cope,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Leukenor, Hurlſton,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Braynbridge,</hi> and others were committed to the Tower by the Queen, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament they had ſundry conventions for the preferring in Parliament a Book touching the Rates of the Church, and a form of an Act for eſtabliſhing the

               <p>
                  <hi>What then do you think of the Kings accuſing of the five Members?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stud.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, you muſt know that the accuſation layd by His Majeſty againſt them, is not within the compaſſe of any of thoſe Preſidents; and we need not ſtand to give any reaſons to prove how it differs from them preſidents, becauſe the King Himſelf hath acknowledged it; and what diſhonor can His ſo doing be to ſo Religious a Prince, when as he himſelf is ſubject to error, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as man? nay, in that point He hath excelled the goodneſſe of His Royall Anceſtors, which act I hope ſhall be perpetually Recorded in the hearts of all His Subjects, for a teſtimony of His Grace and goodneſſe, and for a pattern to all ſucceeding Princes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But why did not they then except of a Pardon?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stud.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Kings mercy had been apparent, of which we have other great evidences; but His willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to acknowledge His errors (which is as great a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in Prince) had been concealed, and ſo he had been (in that reſpect) leſſe glorious: beſides, had they received a Pardon, being not guilty, they had <hi>ipſo facto</hi> loſt their perſonall eſtate by the Statute, unleſſe ſome words of Art had been put into the pardon, which is not too late yet to be done.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Then it ſeems that in former times the King had a power over the Parliament, unleſſe I miſapprehend them, pray tell me, hath he not now a power over them?</hi>

common Faſt, whereof the Queen miſliked not for the matter, but for the innovation of order, without her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and without Eccleſiaſticall Authority; for which cauſe, the Commons ſubmitted themſelves, and ſhe gave them their pardon: And Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> ſaith, the three Eſtates do but adviſe, as the Privie-Councell doth; which advice if the King embrace, it becomes the Kings own Act in the one; and the Kings Law in the other; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings acceptation, both the publike and private advices be but as empty Egge-ſhells. Again, if there be any difference for alteration of a Bill between the Lords and Commons, then uſually ſome ſpeciall perſons of each Houſe meet &amp; confer, that one Houſe may underſtand the meaning of the other; but a Bill that is ſigned by the King, and ſent to the Lower-houſe, may not be altred in any part thereof, without His Majeſties licence; but if a Bill come from the Lords, and not ſigned by him, it may be altered, by noting what ſhould be taken from it, or added unto it: from whence learned Doctor I deſire you to gather your own ſatisfaction: and in 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>Phill. &amp; Mar.</hi> The Speaker ſhewed that it was the QUEENS pleaſure, that the Houſe ſhould proceed no farther with the Bill for the Revenues of the Queen, becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to divers which had accompted, and then <hi>Peter Wentworth</hi> and <hi>James Dalton</hi> moved, whether this did not reſtrain the Liberty of the Houſe; upon which after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments, they reſolved to ceaſe till ſome other time: now the Queen revoked her ſaid Command, and gave them liberty to proceed; but upon conſultation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, they ſpared to proceed any farther.</p>

               <p>Surely (noble Doctor) the King was well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take the money upon any condition, and they were fooles that did propound the reſtrain't; for it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the King took any great heed to thoſe overſeers: Kings are bound by their Piety, and by no other obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
