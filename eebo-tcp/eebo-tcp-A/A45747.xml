         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epiſtle as it was imediately written to a King, who was in his generation, both wiſe and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, ſo it doth compriſe the whole ſecret, both learnedly deſcribed, and yet Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially vailed, yet as the Author teſtifieth, that in this Epiſtle he doth plainly untie the main knot. So I can and do teſtifie with him, that there is nothing deſireable for the true attaining of the myſterie, both in the Theory and Practick
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35843:16"/>
of it, which is not in this ſhort E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle fully taught. This then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as a key to all my former wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and aſſure you on my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word, that I ſhall not ſpeak one word doubtfully or myſtically, as I have in all my other writings, ſeeming to aver ſome things which taken without a figure, are utterly falſe, which we did onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal this Art: This key therefore we intend not to make common; and ſhall intreat you to keep it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to your ſelf, and not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it, except it be to a ſure friend, who you are confident will not make it publick. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt we make upon very good grounds, knowing that all our writings together, are nothing to this, by reaſon of the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have vvoven into them, which here is not done in the leaſt meaſure. I ſhall therefore in this Epiſtle take up a new method, and that different from the former, and ſhall firſt draw up the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Philoſophy couched
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35843:16"/>
in this Epiſtle, into ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, and after elucidate the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Concluſion is drawn from the nineth ſtave of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, the eight firſt ſtaves being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complemental, and that is, That as all things are multiplyed in their kind, ſo may be Mettals, which have in themſelves a capacity of being tranſmuted the imperfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfect.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Concluſion in the tenth ſtave is, That the main ground for the poſſibility of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, is the poſsibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of all Mettals, and ſuch Minerals as are of Mettalick princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, into their firſt Mercurialmater.</p>
                  <p>The third Concluſion is in the eleventh ſtave, That among ſo many Mettaline or Mineral Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs and ſo many Sulphurs there are but two that are related to our work, which Sulphurs have their Mercuries eſſentially united to them.</p>
                  <p>The fourth concluſion from the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35843:17"/>
ſame ſtave is, That he who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands theſe two Sulphurs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies aright, ſhall find that the one is the moſt pure red Sulphur of gold, which is Sulphur in <hi>manifeſto</hi> and Mercurius <hi>in occulto,</hi> and that other is moſt pure white Mercury, which is indeed true quickſilver, in <hi>manifeſto</hi> and Sulphur in <hi>occulto,</hi> theſe are our two principles.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Concluſion from the twelfth ſtave is, That if a mans prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be true, and his operations regular, his event wil be certain, which event is no other than the true myſtery.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Concluſions are but few in number, but of great weight, the amplification, illuſtration, and ilucidation therfore of them will make a Son of Art truly glad.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, Foraſmuch as it is not for our purpoſe here to invite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Art, onely intending to lead and guide the Sons of Art; we ſhall not prove the poſſibility of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimy, by many arguments, having done it abundantly in another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35843:17"/>
He then that will be incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, let him be incredulous, he that will cavil, let him cavil; but he whoſe mind is perſwaded of the truth of the Art, and of its dignity, let him attend to what is in the Illuſtration of theſe five Concluſions diſcovered, and his heart ſhall certainly rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall therefore briefly Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this firſt Concluſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt there more largely, where the ſecrets of the Art are moſt couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>For this firſt then which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in effect the truth of the Art, and its reality, he that would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be more ſatisfied in it, let him read the Teſtimoniy of all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and he that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Teſtimones of ſo many men, being moſt of them, men of renown in their own time, he wil cavill alſo againſt all other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall onely hold to <hi>Riplyes</hi> Teſtimony in this our key, who in the fourth ſtave, aſſures the King
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35843:18"/>
that at <hi>Lovain</hi> he firſt ſaw the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt perfect ſecrets, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the two Elixers; And in his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes, craves his confident credit, that he hath himſelf truly found the way of ſecret Alchimy, and promiſeth the diſcovery of it to the King, onely upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſecrecy.</p>
                  <p>And in the eighth ſtave, though he proteſts never to write it by pen, yet proffers the King at his pleaſure, to ſhew him ocularly the red and white Elixer, and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, which he promiſeth will be done for eaſie coſts in time. So then he that will doubt the truth of the Art, muſt account this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author, for a moſt ſimple mad Sophiſter, to write and offer ſuch things to his Prince, unleſs he were able in effect to do what he promiſed, from which imputation his writings, and alſo the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of him, of his fame, gravity, and worth will ſufficiently cleer him.</p>
                  <p>We now come to the ſecond
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35843:18"/>
Concluſion, the ſubſtance of which is, that all Mettals and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Metaline principles, may be reduced to their firſt Mercurial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and this is the main and chief ground for the poſſibility of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation. On this we muſt inſiſt largely &amp; fully, for (truſt me) this is the very hinge on which our ſecrets hang.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then know that all Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and ſeveral Minerals have ♁ for their next matter, to which (for the moſt part, nay indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes) there adheres, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coagulated an external Sulphur, which is not Mettaline, but diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from the internal kernel of the Mercury.</p>
                  <p>This Sulphur is not wanting even in common <hi>Argent vive,</hi> by the Mediation of which, it may be precipitated into the form of a dry pouder. Yea and by a liquor well known to us, (though nothing helping the Art of tranſmutation) it may be ſo fixed, that it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all fires, the Teſt and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35843:19"/>
and this without the addition of any thing to it, the liquor (by vertue whereof it is fixed) coming away intire, both in its <hi>Pondus</hi> and vertue.</p>
                  <p>This Sulphur in gold and ſilver is pure, in the other Mettals leſs pure, therefore in gold and ſilver it is fixed, in other it is fugitive, in all the Mettals it is coagulated in Mercury or Argent <hi>vive,</hi> it is coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulable in gold, ſilver, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, this Sulphur, is ſo ſtrongly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, that the Antients did ever judge Sulphur and Mercury to be all one, but we by the help of a liquor, the invention of which, in theſe parts of the World we owe to <hi>Paracelſus</hi> (though among the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> it hath been and is (at this day) commonly known to the acuter ſort of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>) by this I ſay we know that the Sulphur which is in Mercury coagulable, and in the Mettals coagulated, is external to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mercury, and may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the form of a tincted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35843:19"/>
Mettalick Oyle, the remaining Mercury being then void of all Sulphur, ſave that which may be called its inward Sulphur, and is now inincoagulable of it ſelf (though by our Elixer it is to be coagulated, but of it ſelf, it can neither be fixt nor precipitated, nor ſublimed, but remains unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all corroſive waters, and in all digeſtions of heat. One way then of Mercury azating all Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and Minerals, is by the liquor <hi>Alcaheſt,</hi> which out of all ſuch bodies as have Mercury in their conſtitution, can ſeparate a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Argent vive,</hi> from which <hi>Argent vive</hi> all its ſulphur is then ſeparated, ſave that onely which is internal and central to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, which internal Sulphur of Mercury no coroſive can touch, Next to this way of univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, there are alſo ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular wayes, by which ♄ ♃ ♁, yea, even ♀ and ♂ may be reduced into a running quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, by the help of Salts, which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35843:20"/>
becauſe (being corporeal, they pierce not ſo radically as the fore named liquor doth, they therefore do not ſo ſpoile the Mercury of its Sulphur but that as much Sulphur as there is in common Mercury, ſo much alſo there is in this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury of the bodies, onely this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury hath ſpecificated qualities according to the nature of the Mettal or Mineral, from which it was extracted, and from that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as to our work, which is to diſſolve perfect <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Mettals) it hath no more vertue than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Argent vive:</hi> There is then but only one humidity, which is applicable unto our work, which certainly is neither of ♄ nor ♀, nor is drawn from any thing, which nature hath formed, but from a ſubſtance compounded by the Art of the Philoſopher. So then, if a Mercury drawn from the bodies, have not onely the ſame deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of heat and ſuperfluity of foeces as common Mercury hath, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a diſtinct ſpecificated form, it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35843:20"/>
muſt (by reaſon of this its form) be ſo much the farther remote from our Mercury then common <hi>Argent vive</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>Our Art therefore is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound two principles (one in which the ſalt, and another in which the Mercury of nature doth abound) which are not yet perfect, nor yet totally imperfect and by conſequence) may therefore (by our Art be exalted with that (which is totally perfect, cannot be) and then by common Mercury to extract not the <hi>Pondus,</hi> but the celeſtial vertue out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, which vertue (being fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental) begets in the common Mercury an off-ſpring more noble than it ſelf, which is our true <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite,</hi> which will congeal it ſelf, and diſſolve the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; obſerve but a grain of Corn in which ſcarce a diſcernable part is ſprout, and this ſprout, if it were out of the grain, would dye in a moment; the whole grain is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, yet the ſprout onely produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35843:21"/>
the herb: So is it in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the fermental ſpirit that is in it, is ſcarce a third pars of the whole, the reſt is of no value, yet all is joyned in the compoſition, and the <hi>faeculent corporeous,</hi> part of the body comes away with the dreggs of the Mercury. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the example given of a grain, it may be obſerved that the hidden and ſpiritual vertue of this our body, doth purge and purifie its matrix of water, in which it is ſowen, that is, it makes it caſt forth a great quantity of filthy earth, and a great deal of Hydropical ſaline moiſture. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance make thy waſhings (for a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) with pure and clean fountain-water, weigh firſt a pint of the ſame water, and take the exact weight of it, then waſh thy compound eight or ten times, ſave all the faeces, weigh thy body and Mercury exactly, weigh thy faeces being very dry, then diſtill or ſublime all that will ſublime a very little quick Mercury will aſcend; then put the Reſidue of the faeces in a crucible, ſet them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35843:21"/>
on the coals, and all the faeculency of the Mercury will burn like a coal, yet without fume; when that is all conſumed, weigh the remaining faeces, and thou ſhalt find them to be two thirds of thy body, the others being in the Mercury, weigh the Mercury which thou ſublimedſt, and the Mercury prepared by itſelf, and the weight of both will not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thy Mercury weight by farre. So then boile up thy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a skin, in which thou madeſt thy Lotions, for that is a thick wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and in a cool place thou ſhalt have Chriſtals, which is the ſalt of Mercury Crude, and no way fit for Medicines; yet it is a content for the Artiſts to ſee how the Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyties of Mercury are diſcovered, which no other Art ſave the liquor of <hi>Alcaheſt</hi> can do, and that in a deſtructive, and not a generative way as this is, for this operation of ours is made between male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, within their own kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which there is a ferment which effecteth that which no other
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35843:22"/>
thing in the world could do. In all truth, I tell you, that if you ſhould take our imperfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound body, <hi>per ſe,</hi> and Mercury <hi>per ſe,</hi> and them alone, though you might bring out of the one a moſt pure Sulphur, and out of the other Mercury of Mercury, which is the nut of Mercury, yet with theſe thou couldſt effect nothing, for fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal virtue is the wonder of the World, and it is by it, that water becomes Herbs, Trees, and Plants, Fruits, Fleſh, Blood, Stones, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and every thing, look then for it onely, and rejoyce in it as in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly invaluable treaſure; Now know that fermentation, work not out of kind, neither do ſalts ferment Mettals; Wilt thou know then whence it is that ſome fixt Alcalyes do extract a Mercury out of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and out of the more imperfect Metals, conſider then, that in all theſe bodies the Sulphur is not ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically mixt and united, as it is in Silver and Gold. Now Sulphur is of Kin to divers Alcalyes, that are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35843:22"/>
ordinarily diſſolved or melted with it, and by this means the Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al parts are diſjoyned, and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent vive</hi> is by fire ſeparated. The Mercury thus ſeparated, is ſpoyled of its Sulphur when as indeed there needs onely a depuration of the Sulphur by ſeparating the impure from the pure; but theſe ſalts having ſeparated the Sulphur do leave the Mercury worſe, that is, more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from a Metallick nature, than it was before, for in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that Sulphur of Saturn will not burn, but though it be ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, calcined, made ſugar, or vitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet by fire and fluxes it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the ſame it was in before, but its Sulphur being (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) ſeperated, will take fire, if joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Salt-peter, even as common Sulphur doth, So that the Salts act on the Sulphur of which they rob the Mercury, they act not for want of ferment which is not to be found, but onely among Homogeneall things. Therefore the ferment of bread leavens not a ſtone, nor doth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35843:23"/>
the ferment of any animal or vigeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ferment a mettal or mineral.</p>
                  <p>So then, though out of Gold thou mighteſt obtaine a Mercury by the help of the Liquor, of the firſt ens of Salt, yet that Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would never accompliſh our work, whereas on the otherſide made out of Gold by our Mercury, though there be three parts of our Mercury to one of Gold, This Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury I ſay will by continual digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) accompliſh the whole work, marvell not then, that our Mercury is more powerfull, which is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Mercury, for certainly the ferment, which commeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the compound Body and the Water, cauſeth a death, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, it doth that, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world can do, beſides it ſevers from Mercury a terres trei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which burns like a Coale, and an Hydropical humor melting in common water, but the reſidue is acuated by a Spirit of life, which is our true embryonated Sulphur of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35843:23"/>
our water, not viſible, yet work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſibly; We conclude that all operations for our Mercury but by common Mercury, and our body according to our Art are erronious, and will never produce our myſtery, although they be other wiſe never ſo wonderfull. For as the Author of the Newlight ſaith, No water in any Iſland of the Phyloſophers, was wholeſom, but that which was drawn out of the reines of the Soll and Luna. Wilt thou know what that meanes? Mercury in its pond us and incombuſtibility is Gold fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, our Body in its purity, is called the Phyloſophers Luna being farre more pure than the imperfect met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and its Sulphur alſo as pure as the Sulphur of Soil, not that it is indeed Luna, for it abides not in the fire, now in the compoſition of theſe three (1) our common Mercury and the two principles of our compound there interceeds, the ferment of Luna, out of which though it be a Body, proceeds yet a ſpecificating odor: yea and oft
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35843:24"/>
the pondus of it is diminiſhed: If the compound be much waſht, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is ſufficiently clean. So then the ferment of Soll and Luna inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in our compoſition, which ferment begets an ofſpring, more noble than it ſelf a 1000 fold, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſhould'ſt thou work on our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Body by a violent way of Salts, thou ſhould'ſt have thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury by farre leſs noble, than the Body, the Sulphur of the Body being ſeparated and not exalted by ſuch a progreſs.</p>
                  <p>We now come to the third conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is that among all metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and mineral Sulphur there are onely two, that belong to our work, which two have their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies eſſentially united with them. This is the truth of our ſecrets, though we (to ſeduce the unwary) do ſeem to aver the contrary, for do not think that (becauſe we do inſinuate two waies, therefore) we really mean as we ſay, for veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as witneſſeth <hi>Ripley</hi>) There is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35843:24"/>
no true principles but one, Nor have we but one matter, nor but one way of working upon that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor but one regimen of heat, and one linear way of proceeding.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Sulphurs as they are principles of our work, they ought to be homogeneal, for it is onely Gold ſpiritual that we ſeek, firſt white, then red, which Gold is no other then that which the vulgar ſee, but they know not the hidden ſpirit that is in it. This principle wants nothing but Compoſition, and this compoſition muſt be made, with our other crude white Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur which is nothing but Mercury vulgar, by frequent cohobation of it upon our Hermaphroditical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo long till it be come a fiery water.</p>
                  <p>Know therefore that Mercury hath in its ſelf a Sulphur, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unactive, our Art is to multiply in it a living active Sulphur, which comes out of the loyns of our Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphroditical Body, whoſe father
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35843:25"/>
is a metal and his mother a mineral, Take then the moſt beloved daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Saturn, whoſe armes are a circle Argent, and on it a ſable croſs on a blackfield, which is the ſignall note of the great World, eſpouſe her to the moſt warlike God, who dwels in the houſe of Aries, and thou ſhalt find the Salt of Nature, with this Salt acuate thy water, as thou beſt knoweſt, and thou ſhalt have the Lunary bath, in which the Sun will be amended.</p>
                  <p>And in all truth I aſſure thee, that although thou hadſt our body Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialized (without the addition of Mercury of any of the metals) made <hi>per ſe,</hi> that is without the addition of Mercury, it would not be in the leaſt profitable unto thee, for it is our Mercury onely, which hath a Celeſtial form and power, which it receives, not onely, nor ſo much from the compound body, as from the fermental virtue which proceeds from the compoſition of both the body and the Mercury, by which is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35843:25"/>
produced a wonderfull Creature: So then let all thy care be to marry Sulphur with Sulphur, that is our Mercury which is impraegnated, which Sulphur, muſt be eſpouſed with our ☉ then haſt thou two Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers married and two Mercuries of one off ſpring, whoſe father is the ☉ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> the mother.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Concluſion makes all perfectly plain, which hath been ſaid before, namely that theſe two Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs are the one moſt pure red Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Gold, and the other of moſt pure clean white Mercury.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are our two Sulphurs, the one appears a coagulated body, and yet carries its Mercury in its belly: the other is in all its proportions true Mercury, yet very clean and carries its Sulphur within its ſelf, though hidden under the form and fluxibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Mercury.</p>
                  <p>Sophiſters are (here) in a labyrinth, for becauſe they are not acquainted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35843:26"/>
with metalline love, they work in things altogether heterogeneal, or if they work upon metalline bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they yet either joyne males with males, or elſe females with females, or elſe they work on each alone, or elſe they take males, which are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with natural inabilities, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males whoſe matrix is vitiated Thus by there own inconſideration they fruſtrate their own hopes, and then caſt the blame upon the Art, when as indeed it is onely to be imputed to their own folly, in not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Phyloſophers.</p>
                  <p>I know many pittifull Sophiſters do dote on many Stones, vigitable, animal, and mineral, and ſome to thoſe add the fiery Angelical, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radaical Stone, which they call a Wonder working eſſence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the mark they aim at, is ſo great, the Waies alſo, by which they would attain their Scope, they make alſo a double, one Way they call the <hi>Via Humida,</hi> the other, the <hi>Via Sicca,</hi> (to uſe their languages).</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:35843:26"/>The latter Way is the labirinthian path, which is fit onely for the great ones of the earth to tread in, the other the dedalean path, an eaſie way of ſmall coſt for the poor of the world, to enterprize.</p>
                  <p>But this I know and can teſtifie that there is but one Way, and but onely one Regimen, no more Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours than ours, and what we ſay or write otherwiſe, is but to deceive the unwary, for if every thing in the world ought to have its proper cauſes, there cannot be any one end, which is produced from two waies of working on diſtinct principles. Therefore we proteſt and muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain admoniſh the Reader that (in our former writings) we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed much, by reaſon of the two waies we have inſinuated, which is the play of children, and the work of women, and that is decoction by the fire, and we proteſt that the loweſt degree of this our work, is that the matter be ſtirred up, and may hourly circulate without feare
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35843:27"/>
of breaking of the veſſel, which for this reaſon ought to be very ſtrong, but our linear decoction is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal work, which advances every day and hour, and is diſtinct from that of outward heat, and therefore is both inviſible and inſenſible. In this our Work, our Diana is our body when it is mixed with the water, for then all is called the Moon, for Laton is whitened, and the Woman beares rule, our Diana hath a wood, for in the firſt dayes of the Stone, our body after it is whitened grows vegitably. In this wood, are at the laſt found two Doves, for about the end of three weeks, the ſoul of the Mercury aſcends, with the ſoul of the diſolved Gold, theſe are in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the everlaſting armes of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, for in this ſeaſon the confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are all tincted with a pure green colour, theſe Doves are circulated ſeven times, for in ſeven is perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then they are left dead, for they then riſe and move no more, our Body is then black like to a Crowes bill, for in this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35843:27"/>
all is turned to pouder, blacker than the blackeſt. Such paſſages as theſe we do oftentimes uſe, when we ſpeak of the preparation of our Mercury, and this we do to deceive the ſimple, and it is alſo for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end that we confound our ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſpeaking of one, when we ought to ſpeak of another, for if this Art were but plainly ſet down, our operatiations would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible even to the fooliſh. Therefore believe me in this, that becauſe our workes are truly Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, we therefore do take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to confound the Phyloſophers work, with that which is purely Natures work, that ſo we might keep the ſimple in ignorance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our true Vinegre, which being unknown, their labor is wholly loſt.</p>
                  <p>Let me then (for a cloſe) ſay one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus much; Take our Body which is Gold, and our Mercury which is ſeven times acuated by the marriage of it, with our Hermaphroditicall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35843:28"/>
Body, which is a Chaos, and it is the ſplendor of the ſoul of the God Mars, in the earth, and water of Saturn, mix theſe two in ſuch a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus as nature doth require, In this mixture you have our inviſible fires, for in the water our Mercury is an active Sulphur or mineral fire, and in the Gold a dead paſſive, but yet actual Sulphur now when that Sulphur of the Gold is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up and quickned, there is made between the fire of nature which is as the Gold, and the fire againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is in the Mercury, a fire partly of the one and partly of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for it partakes of both, and by theſe two fires thus united into one, is cauſed both Corruption (which is Humiliation) and Generation (which is Glorification and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:) Now know that God onely governs this way of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire, man being ignorant of the progreſs thereof, onely by his reaſon beholding its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he is able to diſcern that it is hot, that is, that it doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35843:28"/>
the action of heat, which is decoction, In this fire there is no ſublimation, for ſublimation is an exaltation, but this fire is ſuch an exaltation, as that beyond it, is no perfection.</p>
                  <p>All our work then is onely to multiply this fire, that is to circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the body ſo long until the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sulphur be augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Again this fire is an inviſible Spirit, and therefore not having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentions, is neither above nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but every where in the Sphere of the activity of our matter in the Veſſel; So that though the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial viſible ſubſtance do ſublime and aſcend by the action of the elemental heat, yet this ſpiritual virtue is alway as well in that which remains in the bottom, as in that which is in the upper part of the Veſſel. for it is as the ſoul in the body of man, which is every where at the ſame time, and yet bounded or termined in none.</p>
                  <p>This is the ground of one Sophiſm
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35843:29"/>
of ours, (<hi>viz.</hi>) when we ſay that in this true Philoſophical fire, there is no ſublimation, for the fire is the life, and the life is a ſoul, which is not at all ſubject to the dimenſions of Bodies, Hence alſo it is that the opening of the Glaſs or cooling of the ſame during the time of working kils the life or fire, that is in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Sulphur, and yet not one grain of the mettal is loſt. The elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fire then is that which any child knowes how to kindle and govern, but it is the Philoſopher onely, that is able to diſcern the true inward fire for it is a wonderful thing, which acts in the body, yet is no part of the body. Therefore the fire is a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial virtue it is uniformed, that is, it is alwaies the ſame untill the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of its operation is come, and then being come to perfection it acts no more, for every Agent, when the end of its action is come then reſts.</p>
                  <p>Remember then that when we ſpeak of our fire which ſublimes not, that thou do not miſtake and think
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35843:29"/>
that the moiſture of the compound which is within the Glaſs ought not to ſublime, for that it muſt do <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſantly, but the fire that ſublimes not, is the metalline love, which is above and below and in all places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Now then for a cloſe to all that hath been ſaid, learn and be well adviſed what matter you take in hand, for an evil Crow laies an evil Egg, as the proverb hath it, let thy ſeed be pure, and thy matrix alſo pure, then ſhalt thou ſee a noble off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, let the fire without be ſuch, as in which our confections may play to &amp; fro unceſſantly, &amp; this (in a few daies) will produce that which thou moſt longeſt for, the Crows Bill.</p>

                  <head>A CAVEAT FOR ALCHYMISTS, OR, A warning to all ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentlemen, whether <hi>Laicks</hi> or <hi>Clericks,</hi> that ſtudy for the finding out of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone; ſhewing how that they need not to be cheated of their Eſtates, either by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of others, or by their own idle conceits.</head>

                     <head>The firſt Chapter.</head>
                     <p>WHereas I am ſhortly to demonſtrate before the High and Honourable Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35843:32"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> that there is ſuch a thing feiſible as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone; or to ſpeak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, an Art in the tranſmutation of Mettals, which will cauſe many a thouſand men to undo and begger themſelves, in the ſearching for the ſame: I cannot chuſe but to publiſh theſe advertiſements, for that is a fundamental point in my Religion, to do good to all men, as well ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as friends: If I could be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the publiſhing thereof, would do more good than hurt; then the world ſhould have it in plain terms, and as plain as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries receit: But in regard that I have often vowed to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty upon my knees, to do the greateſt good with it, that my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding could perſwade me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, I have craved the advice of the Honourable Parliament, for that I have ſtrongly conceived an opinion, that by the well contriving of the uſe of it, the worlds ill manners may be changed into better: if this can be done, then I ſhould break my
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35843:32"/>
vow to God, if I ſhould not do my beſt endeavours, and therefore I dare not to cheat God Almighty (having obtained this bleſſed ſcience of his free gift) and go into a corner, and there eat, drink and ſleep like a ſwine, as many have done before me, upon whom this bleſſed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hath been unworthily beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but had rather improve it to his glory, if my counſel craved ſhall ſo think fit. But howſoever my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to do ſome conſiderable good with it howſoever, that is, to make my ſelf a ſea-mark, to the end, that no ingenious Gentleman ſhall from henceforth be undone by the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this noble Art, as many have heretofore been</p>
                     <p>Therefore my firſt Caveat ſhall be to ſhew, that no man needs to be damnified above the value of 20. s. to try whether he be in a right way to it, or not?</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Caveat ſhall be, to ſhew a way how to try whether any wandring Alchymiſt, that promiſeth golden mountains, know any thing or not?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:35843:33"/>The third Caveat ſhall be, to ſhew how any mans Iudgement ought to be grounded by a Concordance of the beſt books, before he fall to practice?</p>
                     <p>The fourth Caveat ſhall be, to ſhew which are falſe books, and which are true ones, to the end that every ſtudent in this excellent Art, may trouble himſelf with fewer books, till he hath made a Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and hath gathered the ſame out of the aenigmatical diſcourſes, and hieroglifical figures, wherein this Art is hidden, and never to be found in plain terms, nor written plainly in any receipt.</p>
                     <p>Well for the firſt Caveat, that no man needs to be damnified above 20. s. to know whether he be in a right way, or not, let him be pleaſed to conſider, that without <hi>putrefactio unius,</hi> there can be no <hi>generatio al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius</hi>; as in all other ſublunary bodies, as well Animals as Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, right ſo in Minerals and Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he that cannot take one
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35843:33"/>
ounce of the filings of copper, or any other baſe Mettal, and by an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious addition of a Mineral moiſture of the ſame kind, putrefie the ſame in a few moneths, and make it total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly volatil, except a few faeces of no conſiderable weight, then he is out of the way, and is not to meddle with gold or ſilver, or any thing of great price: for he ſhall never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his deſire, (though he ſpend his whole life, time and eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Alſo he that hath not gathered a Concordance, by reading of books, which cannot be controlled by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wit, is not fit to begin to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice this noble Art, and not in one part thereof, but in ſix ſeveral parts, which are theſe that follow.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is clear that he muſt have a Mineral ſpirit, before he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve a Mineral body, or elſe he will work out of kind; and if he think that Quickſilver, which is ſold at the Apothecaries ſhops, is this Mineral ſpirit, then he is deceived, and will find it to be ſo; but the truth is, that if nature had not created quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35843:34"/>
this Art could never have been found; not that it can be made the Philoſopical diſſolvent, by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration whatſoever, but without it the firſt diſſolvent (for there are three) cannot be gotten: for it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath power to ſeparate this Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpirit, from a crude Mineral, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the mine, which the fire hath never touched, and no other thing under heaven can do it elſe, no more than any creature beſides a Bee, can extract hony out of a flower.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that he muſt know the ſecret of diſsolution, (which is not by the common way uſed by Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, but by the way meant by <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus Comes Troviſanus,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>hujus diſſolutionis via pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſimis eſt nota:</hi> and I know not one Alchymiſt this day, nor ever did, to whom, if I ſhould have given him the true diſsolvent in one hand, which is a ponderous bright water, and the diſsolvend in the other hand, which is a powder, or filings of mettal: ye he knew not how to diſsolve it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:35843:34"/>Thirdly, he muſt know what is meant by the hollow Oak, a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon not very unfit for the furnace, wherein this ſecret of diſsolution, is to be accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he muſt know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and manner of refixing his bodies when he hath made them volatil, by this ſecret way of diſsolution.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, he muſt know the ſecret of projection, which hath beguiled many, when by their great charges ſtudy and labour, they have made the Philoſophers Stone, ſo that they could make no uſe it. For when it is mingled with the imperfect met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, yea, though prepared philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically, not vulgarly, yet there is another thing to be done, before the mettal tranſmuted goeth to the teſt, or elſe all is loſt: and if any one will not believe me, let him read the books of <hi>Raymundus Lullius,</hi> and he ſhall finde in three ſeveral places, in ſeveral books, that after projection, the matter muſt be put in <hi>cineritio,</hi> in <hi>vaſi longo,</hi> but he ſaith alſo, <hi>non intelligas quod ponas plumbum in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35843:35"/>
cineritio</hi>: for there is ſomthing to be ſeparated by the Art of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, before the lead come to do its duty, or elſe all will be gone accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying: <hi>totum vertitur in fumum, quicquid ineptus agit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, he muſt know the fire, and the regiment thereof; and alſo the nature, which is to be gentle, continual, compaſſing round about the matter, and not burning it.</p>
                     <p>And now that I have ſhewed what an Artiſt muſt know, or elſe all his labour and charge is loſt, I wiſh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to conſider what a hazard he undergoeth, if he meddle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of theſe ſix ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, for ſo much as he may very well faile, though he have them, I mean, though he have the Theorick, yet he may fail in the Practick.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if any ſmoak ſeller, or wandring Alchymiſt, ſhall come to any ingenious Gentleman that ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Art, though he bring with him a recipe that promiſeth golden mountains, and maketh affidivit, I mean that ſearcheth never ſo deeply,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35843:35"/>
that he hath done it, or ſeen it done, which is a common trick amongſt wandring Alchymiſts: believe him not, unleſs he can ſatisfie you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all the ſix former mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſecrets, for if you do believe him having not that knowledge, I will give my word for him, that he ſhall cozen you. For there is but <hi>unica via, unica operatio,</hi> to accompliſh any work in Alchymie, which is as hard to be found, as the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this world, where there are an hundred Religions, or rather an hundred Sects of Religion, wherein the true Religion is ſmothered and bemiſted, even as the way to make the Philoſophers Stone is, by the idle conceits of men, that are ruled by opinion, more than by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>As for example, on <hi>Petrus Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ferrarienſis</hi> a great learned man, and a Doctor of the chair of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, wrote a book called <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garita Pretioſa,</hi> and penned it moſt admirably, concerning the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtone, and the way to make it;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35843:36"/>
and when he had done, confeſsed that he never had made it, yet he gueſsed indifferent well, but all his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not worth a button. I would give an impreſſion of his books away freely, that I had his School-learning, but as for his knowledge, I would not give two pence: whereby it may be ſeen how eaſily wiſe men may be deceived, and therefore let fools look about them before they attempt this noble ſcience.</p>
                     <p>Alſo one <hi>Gaſton Dulco Cl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>vens,</hi> a great Champion that quarrelled with all oppoſers of this ſacred Art, and wrote a book, which is greatly eſteemed by Alchymiſts, and ſeemeth very rational to all thoſe, which have not the practick, wherein he defendeth the truth of this Art by 32 Arguments, and many experiments, which are all falſe, upon my certain knowledge, and if my purſe could ſpeak it, ſhould ſwear it.</p>
                     <p>And many others have written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, which knew nothing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35843:36"/>
but what they had collected out of books, to what end, I know not, unleſs it were to draw other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men unto them, thinking to gain ſome knowledge by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                     <p>Alſo another, whoſe name I have forgotten (for it is a great while ſince I read any books) wrote a book intituled <hi>De interitu Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> which is as fooliſh as any of the other, unleſs that when all his hopes were at an end, he thought that ſome man would have come unto him, and confuted him, by ſhewing him the experience of it.</p>
                     <p>Well thus much for falſe books; now as for true ones, I could name many, that could not be written, but by thoſe that had made certain trial of the work; but for brevity ſake, <hi>and to keep this book within the price promiſed, viz. two pence</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will name onely four, viz. The Compound of Alchymie, written by <hi>Georgius Ripleus Anglus,</hi> The Hierogliphical Figures of <hi>Nicholaus Tilamellus,</hi> whoſe body lieth buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35843:37"/>
in <hi>Paris</hi>: The works of <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus Lullius</hi>; The two books of <hi>Bernardus Comes Tieviſanus:</hi> Theſe four men ſhewed by their actions, that they had the Art of the tranſmutation of Mettals. For <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Ripleus Anglus,</hi> maintained an Army of ſouldiers at <hi>Rhodes</hi> againſt the Turks, at his own charge: <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholaus Tilamellus</hi> builded up ſeven Churches, and ſeven Hoſpitals at <hi>Paris,</hi> and endowed them with good revenues, which may be eaſily proved: <hi>Raymundus Lullius</hi> made gold in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> to furniſh an <hi>Army</hi> to go againſt the Turks: <hi>Bernardus Comes Treviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> recovered his Earldome again, which he had formerly ſpent in the ſeeking of this Art. And now me thinks, I hear every one demanding, how ſhall we do to find out this grat ſecret?</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Geber</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, and a famous Philoſopher ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in his own words, viz. <hi>non per lectionem librorum, ſed per immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam cognitionem, per profundam
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35843:37"/>
imaginationem, &amp; per aſſiduam praxim</hi>: and when all this is done; he concludeth, that <hi>eſt donum Dei Altiſſimi, qui cui vult, largitur, &amp; ſubtrahit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well now me thinks I hear the couſening Alchymiſts, ſaying, what ſhall we do now, we have no other living? To which I anſwer, that I would gladly rid the world of chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters if I could: but if they muſt needs couzen, then let them trade with thoſe that have ſo little love to art, that they cannot afford to read this book, to defend themſelves, and that will improve the wits of the world very much, ſo that it may poſſibly do more good than hurt: for the truth is that the world is unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, only for want of wit, which I have demonſtrated in a little book lately printed, which ſheweth how any Kingdome may live in great plenty, proſperity, health, peace and happineſs, and the King and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours may live in great honour and riches, and not have half ſo much trouble, as is uſual in theſe times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:35843:38"/>
and if any one ſhall be cheated, and lay the fault upon me for diſcovering of cheats in this book, I cannot help it: for he that is willing to do good, muſt needs do ſome hurt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs men were Angels. But in this caſe I ſee not but my action is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable: for firſt, I have given every one an antidote againſt cheating, and if they will not take it, let them be cheated, and then I will ſhew them a way to recover their loſſes, by an experiment tryed upon my ſelf: for till I was ſoundly cheated of divers hundred pounds, I thought my ſelf to be a very knowing man: but then I found that I was a fool, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained not to learn wit at any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hands that could teach me, whereby I attained a conſiderable quantity of knowledge, which I will not give or change, for any mans eſtate whatſoever; but though I ſped ſo well by being cheated, yet I wiſh all others to take heed, for fear leaſt that their fortunes prove not ſo good as mine.</p>

                     <head>The ſecond Chapter.</head>
                     <p>WHereas I have profeſſed my ſelf to be an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheator, it behoveth me to diſcover the ſeveral ways whereby the world is ſo univerſally cheated by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening Alchymiſts: and therefore though I could diſcover fourſcore cheats, yet at this time I will onely diſcover fourgrand ones, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſhall be to diſcover the knavery of <hi>Kelly</hi> the grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of the world, whom the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Germany</hi> kept priſoner in a Caſtle, and maintained him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably, thinking either by fair means or by foule, to get the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers Stone out of him, who God knows had it not but made divers coſening projections before great men, which by the report thereof, have cauſed many to ſpend all that ever they had; and it cannot be well eſtimated, how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds have been
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35843:39"/>
ſpent in <hi>Europe</hi> about it, ſince that time, more than before.</p>
                     <p>And thus one of his projections was made before three great men ſent over by Q <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to ſee the truth of the buſineſs. He gave order to them to buy a warming panne, which they did accordingly, and brought it to him; he took a pair of compaſſes, and marked out a round plate in the middle of the cover thereof, and with a round chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel he took out the piece; then he put it in the fire, and when it was red hot, he put a little pouder upon it, which flowed all over it, and made it to look like to gold, which is an eaſie matter to be done: but when he came to fit it to the hole, he had a piece of good gold, taken out of a plate of gold by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, not altered, and this by a trick of Legerdemain, or ſlight of hand (a thing common, for I have known a Porter that could have done it) he conveyed into the place, and delivered the warming panne <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nto the hands of the ſpectators, who brought
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35843:39"/>
it into <hi>England,</hi> and the noiſe thereof made almoſt all mens ears to tingle, and their fingers to itch, till they were at the buſineſs, and raiſed the price of Alchymie books fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Now if he had meant plain dealing, he would have given them ſome of his pouder home to their lodging, that they might have done the like again themſelves at home, but he neither offered it, neither did they deſire it, at which I marvel: for if he had denyed that, as it is like that he would, then the kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very had been preſently diſcovered, ſo that this falſe news had not been brought into <hi>England,</hi> whereby many men have received great loſs. Some have reported that he clipped out a ſheard with a pair of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths ſheers, and then he took a little more time, and caſt one of gold like to it, which is eaſily done: whetherſoever he did, the whole ſcope of the buſineſs argueth chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and his meaning was nothing elſe, but by either of theſe wayes, to make the ſpectators to be leſs
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35843:40"/>
ſuſpitious; like to a jugler that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth up his ſleeves for the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpoſe. But admit that he had the true Philoſophers Stone, and that the body of a Mettal might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by it, and turned into true gold, without reduction of it to the firſt matter, which is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: yet he was a deteſtable vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to publiſh it in ſuch manner, to the great dammage of ſo many men as were thereby irritated to undoe themſelves, and not to give them ſome Advertiſements, like to theſe in this book, whereby they might be preſerved from undergoing any conſiderable loſs. But the old ſaying proved true, <hi>qualis vita, finis ita:</hi> he loſt his ears in <hi>London</hi> for chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, when he was a young couſener; and when he was grown too skilfull to be diſcovered by men, then God Almighty took puniſhment of him; for he bought as much linnen cloth, pretending to make ſhirts and other things, as he thought would ſerve to let him down to the ground out at a window in the Tower of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35843:40"/>
wherein he was a priſoner; and whether his hold ſlipped, or the cloth was too ſhort, I could never learn certainly; but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he fell down and broke his bones, and died, and there was an end of him.</p>

                        <head>The ſecond Cheat.</head>
                        <p>A Nobleman in <hi>England</hi> thought that he had a tranſmutation of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per into ſilver ſhewed to him, and thus the cheat was done. Firſt, the cheater made two ingots of copper both alike, then he filed one of them into two equal parts, or very neer the middle; then he got a piece of ſilver faſhioned like to the longer end, but a little longer; then he got a Silver-ſmith to let the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other curiouſly, and ſoder it ſo, that the piecing could not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned, but that it appeared plainly to be one piece of mettal, onely of two colours, to wit, white and red: then he painted it all over with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour made of copper, as is hereafter
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35843:41"/>
declared; then he dried it, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it over three times or more, till the colour was equal to the other, when this was done he brought that which was all copper to the Earl, and prayed him to file it at both ends, which was done; then he took it, and went to fetch his white pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a very little thereof, being made like to a Painters colour, with a little vinegar, he prayed the Earl to paint it half way over, and ſo it was done: the Earl ſuppoſing he had painted the ſame ingot, which he formerly fi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

than ever any Alchymiſt, or yet the beſt Philoſopher in the world, did ever make; for it was all fine ſilver, without any waſt at all, which was conſiderable before the refining: but if he had meant plain dealing, he would have divided his white pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into two equal parts, and have made his ingots but half ſo big, and would have done the firſt part him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the Earl, and would have left him to do the other part him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his abſence, but this he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offered, neither did the Earl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, whereat I marvel. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got was ſhewed to many, and cauſed many a thouſand pound to be ſpent, ſome by the ſaid Earl, and ſome by others, that were thereby encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and no doubt but that he had a great reward for couſening him; for great men will have honourable rewards to a man, that can ſatisfie them in the truth of this Art, and that they are ſatisfied fully, ſo long as the deception is not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

colour, it might be thus done. Take filings of copper, and twice as much quickſilver, and grinde them upon a Painters marble ſtone, with a little ſalt and vinegar, and they will come into a Maſs, then waſh away the ſalt and vinegar with common water, till the maſs be bright as ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but ſoft; then ſet it in a gentle heat all night, and it will be hard, then grinde it with a little more quickſilver, not too much to make it very liquid, and ſet it in a gentle heat again till it be very hard, and this work reiterate, till it will drink up no more quickſilver, then are the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings burſt into attoms; then evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the quickſilver in a crucible, with a gentle heat firſt, and afterwards, make it red hot, ſo will the copper be in red pouder; this red pouder muſt be ſtamped in a marble morter, with warm water, and ever as the water is coloured red, it muſt be poured of into a great Jarre glaſs, and new water put to it, and ſo the work muſt be reiterated, till it will colour the water no more, then let

the water ſtand a night, till the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour be ſetled to the bottom, then poure off the clear water, and dry the reſt in the Sun, or in any gentle heat, &amp; it will be as fine as any fine wheat flower, which muſt be ground upon a Painters marble ſtone, with gum-water, till a Painter may paint with it.</p>

crciuble; and when he wanted mony, he would go to a rich hoſteſs in ſome City, and take a chamber for a week, and when he had been there a day or two, and had payed royally, the next morning he would be ſick, and keep his bed, and when his Hoſteſs came to viſit him, he would ask her, if ſhe could help him to a Goldſmith, that would do ſome buſineſs for him, and he would pay him for his pains very largely, ſo ſhe was ready, and brought one; he asked him if he could do him one hours work or two preſently, the Goldſmith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, yes Sir, with all my heart: ſo he took his purſe from under his pillow, and gave him half a crown, and prayed him to buy half an ounce of quickſilver, and bring it to him preſently, the Goldſmith did ſo; then he gave him his key, and prayed him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his portmantle, and take out a little box, and open it, where he found a crucible, and a little Ivory box, filled with the red pouder of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35843:43"/>
Vermillion; the Cheater prayed him to weigh out a grain of the red pouder, with his gold weights, which he did; then he bid him look well upon the crucible if it were a good one, and not cracked in the carryage; the Goldſmith ſaid it was as ſound an one as he had ſeen, and had a good ſtrong bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, then he bid him to put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the quickſilver, and the grain of red pouder, and ſet it into the fire, and by degrees melt it down, the Goldſmith did ſo; when it was melted, he bid him ſet it by to cool, and then break it; then he lay down in his bed, and after a little while, he asked the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith what he found in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, to which the Goldſmith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he found a little lump of gold, as good as ever he ſaw, ſo he prayed him to help him to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for it, for his money was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all ſpent; that I will ſaid the Goldſmith preſently, and went home, and weighed it, and brought him nineteen ſhillings in ſilver, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35843:44"/>
was deſirous to know, how that red pouder was made; he ſaid it was an extract out of gold, which he carried with him in his long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, for eaſe of carriage, and that there was no other grain in it, or elſe he would tell it him. So the Goldſmith asked him, how much he would have again of his half crown, and he ſhould have all if he pleaſe; for he was well enough paid for his work, in ſeeing that rare piece of Art: no ſaid the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſt, take it all, and I thank you too; ſo the Goldſmith took his leave, with great reſpect: then he laid down in his bed a little while, and by and by he knocked for his Hoſteſs, who came immediately, and he prayed her to call for a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whilſt that he wrote a note, ſhe did ſo: when the porter came, he ſent him to his fellow cheater, who lay in the other end of the Town, who preſently brought him a letter formally framed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them; upon the reading whereof, he called for his Hoſteſs
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35843:44"/>
again, and deſired her to fetch the Goldſmith again, ſhe did ſo; when ſhe brought him, he was riſing, and gruntled and groaned, and told the goldſmith, that though he was not well, yet neceſſity forced him to go about earneſt buſineſs, and ſhewed him the Letter, and prayed him to read it whilſt he put on his cloaths, and when the Goldſmith had read it, he ſaid, you ſee what a ſtrait I am in for twenty pounds, can you furniſh me, and to morrow or next day you ſhall work for me, and pay your ſelf, and I will leave you my box in pawn, which now you know how to make five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds of it, as well as I? the Goldſmith anſwered, it ſhall be done, and went down and told the Hoſteſs all things; and alſo told her, that the Gentleman was in great diſtreſs for twenty pounds, and that he had promiſed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him inſtantly, but he had but ten pounds by him, if ſhe pleaſed to furniſh him with the other ten pounds, ſhe ſhould be ſure enough
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35843:45"/>
to have it with great advantage, for ſo ſhort a time: for ſaith he, we ſhall have his box in pawn, and will make bold with twice as much of his pouder, as our money comes to; and beſides that, he will pay us royally I warrant you; and all the while I can do the work ſo well, that I ſhould be glad never to hear of him more; ſo ſhe agreed, and they brought him up twenty pounds preſently, whereupon he delivered them the box, and made a motion to have it ſealed up; but at length he ſaid, that becauſe they had furniſhed him in his neceſſity, and becauſe he eſteemed them to be honeſt people, in regard of his Hoſt, he would not ſtay to ſeal it, and ſo took his leave, and prayed the Goldſmith to be ready within a day or two, to help him to work, but from that day to this, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw him; ſo when he came not again vvithin a vvek or a fortnight, they concluded that ſome misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone had happened to him, or that he had taken cold by going abroad

ſo haſtily, being not well, and ſo was dead, for elſe he would have ſent about it before that time, if he were but ſick; ſo they reſolved to make uſe of it, and fell to work with great alacrity; but when they could make no gold, their hearts were cold, and they found themſelves to be miſerably cheated.</p>

                        <p>This Cheat is deſcribed in old <hi>Chawcer,</hi> in his <hi>Canterbury</hi> Tale; but becauſe everyone hath not that book, I will relate it briefly, and thoſe that would ſee it more largely deſcribed, ſhall be referred to the ſaid book.</p>
                        <p>And thus it was done: The Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter took a charcoal about two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches long, and one inch thick, and did cleave it through the middle, and made a little concavity in the middle thereof, and put in a little ingot of gold, weighing an ounce, into the middle of it, and glewed it up again, ſo that it ſeemed to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

but a very coal; then before the cheated, he put in one ounce of quickſilver into a crucib<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

ſo was earneſt with the cheater to teach him his Art, but what bargain they made I have forgotten, for it is twenty years ſince I read <hi>Chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> book.</p>

                           <hi>And firſt,</hi> To ſum up all, Let men beware of all books and receipts, that teach the multiplication of gold
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35843:47"/>
or ſilver, with common quickſilver by way of animation or <hi>minera,</hi> for they cannot be joyned inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by any <hi>medium,</hi> or means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

Let all men take heed of books, that teach any operations in vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or animals, be they never ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly penned; for it is as poſſible for a bird to live in the water, or for a fiſh to live in the air, as for any thing that is not radically mettallical, to live in the lead upon the teſt.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, let all men beware of his own conceit of wiſdom, for that hath undone many a man in this Art. Therefore let every one take notice, that though it be a thouſand to one

                        <p>Therefore if any man attempteth this Art, which hath not attained to ſuch a perfection in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nature, eſpecially in mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, that by his own ſpeculation and practice, without the help of books, he can write a rational diſcourſe of either animals, vegetables, or mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, in ſuch a ſolid way, that no man can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict it, without ſhame upon fair tryal, the queſtions being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated, then his labour and charge
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35843:48"/>
is the cauſe why ſo many men fall and undo themſelves in this Art; for if the ſearcher be quallified ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, then it is ten to one odds, that he ſpeedeth.</p>
                        <p>But to draw to an end: What ſhould I ſay more? Oh, if any man either in <hi>England,</hi> or beyond the Seas, ſhall trouble himſelf to write to me, he ſhall be ſure to have an anſwer, if he come to me, he ſhall be ſure to loſe his labour, if he think to win me by rewards, though never ſo great, he ſhall be ſure to get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Jeer; for I did not write this book with an intent to teach the Art abſolutely, but onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve men from undoing themſelves fooliſhly; which if it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of, will be found to be large charity: for but that I know where I am, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a free State, where the ſubjects know ſo well their own Liberties and Priviledges, that they will never ſuffer any Tyrannical Government to prevail in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhould have been ſure to have loſt my liberty by this ſingle action.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt man ſaid, that men, following the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, alwayes ſeek the neereſt way: which hath cauſed them to make Maxims of all things, whereas in truth, there is no Maxim of any thing; for by the moſt certain of all Rules, there is no Rule ſo Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35843:50"/>
but it hath ſome exception; nay there are ſo many exceptions, that we have often cauſe to doubt on which hand the Rule is.</p>
                  <p>And yet nevertheleſs men make Axiomes in all Sciences, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Phyſick, which taking upon it, the Government (as it were) of n<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ture, wraps up in general Laws, all diſeaſes with their Cauſes, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, and Remedies; although, as in the Law, ſo likewiſe in Phyſick, there never happen two caſes alike. And when theſe Rules come to be applyed to practice, every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he doth not find that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of thoſe Laws, which he had i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined to himſelf. But this is chiefly to be underſtood of particular and ſpecifical diſeaſes, ſuch as the Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, the Cataract, and the Gout. For general diſeaſes, and ſuch as meer diſtempers, may be cured by as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral remedies; that is, by ſuch things as have contrary qualities.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſaid, That ſpecifical is that which is determined to one; and hath above it, Generical, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35843:50"/>
below it, Individual: Now the queſtion is, Whether there be any remedies ſo determined to one <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> or ſort of diſeaſe, that they are fit for none elſe. I do think, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are diſeaſes of the whole form, or frame of Man, as are peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, venomous, and malignant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; ſo there are likewiſe as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral remedies. And experience ſhewes, as in divers admirable cures, that there are remedies; the effects of which, do not depend upon their firſt qualities. As in Rheubarbe to be purgative, in Mugwort, to be good againſt fits of the mother, and in Bezoar to be Cordiall, comes not from being cold or hot in ſuch a degree; for then every thing of the ſame temper with them, would be purgative; good againſt fits of the Mother, or Cordial, which is not ſo. But there is no reaſon why the ſame Remedy may not be fit for one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſeaſe, by its occult qualities, and yet good for others by its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt qualities, as food alſo is medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                  <p>The third ſaid, That this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35843:51"/>
depends upon another, namely, Whether mixt bodies work onely by their tempers and firſt qualities, or by their ſubſtantial forms, and ſpecifical vertues. For if the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every thing do not depend upon its whole form and ſubſtance, then Medicines cannot cure by their qualities of heat and cold, but by a particular and ſpecifical vertue, proceeding from their form, and wholly contrary to that of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. For the underſtanding whereof, it muſt be obſerved, That as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſtitution of each Mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth conſiſt in a perfect mixture of the four Elementary qualities, and in the fit diſpoſition of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the intireneſs of the form: ſo may it be changed one of theſe three wayes, either in its Temper, or in its Matter, or in its Form. And from thence it comes, that each mixt body, (as all medicinals are) can work upon our nature by its firſt, ſecond, and third Faculties. The firſt Faculties come onely from the Mixture of the four qualities, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diverſity of which, the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35843:51"/>
compound body, is either hot, as Pepper, or cold, as Mandrake, or moiſt, as Oyle, or dry, as Bole-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meniack, not immediately, but in operation. And by this Faculty on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which proceeds from the temper of the thing, it is, that the Medicine works chiefly upon the temper of mans body.</p>
                  <p>Their ſecond Faculty comes from the different mingling of theſe ſame qualities, with the Matter. For a hot temper joyned with a matter, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed according to its degree of heat, ſhall be opening or eating in, or corroſive, or burning, or of ſome other vertue, wherof there are many ſorts, according to the degrees of their mixture, from whence they are ſaid to be either Attenuating, or Thickning, Scouring, or Sticking to, Rarefying, or Condenſing, Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or binding, drawing, or beating back, ſoftning, or Hardning: and by this ſecond faculty onely, do Medicines work upon the Matter.</p>
                  <p>The third Faculty of Medicines, is that which comes not from their quality, nor from their Matter, but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35843:52"/>
from their Form, and from their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical and occult vertue; and ſuch is in the herb Sina, the faculty of purging away melancholy, and in Terra Sigillata, or Lemnia, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of the heart againſt poyſons; as alſo the Scorpions killing with his tail, and thence ſome poyſons do kill, without altering the Temper.</p>
                  <p>The fourth ſaid, That diſeaſes are to be conſidered either in their <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or in their <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or in their individuals.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, When the diſeaſe is nothing but a diſpoſition diſturbing the workings of nature; it may be cured by regaining the natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſecond, If it be a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (for example) cold in the ſecond degree, then the ſpecifical Medicine for it, is hot in the ſame degree; if it be a diſeaſe in ſome of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a mans body, as (for example) an obſtruction, then the only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is, to open the Conduits. If it be a breach, then the remedy is to peice again what is parted aſunder: But
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35843:52"/>
if the diſeaſe be conſidered in the individual, whoſe ſubſtantial Form it deſtroys; then muſt we uſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular remedies of the ſame nature; and thoſe are the true ſpicifical ones.</p>
                  <p>The fifth ſaid, It is the ſame thing with the cauſes of health, that it is with the cauſes of diſeaſes, Now we ſee that the ſame thing is hurtful to one, and not to another, and that not onely in different <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but alſo in ſeveral individuals of the ſame <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> becauſe of ſeveral circumſtances. And therefore ſome remedies will cure one, and will kill another; nay and that which was lately good, may be now hurtful for the ſame Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual: ſo that it is impoſſible to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any ſpecifical remedies for an Individual, and yet it is an Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual man that muſt be cured, and not the whole <hi>ſpecies</hi> of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſixth ſaid, That in nature, every thing is determined to one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Action; and this proceeds alone from its Form and Being, which hath a neerer relation to that one
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35843:53"/>
Action, than to any other: So a Tree is determined to bring forth one fruit rather than another, It is the ſame caſe with thoſe remedies, which are had from the three Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Animals, Vegetables and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. Some are proper to purge one particular humour, as choler, or melancholy, or water, or they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke vomiting, or urine, or by ſweat, or they are diſcuſſive, or cauſe ſneezing, or ſtop coughing. Other Medicines ſtrengthen one particular member, as the heart, the head, the liver, or the ſpleen; Some again are good againſt particular poyſons; So Treacle is ſpecifically good againſt a bite by a viper; So a Scorpion applyed to a place, which he hath ſtung, heals it; So the Oyle of Pine apple kernels is good againſt Orpiment; So long Hart wort &amp; Rue are good againſt <hi>Aconite</hi> or <hi>Wolf-bane,</hi> and the rinde of Lemon Tree againſt <hi>Nux Vomica:</hi> and the ſeeds of winter-cherry againſt <hi>Cantharides,</hi> and Mummy againſt the Ulcers made by <hi>wilde ſpurge</hi>: and the flower of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Lilly,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35843:53"/>
againſt <hi>Hellebore.</hi> So the root of wilde Roſes, and the herbs Gentiane, Balme, Betonie, and Pimpernel, are excellent againſt the biting of a mad dog, and ſo it is with others.</p>
                  <p>There are others called Amulets, which being worne about the neck, or laid to certain parts of the body, do preſerve from diſeaſes. So (as <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf reports) Pionie worne, keeps from the falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; So Wolfes dung allayes the Cholick, and Jaſper ſtrengthens the ſtomack; And <hi>Trallian</hi> aſſures that the <hi>Aetites,</hi> or Eagle-ſtone, cures the quotidian Agues; and ſnails, and green lizards cure quartan Agues; and that an Aſſes forehead, and a nail taken out of a broken ſhip, are good againſt the falling-ſickneſs; So the aſhes of Tad-poles and Frogs are uſed againſt the bloody Flux; <hi>Lapis Judaicus,</hi> and Goats blood, againſt the ſtone in the kidneys; and the water of a Stags head, and the bone of his heart, againſt the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the heart. Now there is no
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35843:54"/>
reaſon why all theſe marvellous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſhould be aſcribed to the firſt qualities; and therefore <hi>Galen</hi> laughs at his Maſter <hi>Pelops,</hi> who gave that reaſon for them.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh ſaid, That Phyſick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt found out by uſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hath no need of reaſon in thoſe things, which fall clearly under our ſenſes; but only in thoſe things which are beyond the preception of our ſenſes; the which being confirmed by reaſon, are much the more infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. However, when reaſon ſeems to thwart experience, we ought rather to ſtick to experience, ſo it be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon many obſervations: Seeing then that experience ſhews us there are many ſpecifical remedies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the weak wit of man cannot finde out the cauſe, it is better in this caſe, to rely upon ſenſe without reaſon, than upon reaſon contradicted by experience. Now if there be ſpecifical remedies for ſome diſeaſes, there are alſo for all; but they are ſo very many, that we cannot know them. And who is that man that can know
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35843:54"/>
the vertues and properties of every thing in the world? The Chymiſts are of this mind, for they hold that all Medicines have their ſignatures, or their peculiar marks and figures, by which they reſemble the parts or diſeaſes of mans body, and that they are writings (as it were) ſealed with the hand of God, to teach men their faculties.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt man ſaid, That the Poets had reaſon to ſay that the Gods had left hope for men in the bottom of <hi>Pandora's</hi> box, after all their other goods were flown away; for nature dealing gently with man, doth ſo order it, that the almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of accidents of his life, (and thoſe for the moſt part trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome ones) cannot on the one hand lay him too low, but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope wil raſe him again as high. For not to ſpeak of Hope, as it is the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35843:56"/>
cheif of Chriſtian vertues, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying a man even in death, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him of the pain of all his evils; Is a man in affliction? He comforts himſelf with hope of coming out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of it; Is he of low birth? He hopes by his brave exploits to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Noble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If poor, to enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if ſick, to heal himſelf: Nay though he want the ordinary means of obtaining theſe ends, yet is he not diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>But that which moſt deſerves to be laught at by thoſe which think it impoſſibly, or to be admired by thoſe who will ſearch deeper into the whimſies and fancies of men, is that an old, weak, ſick, poor man, ſhould nevertheleſs hope to be one day attended like a Prince, and not onely to grow ſound again, but alſo young and handſome. How can all this be? Why, by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone, which is the great work, the All-heal, the <hi>Elixir,</hi> and the univerſal Reſtorative. Now this being far from all likelyhood, and there being divers other abſurdities
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35843:56"/>
in that Chymerical Art, it makes me believe that there is no uſe of it, but to comfort miſerable men with.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſaid, that the Chymiſts, who buſie themſelves about the Philoſophers ſtone, are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>The one ſort, though they promiſe tranſmutation of Mettals by mixing, fixing, cimenting and other opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet do nothing but give Tinctures to the <hi>Mettals</hi> by their Sophiſtications.</p>
                  <p>The other ſort, call themſelves the true Sons of knowledge, and meddle not with particulars, but onely with this great work, at which they all aim, though by ſeverall wayes ſome of theſe, think to get it by blowing, and their way is to put gold and quickſilver together, which they keep for nine moneths long in a furnace, over a lamp. Others think it a very eaſie buſineſs, &amp; call it the work of children, and ſay that to attain it there needs no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but of the matter, the Fire, the Veſſel and the manner, for the reſt comes as it were of it ſelf, after
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35843:57"/>
one hath received it by tradition, which they ſay is the onely means to get it. There are ſome alſo who attribute this work to Revelation, and ſay that we need onely to pray to God for it, and theſe believe that it is conteined in the Scripture where it is ſaid, That there needs a great deal of clay to make Pots with, whereas a little pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will make gold; and that it was this kinde of knowledge which did ſo inrich <hi>Solomon,</hi> that Gold (as is ſaid in the Scripture) was in his reign as common as ſtones, and that the gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> was that which the Philoſophers Stone had changed, and made much more excellent than natural gold; and what is ſaid of the ſhips which he ſent to fetch it, is ſpoken but Parabollically, and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, as was that ſtory of the golden Fleece; for the golden Fleece was nothing but a Parchment wherein this ſecret was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; but the greateſt number of Chymiſts are of an opinion made up of both theſe; for they ſay, that to obtain it, men muſt work,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35843:57"/>
and God muſt help by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grace and favour: I do think with them, that there is a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone, or at leaſt, that it is poſsible to be found out; That the matter of it is ſalt, and that its fire is motion. For ſeeing both theſe are found every where, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty fits them very well. For ſalt may be drawn out of all bodies, &amp; heat likewiſe proceeds from the rubbing of bodies one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in imitation of that heat w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Heavens do cauſe here below.</p>
                  <p>The third ſaid, That the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Stone is a pouder of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which being in a very ſmall quantity thrown upon imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Mettals (as all Mettals except gold are imperfect) doth purifie and heal them of their Leproſie and uncleanneſs, ſo that having purged them of their droſs, and hightned their degrees, they obtain a more perfect Nature: for Mettals differ from one another, onely in degrees of perfection.</p>
                  <p>This pouder is of two ſorts, the white, which ſerves to make ſilver with; and the red, which being
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35843:58"/>
more concocted, is fit to make gold with. To obtain this, a man needs the perfect knowledg but of three things; that is to ſay, of the Agent, the Matter, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion requiſite, to the end that the Agent may draw out the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Form, out of the very boſome of the Matter duly prepared by the application of Active to Paſſives: The two firſt of theſe three are eaſie to know; for the Agent is nothing but heat, whether it be of the Sun beams, or of our common fire, or of the dunghill, which they call the Horſe belly, or of <hi>Maries</hi> bath, or of Animals? The Patients are Salt, Sulphur, Mercury, Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Antimony, Vitriol, or ſome few other ſuch like things, from which what we have to look for, experience will eaſily ſhew. But the application of the Agent to the Patient, the determination of the degrees of heat, the laſt prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpoſition of the Matter, cannot be known but by much pains and long experience, which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35843:58"/>
being very difficult; from thence it comes, that in this Art, we ſee more cheats and impoſtures, than truth; and yet Hiſtories do aſſure us that <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus, Geber, Raymundus Lullius, Arnoldus de Villâ Novâ, Flamellus, Treviſanus,</hi> and ſome others have had the knowledge of it.</p>
                  <p>But whereas this ſmall number of thoſe which they aſſure have had it, an almoſt infinite number of others have undone themſelves by it; the ſearch of it ſeems to be more curious than profitable.</p>
                  <p>The fourth ſaid, That as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, by endeavouring to ſquare the circle, though they have not done it, yet are come to the knowledge of divers things which they knew not before; So the Chymiſts, though they have not light upon the Philoſophers ſtone, yet have diſcovered admirable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets in the three great Families of Animals, Vegetables, and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Now though no body had ever yet had it, yet may it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35843:59"/>
to be found out; not onely for this general reaſon, that nature hath not given us deſire in vain, but particularly becauſe all Mettals are of one kind, being made of one Matter, which is Sulphur and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and are concocted by the ſame heat of the Heavens, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer onely in the coction, as the grapes of one bunch, which ripen at ſeveral times. Which appears to be true, becauſe gold and ſilver may be extracted out of all Mettals, yea, even out of Iron and Lead, which are the moſt imperfect of all. So that Art ought not in this caſe to be counted inferiour to thoſe things which it perfects. And the Greek Etymologie of Mettals doth ſhew that they may be changed from one to another.</p>
                  <p>The fifth ſaid, That as in the production of corn by Nature, the corn and the fat juice of the earth are the Matter, and the Efficient cauſe is partly internal and incloſed in the grain; and partly external, that is, the heat of the Sun; and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35843:59"/>
that the place is the boſome of the Earth. So alſo in the production of gold by Art, the Matter is the gold it ſelf and its quickſilver: the Efficient cauſe is partly in the gold, and partly in the external heat; the place is the furnace which holds the egge of glaſs, wherein is incloſed the Matter, which diſſolves and turns black, (and this they call the crows head) then grows white, and after hardens into a red lump, ſo hard that they call it a Stone, which being beaten to pouder, and kept three dayes together over a ſtrong fire, in a veſſel Hermetically ſealed, turns into a purple colour, and then one dram of it will turn two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred drams of quickſilver into pure gold, and the whole Sea too, if it were of like Matter.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth ſaid, That Art may imitate Nature, but cannot outdo it; As it would be, if men could change other Mettals into gold, that being impoſſible for nature to do, even in the Mines, and in never ſo long time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:35843:60"/>For Mines of Iron, Lead, Tin, or Copper, never become Mines of Gold or Silver; therefore muchleſs can the Alchymiſt do it in his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, &amp; no more than he can produce ſomething more excellent than gold, as this Philoſophers ſtone would be: for gold is the moſt perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of all mixt bodies, and is therefore incorruptible; muchleſs can the Alchymiſt bring to paſs a thing, concerning the immediate Matter of which, its Efficient cauſe, its Place, Time, and Manner of working, men are not agreed; there being as many ſeveral opinions about it, as there are Authors, who are in great number.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, it is a miſtake to ſay, that Mettals are all of one kind, and that they differ but in coction, for we ſee that Iron is more concocted than Silver, it being harder, and not ſo eaſie to melt, and becauſe their differing is needful for mans uſe. Now thoſe perfect <hi>ſpecies</hi> which are neer of the ſame kind as Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are, do never change into one
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35843:60"/>
another, no more than an horſe changes into a Lion. Nay, if there were ſuch a Philoſophers ſtone could work upon Mettals, yet would it not make gold or ſilver, but other ſtones like it ſelf, or elſe would onely imprint its qualities in them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinary effects of all natural Agents. And if it were true that this pouder of Gold, being thrown upon other mettals, could produce more Gold, as one grain of corn, being ſown in the ground, doth produce many other grains; yet ought the ſame order and progreſs to be obſerved in the multiplication of gold, that is in the production of corn: but this the Chymiſts do not, for they will have their multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be done in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh ſaid, That ſeeing Art doth draw ſo many natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects out of one fit matter, as out of little worms may be had Serpents, Frogs, Toads, Bees, and Mice, and conſidering that the ſubject of theſe Metamorphoſies, is a great deal har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to receive life than mettals
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35843:61"/>
(which are inſenſible) to receive a Form as well diviſible as its matter; He did not ſee, but that (at leaſt, by the extraordinary help of good or evil Angels) men might come to have ſome knowledge of it. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we ſee that ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> do naturally change the one into the other, as <hi>Egpytian Nitre</hi> turns into ſtone; Jaſper into Emerald, the herb Bazil into wilde Tyme, Wheat into Cockle, and Caterpillers into Butterflies.</p>
                  <p>And if we will believe the Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they have a Tree, whoſe fruit falling into the water, turns into a bird.</p>

Auxiliary motives to obtain the grant of ſo juſt a favour; yet a deſire to let you ſee that Piety and Reaſon are no leſs your Petitioners in this particular, then <hi>Philaretus</hi> will I hope excuſe my zeal, if to juſtifie your good nature as well as my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, I take leave to repreſent to your conſideration, the immenſity of that goodneſs, that excludeth not its very enemies from its gratious effects, and there heapeth benefits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not onely where they were never deſerved, but where they never can be returned: this is a noble preſident and fit for your raiſed ſpirit; whoſe imitation cannot poſſibly miſlead you: ſince both Gods, Wiſdome and his happineſs, being no leſs infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite than his goodneſs, places it above controverſie, that a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in the one, is not at all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the poſseſſion of an equall degree of the others. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour aſſureth us, that it is more bleſsed to give than to receive, and in effect, we ſee that God that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth a felicity as Supream as any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35843:63"/>
of his Attributes, maketh it his continual employment to oblige, and that there where he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Retribution. And therefore the more diffuſed, and the leſs ſelfiſh and mercinary our good actions are, the more we elevate our ſelves above our own, and the neerer we make our approximations to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Divine nature. But to deſcend from theſe abſtracted thoughts into leſs Platonick conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, we are all acquainted with the ſtrong obligation, that not charity onely, but bare humanity layeth upon us to relieve the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe, that derive their pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from the ſame father we are deſcended from, and are equal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with us, of the Image of that God, whoſe ſtamp we glory in. And can we fancy that all the duties of charity are fulfilled with the empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the refuſe of our ſervants tables into the poor mans basket, and flinging a piece of market money to a ſhivering Beggar? (though we deny not thoſe acts their juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation)
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35843:64"/>
no, as our neighbour, ſo far forth as he is afflicted, is the object of our charity; ſo all that we are to do, either to remove or ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that miſery, is to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within the Acts of our chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which doth therefore not confine us to any particular kinde of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to our neighbour, that we may know it to be our duty to aſſiſt him in all kinds. Therefore doth the Scripture reckon the viſiting of the afflicted and the priſoners, and the comforting of the ſick amongſt the prime and moſt eminent producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that vertue; and therefore our Saviour himſelf (the exacteſt Preſident ſure, of what his whole life was a continued practice of) did far ſeldomer employ his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence to feed the hungry, then he wrought miracles to heal the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Certainly the almes of curing is a piece of charity, much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſie than that other of relieving; ſince onely beggars are neceſſitous of the laſt: but Princes themſelves do often need the former. Why
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35843:64"/>
ſhould we think it a greater charity (or more our duty) to give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed wretch ſhelter from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cold of the air, than to protect him from the aguiſh ioyneſs of the blood? or to ſhade him from the outward ſalutes of the hot Sun, then free him from the inward dog-dayes of a burning Feaver? Sure this is not a charity much inferiour to the preſerving of mens lives, to reſtore them that good, without which, life it ſelf is but a miſery. How greatly, and how juſtly do we deteſt thoſe Uſurers, that hoard up all their bags from all thoſe uſes, that onely can give riches the Title of a good? And yet the avarice of profitable ſecrets, is by ſo much worſe than that of money, by how much the buried Treaſure is more excellent.

whereas receipts, like Torches, that in the lighting of others, do not waſt themſelves, may be imparted without the leaſt diminution. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if (as a wiſe man allegorically ſaid) he is as much guilty of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of a lamp, that denieth it neceſſary oyle, as he that actually blowe hit out: they will not have a little to anſwer for, that by a cruel refuſal of Soverain receipts, permit the torments, and the death of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; they might (without their own leaſt prejudice) have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that had rather manifeſt a bad nature, than reveal a good ſecret, and hazard the loſe of an eternal life to themſelves, rather than either prolong or ſweeten a temporal life unto others. Laſtly, had all men been of this Retentive humor, how many excellent receipts muſt they themſelves have wanted, for which they muſt acknowledge themſelves beholding unto others? Had all men been ſo covetous of, and in that particular, their poſseſſions would be, perhaps as narrow as their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35843:65"/>
that coſtive humor, being not more fit to bury than unapt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. So that a kind of intereſt and juſtice as well as charity, ſeemeth to oblige us to make thoſe goods communicable, that became ours but upon that ſcore. Let us not then be leſs civil to our Poſterity, than our Predeceſsors have been to us; but conveying to our Succeeders at leaſt thoſe benefits we derive from our Anceſtors; let us not refuſe our imitation to what we think worthy of our applauſe.</p>
                  <p>And now Sir, having thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented you with ſuch thoughts of mine upon this Subject, as its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did readly ſuggeſt, I ſhall take the liberty ſuccinctly to diſcuſs their evaſions, that are of a contrary ſenſe. And in the firſt place, I find ſome Phyſitians objecting, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid outmuch of their mony, and more of their time, in the ſearch of ſuch and ſuch a ſecret, that diſcovery is now become either their Fortune, or their Subſiſtence, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the divulging it to others,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35843:66"/>
would prove deſtructive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In this caſe I muſt ingeniouſly confeſs that all I can require is, that they deny not thoſe that want it the benefit of the Compoſition, whilſt that bewrays not the receipt, and refuſe not to impart the Secret it ſelf to thoſe that need it, upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms: for they that will not aſſent to this, muſt flie for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſome other excuſe. In the next place it is objected by divers, that their receipts are of more curioſity, or at leaſt have no relation to the cure of our Diſeaſes. In which caſe, though I will not preciſely exact their publication, yet let thoſe whoſe ſecrets may any other way advantage the publick; (ſince 'tis not the kinde ſo much as the utility of our knowledge, that obliges us to dedicate it to the publick ſervice) Remember his fault that folded up his Talent in a Napkin; and fear to feel his doom, whoſe fault they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Another thing muſt require both of theſe and of the Antecedent ſecretiſts, is, that they take a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35843:66"/>
care to have their receipts ſurvive their perſons, conſigning them into the hands of ſome confident or other, that they may not follow their owners to the grave (where next a bad conſcience the worſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion is a good ſecret) and give men occaſion to reſemble them to Toads; who if we may credit the vulgars uncontrouled report, when they feel themſelves upon the point of dying, deſtroy that Antidotal ſtone in their heads, which is all that is worth any thing in them; left men ſhould have cauſe to vaunt themſelves of being the better for them; ſuch people are in this worſe than very Uſurers and Hogs themſelves; that theſe do ſome kinde of good after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, but they take a great deal of pains to be as little guilty of that humanity after they have left the world, as they were whilſt they lived in it. Others there are, that to excuſe themſelves, will tell us, that they received their receipts but upon condition, and that ratified, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with an oath, never to diſcloſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35843:67"/>
them; or (to give it you in a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis) that never any body ſhould be the better for them. To which all that I can juſtly anſwer is, that if this promiſe have indeed been ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly made, it is a greater fault to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, than it was to make it. Though I am apt to believe that if all men declined the taking of receipts upon theſe terms, they might have them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better. But by the way I muſt take leave to wonder at their niggard hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that will thus ſtint their own charity, and in the preſenting us a good, clog it with a reſtraint, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to its Nature, that ſtrips it of one of its Nobleſt Prerogatives, which is to be diffuſive of it ſelf. Some I have known, and thoſe too conſcientious, that alleadge, that the eaſie divulging of receipts, makes our Phyſitians leſs careful to beat about for remedies themſelves when they find them already pared to their hands. To which I ſhall reply, That granting that to be true, which is not undiſputable, it is far better to pleaſure ſome few
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35843:67"/>
drones, than venture the periſhing of whole ſwarms of Bees. Shall we not eaſe the pains of Legions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Chriſtians, for fear of ſparing the pains of a few undiligent Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians? We know how contrary this practice is to his, that would have ſpared <hi>Sodom</hi> it ſelf for the ſake but of ten good men. Beſides that, if our Phyſitians be lazy, ſo much the greater is our neceſſity of uſing other means to recompence that want. Of the like nature with this is their excuſe, or patience rather, that pretend a fear, that if their compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould come to be divulged, they would preſently be ſophiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diſguiſed: whereas them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beſtow the mixtures in their native purity. But thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the doing of a certain good upon the ſore, and perhaps cauſleſs ſuſpition of a contingent harm; grounding their own want of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charity, upon an uncharitable and unlikely apprehenſion of anothers. As if the firſt inventor of navigation ſhould have conceal'd from us that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35843:68"/>
admirable and beneficial Art, for fear Pyrates ſhould likewiſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to abuſe it. Had thoſe Ancient Phyſitians that cure yet in their Coffins, and preſerve the Lives of others after the loſs of their own) been frighted with theſe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs jealouſies, the Church-yards had been frettily throng'd ere this, and the dul Sextons ſpade al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways might be as buſie as the Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Beſides, that 'tis very unlikely, there ſhould be then more falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts believed, when there are more true ones extant to confute them. If men will counterfeit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, they may eaſily ſuppoſe ſpurious compoſitions in ſpight of the concealment of the true one: but ſure the eaſieſt way to prevent that kinde of coſenage, is to be ſo liberall of the Legitimate receipts, as to make men not to need it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there are, that promiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a publication of their ſecrets, but reſolve to ſuſpend it till they die.</p>
                  <p>But to omit how much the review
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35843:68"/>
and ordering of theſe ſecrets, or their neglect will either diſtract or trouble us upon our death-bed, and not to mention how unfit it is, to ſow in harveſt what ſhould then be ready to be reaped; and for a vain oſtententation to delay both the good they might have done all their life time, and loſe all the praiſes it would juſtly have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; To skip all this, I ſay, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have we noted, whom either an unripe Fate would not give reſpite to effectuate thoſe Intentions, or the falſ uſurpations of their Friends or Executors, hath cheated of that glory themſelves might juſtly have expected. Sure theſe Poſthumous Treatiſes on Theames, that have ſo great a tendency to the publick good, that are rather the Authors deſſein than his misfortune, are not uſually more void of charity than Judgement: Since they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the writer both of the praiſe of his labours, and of the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reform his errors. Others there are, that ſeek an Apology
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35843:69"/>
in telling us that if 'twere any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of ordinary value, they would not ſcruple at its communication, but being a rare and a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſecret, you muſt pardon them forſooth if they think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy its poſſeſſion. Which is in my opinion the very ſame reaſon, that moſt ſhould prevail with them to diſcloſe it: for the more ſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the remedy is, and the greater the benefit is, its knowledge may afford, the greater obligation ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the owner to impart it, ſince our ſervices will be expected proportionable to our abilities. For the nature of good is to grow greater by extenſion, but careful providence foreſeeing how incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable frail men would be to ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the diſpenſation of ſuch goods as theſe, hath moſt wiſely provided, that the parting with theſe goods ſhould not prejudice their poſſeſſion, nor liberality im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh him that uſes it. Whom the Nature of the riches he diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, reſembles to the Sun, who
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35843:69"/>
though ſo bountifully he beſtoweth his Beams on the whole univerſe never findeth a ſcarcity of them in himſelf: but the much greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our ſecretiſts doth conſiſt of thoſe, who are aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, ſmother their ſecrets, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they may be ſtill talked of for the ſole proprietaries of thoſe rarities. But to let thouſands pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, leſt another ſhould have the honour of their cure, to endeavour rather that our receipts ſhould be known by few, then that they ſhould cure many, and to prefer the vanity of poſſeſſing a Rare ſecret, to the ſatisfaction of having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed a ſucceſsful one, are excuſes that will hardly paſs for currant at that great day, when many ſhall be excluded heaven for ſuffering others to be ſnatcht up thither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their natural time, and when all men ſhall be crowned not for the excellency of what they have done. But becauſe ſuch a kind of people, uſe to be very little toucht with conſiderations of this nature,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35843:70"/>
I ſhall onely intreat them a little to conſider whether it be not a greater glory to oblige (and have many wear ones Livery) than to gain the reputation of having buried hoards, by keeping ones ſecrets more cloſe than Ingeneers do Mines, which the leaſt vent defeats. Experience it ſelf can teach us, that our Phyſitians have got more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by thoſe few ſecrets that have died with them: as indeed it is not over probable, that cloſneſs ſhould have like advantages with Liberality, in the acquiſition of eſteem and of applauſe. Laſtly, ſome of our Chymiſts do object, that had they in their power that great Elixer it ſelf, they call the univerſal Antagoniſt of all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they ſhould think it as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to diſcloſe as happy to poſſeſs it; partly becauſe ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſcoveries being rather inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than acquired, ought not to be profaned by being divulged, and partly too, becauſe that in theſe diſſolute times it would be a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35843:70"/>
tempting invitation to all kinde of Ryot and Intemperance, by ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us from the danger of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that attend them. It is ſtrange me thinks, that conſcience ſhould be fallen out with charity! But the objection it ſelf furniſheth us with an anſwer to it; for if, ſince the negative is very probable, the Elixir be a ſecret, that we owe wholly to our Makers Revelation, not our own induſtry, me thinks we ſhould not ſo much grudge to impart what we did not labour to acquire, ſince our Saviours preſcription in the like caſe was this: <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> Should God to one of our Divines reveal ſome newer Truths and Secrets of his Goſpel, would we not condemn him for the concealment of what was imparted but to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated? Thoſe ſecrets that were intended for our uſe, are not at all profaned by being made to reach their end: but by being fettered from the diffuſiveneſs of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And therefore though God
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:35843:71"/>
ſhould addreſs thoſe ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours but to ſome ſingle perſon; yet he intendeth them for the good of all Mankind, and to make that Almoner to whom he truſteth them, not the grace but the ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his graces.</p>
                  <p>As for the other edge of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſhall we that think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to do evil that good may come of it; think it juſt to forbear duties left evil might enſue? And ſhall we let good men languiſh and periſh for want of opportune relief leſt others ſhould be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to expect it? Beſides, that the ſame Reaſon that is here alleadged, would juſtifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of all other ſecrets; ſince neither is there any of them that is not abuſable, nor would our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants venture upon exceſſes as they do, did they not confide in the vertue of thoſe receipts we have already. To omit that to imagine to reſtrain vices by refuſing men the remedies of thoſe exceſſes they ſeduce them to; is a deſſein as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35843:71"/>
as the means are uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Since our inclinations alone being ſufficient to vice, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting onely of the outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, whileſt the deſires are unreformed, doth make abſtain not from the ſin, but onely from the act. Sure many of theſe envious Salamanders, will one day finde their knowledge to be both their miſery and their crime; when thoſe rich ſecrets that were beſtowed as jewels for their charity, ſhall ſerve but to aggravate their guilt. Then they will be forced to endure far greater torments than thoſe that they declined to cure, and with as little pitty as they here expreſſed, it being as fooliſh as unjuſt for them to expect that mercy that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to give. But by this time Sir I fear that I have made you as much need a receipt againſt impatience, as my friend doth one againſt the Gout; and therefore I will here conclude both your trouble, and this letter which beſeeching you to do me the right to believe, that

And having weighed the matter, I found, that in general reſpecting the whole pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chyrurgery, as well in new as old hurts, it would be an hard matter at preſent to propound ſuch a way; but in particular, in reference to freſh hurts received in war, either in Water or Land ſervice, as by ſhooting of Guns, cutting off any part or member, ſtabbing, gaſhing, beating or bruiſing, or what ever other freſh hurt, there may ſuch a Chyrurgery be avouched to heal them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To which end I have a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which (by Gods help) will not fail, which I have for mine own part practiced, for above 25 years, finding by experience, that there is none like to it.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35843:77"/>
die with ſuch a ſecret unrevealed: I conceive (under correction, and without offence to any man be it ſpoken) that all Governours and Magiſtrates ought to recommend the ſame in charity, to all their reſpective Hoſpitals, and to make ſuch maimed perſons as lie in their houſes of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity partakers hereof. And beſides the charitableneſs of ſuch a practice, it would prove likewiſe very benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and profitable unto themſelves, when the maimed perſons ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the ſooner from the Hoſpitals, and the cries of the diſtreſſed ſhall not ſo long vex their ears, by reaſon that many violent and offenſive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of Chyrurgery, in ſuch caſes uſual, ſhall by this Method be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>Think but what a pleaſant and comfortable thing it would be for a compaſſionate Chyrurgeon both at Sea and Land, ſo lightly, and with ſo ſmall charge to dreſs and binde up a Patient, after the way that I ſhall ſhew anon. Conſider what a work it is for a young Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35843:78"/>
that would travel, to carry ſo many Inſtruments with him, ſuch an innumerable company of Irons, ſo many Salves, and Ointments, and Oyles, as would lade an Aſs. So that it is work enough for a beginner in Chyrurgery, to know the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Inſtruments which he is to uſe, too much labour to carry them, and contrary to the gentleneſs of his diſpoſition to uſe them, to the grief of the Patients, by raking in their wounds, and cutting their fleſh, &amp;c. O Cruel way of Healing, many times unneceſſarily uſed, and which oftentimes troubles the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Operator, eſpecially being once convinced how unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that ordinary way of practice is. I know very well that Ignorance of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends not, that men knowing no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt do as well as they can, and that they muſt not throw away the foul water before they have clean. And therefore will I by Gods help, diſcover a better, more convenient and eaſier way of practice, onely beſeeching the Readers that they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35843:78"/>
will not through any miſaffection, or other conceit, caſt the ſame behinde their backs, nor ſay what news have we here with this outlandiſh ſojou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? We have lived ſo long, and our fathers before us, and have uſed this Method of Chyrurgery, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no better, we reſt upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of our Art. Nay, but we ought to know, that in all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or under the name of oldneſs, there hath ſtill new matters been ſet on foot: and in all ages there have been, are and will be rare men, who bring things to light which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and called new things, whereas ſuch things are often older than thoſe which are accounted of greater age. And every underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding man in his own faculty daily ſees, that there is (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid) nothing new under the Sun: it hath been but for a while out of the knowledge and memory of men, and then returns into their knowledge, and therefore by ſuch as did not know it before, it is called a Novelty. So is this that I propound, a thing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:35843:79"/>
that hath been long in the world, that is of age and Antiquity, onely it hath been parceld out, one man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one part, another a ſecond, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other a third, &amp;c. and my work it hath been with great diligence, pains and coſt to collect all into a Sum, yea, and by long practice I am ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, that I am able ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to imform thouſands of men to practice the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now I deſire the Reader not to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand me, but to remember that this Method pertains onely to freſh hurts, and that it is invented to ſpare (for the moſt part or very neer) for the future, all uſe of tents, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives, ſawes, tongs, probes, ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, nailes, yea, and the greateſt part of oyles, ſalves, unguents, and other uſual implements: foraſmuch as in our Method, we very ſeldome or never make uſe of them. It may happen in ſome rare accident, that we may put a tent into ſome wound that goes juſt through the skin and no more, to keep the skin from clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (though I ſeldome find occaſion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:35843:79"/>
ſo to do) and it may fall out in a great exulceration where the matter lies viſible and at hand, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is impatient and unruly— that we cut the skin juſt thorough, and ſo with hurting and forcing the Patient, we let the matter purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Howbeit this falls not often out, foraſmuch as I hold it together with defenſatives, and put it into good digeſtion by my Balſoms, ſo that it ſeeks and makes its own way into the light, breaking of it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo it becomes quieter and better diſpoſed to the cure, foraſmuch as all manual inciſions, either cloſe up of themſelves, or at leaſt are very apt to cloſe up, which is the cauſe that men are forced to uſe a tent; which an hurt, breaking of it own accord hath no need of, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly keeps open of it ſelf to the very laſt, and then ſhuts it ſelf up, as I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by many years experience have found. And I do aſſure the honeſt truth-loving Chyrurgion, that I ſpeak nothing at randome or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, but that I propound (with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:35843:80"/>
Gods bleſſing) a ſure, ſweet, ſoft way, which will ſtand him in ſtead at his greateſt neceſſity. And though I propound this method, as proper for freſh hurts, yet may the skilful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt do incredible wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders hereby, in other cures that occur to the diligen<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Know then, that this Chyrugery which I propound and offer unto you, conſiſts onely in three Balſoms, and two Plaſters. But although a good Chyrurgion may ſatisfie all intentions herewith, yet I have thought good to augment the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to five Balſoms; all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experimented by the skilfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, he may make uſe of that which ſhall ſerve his intent the beſt; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing one Chyrurgion hath a better hand in curing than another, and there is great difference in the fleſh of ſeveral men, in the point of aptneſs to be healed. Neither is it my meaning, that men ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently caſt away, and throw aſide what ever belongs to the preſent
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35843:80"/>
practice of Chyrurgery, and uſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this way of mine, by no means; but my advice is, that the Cyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would have in his ſhop, or in his Cheſt, ſome of my Medicaments, that ſo upon occaſion having made proof of mine and his own, he may give the commendation to thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments that beſt deſerve it.

If it be a deep ſhot or a ſtab, ſquirt it in very warm with a ſeringe, whether it go through the wound or not; for if the wound go through the member or part hurt, the Balſom will flie through, if it go not through, the Balſom will recoile back. If it be a flat, bruiſed, or bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered hurt, anoint it with a feather dipped in this Balſom, ſo that it come to the ground or bottom of the wound, and then lay on the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters according to the ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Art, ſo as to cover the whole maimed place. And this muſt be done once a day, unleſs ſome great quantity of matter do work out, for then it may be opened in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to air it and diſcharge it from the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:35843:81"/>
matter; and lay the Plaſters on again, without uſing any more of the Balſom.</p>
                        <p>With this Balſom are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all wounds healed ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from the bottom; and take notice that in ſuch hurts as you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this Balſom to, you need not to try or ſearch with tent or probe how deep the wound is, the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom will do that for you, ſearching through and through better than you can do by any means whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; neither need you to put any tent in to keep it open, for the Balſom will not ſuffer it to cloſe, till the ground or bottom of the wound or hurt have ſufficiently purged it ſelf. I ſpeak not of clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the wound every time it is dreſt with warm Brandewine, ſalt water, or other wine; ſeeing the skilfull Chyrurgion knows that the wound muſt alwayes be clenſed, before the Balſom be applied. This method you muſt obſerve in all wounds and hurts, from the top of the head to the ſoles of the feet. So
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35843:82"/>
muſt you dreſs the ſhins— like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, onely be ſure to ſet the ſhins —even and juſt together, and dry them and lay the Plaſters upon them, and this muſt be done when the hurt is not deep, but ſhallow, lay an whole plaſter of <hi>Op<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

I order the Shins to be thinly anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe if they be clean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proud fleſh, they need little healing; and after they have been anointed, they muſt be dried, and the plaſter laid over them.</p>
                        <p>The uſe of this Balſom is very Soveraign, for where it is uſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the foreſaid direction, men have hardly ever any ſympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical fevers to ſpeak of, nor any inflamation or mortification; for this Balſome peirceth forthwith to the Centre or bottom of Nature, and ſupplies the neceſſities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by making fleſh to come where it is wanting, how deep ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:35843:82"/>
the wound is; and by eating out the proud fleſh, or what ever grows up beſides the intent of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And it makes the wound to yield a well digeſted matter; if a wound want digeſtion, it brings it to digeſt, and into a poſture of healing; if the wound be inflamed, it brings it to temper and cooling; if it be cold and crude, it brings the ſame again to a natural warmth; if there be a ſwelling, it brings it down, and takes it quite away, a man needs but with his warm finger anoint the wound lightly round about, and it allays the ſwelling, which is very good for a Cyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to prevent the Gangraena, and all accidents. And this is but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens play, which may be done ſporting, by him that underſtands but to handle a wound, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to binde and ſwathe the ſame.</p>

                        <p>This Balſom marked Num. 2. does work as the former in ſome
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:35843:83"/>
reſpects, howbeit it is a degree hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which in ſome mens fleſh is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and a Chyrurgion muſt make uſe of his experience. All good effects and no other are to be expected from this Balſom, and this is added to the former by way of ſuperogation, and not for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, onely where there is need of matter thicker than ordinary, we commend this Balſom to the skilful Chyrugion to that intent.</p>
                        <p>As for the former Balſom, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Num. 1. It is ſo tempered, that there is in it no exceſſes of the four qualities, Heat, Cold, Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, Dryneſs; ſo that by its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vertue, it fully ſatisfies all the wants of nature, removes all that burthens her. So that it were a ſad thing and inconſiſtent with a good conſcience for me to neglect the preſentation of this Balſom, and more ſad if thoſe that need the ſame ſhall not be made partakers of the benefit thereof. And therefore I recommend the ſame to all ſuch as love God, and are of ability to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35843:83"/>
help thoſe that ſtand in need. This ſmall proviſion of one balſom, is more worth than all that the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions ordinarily make uſe of, not to ſpeak of the reſt adjoined thereunto, as I am able to make it in reality to appear.</p>
                        <p>A young novice in Chyrurgery may paſs through all Spittles and Hoſpitals, and to the aſtoniſhment of by-ſtanders, do wonderful and incredible cures.

                        <p>The Balſom marked with Num. 3. is called <hi>Balſamum naturale per ſe,</hi> or natural Balſom of it ſelf, becauſe it is ſo kindly diſpoſed, and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical to the nature of mans fleſh, which may be ſeen when any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:35843:84"/>
is out of joint, or ſprained, or bruiſed, &amp;c. for then ſome of this Balſom being put into a ſpoon (as was ſaid of the former) put your warm finger into it, and anoint the member all about the joint, or bruiſe, and then dry it in with your warm finger or hand, and wipe off all foulneſs very well, with a warm cloth, and lay on your defenſative plaiſters, or pulteſies, in caſe you want good defenſatives. And this will take away the ſwelling, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much; and if you would uſe this Balſom in caſe of an Ulcer, it will cauſe it to ripen and make the matter break out, and bring it to a good end, obſerving the directions given for the firſt. It does wonders in healing many outward wounds, as the former, and I have known in great Camps, ſuch as uſed this and no other, and did wonders therewith. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe it is ſo like the nature of man, which is the reaſon that I call it the natural Balſom. And ten or twenty drops thereof, daily drunk
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:35843:84"/>
down with wine or Beer, ſtrengthens the maimed perſon, and ſerves him for a wound-drink, ſo that, uſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inwardly or outwardly, it hath more vertues than I dare mention. The truth is, it is of a far differing quality from the firſt Balſom, which I have termed <hi>Balſamum univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> But this likewiſe will act its part, as the ſincere experimenter ſhall find: wherefore I thought good to aſſign it a place in this my ſmall Cyrurgery; that beſides open wounds, men might alſo have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for bruiſed, ſtrained and diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, or disjointed members upon all occaſions.</p>

The member becomes ſuddenly refreſht, the Patient ſtrengthned, the pain allaid; the matter digeſted, thicker, and whiter; the wateriſh moiſture leaves running, and the Patient is prevented from having a ſtiff limb or member as aforeſaid, in which caſe it is requiſite, the Chyrurgion have a good hand to bind the Patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts hurt, as the condition thereof ſhall require.

                  <head>The Appendix, Containing Mr. <hi>Gerard Malynes</hi> Philoſophy, about the Eſſence or Exiſtence of Metals.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Delivered accidentally in one Chapter of his Book, called, <hi>Lex Mercatorium,</hi> or, <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law-Merchant.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll Philoſophers, by the light of Nature and long obſervation have determined, that the ſperme or feed of all things created of the four elements, doth in a ſecret manner lowre within the two elements of water and earth; and that Nature doth continually work to produce perfect things, but is hindered therein by accidental cauſes, which are the begetters of
<pb facs="tcp:35843:88"/>
corruption and imperfection of all things, whereby we have variety of things which are delectable to the ſpirit of man. Herein they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the operation of the Sun and Moon, and the other Planets and Starres, in the generation of all things which either have a being or exiſtence, as the Elements have; or a being and life, as vegitable Trees or Plants; or a being, life and ſence, as Beaſts, Birds, and other living Creatures; or a being, life, ſence and reaſon, as Man hath, and all reaſonable Creatures; which knowledge and wiſdom, no doubt, the holy Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> did learn amongſt the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> But had theſe Philoſophers read the Book of <hi>Moſes, (Acts</hi> 17.22. <hi>Geneſis</hi>) of Creation and Generation. They would not have aſcribed the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and conducting of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things to the two Leaders, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Stars and Nature. Hence it proceedeth, that amongſt vegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things (which have a Being and life) they reckon all Metals,
<pb facs="tcp:35843:88"/>
which have their beginning from Sulpher and Mercury, <hi>tanquam ex patre &amp; matre</hi>; which meeting and concurring together in the veines of the earth, do ingender through the heat and quality of the Climate, by an aſſidual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, according to the nature of the earth wherein they meet, which being either good and pure, or ſtinking and corrupt, produceth the diverſity of the Mettals of gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Lead, and Iron, in their ſeveral natures: and hereupon they have aſſigned them under their diſtinct Planets, to be benevolent, or malevolent; as Lead under <hi>Saturn,</hi> Tin under <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Iron under <hi>Mars,</hi> Gold under <hi>Sol,</hi> Copper under <hi>Venus,</hi> Quick-ſilver under <hi>Mercury,</hi> and Silver under <hi>Luna.</hi> So Mercury or Quick-ſilver is one of the ſeven Metals, which being volatile, and by his volubility running with every one, is in nature as they are, either good or evill: and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have placed Tin under
<pb facs="tcp:35843:89"/>
the benevolent Planet <hi>Jupiter,</hi> experience hath proved unto us, that Tin is the poyſon of all Metals. Sulphur is excluded, which they ſay is of two colours, being white and corrupt in the Silver, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore falleth away, but red and pure in the Gold, and therefore perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diverſities of metals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to paſſe by accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is the cauſe that Art (being Natures Ape by imitation) hath endeavoured to perform that wherein Nature was hindered: whereupon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius eſt diſtruere Accidentale, quam Eſſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But this cannot be done without projection of the Elixar or Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence upon Metals. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the ſtudy of all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers to make their miraculous ſtone, which I confeſs is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and full of expectation, when a man ſeeth the true and perfect
<pb facs="tcp:35843:89"/>
tranſmutation of Metals, Lead and Iron into Copper, the Ore of Lead into Quick-ſilver or Mercury, with a ſmall charge to a very great profit, as it hath been made for me, untill the maker of it died, within three months after he had made almoſt four thouſand pound weight, as good as any natural Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury could be, and that in ſix weeks time.</p>
                  <p>To return to our Philoſophers, concerning the eſſence of metals, they have been tranſcended in the knowledge thereof, for they ſhew the generation of Sulphur and Mercury in this manner.</p>
                  <p>The exhalations of the earth being cold and dry, and the vapours of the ſeas being cold and moiſt, according to their natures aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meeting in a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and equality, and falling upon ſome hilly or mountainous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where the influence of Sun and Moon have continual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are the cauſe of generation; or properly from it is Sulphur
<pb facs="tcp:35843:90"/>
ingendered, penetrating into the earth where there are veines of water, and there they congeal into Gold or Silver, or into the Ores of Silver, Copper, and all other metals, participating or holding alwayes ſome little mixture of the beſt, or being in nature better or worſe, according to the ſaid acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental cauſes. So that they do attribute the generation to the operation of the influences of the Sun and Moon; where the Book of God ſheweth us the creation of all things in heaven and earth, and the furniture thereof. The earth (being the dry part of the globe of the world) did appear and was made the third day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it the Ores of all Metals and Minerals; whereas the Sun and Moon were created afterward on the fourth day, whoſe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was incident to the things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not before. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (ſay they) are Diamonds, Rubies, and other pretious ſtones ingendred, according to the purity
<pb facs="tcp:35843:90"/>
of the matter, and the proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable participation of every ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein: if the exhalations (being ſubtill) do ſuperabound and prevail over the vapours, then hereof is Sulphur ingendered: and if this ſubtil exhalation be mixed with the moiſt vapours, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth decoction, as being in a very cold place, it becomes Mercury or Quick-ſilver, which can endure no heat or fire at all.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Metal mentioned in the holy Scripture is Gold, which was found in the river <hi>Piſon,</hi> running through the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> into the Countrey of <hi>Havilah,</hi> where Gold doth grow, and this was in the Eaſt. According to which obſervation, all the veins of Mines run from Eaſt towards Weſt, with the courſe of the Sun, as ſhall be more declared.</p>
                  <p>To this argument appertaineth the Philoſophical ſtudy of <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> to be found out by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience for the great work of <hi>La pis Philoſophorum,</hi> by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:35843:91"/>
of the Sun in ſeven yeares. The practiſe whereof was made about forty yeares ſince, by a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Doctor of Phyſick, at <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> in the Eaſt Countries (as I have been informed by a friend of mine who was alſo a Phyſitian) and was done in this manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bigneſs of the body of the Sun, being 166 times bigger than the whole Globe of the earth and water, making the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the world. Whereupon he took 166 vials or glaſſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he did put of all the Ores of Metals and Minerals, and other things which had any affinity with Minerals, and ſome of them mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and calcined all of them, and cloſing or nipping up all the glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by fire, he did expoſe them to the Sun in an eminent place, for and during the ſaid time of ſeven yeares, and found thereby (as it was reported) <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> which was reduced to ſeven glaſſes; howſoever, it was certain that he grew very rich, &amp; bought above an
<pb facs="tcp:35843:91"/>
hundred houſes in the that City befor he died. Which was an occaſion- that my friend (imitating him) did likewiſe place not far from <hi>London</hi> ſeven glaſſes, with calcined Metals and Minerals, upon a houſe top, againſt the back of a chimney, where the repercuſſion of the Sun did work upon them, which was admirable to behold from ſix moneth to ſix moneths, not onely by the ſublimation of colours, very variable and Celeſtial, but alſo of the rare alteration of the ſtuffe, being ſometimes liquid, another time dry, or part of it moiſt, aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſcending very ſtrange to behold, as my ſelf have ſeen divers times from year to year. Some had been there two, three, four, five, and one almoſt ſeven yeares, the colour whereof had been yellow, then white in the ſuperficies, then as black as pitch, afterwards dark red, with ſtars of gold in the upper part of the glaſs, and at laſt of the colour of Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Lemons, and the ſubſtance
<pb facs="tcp:35843:92"/>
almoſt dry. Many were the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions between him and me, but he was confident, that there was the Eli<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>r, howbeit very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he ſhould never enjoy the ſame; and it came ſo to paſſe, for after a long ſickneſs he died of a burning Ague, and a Gentleman gave a ſum of mony to his wife for that glaſſe, whereof I have not heard any thing theſe ſeven yeares. In this glaſs he would ſhew me the working of this Quinteſſence, according to the deſcription of <hi>Ripley,</hi> who he was aſſured had the <hi>Lapis,</hi> and ſo had Frier <hi>Bacon,</hi> and <hi>Norton</hi> of <hi>Briſtol: Kelley</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had by his ſaying ſome little part to make projection, but it was not of his own making. The charge to make it was little or nothing to ſpeak of, and might be done in ſeven moneths, if a man did begin it on the right day. The twelve opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Ripley,</hi> he declared unto me were but ſix, and then it reſteth; for, ſaith he, all Philoſophers have darkened the ſtudy of this bleſſed
<pb facs="tcp:35843:92"/>
Work, which God hath revealed to a few humble and charitable men. Calcination, Diſſolution, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration are but one, and ſo is Conjuction and Putrifaction; likewiſe Cibation and Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then followeth Congelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and at laſt Multiplication and Projection, which are alſo but one. For mine own part, ſeeing that no man can be perfect in any one Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I hold it not amiſs for a man to have knowledge in moſt or in all things: for by this ſtudy of Alcumy, men may attain to many good Experiments of diſtillations Chymical, Fire-works, and other excellent obſervations in Nature; which being far from Merchants profeſſion, I hope ſhall not give offence to the Reader of this book, ſeeing it is but in one chapter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally handled Neither will I crave pardon of the Muſes, as it were, inſinuating to the world to have a far greater knowledge in theſe trials or concluſions. But to ſatisfie the curioſity of ſome, that
<pb facs="tcp:35843:93"/>
it maybe with a gaping mouth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to underſtand ſomewhat of the Stuffe put into theſe glaſſes; I may ſay as I was informed, That in ſome was the calcined Ore of Silver and Gold, in ſome other Mercury calcined, and Sulphur in ſome other; Arſenick for the air, Sulphur for the fire, Mercury for the water, and Sea-cole for the earth, were put all together as the four elements. In ſome other Glaſs was Vitriol and Orpiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what more I do not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; concluding, That where Nature giveth ability, Art giveth facility.</p>

Eſdraſs 47.53. and 8.52, 53, 54.</note> But when <hi>Elias</hi> who was with Chriſt in the Mount ſhall come, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare more to you of theſe things. So I tell you what I have heard of the Tree of Life, which hath been ſealed up hitherto, and no man hath dared to break up the ſeal, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could: becauſe a Fiery Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is in the way which ſhall not be removed before Chriſt come with great Power &amp; Glory; whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we do declare to you, is much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than men believe it is: and ſeeing it is ſo, I do foretell all Phyſitians, that then their Phyſick ſhall be worth nothing; for another Garden will be found, whence ſhall be had herbs, that ſhall preſerve men not onely from ſickneſs, but even from death it ſelf. Who will not be glad of this,
<pb facs="tcp:35843:97"/>
eſpecially when you may partake of the benefit of it, if you receive and believe it, and do not deſpiſe my Prognoſtication. Beſides let the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſts know this from me, that the Phyloſophers Stone, wherewith they have cured the ſick; and their univerſal Medicine, and chief Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall be worth nothing, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt vile in compariſon of this univerſall Medicine of which I have heard, and tell you of. What think you of this? you that have ſo bragged of your Chymiſtry hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and have written ſo many Books and brought men into many errors; (I mean not the true Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſts, that were good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and in ſimplicity of heart truly ſerved their neighbour, ſuch as were the <hi>Benedictine Monk, Baſilius, Valentinus, Paracelſus,</hi> and others, for they ſhall have this ſaid unto them, <hi>I was ſick and ye viſited me,</hi> and have not ſo conſtanly taken fees from all, as many of our money-ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers do, who forget mercy and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and are therefore no true Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,)
<pb facs="tcp:35843:98"/>
but I mean the knaviſh Cole-blowers, and pretenders to Chymiſtry. Know therefore ye Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſts, that all your glory ſhall vaniſh away, both of your univerſal Medicine, and of your projection and Tranſmutation of baſer Metals into Gold and Silver, and this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall belong to the Miners, who in the New World ſhall dig out of the ground more Gold and Silver than needs, and that very pure and refined, without any cleanſing or melting at all.<note place="margin">Iſa. 60.17.</note> Now have you not red a Propheſie of this in <hi>Iſaiah, For Braſs I will bring Gold, and for Iron I will bring Silver, and for Wood Braſs, and for Stones Iron.</hi> It is not to be believed what great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and unexhauſted riches are hid in the Mountaines, nay and in the very fields and plaines what a vaſt quantity there is of Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, which have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been hid and ſealed up till theſe laſt daies, wherein all ſhall be made manifeſt, to the glory of God. But what are theſe earthly things, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb facs="tcp:35843:98"/>
of that glory which is in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine World or the Original of theſe Worlds. For there is a thing more noble and excellent than the very Tree of Life, which is in Paradice,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.</note> namely that <hi>Stone which hitherto the Builders have refuſed.</hi> Here now will many think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: what means all this? give me the Phyloſophers Stone, or tell me where thoſe treaſures are hid w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you ſpeak of, and keep your fine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits to your ſelf. Not ſo (ſay I) for it is a true propheſie, that <hi>He which ſeeks theſe fading things,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2.17.</note> 
                        <hi>he ſhall decay with them.</hi> But <hi>he which firſt ſeeks the Kingdome of God,</hi> him will God ſeek and enrich him for ever. And therefore I wiſh from my very heart, that ye were of my mind, and then we would preſently berich our ſelves, and enrich others; I wiſh but as much as will ſerve me and my ſmall family from day to day, though I might eaſily grow rich if I would worſhip the God of the world, but when I am offered riches, I ſay to my ſelf, away Satan. And who would think that I have not a

peny to buy my own ſupper and my poor little childrens with, but what I borrow. O Man, if thou didſt but know the inexhauſted riches of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Kingdom &amp; Glory: thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt utterly deſpiſe the riches and glory of this World, and think as <hi>Paull</hi> doth, <hi>But what things were gain to me,</hi>

                        <hi>thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt.
