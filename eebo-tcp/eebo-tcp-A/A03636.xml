            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10008:3"/>
and towardelye euyles, before they be full rype, lest they shuld oppresse &amp; kepe vnder the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of truythe.</p>
            <p>Amonge all other pernitiouse doctrine contrarye vnto the truythe, there is one most pesti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent and dangerous whych de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyithe Jesus of Nazareth our sauioure to haue receauyd hys humanite and manhede of the blyssyd &amp; holye virgine Marye and supposithe ether he brought hys humanite wyth hym from heauen, or else toke it of some other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of here. For asmouch thefore as thys vngodlye opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon, crept not onlye into the churche immediatlye after the Apostelles, but also the same (beynge buryd and condemnyd by the scripture) in oure mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and most perillouse tyme

is goten into the hartes of manye: for whom Christ in hys humanite shedde hys preciouse bloud, and some it holdithe in troble, and perplexite of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: to confyrme and helpe the well persuadyd in the Christiane and Catholick fayth, and also to call agayne (yf God wyl) souche as begone: I purpose to intreat and reason thys mater of Christes incarnation at large, that the truythe maye as right is in thys case, take here place.</p>
            <p>Nothyng else in thys preface I demande, but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christiane reader tarye with the truythe, and not to be offendyd thoughe in thys tyme, manye erroures (vpon the begynnynge of the Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of trew religion in thys realme) dayly be brought

            <head>Reasons out of the olde Testament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fyrste is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mese of GOD vnto Adamme and Eue: Gene. 3. that the sede of a woman shuide breake the Serpenteshed. This promese was spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, for he solye and onlye brake the Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes hed, that is to saye destroyede the workes of the deuylle, satis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyed for synne and ouer came it, and also the worlde, hell, and the Deuylle, and set God and manne at one, remouynge the occasion of Ennimite, and the Ennimite it selfe in hys preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blud. Brekynge the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges of oure condemnation
<pb facs="tcp:10008:5"/>
vpon the crosse, Ephe. 2. &amp; thys oure Sauioure and peace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is callyd the sede of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The whyche word alone were sufficient to confounde the contrarye part, that saythe Christ toke not the substaunce of hys humanite of the blessyd Uyrgyne. Where so euer ye fynde thys worde, the sede of a woman in the holye scripture, ye shall see alwayes it is taken for the chyld, and byrthe that hathe of the substaunce of hys mother: and not for any thyng that passithe throughe the mother, as the water passithe throughe a pype: But that part of the mothers substaunce doothe concurre and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rielye is requyryd to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of the chylde as all Phisicke holdithe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10008:5"/>And this waye wrought God almightye the humanite of hys onlye sonne oure Sauyour Je<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sus of Nazareth wythoute the knowledge of man, vsynge the blessed virgine by the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Ghost to conceyue &amp; brynge forth thys blessed sede, whyche was made of her, and toke the original of hys huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite of, and in her, by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Ghost, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther norished in her wombe, nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther brought forthe she, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manite of Christ, as a thing that God hadde geuen Christe from heauen, or els from some other where, but noryshed in her, and brought forth the blessed sede, that God had made by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye poure, of her own substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Other els were thys promyse false, the sede of a woman shall
<pb facs="tcp:10008:6"/>
breake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> serpentes heade. It is no sede of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor hath any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thyng to do to be called the sede of a woman, that neuer take th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ought of a woman. But God doeth warraunte that he that shall breake the Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes head shalbe the sede of a woman. If it be true (as it can not be false) that the Serpentes heade is broken: who can denye but that it is broken by the sede of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. That is, by hym that toke his humanite of the womannes substaunce. Men must be ware, they be not deceiued in this case with allegoryes, and wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretacion of the worde: but plainlye make answere, Christe is the sede of a woman, and not a thynge that passed throughe here, nor was partetaker of her nature. For then should she not
<pb facs="tcp:10008:6"/>
haue broughte forthe her sone, but such asone as she know ney<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther father neyther mother of.</p>
            <p>Othere promises made god vnto Abraham and vnto Jacob of the same sede. To Abraham Gene. 22. In thy sede shall they say all the nacyons of the earth to be bsessed. Unto Jacob, Gen. 26. God saith thus: In thy sede shal al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world be bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed. Here agayn se we Christe called the sede: for none other purpose doutles, but onelye to take away all suspycion &amp; dout, that the worlde myght haue of hys humanyte. And leaste the worlde myghte haue sayde, as nowe a daye (the more pytye) many doth say, we belieue that Christe is of the sede of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but he brought that sede with him from heauen, or elles
<pb facs="tcp:10008:7"/>
wroughte the same sede, and made it not oute of the synneful nature of the fathers, but some other wayes, vnknowen vnto man. The scripture in these pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myses, and in other that shal fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowe putteth expresselye, thys pronown, Thyne, Saying, thy Sede. In thy sede, not in the sede that Christe shall brynge from heauen shalbe the blessing of all people. Howe can that be Abrahames, or Jacobes sede, that neuer toke any of their sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>staunce, but came from heauen, and was made of an other kind of nature, then Abraham and Jacob was of. Who is able by good auctorite of the scrypture to warraunt Christes humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, incase it be vnknown of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shoulde take it. As these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knoweth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> denyeth Christe
<pb facs="tcp:10008:7"/>
to take the nature of man of the blessed virgine. Unto Dauid God made the lyke promyse of Christe to be borne of hys sede. 2. Samuel. 7. When thy dayes be paste, and thou slepeste wyth thy fathers, I wyll suscitat thy sede after the, that shall come out of thy bely. The same haue ye. 1. Paral. 17. and also Psalm. 132. The Lorde swore a trueth vnto Dauid, and wyll not go fromit. I wyll set vpon thy sete (one) of the fruyte of thy belye. Nothinge is more clere, then these wordes. Noman douteth but all these places appertayne vnto Christ, the sonne of the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye virgine. Who is called here the sede of Dauid. Also that it shoulde come out of hys owne belye, concernynge his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is Christ called the fruit
<pb facs="tcp:10008:8"/>
of Dauid belye. God did sware he would thys do. Except he be for sworne he hathe done it, and in that God be presyde, we be agryed. Therfore we wyll not tarye long in the proue therof, seinge it neadeth no probation. One thing I desyre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reader of, that he marke well euerye worde of the promyse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where as he callethe hym that is promysed, nowe the sede of Dauid, then the fruyte of hys wombe: yf he so do, it shalbe easy to comprehende, howe far these men be from the veryte, that Christe shoulde be a man of the fathers nature, accordynge to the scriptures, and yet neuer re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued hys humane nature of none of them all. Loke in the scrypture, and se what the fruit of the belye is, and thou shalte
<pb facs="tcp:10008:8"/>
find in euery where, it is taken for the child that taketh the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnynge of hys humanite not onlye in hys mother, but also of hys mother, and parente. And calleth not that the fruyt of the belye, that passeth the bely with out the commixtion and partici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pation of the mothers substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as the water runneth, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sethe thoroughe the pype, that mengleth it selfe nothyng with substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the led. For a more ample declaration, and defence of the trueth concernynge the humanyte of Christ, and the ori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginall therof, Esaie the prophet hath more open propheties, not only assuringe of what familie, and trybe, Christ shuld be borne but also namethe the condicion of hys mother, saying. Behold a virgyne shall conceyue, &amp; bare
<pb facs="tcp:10008:9"/>
a chylde, the. 7. Chapt. S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thew sayth, not onelye that she had conceiued, but also that the blessed fruit grew in her, so that she was great, Chap. 1.</p>
            <p>Esaie in the. 11. Chap. sayth. There shall come forthe of the rase of Jesse a braunche, and a floure of hys rote, and so forth, reade the place. Now note the wordes of the holy Ghost, Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue, beynge great, &amp; to bring for the chylde: whether euer ye did read in the holy scriptures, or in any other boke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pertes were found, or may be founde in anye, sauynge in her, of whose nature and substaunce the chyld is formed, and made. Therfore the virgin, which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say here saythe shall conceyue, &amp; bryng forth, must ministre the part of her substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to her fruit
<pb facs="tcp:10008:9"/>

Therfore Sayncte Mathewe in the fryste Chapiter to helpe this dout, amonge other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges touchynge the genealogie and stocke of Christ, sayth thus speakynge of the blessed virgin Mary, Of whom is born christ and doeth not say by whome or through whome Christ passed.

Note well y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and they shall satisfye the. Unto this obieccion and other I wyll answere vnto here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the ende of the oration. Now to the proue of our propo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sytion, reade the fyrst of Saint Luke, and marke the gretinge of Elizabeth vnto the holy vyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne beyng great: Blessyd said she is the fruyte of thy wombe. Thys holye womanne callyth Christ the fruite, but wherof, &amp; from whens had she this fruite of heauen, or othere where? no treulye: but it was the fruyte of her owne belye, then of her owne substaunce, or else it were a manifest lye to call Christ the
<pb facs="tcp:10008:14"/>
fruyte of her belye. Nether I thynke, there is no man that would call a thing the fruite of a tre, that neuer had the nature of a tre. What man was euer so founde to saye, that a Pere were the fruyt of a Chery tre. Or who is he that can say, that Jesus of Nazareth takyng his humanite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen or of some other thinge besyde hys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can truely call him, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit of hys mothers wombe. The scripture sayeth: Christe is her sonne, and she is hys mothere, not a faynyd mother, but a true and verye naturall mother.</p>
            <p>So sayeth saynct Mathew in the fyrst Chapt. She broughte forth her sonne. And so the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne callyd hym Luke the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Sonne why haste y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> done thus vnto vs. Belyue the scry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb facs="tcp:10008:14"/>
and pondre accordingly the words and sentences ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Math. 1. Luce. 3. Jo. 2. 19.</p>
            <p>One place more there is in S. Paule wryten in the second to the Ebrew: which is thys, for asmuche then as the chyldren were partakers of fleshe and bloude, he also hymselfe lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse toke part wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in the same place he sayeth: He toke the sede of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not of the Angels so that he muste be lyke vnto his brothers in all thynges. This place appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the natiuite of Christe, let vs consydere dilygently the wordes of S. Paules oration, how he prouyth Christ to haue oure nature, whiche he toke of hys mother. If it be so sayeth S. Paule that the chyldren, that is to say men be partakers
<pb facs="tcp:10008:15"/>
of fleshe and bloude: Christe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he myghte destroye hym that hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dominion of death, by the death in his owne body, was made partaker of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, to wyte of fleshe and bloude. Here he vsythe thre wordes, Lykewyse, Partaker, Of the same. Reade the text and note the wordes.</p>
            <p>¶ Fyrst it is out of doute, that oure fleshe is of the nature and substaunce of a woman. Nowe sayeth S. Paule Christe lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse, that is to saye after the same maner toke fleshe as hys brothers. I saye not lyke vnto vs, for we receaue oure nature wyth synne, and in synne, and by naturall coniunccion. Christ receaued his humanyte of hys mother wythoute synne, by the operacyon of the holye ghoste.
<pb facs="tcp:10008:15"/>
But to Saynct Paules wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: like as man taketh his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of hys parentes, so lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse toke Christe hys humane nature of the blessyd vyrgyne, or else S. Paules symyle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nothynge.</p>
            <p>¶ The second word of Saynt Paule sayth, that he was made participant, or partaker. Now there is no participatyon nor can be, except it be of such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as is commune betwene them that be partakers of one thynge. It cannot be therfore that Christe hath taken other fleshe then hys brothers had, whych was of the sede of man. Forther he addeth. Christ toke the sede of Abraham, and not of Angelles, that is asmuche to say Abrahams fleshe verely hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane, and not any body or flesh
<pb facs="tcp:10008:16"/>
celestiall, or made of the ayer. In this place S. Paule shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth playnely from whens, and of whom Christ toke his huma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nite. In the same chapter S. Paule sayeth, Christe is made lyke vnto hys brothers in all thynges.</p>
            <p>¶ Howe can thys I praye you be true, in case he neuer toke hys humane nature of anye of hys brothers substaunce. The whyche thynge if ye take from Christ, there is nothinge can be more vnlyke, then Christe, and vs, that be hys brothers. In the last reason S. Paule sayth that Christ was tempted, that he myght succour such as were te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted. Now there is no fleshe, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be tempted, but mans fleshe. And there is no mannes fleshe, but hath taken his begynnyng
<pb facs="tcp:10008:16"/>
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substaunce of man, except it were Adam the fyrste man that was made of the Earth, Gen. 1. Farther howe can he helpe vs as S. Paule sayth beyng in an other flesh from vs. If he haue an other fleshe then we haue (I except synne, &amp; nowe mortaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te) how or wherin is the iustyce of God satisfied for sinne? How can he be a faythful medyatour betwene God and man, that neuer toke hys humanite, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substance or natur of any man.</p>
            <p>¶ These places and autorytes I trust suffycyth euerye Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hart for the stablyshement of thys Article of oure beleue, where we confesse that Christe was conceaued by the holye ghost, and borne of the vyrgyn Marye. By the whyche word Of, we beleue that he toke hys
<pb facs="tcp:10008:17"/>
humanite of her substance, and had none othere begynnynge as touchynge hys humanyte, then in her, and of her, by the operatyon of the holye ghoste.

                  <p>¶ This wrong interpretation of the scriptures comineth by the equiuocation, or diuerse sig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifycatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thys word (Made) Whyche hath in the scriptures two sygnifycatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The fyrst, it sygnifyeth a chaunge of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into an other as Jo. 2. the water was made wyne. And also Gene. 19. The wief of Loth was made into a stone of salt.</p>
                  <p>Thys word (Made) in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in many other places syg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth asmouche as to saye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauyd, as S. Paule wryteth Gala. 3. Christe is made for vs

the curse or execration. That is to saye receauyd in hym the curse and maledictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God for our synnes. And agayn, 2. cor. 5 He that knew no synne, Made synne for vs. That is to saye was the sacrifyce for oursynne. Good Christiane reader, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre to take the meanyng of the scripture accordyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce therof, and then thou shalt perceaue for the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilyte of Godes nature, that where sayncte Joanne sayth, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde was made fleshe, is euen asmouche to say, as the sonne of God, receauyd fleshe, And no other sense nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng can it haue then thys, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye woulde the worde that was God before, &amp; immortall is now chaumged into man, &amp; beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me mortal, which sentence
<pb facs="tcp:10008:22"/>
repugneth euerye booke of the scripture. Farther it should fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that he that was before God, as S. John sayeth, now leueth to be God, and is made man, as the water that was turned into wyne Jo. 2. Lefte to be wyne and become water. And as the corne of salt was no more the wyefe of Loth, but a corne of salt.</p>
                  <p>¶ Beside all thys, yf God be turned into man, how standeth there fyrst interpretacion, that hys fleshe and trew humanite is of the holye Ghost?</p>
                  <p>¶ Nomaner of waye doutles for no substaunce of fleshe is of the substaunce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holye ghost, nor no substaunce of the holye Ghost can or maye be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of the fleshe.

               <p>¶ Whatso euer is borne of a woman, hath a carnall bodye, but Sainct Paule attrybuteth vnto Christe a spirituall bodye 1. Cor. 15. therfore he was not conceyued nor borne of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannes nature.</p>

                  <p>¶ S.

<pb facs="tcp:10008:23"/>
And answereth there to the obiection of them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundyd in what bodye the dead shoulde ryse: in the same sayeth he that they lyuyd, but nomore mortall, nor subiecte vnto the payne of mortalite, as Adames bodye was after he synned: but spirituall as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body was after his resuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (spirituall I saye, not that it losteth hys humanyte, or is turned into the nature of a spiryte.

                  <p>Thus proueth S. Paule whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saeyth, it is sowen a naturall bodye, it shall ryse a spirituall bodye.
