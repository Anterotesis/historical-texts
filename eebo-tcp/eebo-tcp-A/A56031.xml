            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PROPOSALS FOR IRISH Forfeitures CONSIDER'D, With Regard to LAW and GOOD CONSCIENCE.</head>
            <p>THE Forfeitures of <hi>Ireland</hi> being now propos'd as a Security to raiſe a Million of Money on towards tſte Charge of the War, 'twill be neceſſary to enquire more near into the Value of the ſaid Forfeitures, rather than depend altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon a Notional Calculation made by the Propoſer, (who contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in framing his Project with Numbers of Imaginary Acres without any regard to the nature of a Forfeiture, or the Laws eſtabliſh'd) for that a diſappointment in a matter of this kind may prove of Ill Conſequence to the Publick; which he and his Party don't ſo much ſeem to conſider, as their own particular Gain, and the Deſtruction of Innocents, Widows, and Orphans, who have ſuffer'd but too much already.</p>
            <p>The Propoſer brings the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> under Two Heads, that is to ſay, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi>; the Poſſeſſions of the latter he would have entirely Forfeited, and brings every Eſtated <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick of that Kingdom under that denomination, and thence wou'd he inſinuate them to be different from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Temper, and Intereſt, nay, that they have an innate prejudice and hatred to them. Thus by falſe and malicious Suggeſtions wou'd he carry on a deſign to ſtrip, and ruin a Body of <hi>Engliſh</hi> People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a different perſwaſion from himſelf; for that the Eſtated Men of <hi>Ireland</hi> (to a very few) are deſcended of Ancient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, who at the expence of their Blood firſt Conquer'd that Kingdom, brought it under the Subjection of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and continued it ſo ever ſince. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> who plant in <hi>America</hi> may with as much reaſon be call'd <hi>Indians,</hi> and for that alone have their Fortunes and Eſtates ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them.</p>
            <p>It is therefore hop'd that the Wiſe, and Juſt Senate, the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> will conſider their Countreymen (tho' in a diſtinct Kingdom) under their preſent unfortunate Circumſtances, without any prepoſſeſſions of prejudice, and take their Caſe juſtly as 'tis.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> having gone for <hi>Ireland</hi> on the Late Revolution, ſome of the Catholick there were concern'd in his Army, and ſome not; of thoſe concern'd in the Army ſome ſubmitted to the preſent Government on Articles, others choſe to follow him; theſe are intituled to no favour from that Power to which they refus'd to ſubmit, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence their Eſtates juſtly to be Forfeited.</p>
            <p>But as to the Article-Men publick Faith ought to ſtand good, beſides, he was their only known Maſter, and to whom, as their King, they had promiſed Faith, and Sworn Allegiance. Then let any impartial Man make the caſe his own, and ſeriouſly examine if at the expence of his Conſcience he wou'd refuſe performing the Duty of a Subject to his Soveraign when requir'd to it? Muſt it not then neceſſarily follow that they acted but the part of Subjects, or at leaſt, the Propoſer muſt maintain that the tyes of Faith and Allegiance are of no force, and may be broke with their preſent Majeſties in caſe of a Forreign Invaſion, which is a Doctrine no good Subject will allow of.</p>
            <p>Theſe People have now ſubmitted on a ſolemn Capitulation, and are become Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is it not therefore reaſonable they ſhould have the benefit of the ſame, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29756:2"/>
into the protection of the Laws, when as by the implacable malice of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers Party, one third of thoſe compriz'd in the ſaid Capitulation are not admitted to enjoy their Eſtates, and Fortunes, as 'twas ſtipulated.</p>
            <p>As to them, who were not concern'd in King <hi>James</hi>'s Army; ſome for order, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and ſecurity in the Commonweal had and took, Civil Employments, to prevent the miſchief a multitude, or populace is capable of, theſe he wou'd have Forfeiting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons too.</p>
            <p>Others were no way concern'd, more than in Tilling their Ground, and following their lawful Occupations, yet can they not eſcape this Propoſer's heavy ſtroke, but that they muſt likewiſe Forfeit.</p>
            <p>In fine, ſo 'twas order'd, That all the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of the Kingdom, that had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Eſtate of Freehold, or Leaſe, to the number of Four Thouſand ſtand now Outlaw'd of High Treaſon, ſave ſome few, who thro' their Majeſties Grace and Favour have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd Orders to Reverſe the ſame.</p>
            <p>'Tis out of theſe Perſons Eſtates, (without regard to Law, either Humade, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) that this Projector wou'd extract his Fund for the Million of Money.</p>
            <p>And to that end computes a Million of Acres to be Forfeited, (making his clip'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for the Article-Men) which with the help of Forfeited (or ſo ſuppos'd) Tythes, Fairs, Markets, Woods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if valued at 2 <hi>s.</hi> the Acre <hi>per Annum,</hi> makes up 100000 <hi>l.</hi> and that at Ten Years Purchaſe brings in a Million.</p>
            <p>This Calculation granted, (tho' falſe in this, as in other inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> for that <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terees</hi> by the Act of Settlement, as ſuch, were reſtor'd to no Acres) yet there is no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance made for ſuch of theſe Lands, as are fallen in ſo great a tract of time to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Heirs, ſold, or Leas'd to Proteſtants for Chieferees, or ſome ſmall Rents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the heavy Incumbrances due to the Proteſtant Creditors, (of which there are but very few Catholicks Eſtates free) will never be ballanced by Forfeited Incumbrances, as he ſuggeſts. Then he deſtroys all Remainders, and Settlements, by ſuppoſing the Parties intereſted all guilty of Rebellion, and probably many of them Proteſtants, and Infants.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners of the Revenue in <hi>Ireland</hi> have brought theſe Forfeitures to a greater certainty, than an airy Calculation can be ſuppos'd to do, thoſe of them in this Kingdom at preſent can give an eſtmate of what they amount to, and out of this two thirds of the Article-Men, not yet reſtor'd, are to be ſatisfied; ſo that 'tis plain this expedient (tho' 'twere practicable by Law) anſwers not with any certainty the end propos'd.</p>
            <p>However the Propoſer and his Adherents makes ſure of what <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> aim at firſt, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all theſe Lands in Fee-farm to themſelves at an eaſie Rent, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to exterminate a People, who they have but too much injur'd, and leave the Million as a Conſequence to happen, or not happen.</p>
            <p>If theſe Gentlemen did but offer to their Majeſties a Million of Money for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Exigency of Affairs out of the 4560037 Acres, they now poffeſs, and which they got at ſmall, or no Rates, with the large Purchaſes made by them theſe Thirty odd Years paſt, (and that may juſtly be computed at much above a Million more) 'twou'd be ſome proof that this Project of theirs was meant for the Publick Good, but to be thus Generous at other Mens Expence, and that with ſo great a regard to themſelves, ſhews but too plain the Deſign to be ſet on foot for their own particular Intereſts.</p>
            <p>It is evident that a Covetous Man is not to be ſatisfied, for theſe very Perſons (whoſe Fathers, and many of themſelves were Born to little or no Eſtates) are now poſſeſs'd of ſix parts in ſeven of a Fertile Rich Kingdom, and yet are not contented, but wou'd play the old Game over again; for that upon the Reſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second they prevail'd to get an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act of Parliament of their own forming, with ſuch Qualifications on <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, that 'twas eaſier to paſs the tryal of <hi>Ordial,</hi> than to be judg'd Innocent by the ſaid Conditions, by the ſeveral Clauſes and Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſaid Act, they intitul'd themſelves to the Eſtates of the very Perſons, that Fought for the Crown, and never againſt it, and of ſuch Infants and Orphans whoſe Fathers dyed for the King by ſeemingly involving them in a Conſpiracy carried on by Sir <hi>Phalim Oneile,</hi> and his Accomplices; they now wou'd finiſh at a blow what they left uncompleated, which may plainly appear by what he ſays was deſign'd by their late <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament, as if they had an undoubted Right to Enſlave People.</p>
            <p>Their Outlawries reach not only all the Living, but call the Buried out of their Graves, many being Outlawed after Death, a proceeding againſt Law, and Common Senſe; for that by the ſame Rule any, or all the Families of <hi>England</hi> may be Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29756:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſince the Conqueſt; ſome were actually Priſoners in the Sheriffs Cuſtody, and Outlawed by the Return made by the ſame Sheriff, and ſuch as appear'd to ſtop the Proceſs offer'd to be Try'd, yet were refus'd, or otherwiſe terrified; in ſhort, 'twas the Eſtate committed the Treaſon, and not the Man.</p>
            <p>And becauſe after long Solicitation and Importunity they find his Majeſty will not recede from his Royal Promiſe as to the Articles, they ſeemingly conſent the ſame may be confirm'd, but in Negative Terms, to the end, they may have room to cavil at, limit, and conſtrue the ſame at will and pleaſure in the execution thereof; the few that have already been admitted to the benefit of the ſaid Articles were not allow'd the Arrears due to them on their own Tenants, but oblig'd by Recogniſance to Releaſe the ſame, as alſo rhe <hi>November</hi> Rent growing due after the perfection of the ſaid Articles, nor were they admitted to any Chattels real, (tho' the Fortunes of many conſiſted in no other Eſtate, and the Capitulation ſays poſitively they ſhall be reſtor'd to all their Eſtates, Rights, Titles, and Intereſts; by the very word (Eſtates) not only an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, or Freehold is ſignified, but alſo a Term for Years, a Statute Staple, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, Elegit, or the like. <hi>Cook</hi>'s <hi>firſt Inſtit.</hi> 345. <hi>a.</hi> Such is the favour (as he calls it) they met with on an Execution of the ſaid Articles.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing that the Propoſer graciouſly condeſcends, that the Article-Men may at one time or other receive the benefit of their Capitulation, whence muſt we have this Million of Acres? He tells you out of the Eſtates of the <hi>Protectees,</hi> that is to ſay, firſt, the Juſtice of Peace, the Sheriff, Judge, or any other in Civil Employments, (tho' by Commiſſion before the Revolution;) truly 'tis a new ſort of Forfeiture, that Men who out of a publick Spirit of diſtributing Juſtice, keeping of Peace in a Society, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of Deſtruction in a Commonweal, ſhall Forfeit their Birthrights and Inhei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances for the ſame.</p>
            <p>But he finds you out of another ſort of Men that after his way are yet more guilty, and that is the Honeſt Gentleman, who ſtaid at home to look after his Tilling, his Grounds, and Eſtate; or otherwiſe followed his lawful Affairs, without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in Army or Civil Employment, the Lawyer that minded his Clients Intereſt, the Phyſician that took care of his Patient, the Merchant that attended his Market, and Buſineſs, and the Tradeſman that look'd after his Shop, theſe are the Perſons, he ſays, who muſt have committed deep Crimes in thought and imagination (for no other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) and therefore muſt give all their Fortunes to make up the Calculators Fund, tho' they liv'd under the Faith of the Government by receiving publick Protections, and were not a little uſeful to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, and are expreſly within the King's Declaration of the 22<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1688.</p>
            <p>If thus People living under the Laws of <hi>England</hi> muſt be ſtript of all, we ought no more to boaſt of Liberty, and Property, and what is practic'd to day in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may hereafter ſerve as a Preſident for the future. By the Law every Man is free, and Maſter of his Property, until he be prov'd guilty <hi>par judicium pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſuorum,</hi> or flies from Juſtice. In the Caſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> there happens neither, therefore 'tis againſt Law, and <hi>Magna Charta</hi> expreſly, to keep them out of their Rights: When it is evident by many Inſtances how well diſpos'd the Government is to do all People Right, but their Majeſties good Intentions in doing Juſtice to the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> are wholly obviated by the practice of malevolent Perſons, who by their Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Contrivances continue them Attainted, and of conſequence are capable of no Grace, or Favour.</p>
            <p>As to the Two and Fifty Rebellions mention'd by the Propoſer to have been in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whether true, or falſe, is not at this time diſputed; and what Countrey has been altogether free from ſuch Misfortunes? But 'tis moſt certain that neither he, nor one of his Adherents, had any ſhare in quelling theſe he mentions: 'Twas by thoſe, and their Anceſtors (whom he calls Forfeiting <hi>Iriſh</hi>) they were ſuppreſs'd, who fought for every Foot of Land they got there, and gain'd it Inch by Inch until they ſubdued the whole Countrey, and preſerv'd it ſince for the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; and if in return of ſo much Fidelity they muſt now be deſtroy'd to make room for, or to gratifie theſe their Perſecutors, 'twill be hereafter but a ſlender Encouragement for juſt and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
            <p>He wou'd infer as a neceſſary Conſequence from theſe Rebellions a prejudice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to be ingrafted in thoſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which in practice and experience is moſt notoriouſly falſe; nay, they liv'd after a moſt Neighbourly and Amicable manner during the laſt two Reigns, even with the Propoſer's Friends, who had a little before taken moſt part of their Bread from them, by which it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29756:3"/>
that 'tis the injur'd Man that forgets and remits the wrong, but never he that gives it: For who cou'd be better us'd than thoſe of the Proteſtants, who ſtaid in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> during theſe late Troubles; did they pay extraordinary Taxes, or any thing more than the Catholicks? Nay, by all People in Employment they were rather favour'd than otherwiſe? What might have been done by the Mobb, or Rapparees, was not in the power of Man to help; yet all this Humanity and Juſtice would he attribute to the hopes King <hi>James</hi>'s Officers had of getting Eſtates in <hi>England</hi>; but the Gentleman is apt to miſtake, and did not conſider, that every Body well knows the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> don't Forfeit their Eſtates on ſuch eaſie terms; however he allows in Fact that they were well us'd, and we are oblig'd to him for this one Truth.</p>
            <p>If then all thoſe black Rebellions, and falſe Reaſonings don't prevail, he offers for a conclu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, and ſtabbing ſtroke, That to make Forfeitures of theſe Eſtates by accrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the Innocent, oppreſſing the Widow, and ſtriping the Orphan, is a ſure Baſis to Build on, and an infallible Mean whereby to preſerve the Proteſtant Religion, by which he ſhews himſelf ſo little a Divine, that he is not commonly Moral, to imagine that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Religion ſhould eſtabliſh it ſelf by a practice ſo contrary to what it teaches.</p>
            <p>Then he deſires that Sanguinary, and Penal Laws may be put into their hands, but it ſhou'd ſeem by their practice, that they need neither, who proceed ſo violently even againſt the Eſtabliſh'd Laws, and regard ſo little Humanity, and the Laws of God; for that the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſince the Reduction of it by the Army, have under pretext of Rapparees, kill'd ſeveral Labouring-men, even at the Plough; becauſe they wanted opportunities during all the War to draw their Swords.</p>
            <p>Another Expedient he thinks likewiſe Reaſonable, which is, That a Pale may be made for Proteſtants; and that the Catholicks be removed from the Sea-ſide in all Parts. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> of which is, That where a Catholick ſhall happen to be reſtored to his own Inheritance, and the ſame prove to be good Land, it ſhall then be in the Power of any of them to tranſplant him to the top of a Mountain, and to ſeize on his Right, as being within their Verge. In ſhort, 'tis to be wondred they do not ſue for a Power and Liberty to impale them then too at will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for that they are in a Circumſtance almoſt as bad, expoſed daily to the Inſults of their Neighbours, who at diſcretion may take from them the ſmall Remnant they have left of any kind, and as being Out-law'd, have no Remedy for the ſame.</p>
            <p>What ſtate of Man can be more Miſerable than this, or ſavour more of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage? A thing in <hi>England</hi> ſo much deteſted. It is therefore hoped that theſe Inſtances will make impreſſions on every true <hi>Engliſh-man</hi>'s heart, and that they will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe of their own Nation, ſo as to prevent their being thus injured by a ſort of Men, who have always fiſh'd in troubled Waters, and know not what 'tis to get, but by Rapin and Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>It is to be preſumed that theſe Catholicks for being of that Perſuaſion are not to loſe their Birth-rights. Wherefore it may reaſonably be asked, why a Proteſtant living in <hi>Ireland</hi> under King <hi>James,</hi> or actually ſerving him either in a Military or Civil Employment, ſhould be free under the Protection of the Laws, and ſafe in his Property; when at the ſame time his <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Neighbour, in equal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with him, ſhall forfeit all, and be proſcribed? This ſingle Inſtance ſhews the Proceedings of theſe Men of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be plainly Partial and Unjuſt.</p>
            <p>All this conſidered, and ſeriouſly reflected on, it may with Reaſon be hoped, and expected, That Their Majeſties, and all thoſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oncerned in the Legiſlature, will no longer ſuffer, that Men ſhall thus be diveſted of their Properties, againſt the Laws of God and Man: That ſome certain Rules or Meaſures of Juſtice be put to them like other Subjects, and that all their Outlawries (a Yoak much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable than Chains and Fetters) be reverſed, they having done nothing to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the Protection of the Government ſince their Submiſſion to it.</p>
            <p>In Conſideration of which, and to be delivered out of the Power of their bitter and inſatiable Perſecutors, the ſuppoſed Forfeiting Perſons moſt Humbly, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offer to Subſcribe to any Tax that ſhall be thought fit, or reaſonable to be given out of their Eſtates towards the Charge of the War, which in all probability will prove more effectual to the Government, than the Methods propoſed for Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſaid Eſtates, ſo much againſt Reaſon, Law, and good Conſcience; an Undertaking no conſiderate Man (both for his own, and the ſake of his Poſterity) will have a hand in.</p>
