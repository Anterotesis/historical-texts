            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT having pleaſed the King, to emit a gracious Declaration for
<hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and it being more than probable, that the
matter thereof, may be the Subject of the next <hi>Parliament;</hi> I
do here preſent you (my old Friend) with ſome of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
inclining me to exert my ſelf to my Ability, when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to it (whatſoever Oppoſition or Cenſure, may therein attend me)
for the Election of ſuch Members as may concur with his Majeſty, in
giving Sanction to this <hi>Indulgence</hi> (it being what we have long wanted,
and wiſhed for) and in ſecuring it to after Ages, which is as undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the King's Royal Purpoſe, as it is our common Intereſt; my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are.</p>
            <p>1. That herein I ſhall be found to act in conſiſtency with my conſtant
Principle, for I always eſteemed it, to be a glorious Work, to ſet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
free from <hi>Church-Tyranny,</hi> and to extricate the Nation from
the intolerable Burden of deſtructive <hi>Penal Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60242:2"/>
2. That in the preſent Undertaking; I ſee my Security, we have in
this happy Juncture, the Advantage of promoting what we highly
prize, and that with his Majeſtie's Royal Recommendation; ſo we are
ſafe (whoſoever ſnarles) in conforming, to ſo great, ſo good, and ſo
wiſe a Reſolution, as the King has propitiouſly taken. And moreover,</p>
            <p>3. Gratitude to his Majeſty for this <hi>Declaration,</hi> and for his gracious
<hi>Proclamation of Pardon</hi> of the <hi>10th,</hi> of <hi>March 1685,</hi> engages and ſpurs
me (as I hope it will do Multitudes) to promote with my utmoſt
Might, this preſent Work, as it is a thing acceptable to the King.</p>
            <p>To add no more, theſe Reaſons are prevalent with me, and if they
may diſpoſe you to contribute to the making proper <hi>Elections,</hi> ſo that
his Majeſtie's gracious Purpoſe, for the Relief and Tranquility of his
People, may not be fruſtrated, by unreaſonable Malecontents, it will
be moſt grateful to me; for I know you to be very capable, of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
ſignificantly to this publick Good.</p>
            <p>I perceive that ſome of your Neighbours are beating their Brains for
Arguments, to juſtify the upholding the <hi>perſecuting Laws,</hi> and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating,
and moſt unreaſonable <hi>Tests:</hi> With me it is out of Queſtion,
that thoſe Men, are very narrow ſoul'd, and their Maxims ill grounded;
pray therefore bear with me, that I preſent you with my Thoughts, of
the great Point now agitated, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> or <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am well ſatisfied, of the Truth, and Stability of the following Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
and he that is ſo, muſt ceaſe to Love <hi>Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is conſonant to the Goſpel which no where
countenances Force and Compulſion.</p>
            <p>2. To grant this <hi>Liberty,</hi> is the true Intereſt both of Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to evince the Truth of theſe, let it be conſidered as to the firſt:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is conſonant to the Goſpel. It is a Goſpel
of Peace, and not of Force and Fury: If ſo, it is moſt unbeſeeming this
Goſpel, to do things raſhly and violently, for its Advancement, it is
not to be ſo propagated: Its Language is, <hi>he that believes ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
And our bleſſed Lord, and his Apoſtles (who had the command of all
Power) to bring Men to this Faith, uſed Inſtruction, Perſwaſion, and
Reaſoning, but never went about to deal with Mens Conſciences, by
Violence; they uſed no Sword but that of the Spirit, and left every
Man to his own Light.</p>
            <p>Error, as well as Truth, is ſeated in the Mind of Man, and we are
without one Inſtance ſince the Creation, where Compulſion ever wrought
a Change in any ones Principles, tho it hath wrought on many, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or conceal their Opinions. The Soul of Man is out of the reach of
the Magiſtrates Sword, and therefore 'tis as vain to pretend to direct
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60242:2"/>
what I ſhall believe, and to force in me a Faith of any thing, as 'tis to
attempt to bring the Angels under an outward ſecular Power. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
undoubtedly will diſpoſe a Man to hate whatſoever is ſo propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and not better evinced. To proceed,</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is the Intereſt both of the King and his
People, this is well proved, by the invincible Reaſons in his Majeſties
gratious Declaration, which are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. The Glory of the King. 2. The Peoples Peace. 3. Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and his People. 4. The Unreaſonableneſs of conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conſcience, and forceing People in matters of meer Religion.
5. The Miſchiefs of Compulſion by ſpoiling Trade, depopulating Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and diſcouraging Strangers. And laſtly, the ill Succeſs which
Force has had in Religious Matters, which ſhews the invincible Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
which attend thoſe Methods.</p>
            <p>1. The Glory of the King. Will any Member of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(ſo fam'd for Loyalty) repine at his Majeſties being truly Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
ſurely no; and hath not this his Act of Tenderneſs, added high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Glory? It undoubtedly hath: It ſecures not only common
Homage of Obedience, and Subjection to his Majeſty; but with it, that
more noble, of the Hearts and Affections, of a very great multitude of
his People, who are ſober, ſerious, induſtrious, and alſo wealthy; theſe
by Perſecution have been made heartleſs in themſelves, and uſeleſs in
a very great Meaſure, to the King, and Kingdom: I ſay this <hi>Indulgence</hi>
hath ſecured to the King the Hearts of his diſſenting Subjects, who
are brought to depend upon him, and they will love him, who favours
and protects them, and hath put them into a Poſture, than which they
can never hope for a better; and ſeeing the Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot
but love him, and be Loyal, he is without Controverſy become the moſt
Glorious, becauſe the greateſt, and moſt beloved Prince, that ever yet
ſwayed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter.</p>
            <p>2. The Peoples Peace. Do not we know by ſad Experience, how
greatly Coercion in things relating to God and Conſcience, has diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the Peace of Mankind, and created terrible Concuſſions in theſe
Kingdoms? What lamentable Diviſions and Animoſities, have we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
to ſpring from the Execution of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and how diſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſad have been their Effects? It is not reaſonable to imagine that
<hi>Perſecution</hi> ſhould not diſguſt thoſe who ſuffer; and By-ſlanders (tho
otherwiſe perſwaded as to Religion) are diſſatisfied, to behold their
peaceable honeſt dealing Neighbours, torn to pieces for Conſcience
ſake, ſuch are diſpoſed to pity the Sufferers, and to diſlike the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
wherewith they are exerciſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60242:3"/>
3. Union between the King and his People. It is moſt evident that
the Diſaffection, which not long ſince had overſpread our Horizon,
did ſpring from the Severities of the Laws, and of their Execution. The
happy Union between Prince and People has been (if not broken) to a
very great degree weakened, by a miſtaken Maxim, that but one part of
his Majeſties Subjects (and that a much leſſer part, than ſome are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
they ſhould be thought) deſerved to live, and to be protected:
This too predominant Opinion, did manifeſtly narrow the Intereſt of
the King, by confining it to one Party; but bleſſed be God, and the
King, that we have out lived that fond Conceit, and that we ſee, that
<hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> hath united the Diſſenters to his Majeſty, and that
he becomes the common Father of all his People.</p>
            <p>4. The Unreaſonableneſs of conſtraining Conſcience, and forcing
People in matters of meer Religion. Conſcience is God's peculiar, and
ſo out of Man's <hi>Juriſdiction:</hi> Is it not then moſt unreaſonable, to have
it floating about at the Will of humane Powers, and to oblige Chriſtians to
ſuffer or to fall in with all Changes of Religion? It is unreaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe impoſſible, to compel a Man to the Belief of any thing, out of the
compaſs of his Knowledg; our Lord left neither Precept nor Preſident for
ſuch a Practice: Men under the Goſpel are firſt to be enlightned, and
then to practice in Conformity thereto: The way of dealing with Men
by Violence, was in all Ages unſucceſsful, therefore 'tis more than time
to explode it; <hi>&amp; ad hominem,</hi> to give one irrefragible Argument to our
Church of <hi>England</hi> (which at this day, is, or would be the Perſecutor of
her Brethren;) Is it not unreaſonable, nay abſur'd, that that Church
which in its Doctrin allows <hi>Judicium diſcretionis,</hi> a liberty of judging for
our ſelves, and pretends not to <hi>Infallibility;</hi> ſhould require me to change
my Opinion, and to be of hers, when I conceive my ſelf to be in the
right, and ſhe hath no infallible Aſſurance that ſhe is not in the wrong?</p>
            <p>5. The Miſchiefs of Compulſion, in ſpoiling Trade, depopulating the
Country, and diſcouraging Strangers, amongſt the many miſchievous
Events which we have ſeen, from the denyal of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi>
that upon Trade is not the leaſt, nor to be laſt mentioned: Impoſition
in Religion damps mens Undertakings, and hath drove Multitudes
into forreign Parts, and not a few to a Retirement from their Trades,
and Vocations, who would otherwiſe have been very uſeful to the
Common-wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conſcientious Men have a very ſow Eſteem of all things,
compared with their religious Liberty; who will lay out his Eſtate and
Trade freely, where the bare exerciſing his Religion, gives vile <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
a Power to diſpoil him of his Subſtance? <hi>Toleration</hi> in the united
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> hath brought them from all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> a Confluence of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60242:3"/>
People, and by conſequence of Treaſure, and Trade; wherefore their
Policy, has heretofore, as much approved our preſſing a Uniformity
here, as they now ſeem diſturbed at our <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> it being
that, which with ſo great Advantage they have long monopolized. And
Laſtly, The ill Succeſs which Force in Religious Matters has always been
attended with: Compulſion never attained the intended End, it may,
and hath too often made Hypocrites, never ſincere Converts. The
earneſt deſire of Liberty when refuſed, creates Diſcontents, which
boile in the Breaſts of Men, and have too often broken out, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering
Governments; for Perſons of differing Sentiments in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
will unite in an Oppoſition to the Force about Religious Things,
which renders every diſſenting Party uneaſy, ſo that the Danger ſeems
to lye in Perſecution for Conſcience ſake, and not in the having under
one Government ſeveral Perſwaſions and Parties in Religion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to the Objections made againſt this <hi>Liberty of
Conſcience,</hi> and the Repeal of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> by ſome very warm
Clergy Men (for the Church is not a little divided in this Point, and
the beſt, poſſibly the greateſt part thereof, will be found not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
Perſecution.)</p>
            <p>1. They ſay, their <hi>Oppoſition ariſes from a Dread of Popery.</hi> To anſwer
theſe Gentlemen, and diſſipate their Fears.</p>
            <p>1. Can the Church of <hi>England</hi> (Circumſtances conſidered) poſſibly
invent a better Security than ſhe hath by his Majeſties <hi>Declaration?</hi> That
firſt of all Declares, that the King will protect and maintain Her, in
the free Exerciſe of her Religion, as, by Law eſtabliſhed, and in the
quiet and full Enjoyment of all her Poſſeſſions without any Moleſtation or
Diſturbance whatſoever. What would ſhe further have? Will ſhe call
into queſtion the Sincerity of his Majeſties Promiſe? The King intends
the Concurrence of a Parliament for the eſtabliſhing the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and
the aboliſhing the <hi>Teſts</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws:</hi> It will be then ſeaſonable, for
the Church of <hi>England</hi> to ask her further Security, if ſhe will pretend
to ſtand in need thereof.</p>
            <p>2. Let the Church conſider that the King only takes from her the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of doing Miſchief. She will not pretend to deny his Majeſty <hi>Liberty
of Conſcience;</hi> If ſhe doth not, can ſhe expect by his Permiſſion and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to cudgel her fellow Subjects into a Communion which he doth
not approve, and that after he hath ſo ſolemnly declared his Royal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be againſt all Perſecution for Conſcience ſake? He intends not
to deprive the Church of <hi>England</hi> of ſuch Laws as are defenſive of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Poſſeſſions, but only to abrogate ſuch Statutes, as the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or ſhort-ſightedneſs of paſt Ages hath armed her with to annoy and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60242:4"/>
offend her Neighbours; Laws wicked in themſelves, and which ſhe hath too
long, very wickedly executed, and therefore very fit to be yielded up.</p>
            <p>The Objectors fear of Popery, by the Repeal of the <hi>Penal Statutes,</hi>
is not eaſily to be comprehended; let the Papiſts, with all other the
Kings Subjects, be reſtored to what ought to be theirs, by the Laws of
God, and let them have their Birth-rights, and we have them in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt of the Nation. Such who are in love with Perſecution, may
not think to make the Romaniſts uneaſy, in the Reign of the preſent King;
let us then weigh it, whether it be not the beſt Diſcretion, to ſecure them
of Eaſe in the next Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Objection brought for keeping up the</hi> Penal Laws <hi>is,</hi> That they
for whom Liberty is deſired, are Factious, and that it will ſtrengthen thoſe
who have always been for a Common-Wealth. <hi>Of what force this Objection
is, will be ſeen, if it be conſidered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Perſecution foments Faction, but Liberty wins over the <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,</hi>
if not, it lays him open, and will make every Body ready to be
his Executioner. Violence may have forced many to factious Practiſes, who
were not, nor would not chuſe be Factious, Oppreſſion making the wiſe
Man mad: Give Men Security in their worſhipping God, and you may
ſoon diſtinguiſh between Conſcience and Faction. It hath been well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that no Government is endangered by the People it ſeeks to preſerve:
Did not the Church, by Rigour and Severity in time paſt, drive many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
from their Native Country, and force thoſe who remained, to
ſhelter themſelves under the Enemies of the Crown? I juſtify not the
Practice, nor can the Fact be denyed: The King is at this Day, by his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Grace &amp; Tenderneſs to Conſciences become Maſter of the Hearts,
and by conſequence of the Lives and Eſtates of his diſſenting Subjects.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the next place take the liberty of offering ſome things to the
Conſideration of all our Country-men, both of ſuch as are Members of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>1. The Gentlemen of the eſtabliſhed Church may pleaſe to remember,
that their Church, when brought under, pleaded for Liberty, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accepted it from the late Uſurpers; ſurely then, they will, or ought
to deport themſelves decently in this Juncture, to their lawful Soveraign
(differing from them in Religion) and not cenſure, or repine at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to make all his People eaſy, when that ſame Clemency of the
Kings, ſecures them in their Religion, with the comfortable Addition of
their large Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>Let them conſider their antient Loyalty (interwoven with their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion)
and approve themſelves (againſt thoſe, who begin to accuſe them
of turning upon the Government) what they have always boaſted, unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably
Loyal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60242:4"/>
Shall the Fanaticks with alacrity come into the King's Intereſt, and
will the Church of <hi>England</hi> appear ſullen, ſoure and averſe thereto? I
am confident ſhe will not: To clear up my meaning herein, let me tell you,
I take not the Clergy to conſtitute the Church of <hi>England:</hi> No, not in
conjunction with ſome cloudy, moroſe &amp; ambitious great Men, who ſeem at
this Day to abet their Diſcontents, but the People who joyn in her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
will be found to be the beſt, &amp; by far the greateſt part of that Church.</p>
            <p>The Eccleſiaſticks and ſome of their deſigning Adherents, are indeed
angry, and why? Becauſe his Majeſty reſolves they ſhall not confound
their Neighbours: But did you ever obſerve a violent perſecuting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
to enjoy the Hearts of the People who lent him their Ears? You
may remember, that in our late highly conteſted Elections of Parliament
Men, we ſaw in many parts of the Kingdom the rigid, ſiery Parſon
abandoned his by Flock, and galloping to give his ſingle Voice, which
was all that he and his Horſe could bring in; the Pariſh certainly falling
in with the Side which he oppoſed, and why? Becauſe deteſting his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Principles, they could not be diſpoſed to eſteem him a good Man
for whom their Miniſter voted. May this go for ſome ſort of meaſure of
the Churches Intereſt? I think we cannot readily have a better, than
that of the Freedom of voting in Elections, how miſerably then will that
Intereſt be found to dwindle, when the Clergy ſhall come ſtript of the
Advantage of compelling Men into it, by making uſe of the Kings Name
(to that they were formerly owing their Succeſs where they found it,
and not to the Eſteem they had with their own Members.) I have heard
ſome compute, that not above one <hi>5th</hi> or <hi>6th.</hi> part of the known World
is Chriſtian: It will be found that his Majeſties Intereſt in his People,
vaſtly excels that of the Clergies, and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the
Point now diſcuſſed, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> will not be found to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
ſuch a part of the Nation, as the Chriſtians make of the World.</p>
            <p>Would our Militant Church-men but put on Temper, and ſequeſter ſo
much Time, as to weigh with calmneſs and deliberation, the Opinions of
the moſt eminent Divines of their Church, in the Point of Impoſition,
they would be found no Friends to Perſecution. Reverend Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi>
late Biſhop of <hi>Downe,</hi> thus expreſſed himſelf for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> viz,
<hi>I do earneſtly contend, that another Mans Opinion ſhall be no Rule to mine, and
that my Opinion ſhall be no Snare or Prejudice to my ſelf.</hi> In another place that
learned Man proceeds thus; <hi>It is a part of Chriſtian Religion, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Mens Conſciences ſhould be preſerved in all things, where God hath not
ſet a Limit.</hi> And further—<hi>The ſame Meekeſs and Charity ſhould be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in propagating Chriſtianity, which was in its firſt Publication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Reverend and Learned Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet did once apprehend the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60242:5"/>
               <hi>Miſchief of</hi> Impoſition, <hi>when he declared his Opinion to be,</hi> That Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to any ſuſpected Practiſe, required by any Church Governor, as the
Condition of her Communion, was lawful, if the thing ſo required, was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unwarrantable by a Mans own Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I have been told and doubt not the Truth thereof, that a late Reverend
Prelate, Dr. <hi>Brownrig</hi> (who lived to ſee the Reſtoration of his late
Majeſty, and of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſecured, tho' not actually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed)
did upon his Death-Bed lament the impoſing preſecuting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which he foreſaw would return with the Church: And I think I
have good ground to ſay, that at a late Conference between a Biſhop
(whoſe Health is drank throughout the Kingdom) and ſome of his
Clergy of great note, a dignified Doctor of eminent Learning, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of Spirit, did very freely declare, <hi>That he thought the Church was
under Gods Diſpleaſure for her Severity to Diſſenters,</hi> and that thereupon
the Biſhop lamented that he ever had his Hand in that Work, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that ſhould he be reſtored to Power, he would uſe it better than
he had done: I wiſh all the Clergymen then preſent and throughout the
Kingdom, were ſo reſolved, and would ſhew themſelves for Peace, by
throwing away their Weapons of War.</p>
            <p>2. I propoſe to the Conſideration of Diſſenters, and that of every
Denomination, that as when a Town is on Fire every Man (without
any great Regard to what Intimacy or Diſtance hath been amongſt
Neighbours) doth his beſt to extinguiſh the devouring Flames, ſo that
they would with unanimity joyn in this common Cauſe, of removing,
and that for ever, the undiſtinguiſhing Inſtruments of Miſchief, the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Statutes:</hi> They do equally extend to all, and may by turns reach e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Diſſenter. Hath not the Church of <hi>England</hi> perſiſted to exerciſe
her Severities upon all Diſſenters within her reach, even in the preſent
Reign? Are the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> (tho ſheltered by the Kings Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
willing to deliver other <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with themſelves from thoſe deſtroying Laws, and to ſecure them, from what hath been of ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
an Aſpect in <hi>Popery, Perſecution?</hi> And will they refuſe to be
unſhakled? I cannot imagine they ſhould, eſpecially when I obſerve
amongſt them ſuch <hi>a univerſal Serenity</hi> ſince his Majeſties Declaration.
They owe their Eaſe to the Kings Princely <hi>Clemency,</hi> he invites them
out of <hi>Slavery;</hi> if they will, their <hi>Liberty</hi> may be eſtabliſhed; his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
is reſolved to do that which the <hi>Church</hi> never would when ſhe had
Power, nor can we think ſhe would now, if it be true that ſhe accoſts
the King with heat againſt it: Let then all Diſſenters ſee their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt, to approach the King with Duty and Affection, and to
evidence their Affection, by cloſing with the happy Opportunity which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60242:5"/>
now offers, of ſetting themſelves free by Law, ſeeing his Majeſty calls
them to it: But,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fanaticks</hi> are told by <hi>Church-Men,</hi> That it is not now either
<hi>ſeaſonable or ſafe</hi> (I doubt in their Opinion it never will) and they
promiſe that <hi>they will do the Work.</hi> Affliction is the beſt School, and I
do hope the Fanaticks have learn'd therein better, than to be tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
withal, and decoy'd into an Oppoſition to his Majeſties ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Diſpoſition: They know the <hi>King</hi> never broke his Word, that the
<hi>Church</hi> hath, and that with them in this very Point of <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I appeal herein to the Memories of ſome Men of Note now living, who
were of ſo clear Credit, and ſo great Reputation in the Houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
(tho Diſſenters)</hi> that without their Concurrence, an <hi>Addreſs</hi>
had not been obtained for the recalling the late King's <hi>Declaration of
Indulgence,</hi> which for the time made the Kingdom happy; it muſt be
acknowledged by theſe honeſt well meaning <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that they were
wheedled and cheated of that Indulgence, by the fair <hi>Promiſes and Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes</hi>
of ſome, who are now alſo living, and attempting to play that
Game over again: I conclude therefore, with difference to their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that they are not to be again truſted.</p>
            <p>To provoke <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to avoid the Rock, and gain a ſafe Harbour,
I ſhall remind them (tho' I would not have it remembered for <hi>Vengeance,</hi>
but for <hi>Prevention</hi> ſake) what and how they have ſuffered by the <hi>Penal
Laws,</hi> which ſome ſo highly ſtruggle to keep up. How many Families
have we ſeen ruined, by the vexation of <hi>Citations,</hi> and what quickly
followed, <hi>Excommunications,</hi> in the Courts <hi>Eccleſiaſtick:</hi> The Lawyers
ſay that Excommunication is a Diſability to ſue for Debts, and many
honeſt Men have found that wicked Advantage made thereof; I know
the Name of a <hi>Clergy-Man,</hi> who to ſupply his Occaſions, borrowed
Money of a Neighbour, a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> and to defraud him of the Money
<hi>(inſtead of Payment)</hi> pleaded that his Creditor <hi>ſtood excommunicate:</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note>
A more ſevere Step of thoſe Courts was, the burying the Diſſenter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
in a Goal by a Writ <hi>de Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> from which there
was no Redemption, but at the Price of his <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Indeed where
Men had money, and would farm their Liberty <hi>(not of Conſcience but)</hi>
from Priſon, I have ſeen the tender hearted Gentlemen of <hi>Doctors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
(ſince the Death of his late Majeſty)</hi> for Fifteen or Twenty Pound
paid, half yearly, to reſpit the claping up of an induſtrious man, and they
have permitted him, <hi>till the next Rent Day,</hi> to work for his Family.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have been Tenants to <hi>under Sheriffs, Clerks
of the Peace, Town Clerks, Apparitors, Bailiffs,</hi> &amp;c. Is too well known<note place="margin">☜</note>
throughout the Kingdom, the firſt came but twice a year, the others
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60242:6"/>
quarterly or monthly. If theſe <hi>Devourers</hi> left any thing, the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
followed, and very often ſwept all, and ſometimes ſtock'd a <hi>Juſtices</hi>
Houſe or Farm with Beds, Horſes, Cowes, or what elſe the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
wanted, and that at <hi>very reaſonable Rates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are there not alſo, <hi>to make the Diſſenter compleatly miſerable,</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning,
Baniſhing, murdering Laws? To them, what can the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Cruelty it ſelf add? Have we not, with regret beheld the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of theſe Laws? It may poſſibly be ſaid that none have been
<hi>hanged for Nonconformity,</hi> if ſo, we may ſay, thanks to <hi>the Kings</hi>
Mercy, for reſtraining the <hi>Churches fooliſh Rage,</hi> but 'tis not a ſmall
number both of <hi>Miniſters</hi> and others, whoſe Lives have been deſtroyed
by lingering pining Deaths in noiſom <hi>Goals and Dungeons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay the rigorous Execution of theſe too rigid Laws, did not ſuffice,
we have known many <hi>Informers</hi> ſwear by gueſs, and very faſly, and
the <hi>Perjured</hi> protected and rewarded, of which take an Inſtance: An
<hi>Informer (by Trade a Tinker)</hi> having manifeſtly perjured himſelf in
ſwearing againſt an honeſt <hi>Gentleman</hi> upon the Conventicle Act, and
being indicted for the Perjury, the <hi>Proſecutor</hi> was hurried by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
of the <hi>Informers Patron,</hi> into no leſs Priſon than the Tower
of <hi>London,</hi> and there cloſely detain'd: The <hi>Villain</hi> was rewarded with
a place worth Twenty Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> and ſtill enjoys it. But why
ſhould I argue with Diſſenters from particular Inſtances, to make them
out of Love with their <hi>Shackles,</hi> when 'tis evident the whole Kingdom
groans under, and would gladly throw off the Burthen of theſe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
bloody Laws.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore take my Leave of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with the Story of the
<hi>Jews</hi> in good <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s time. He being informed of the very deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Caſe, of thoſe who were left of the Captivity, made an <hi>Addreſs</hi>
to the King, repreſenting the ſad State of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and petitioned for
Leave to rebuild it: The King (who was the great <hi>Artaxerxes)</hi> gave
a gracious Anſwer, and not only permitted it, but contributed to the
Work; and <hi>Nehemiah (to the Grief of Courtiers)</hi> went cheerfully
about it. <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> (men of great Power under the King)
appeared grieved that there was come a man to ſeek the Welfare of
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> however <hi>Nehemiah</hi> invited the <hi>Jews</hi> to build the Wall, and they
came unanimouſly and cheerfully into the Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> having drawn into their Faction, <hi>Geſhem</hi> an
<hi>Arabian,</hi> laughed the <hi>Jews</hi> to Scorn, and termed the Work <hi>Rebellion</hi>
againſt the King. <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> knowing that God would proſper him, <hi>(man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
Oppoſition)</hi> proceeded to build, and all the People aſſiſted, but <hi>the Nobles
contributed not to the Worke of the Lord, but held Correſpondance with the Enemy</hi>
Tobiah,<note place="margin">☞</note> and betrayed to him <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Counſels.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> that they might obſtruct the Work, reſolved to
fight the <hi>Jews:</hi> In this great Diſtreſs God fought for them, and brought
the Enemies Counſel to nought, and the <hi>Jews</hi> made up the Breaches in
the Wall: Then <hi>Sanballat</hi> and his Confederates, betook themſelves to
Flattery and Diſſimulation, and invited <hi>Nehemiah</hi> again and again to a
Conference, but he declines the Invitation, anſwering, that he was
doing a great Work, and would not leave it. Thereupon <hi>Sanballat
(still pretending Friendſhip)</hi> informed <hi>Nehemiah</hi> by Letter, That the
<hi>Heathen</hi> reported, and <hi>Geſhem</hi> ſaid it, that he and the <hi>Jews</hi> thought to
<hi>rebel,</hi> and to make <hi>Nehemiah</hi> King, and that this would be told the<note place="margin">☜</note>
King, and therefore <hi>Sanballat</hi> offered to Counſel him how to obviate this
heinous Charge. But <hi>Nehemiah (ſeeing the Snake in the Graſs)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to take Counſel of him, and anſwered <hi>Sanballat,</hi> that no ſuch things
were doing, and that he feigned the Accuſation out of his own Heart:
Then theſe Men of Miſchief, hire <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> to Propheſy <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s
Death, in caſe he did not withdraw: This Plot alſo failed; <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>

finiſhed, to the Enemies Confuſion, who perceived at length, that <hi>the
Work was of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have made the Hiſtory too long, the Application ſhall be ſhorter.
Has God put it into the King's Heart to pitty them, who are left of
