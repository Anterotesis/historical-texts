         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Praiſe of the Bovve and
Commendation of this Booke, written by
Thomas Churchyard Gent.</head>
            <l>IN forraine land and natiue ſoyle, where ſoldiars I haue ſeen:</l>
            <l>And chefly in the martial dais (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> youth was freſh &amp; green)</l>
            <l>I haue beheld both Bow &amp; ſhot, the Bow for Archers meet:</l>
            <l>The ſhot for vſe of powlders force, and lads of liuely ſpreet.</l>
            <l>And iudging by experience great, in place where both were tried:</l>
            <l>I found where ſhot was graunted good, the Bow was not denied.</l>
            <l>Firſt ere we found out ſhot aright, the Bow great battels won:</l>
            <l>And long the Bow great glory gate, before we knew the Gun.</l>
            <l>As lo this Booke doth mention make, &amp; ſhewes in verſes good:</l>
            <l>For murthering ſhot came in of late, when <hi>Bovv</hi> in honor ſtood.</l>
            <l>In elders daies when manhode ſhone, as bright as blaſing ſtarre,</l>
            <l>And chriſtian hart and noble mind, diſdaind this turkiſh warre.</l>
            <l>The Bow was vſed as force of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of arms might draw</l>
            <l>To glad the frend and daunt the foe, and hold the world in awe.</l>
            <l>But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and courage fail'd, and cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning crept in place</l>
            <l>The ſhot and roring Canon came, ſtout people to deface.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:338:5"/>
The Bow not fit for cowards hand, for cowards ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth doth faile:</l>
            <l>VVhen man drawes arrow to the head, and then doth foe aſſaile.</l>
            <l>with ſword and dagger Lion-like, that bends both brow and taile</l>
            <l>And grins and gapes with gnaſhing teeth, to make his enemy quail</l>
            <l>The ſhot lies lurking in a hole, and ſpies aduantage great:</l>
            <l>Then bullet, match, and powders force, do work a wicked feate.</l>
            <l>The Archer ſhowes a manly face, in field and euery where:</l>
            <l>And when his arrowes all are ſpent, he dies with courage there.</l>
            <l>The ſhot no ſooner all diſcharg'd, but legs for life muſt ſhift:</l>
            <l>Theſe bold and venterous nimble boyes, can find no further drift.</l>
            <l>But geue the charging horſmen place, the Archers do not ſo:</l>
            <l>For foure and twenty headed ſhafts, belongs to euery <hi>Bow.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And ſurely ſhoote the Archers may, at many a thing ye know.</l>
            <l>When men in broyles and battailes doubt, how warres and world
wil goe.</l>
            <l>There is a knight a ſoldiar great, in court doth white ſtaffe beare:</l>
            <l>That knowes what Bowes haue done in field, againſt both ſhielde
and ſpeare.</l>
            <l>Yea many more are yet aliue, that honours <hi>Bovv</hi> indeed:</l>
            <l>And can record what noble actes the Bow hath done at need.</l>
            <l>I ſaw in ſundry ſoyles my ſelfe, much ſhot diſcharg'd in vaine:</l>
            <l>Yet grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we muſt that through the ſame are thouſands daily ſlain</l>
            <l>But enterlard the ſhot with Bow, and tel me then your mind:</l>
            <l>A gallant courſe of wars vnknown, in field then ſhal you finde.</l>
            <l>Fiue thouſand Bowes that ſhooteth ſtill, in Battel may do good:</l>
            <l>They gall the horſe, or kill the man, or draw ſome deſperate blood.</l>
            <l>And thick as moates in ayer they flee, which hinder much the ſight</l>
            <l>And haply makes when horſes is hurt, the mounted man alight.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:338:6"/>
VVel, ſpeak of ſhot what beſt you may, the <hi>Bovv</hi> is braue in field:</l>
            <l>And ſure in ſkirmiſh Archers oft, makes f<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ble ſhot to yeelde.</l>
            <l>A rare deuiſe I will ſet out, to ſtrengthen Man and <hi>Bovv,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And when the plaine deuice thereof the world ſhall ſee and know.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Bovv</hi> ſhall come againe in fame, and win his wonted grace:</l>
            <l>Looke out of hand for my diſcourſe, til then come <hi>Bovv</hi> in place,</l>
            <l>And take thine Ancient, rowme &amp; vſe, as <hi>Arthures</hi> Knights thee gaue,</l>
            <l>Thou art a fearfull fore in field, and yet a paſtime braue.</l>
            <l>That brings vp youth, and pleaſures age, a noble thing in view</l>
            <l>An auncient arte, a worthy guiſe, that ſcornes all practiſe new.</l>

            <l>And to this Engliſh ſoyle of ours, wilt bring great fame at length.</l>

and Companie of the ſaide <hi>King Arthure.</hi> And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
euery Knight of this order was bound to rehearſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con

amplified the ſaid Round Table, whereby the nomber of

many young <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Lordes</hi> might come to more greate
