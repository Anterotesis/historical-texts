            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And some such Scatterings as these, I take to be the within mention'd Attacks of <hi>Roger Coke, Ludlow,</hi> &amp;c. upon our <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Martyr,</hi> with an impartial Account of whatever particular Charge they bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, blows quite off, as I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> will find to his Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>And this, I doubt not but that bold Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Milton's Life</hi> will likewise find, though he blusters mightily at present, and perhaps may think by that means to get off, yet the World is come to a very odd pass if he can so escape, who dares to recommend an <hi>Author,</hi> that once occasion'd several hours Debate in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he should not be Hang'd, and had some of his now admired <hi>Books</hi> order'd, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Burnt by the Hands of the <hi>Common Hangman.</hi> I say it must be a blessed Turn of Times we are now got into, that this Fellow's <hi>Works</hi> should be all Reprinted, and for fear of too little Mischief that way, have an Abridgment of the most poisonous Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges put all together in an Account of his <hi>Life,</hi> with many high <hi>Elogiums</hi> of his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Qualities,</hi> which so far as true, might as well have been said of the <hi>Devil,</hi> for so they equally abus'd, according to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Capacities, Great Parts, Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                  </p>
                  <p>Herein however the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Life</hi> acts like a <hi>Plain-dealer,</hi> confirms what we but suspected before, and expresly declares there must be a thorough Reform of the <hi>whole Government,</hi> which I presume this new <hi>Club</hi> is to undertake, according to some old <hi>Draughts</hi> of <hi>Milton,</hi> and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Projectors</hi> in 59. For though somewhat of the <hi>Dutch</hi> way is recommended, yet the main Composition of this new <hi>Eutopia</hi> is <hi>Harrington's Oceana.</hi> I have within ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, that when the <hi>Rump,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Safty,</hi> that is, the <hi>Army,</hi> were tearing one another, and the whole <hi>Nation</hi> in pieces; amongst other <hi>Projects,</hi> that <hi>Maggot</hi> of the <hi>Rota</hi> was set up, and a great Pudder it made, till with many others it was silenc'd by the <hi>Restauration</hi>; when the <hi>Author Harrington,</hi> as a dangerous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, was for some time secur'd in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and elsewhere; at length he obtain'd his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> to <hi>Travel,</hi> and being in <hi>Italy</hi> talk'd so much of <hi>Models, Commonwealths,</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> as that sober Nation reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him no better than a <hi>Whimsical crack-braind Person</hi>; and that he was so in the end, this is an abundant Confirmation, for returning home, and at Liberty to enjoy both

                  <p>But whencesoever it proceeds, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that amongst the several kinds of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent</hi> People, our Nation from time to time hath been <hi>plagu'd</hi> with all, there are none more Troublesome and Pernicious than our <hi>Government Menders,</hi> who will have it continually upon the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Hammering</hi> without the least Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of finishing their Work, or giving it over to more Skillful Hands, whereby every Man of Temper and Prudence cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
<pb facs="tcp:49784:5"/>
that this <hi>Itch of Alteration</hi> proceeds more from a <hi>hot Head,</hi> than <hi>sober Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and if such Pragmatical <hi>Intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> should be gratify'd in every <hi>Whim,</hi> their pregnant <hi>Brains</hi> abound with, the whole <hi>Body-politick</hi> will by degrees become so Monstrous as to have an <hi>Hanc populus</hi> affix'd. It would therefore argue much more Consideration to reflect, that as there are not two <hi>Governments</hi> in all <hi>Europe,</hi> nor any where else, exactly the same, but generally very different from each other; so we may justly presume such long continu'd <hi>Customs</hi> as they have always liv'd under, were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally adapted to the <hi>Temper</hi> of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> with other Circumstances of <hi>Situation, Converse, Traffick,</hi> &amp;c. and whatever is superinduc'd <hi>de novo</hi> must have some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity to those original <hi>Establishments,</hi> or will sit very uneasy, and give occasion both of continu'd Complaints, and frequent <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations.</hi> All good <hi>Patriots</hi> amongst us, who truly <hi>Study</hi> the Interest of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and make an impartial Iudgment of things, do heartily wish the Choice of our <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> might be regulated, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>Many</hi> which make it, as the Management of that <hi>Many</hi> in order thereto; they think likewise that the Disproportion of Beggerly <hi>Burroughs</hi> in the several Parts of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is not a little hard in the

Disproportion of <hi>Taxes,</hi> with not a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inconveniences, which, as wise Men, they rather think of, than attempt to alter, lest it should prove <hi>Tinkers</hi> Work, as the <hi>Proverb</hi> speaks, <hi>Essaying</hi> to mend one, cause more and worse <hi>Defects</hi>; for though the <hi>Dutch</hi> very cunningly got rid of all <hi>Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Elections,</hi> and perhaps thereto, more especially on their easy <hi>Administration</hi> ever since, yet I fancy our Grough <hi>English</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers would not be so easily wheedled, and which is worse, scarce find enough that will be Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in so great a <hi>Trust</hi>: To be sure when the <hi>Rump</hi> took upon them somewhat like that way of Managment, what <hi>Rogues</hi> did they prove? and how like <hi>Rogues</hi> did the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple use them in the End?</p>
                  <p>Here therefore I would turn the <hi>Tables</hi> with this bold <hi>Assumer,</hi> and be gladly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied how such vigorous <hi>Asserters</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's <hi>Liberty,</hi> as he and his <hi>Republican Fraternity</hi> are earnest to be thought, come so highly to recommend the <hi>Dutch Model</hi>? For that is a perfect <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> where the People pay as many <hi>Taxes</hi> as either in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Turky,</hi> and have as little to do in rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or <hi>Enacting</hi> any other <hi>Laws</hi> for their mutual Defence, and Welfare; And really I could wish this <hi>Rota Club</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd for some Months into those <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> that we might see whether they would be
<pb facs="tcp:49784:6"/>
so hardy as to Attack that <hi>Government</hi> with as much Boldness as they do this, abuse the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Press,</hi> by telling the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they are <hi>Bubled</hi> in thinking themselves <hi>a Free Commonwealth,</hi> whereas there is no such thing amongst them, both their <hi>Lives and Fortunes</hi> are at the disposal of a few Men, who <hi>Cabal</hi> together, <hi>Elect</hi> one another, and do what they please; I say should any of them dare to <hi>Prate</hi> or <hi>Print</hi> at this rate, as those in Power would soon hear thereof, so instead of sending them a pair of <hi>Shooes</hi> to trot out of their <hi>Territories,</hi> (which Report saith is done in some Cases) care would be forthwith taken to have them die in their own, a modest Expression some use for a Man's being <hi>Hang'd</hi>; and this, would we take notice of what is Solid and Useful, is the most Remarkable thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that they are exact <hi>Justicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> will not permit their <hi>Laws</hi> to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and <hi>Magistracy</hi> arraign'd by every Pragmatical <hi>Pretender,</hi> without such due <hi>Resentments</hi> as are absolutely requisite to support the <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Publick Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as amongst some other <hi>English Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> that of admiring <hi>Foreign Fashions,</hi> in their <hi>Vanities,</hi> rather than <hi>Virtues,</hi> hath been too justly charg'd upon us; so the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fashion for <hi>Government,</hi> hath had the
<pb facs="tcp:49784:7"/>
Vogue more than 60 Years, with our many <hi>Republican Innovators,</hi> when not one in 60 thousand of them understand any thing more of it, than to take Patterns from thence, for most Exorbitant <hi>Taxes,</hi> which our <hi>Madness</hi> alone, their <hi>Necessities,</hi> when once engag'd, made absolutely Requisite. Yes, the <hi>Licentiousness</hi> of the <hi>Press</hi> is another Branch of <hi>Dutch Liberty,</hi> for <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Fools</hi> to abuse all <hi>Honest Men,</hi> at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: I say in these two things alone we are become their <hi>sordid Imitators,</hi> without any thing of that <hi>Caution,</hi> and <hi>Terror,</hi> their vigorous <hi>Execution</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> enforce; whereas the same just <hi>Severity</hi> would secure our <hi>Old Constitutions,</hi> at a much cheaper Rate than any <hi>Foreign Freaks,</hi> which the more we attempt, the more we shall fail in, for to me it seems impossible; yet if we could be suppos'd to make so Extravagant an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, it would sit no better than a <hi>Boor's</hi> Suit, on a <hi>Courtiers</hi> Back, and be as disagreeing to the Temper, the genius of the <hi>Nation,</hi> as their <hi>Stockfish</hi> to our <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to prove by some other <hi>Authority</hi> than my own, that these assuming <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans,</hi> are not the Men they would be thought, have neither <hi>Bottom,</hi> nor <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>last</hi> proportionable to the <hi>Sail</hi> they <hi>bear</hi>; see no further into the <hi>Milstone</hi> than others,
<pb facs="tcp:49784:7"/>
perhaps as <hi>Superficially</hi> as any; I shall produce a Person who knew them thoroughly, had the most to do with them, and confirm'd to Matter of Fact the Account already given. Our <hi>Author Ludlow</hi> relates several Discourses between <hi>Cromwel</hi> and himself, with some brisk <hi>Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees</hi> which pass'd, wherein as he tells his own Story the other seems constantly to have brought him by the <hi>Lee,</hi> that is, gain'd his Point: What I shall at present relate to, is in <hi>Pag. 241,</hi> where <hi>Cromwel</hi> whilst he was cajoling, and betraying the <hi>King,</hi> gave great Enjealousments to his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Rebels,</hi> that he would make his own Peace, and leave them to their just <hi>Fate</hi>; but having accomplish'd that <hi>Hellish Treachery,</hi> got his <hi>Majesty</hi> into their <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Wight</hi> Toils; then as <hi>Ludlow</hi> tells us, <hi>he began to Complement the Commonwealth-Party, inviting some of them to confer with him at his Chamber; with which acquainting me the next time he came to the House, I took the Freedom to tell him, that he knew how to cajole and give them good Words when he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to make use of them; whereat breaking out into a Rage, he said, they were a proud sort of People, and only considerable in their own Conceits</hi>: Whether he spake this in a <hi>Rage</hi> is of little Concern, to be sure, as seldom as he spake <hi>Truth,</hi> this was a certain <hi>Truth</hi> he spake, and effectually confirm'd, in the many <hi>Contrasts</hi> he had with them, and <hi>Baffles</hi> he gave them; and <hi>Ludlow</hi>'s Reply is very faint, for that he only <hi>hop'd it was not yet their Case,</hi> whereas all others knew it actually to be so, since they lay under a <hi>total defection from
<pb facs="tcp:49784:8"/>
Honesty, Generosity, and all true Virtue</hi>: However therefore they may wheedle others into better Thoughts; I shall stick to <hi>Cromwel's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> which is a strong Confirmation of my former Opinion, <hi>that they are a proud sort of People, only valuable in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Confirmation whereof, I shall add but this one Instance farther, in Relation to the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry fanciful <hi>Hypotheses</hi> they every Day start, to support their <hi>Politick Novels</hi>; wherein a strange Force is put upon all those <hi>Natural Obligations,</hi> and <hi>Regular Dependencies,</hi> which were formerly thought the main Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all <hi>Humane Societies</hi>; such uncooth <hi>States</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> such <hi>Origins</hi> of <hi>Political Societies,</hi> and <hi>Subordination</hi> of <hi>Commonwealth-Powers,</hi> as make <hi>Parents</hi> their <hi>Childrens</hi> Servants, and <hi>Magistrates</hi> their <hi>Peoples</hi> Slaves; and all this with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little regard to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> which being set aside, or brought in on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to serve at a hard Push, a Man may as well write a <hi>Romance,</hi> and swear it a true <hi>History,</hi> as resolve how <hi>Mankind</hi> came upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> and what Measures they took upon their first meeting there.</p>
                  <p>Neither is their Deference to the <hi>Creation,</hi> less than to the <hi>Creator,</hi> not that they disown the <hi>Existence</hi> of an Infinite <hi>Being,</hi> or can imagin this admired <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the <hi>Universe</hi> should be any other way than from an <hi>Almighty Power,</hi> (for most of the <hi>Atheists</hi> have lately thought of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to <hi>Deism,</hi> as a more tenable <hi>Fort</hi>) but then they allow this <hi>Almighty Power</hi> very little share
<pb facs="tcp:49784:8"/>
in the Governing Part; Man being some how or other plac'd here, is suppos'd solely to act upon a Principle of <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Self-preservation,</hi> without any regard to those <hi>Divine Impresses</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil, Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> which many old <hi>Pedants,</hi> even amongst the Antient <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> conceiv'd as natural to the Soul of Man as Thought, and of so strong an Obligation, that the Guilt of violating, <hi>ipso facto</hi> inflicted Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a just dread of the great <hi>Avenger</hi>: Thus as <hi>Preservation</hi> was truly stil'd a continu'd <hi>Creation</hi>; was <hi>Providence</hi> by the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son presum'd to interpose in all humane <hi>Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; to speak upon a <hi>Philosophical,</hi> not <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> Account, <hi>disappoint the Devices of the Crafty, turn all their Wisdom into Madness and Folly</hi>; and how can any Man imagin a more rational <hi>Supposition</hi>? than that he who made should <hi>Govern</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> continue <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Monarch, Sovereign</hi> over all; and whenever any of our Undertakings clash with, or otherwise thwart the <hi>Eternal Purposes</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> how troublesom do they prove in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement? and fatal in the End? So that howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver plausible their <hi>Speculations</hi> may seem, and whatever <hi>Success</hi> attends their first Attempts; I dare Conclude with this as an infallible <hi>Truth, There can be no lasting and happy Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without some moral Assurance of the Almighty's Approbation and Blessing.</hi>

that in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 43, the <hi>King</hi> assembled at <hi>Oxon</hi> a greater Number of <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> then sat at <hi>Westminster,</hi> although the latter supply'd themselves with a sort of Cattle call'd <hi>Recruiters,</hi> from such <hi>Corporations</hi> and <hi>Burroughs,</hi> as were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their <hi>Quarters,</hi> where they might be sure of confiding Men, who would not fail to carry on the Work as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>

                     <p>To come therefore more calmly to the <hi>Question</hi>: As it must be granted on the one Side, there can be no such thing as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>State</hi> to be found in this World, so must it be acknowledged on the other, <hi>optimus ille qui minimis urgetur,</hi> even in this Sense, that is best which has fewest Inconveniencies; for as <hi>Grotius</hi> applies that of the old <hi>Comedian: Aut haec cum il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis sunt habenda, aut illa cum his mittenda sunt,</hi> the bad must be born with, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the greater good we should otherwise go without; and proceeding according to this Method, whether we consider them in <hi>Thesi</hi> or <hi>Hypothesi,</hi> the <hi>Ballance</hi> will certainly turn on <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>'s

Side: For first, in <hi>Thesi,</hi> that hath ever had the Preference with all Men of sober Sense and quiet <hi>Principles</hi>; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the many <hi>Harangues,</hi> and few <hi>Instances,</hi> the contrary <hi>Party</hi> are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to bring, no <hi>Monarch</hi> can be look'd upon, but as oblig'd not only in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> but <hi>Interest</hi> likewise, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the Wellfare of his <hi>Subjects</hi> as much as a Father of a Family that of his <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and hath the same Inducement to keep and leave it in good Order to his <hi>Heir</hi> or <hi>Successor,</hi> as a <hi>Husbandman</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that <hi>Farm</hi> which he is sure shall descend to his <hi>Posterity.</hi> And thus it hath generally been all the World over, and in all Ages, where a <hi>Kingdom</hi> was look'd upon no otherwise than a larger <hi>Family</hi> (from whence at first they all came) and the <hi>Master</hi> thereof, as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Patriae,</hi> the common <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi>; and when otherwise, the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> have been oftner to blame than the <hi>Parent,</hi> though when the Breach was once made, nothing could be more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral than for both Sides to run into <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.</hi> Farther yet, we should consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, all earthly <hi>Powers,</hi> and every <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual</hi> under them, are <hi>subordinate</hi> to the <hi>Almighty Sovereign</hi> of the <hi>Universe,</hi> who in a secret and wonderful manner, <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates</hi>

and <hi>controuls</hi> all <hi>humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,</hi> according to the infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> of his own unsearchable <hi>Will</hi>; and when provok'd to high Displeasure by some <hi>enormous National Crimes,</hi> hath been then observ'd more especially to interpose, and give a <hi>People</hi> over to such cursed <hi>Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations</hi> as to violate all Rules of <hi>common Discretion,</hi> as well as <hi>Duty,</hi> and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their own <hi>Ruin</hi>; whereof farther on, we may have too sad Occasion to make <hi>Application.</hi> And however, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the End of the last <hi>Century,</hi> and Beginning of this, several Parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> were mad upon this <hi>Republican</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and many amongst us are so fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish as still to continue the <hi>Freak</hi>; yet I have sometimes thought with my self, from the few Instances we have in <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of this kind of <hi>Government</hi>; and them them that were, mostly founded upon the Ruin of <hi>Monarchies</hi>; continued all the Time of their being in perpetual <hi>Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Convulsions of State,</hi> till at last they resolv'd into a <hi>Monarchy</hi> again. This I say, hath made me think, that they all took their Beginning from the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Displeasure of the <hi>Almighty</hi>; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting that <hi>Oeconomy</hi> wherein he had plac'd the <hi>World,</hi> and maugre all their Conceits and Oppositions, would have it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49784:26"/>
so continue: For the <hi>Great King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is <hi>jealous,</hi> both of his <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi>; and when a few fancyful <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellists</hi> will dare to set up the <hi>Right</hi> of their <hi>Sovereign Lords the People,</hi> in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to his <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>eternal Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishments,</hi> the Decision may be easily foreseen, if with <hi>Reverence</hi> duly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; his infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> so wonderfully operating, and in so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret a manner upon their hard and <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Hearts,</hi> as to make themselves the <hi>Instruments</hi> of his <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Vengeance.</hi> And from the same <hi>Power</hi> and secret Will it is, that the <hi>Parties</hi> themselves are so little sensible of the <hi>Iudgment,</hi> as to maintain their <hi>Opinion</hi> with more Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness than ever, and so may continue without <hi>Controul</hi>; for, having, withal the Command of <hi>Legions,</hi> no wise <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> will dare to <hi>dispute</hi> his best against them. However, <hi>God is not mocked,</hi> and so they will find at last.</p>
                     <p>But then, <hi>secondly,</hi> If we consider this in <hi>Hypothesi,</hi> and bring it home to our own <hi>Case,</hi> we shall find a very <hi>black</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for after all their <hi>Noise</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,</hi> the little Finger of this <hi>Upstart Commonwealth,</hi> prov'd heavier to the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> than the <hi>Loyns</hi> of the most rigid <hi>Monarch</hi> that ever sate upon the Throne:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49784:26"/>
Nay, 'tis farther certain, by most <hi>dear bought Experience,</hi> that there was more <hi>Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power,</hi> and <hi>illegal Commitments exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Taxes, Rapine</hi> and <hi>Plunder; Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations</hi> and <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> with whatever else could be most Unjust and <hi>Tyrannical</hi>; voted, and put in practice during the twenty Years <hi>Usurpation</hi> of the several <hi>Iunto's,</hi> than by all the <hi>Crowned Heads</hi>; ay, and their <hi>Favorites</hi> too (to take off all Allegations of that kind) since the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi>; I might add, since the <hi>Creation</hi>; did our <hi>Histories</hi> reach so far. 'Tis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly express'd by our <hi>Author,</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their other Helps, the Charge at <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land</hi> was so great, as they were forc'd to lay a <hi>Land-Tax</hi> of 120000 <hi>l. per Mensem:</hi> Which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, if we may believe him, the <hi>People</hi> pay'd very freely. Now let us examin a little what these other Helps were: They had <hi>seiz'd,</hi> not only upon all the <hi>Crown,</hi> but <hi>Church-Lands</hi>; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spos'd of them at Pleasure: They had the <hi>free Contributions</hi> of the <hi>City Dames,</hi> and all others well affected, as far as their <hi>Quarters</hi> extended, even to the <hi>poor Country Wenches Bodkins and Thymbles.</hi> They had the <hi>Sequestration</hi> of all the <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi>; whose <hi>Estates</hi> they dispos'd of amongst themselves, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49784:27"/>
several 1000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> They had rais'd the <hi>Customs</hi> much higher than ever they were in the <hi>King</hi>'s Time: And in humble Imitation of their <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> retrench'd the Excesses of <hi>Good Fellowship,</hi> by an Excise; which the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was never acquainted withal before, and now must never be without.</p>
                     <p>Besides 25<hi>th Parts, Decimations</hi>; with <hi>numberless</hi> other Ways of squeezing the <hi>People,</hi> who notwithstanding must think all too little for that <hi>happy Liberty</hi> this <hi>Free State</hi> had brought them into. One thing farther I must observe, in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Land-Tax</hi>; that as it was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected according to the <hi>Lunary,</hi> or as the Term then went, <hi>Military</hi> Months; so they would not rest there, but were so good at <hi>Multiplication,</hi> as to repeat that Monthly <hi>Assessment</hi> sixteen or seventeen times in a Year: Whereas the <hi>Sum,</hi> which two or three of these <hi>Months</hi> amounted to, was as much as was ever given to, or expected by any <hi>King</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and would have made <hi>Charles</hi> I. the happyest <hi>Prince,</hi> and continued us the easiest <hi>People under</hi> Heaven. Can we be pityed to have it brought to more <hi>Millions</hi> than that made 100000 <hi>ls.</hi> and a <hi>Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of continuing the same? So fatal a thing it is, not to take the <hi>Wise Man</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49784:27"/>
but instead of that <hi>Fear to God,</hi> and <hi>Honour to the King,</hi> which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, be <hi>medling with such as are given to change,</hi> the most troublesome <hi>Generation</hi> of Men any <hi>Nation</hi> was ever plagu'd withal; for whatever <hi>Improvements</hi> our <hi>Royal Societies</hi> may make as to <hi>Natural Knowledg; Oso's</hi> in <hi>Politicks,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> are most intollerable; their <hi>Chymical Heads</hi> will never forbear trying <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> till both <hi>evaporate</hi> in <hi>Smoak</hi> and <hi>Confusion.</hi> Had Sir <hi>W.

<q>Those who make any Enquiry into <hi>King Iames's Reign,</hi> will find, that tho his Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were strongly bent to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>Absolute,</hi> yet he chose rather to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on that Design by Fraud than Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: But <hi>King Charles</hi> having taken a nearer View of <hi>Despotick Government,</hi> in his <hi>Iourny</hi> to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; tempted with the glittering Shew, and imaginary Pleasures of that empty <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry</hi>; Immediately after his Ascent to the <hi>Throne,</hi> pull'd off the <hi>Mask,</hi> and openly discovered his Intentions to make the <hi>Crown absolute</hi> and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>

                        </q>
                        <hi>Audacter Calumniari</hi> goes a great way in any bad <hi>Cause:</hi> To be sure this <hi>Calumny</hi> hath been so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently urg'd, so constantly inculcated, as several worthy <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> otherwise well affected to <hi>Monarchy</hi> in general, as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49784:28"/>
well as the Memory of those two <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> are yet prone to suspect they might have some <hi>Inclinations</hi> that way; and for their Satisfaction more especially it is I give them and my self this Trouble. To shew therefore how little Ground there was or is for this Suspicion: <hi>King Iames</hi> call'd <hi>Parliaments</hi> as often as any <hi>Prince</hi> ever did, and courted them as much, perhaps more than was requisite, considering the Temper they were of: And so did his <hi>Son</hi> at first, as <hi>Ludlow</hi> owns. 'Tis <hi>true, he call'd some in the first Years of his Reign:</hi> But then makes this malicious <hi>Reflection; The People soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd he did it rather to empty their Purses, than redress their Grievances.</hi> The Truth of it is, there was such a Spirit of <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> got abroad, such ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Suspicions</hi> and <hi>Distrusts</hi> every where, not only <hi>whisper'd,</hi> but openly <hi>proclaim'd</hi> throughout the <hi>Nation</hi>; as 'tis equally unaccountable how Men should have the Confidence to <hi>forge</hi> such gross <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> suffer themselves to be so absurdly impos'd upon: Altho, as to this latter, nothing can seem incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to such as observ'd, what a Fright the whole <hi>Nation</hi> was abus'd into the other Day, as if between <hi>two</hi> and <hi>three thousand Irish</hi> (for that was their utmost
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49784:29"/>
Number, could fire all their <hi>Habitations,</hi> and cut all their <hi>Throats.</hi> Yet by such Artifices as these, altogether as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and improbable, the <hi>People</hi> were kept up in a continual Ferment, so foolishly <hi>prejudic'd,</hi> and so freakishly <hi>peevish,</hi> as no Reason could be heard, nor Truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon them; whereunto both the foremention'd <hi>Kings</hi> were too forward to appeal, and too condescending in giving an Account of themselves and Actions, by frequent <hi>Proclamations, Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c. considering they had to do with the most <hi>petulant, malicious Generation</hi> ever any <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Climate</hi> produc'd.</p>
                     <p>As to the present Charge of affecting <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> I cannot but remark in the first place, the different Method these two <hi>Kings</hi> are suppos'd to propound, in order to bring about the same, <hi>King Iames</hi> by <hi>Fraud,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> by <hi>Force.</hi> As to the former, whatever <hi>King-Craft</hi> he pretended to, every discerning Eye hath all along discovered him to be the most open easie <hi>Prince</hi> this Nation ever had; studied nothing but his <hi>People</hi>'s Peace, and therein his own Quiet, the Enjoyment of himself. Such a bold, I may say, desperate Undertaking, must have a <hi>Prince</hi> that is <hi>active, daring,</hi> and <hi>resolute</hi>; of a <hi>subtile Head,</hi> and <hi>hollow
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49784:29"/>
Heart</hi>; understanding all the Arts of <hi>Dissimulation</hi> and <hi>Wheadle,</hi> so as to fool the <hi>People</hi> out of their Mony, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with maintain an <hi>Army</hi> to support his <hi>Usurpation</hi>; with many such like bad <hi>Qualities</hi>; as opposite to <hi>King Iames</hi>'s Temper and <hi>Genius,</hi> as one <hi>Pole</hi> to the other: For to speak freely, he laboured under the contrary Extream, wanted <hi>Courage</hi> to exert his <hi>just Rights,</hi> stoop'd <hi>Majesty</hi> too low, would expostulate and reason where he ought to have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which blind Side, the <hi>Faction,</hi> in his several <hi>Parliaments,</hi> once finding out, grew <hi>wresty</hi> thereupon, would neither <hi>lead</hi> nor <hi>drive</hi> but their own <hi>Pace</hi> and <hi>Way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What I remark in the <hi>second</hi> Place, is the Inducement our <hi>Author</hi> assigns of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s attempting the same by <hi>Violence</hi>; the <hi>nearer View of a Despotick Power in his Iourny to</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain. What will not a <hi>Republican's Rebel</hi> Spite catch hold of? His <hi>Iourny</hi> was not in, but thorough <hi>France,</hi> which he consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in ten or twelve Days, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Post,</hi> had great Opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken with <hi>Glittering Shews,</hi> and <hi>Imaginary Pleasures,</hi> &amp;c. And his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in <hi>Spain</hi> was of another Nature, and took up so much Time, as he had little Leisure to make <hi>Observations,</hi> and less
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49784:30"/>
Reason to be enamour'd with any thing there observ'd; to be sure, upon Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he could not but find, that the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Courts,</hi> or <hi>Councils</hi> there, have as great a Restraint upon the <hi>Crown,</hi> as our <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> have here; though they are a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber wise <hi>Nation,</hi> and seldom or never found to extend their <hi>Privileges</hi> beyond <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> I shall not reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Prudence and Policy</hi> of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; only observe it was hard for a young Amorous Prince to attend the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Delays of old Statesmen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with having been so long kept in Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, this Adventure was thought the only Expedient for a final Issue: Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enough, which notwithstanding he manag'd so dexterously, as to weather all <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and come off with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> contrary to the Expectation of the whole World.

                        <hi>The Prince, for his part, had gain'd an universal Love, and was reported by all, to be a truly noble, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, well deserving Prince.

as a <hi>Ducquoy</hi> to get him into the <hi>Tower</hi>; and then, instead of proving their <hi>Articles,</hi> would have proceeded by <hi>Bill of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and voted it <hi>accumulative Treason,</hi> as we know it was afterwards most barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously done in the <hi>Earl of Strafford's Case.</hi> In the mean while commend me to any Man, or Body of Men, who can have the Confidence to declaim against <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power,</hi> and yet proceed upon <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame</hi> (which was ever thought hard, and therefore discontinued both in <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon Law,</hi> where for some time it took place) especially in an Age, where <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Slander</hi> were so scandalously rise, as no honest Man could escape the <hi>devouring Words of their false Tongues.</hi> Methinks such a Proceedure as this, has some Affinity with that <hi>old Land Story</hi> of the <hi>Cook</hi> serving his <hi>Dog,</hi> who said he would not hang him, only give him an <hi>ill Name</hi>; and thereupon threw him into the Street, and cry'd, a <hi>Mad Dog</hi>; which made all the <hi>Rabble</hi> of two, as well as four legg'd <hi>Curs,</hi> fall upon, and worry him to Death.

                     <p>We shall have Occasion hereafter to observe what pass'd between this and the next Parliament, which was <hi>March</hi> 17<hi>th</hi> 1627. when his Majesty, at their first <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling,</hi> plainly told them, <hi>That if his present calling them together did not answer the Quality of his Occasions, they did not their Duties, and he must rest content in the Conscience of doing his, and take other Courses for which God had impower'd him, to save that which the Folly of particular
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49784:34"/>
Men might hazzard to lose:</hi> Hereupon they fell into long and tedious Debates, whether a <hi>Supply</hi> or <hi>Grievances</hi> should first take place: At length the former had the Preference out of <hi>Complement,</hi> though last consummated; for that Vote was no sooner pass'd, but the <hi>People's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> must immediately be consider'd, which produc'd the so much celebrated <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> wherein the <hi>King</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd them to every <hi>Punctilio</hi> (though nothing but a Spirit of <hi>Opposition</hi> could have excepted against his first Answer) and pass'd it with a <hi>Droit fait come il est desire</hi>; and this with <hi>Bells and Bonfires,</hi> one would think, should have silenc'd all former <hi>Disgusts,</hi> and they gon on with a ready Supply, and mutual Confidence on either Side; whereas the next News we hear, is a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of all the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Fame Stories Malice</hi> or <hi>Mischief</hi> could suggest; and as herein the <hi>Duke of Buks</hi> led the Van, so the whole contain'd only such old Cavils as were easily <hi>weathered,</hi> being very <hi>trivial</hi> or very <hi>false.</hi> But when the <hi>King</hi> found there was a second <hi>Remonstrance</hi> on the <hi>Anvil,</hi> as to <hi>Tunnage and Poundage,</hi> that he had superseded all <hi>Right thereto, by granting their Petition of Right</hi>; this struck him in so sensible a Part, as he resolv'd to break thorough
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49784:34"/>
that <hi>Royal</hi> Patience which had been so long provok'd, and put an End to that <hi>Session,</hi> sometime sooner than he intended, with this Declaration, <hi>That since he was truly inform'd a second Remonstrance was preparing to take away Tunnage and Poundage, one of the chief Supports of his Crown; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, he had given away his Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by his Answer to their Petition; which, as it was very prejudicial to him, so it disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd that the House of Commons began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to make false Constructions of what he had granted already in that Petition; which, lest it should be worse interpreted in the Country, he made this Declaration concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Intent thereof. That the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of both Houses, in the Time of hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Petition, was no way to trench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Prerogative; saying, they had neither Intention nor Power to hurt it; wherefore it must needs be conceiv'd that he granted no New, but confirm'd the Ancient Liberties of his Subjects; concluding with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that they should all take notice of what he had there said, to be the true Intent and Meaning of what he had granted in their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; but more particularly the Iudges; for to you only,</hi> saith he, <hi>under me belongs the Interpretation of Laws; for none of the Houses of Parliament, either Ioint or Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, (what new Doctrine soever may be rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)

have any Power either to make or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a Law without my Consent.</hi> Thus did his <hi>Majesty</hi> freely <hi>Remonstrate</hi> unto them, with Ten Thousand times more Sense and Truth than all their <hi>Harangues</hi> and <hi>Popular Allegations.</hi> For at this distance of time, when we may more <hi>Calmly</hi> judge of such Hot <hi>Debates,</hi> it cannot but be thought more <hi>Gentile</hi> and <hi>Reasonable</hi> for the House to have confirm'd by <hi>Bill,</hi> the <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> in return for <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> than from a cross-grain'd Pretence to further the <hi>Breach,</hi> making it the chief Subject of Debate next <hi>Session,</hi> and cause of a <hi>Fatal,</hi> a <hi>Final Separation.</hi>

                     <p>During the Recess, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bucks</hi> was taken off by a wretched Hand, in a most <hi>Babarous</hi> manner; which 'twas thought would have abated the <hi>Edge</hi> of their furious Prosecution: As likewise <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> of the best parted <hi>Men</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those <hi>Fiery</hi> Tempers began to <hi>Cool,</hi> sensible, as in Charity we are oblig'd to think, what Confusions the Heats they had maintained must produce in the End, and in due time came over to his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi>'s Service; but as the former had little effect, so the other was thought to exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate their great <hi>Spirits,</hi> that some few should run away with the Game, which they had jointly assisted in Hunting down;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49784:35"/>
whereas 'tis probable they design'd a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Division amongst them all, as it afterwards happen'd, though then they fell out most cursedly about their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Shares.</p>
                     <p>We are now come to the last <hi>Session</hi> of this last <hi>Parliament,</hi> who fell immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their wonted Work, <hi>Grievances,</hi> whereof <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> was the Capital; in the Prosecution of which they were resolv'd to <hi>Trounce</hi> all such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as had been imploy'd to <hi>Manage</hi> or <hi>Collect</hi> the same; whereupon the <hi>King</hi> sent for them to the <hi>Banquetting House,</hi> and declar'd <hi>that as he never look'd upon those Duties as Appertaining to his Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Prerogative, so he expected they should pass the Bill, as had been always Customary in the time of his Ancestors, which his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities had oblig'd him to Collect as They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did before the Bill was pass'd; and this very Parliament had profess'd they wanted only Time, not Will to grant them; yet neither this</hi> nor a <hi>Message</hi> afterward could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to take the Matter into Consideration; nay, saith Mr. <hi>Rushworth, the House was troubled to have the Bill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon them, which ought naturally to arise from themselves</hi>; a mighty <hi>Punctilio</hi> that: But in short they would have the <hi>King</hi> own all the <hi>Right</hi> to be in them;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49784:36"/>
and then refus'd the Grant. Whereas it had been all along rather Matter of <hi>Form</hi> than any thing else; and for four <hi>Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> immediately Precedent, pass'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least Dispute. But when Men are resolv'd to Quarrel, they will take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the wagging of every Straw. To be sure whoever stood by the <hi>King</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his <hi>Prerogative</hi> and just <hi>Right,</hi> must expect the Extremity of their Rage and Fury; to which purpose they began with <hi>Weston</hi> the New Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> who was ten times worse than <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Neal Bishop of Winton, Laud of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and so doubtless would have gone the whole <hi>Court</hi> thorough, but that the <hi>King</hi> perceiving they would neither Act with <hi>Temper,</hi> nor attend to <hi>Reason,</hi> stopt the Violence of their Curreer by a <hi>Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi>

upon some Enterprise in defence of <hi>Rochel,</hi> or otherwise to Annoy the <hi>French</hi>; which upon new <hi>Councils,</hi> and perhaps a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Peace, (for about that time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be secretly Agitated) was laid aside.

a <hi>self-sufficient peremptoriness.</hi> So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Odiums</hi> he lay under, as no Man ever lay under greater, (and indeed who could bear up against <hi>Common-Fame,</hi> and a <hi>House of Commons?</hi>) yet more impartial <hi>Iudgments,</hi> which consider'd things as they really were, became surpris'd at so young a Man's falling to Business with so great <hi>Application,</hi> his <hi>judicious Choice</hi> of fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to every concern he engag'd them in, and as <hi>Honourable Rewards</hi> upon their well Performance.

                        <q>Insomuch as <hi>Roger Coke</hi> owns there were three things she was impatient of having debated in Parliament.

For the last of these I have had occasion already to mention how <hi>Morris</hi> burnt his <hi>Fingers,</hi> by meddling therewith; and the <hi>Iournal</hi> gives the like Account about the former, how one <hi>Wentworth</hi> and some others were sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themselves with the <hi>Succession</hi>; but whereas <hi>Roger Coke</hi> saith they were soon discharg'd, is one of his own Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and a shameful, perhaps willful Blunder, since the <hi>Iournal</hi> would have inform'd him, that the <hi>House</hi> becoming humble Sutors to her <hi>Majesty,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease of such <hi>Members</hi> as were under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, It was answered by the <hi>Privy-Counsellors</hi>

then <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>House, That her Majesty had committed them for Causes best known to her self, and that to press her Highness with this Suit, would but hinder those whose Good it sought. That the House must not call the Queen to an Account, for what she did of her Royal Authority; that the Causes for which they were restrain'd might be high and Dangerous; that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty lik'd not such Questions, neither did it become the House to deal in such Matters.</hi> Upon which, saith my <hi>Author,</hi> the House desisted from interposing any farther in their behalf, but left them wholly to the <hi>Queen,</hi> by whom <hi>Wentworth</hi> was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Prisoner</hi> some Years after: 'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable indeed the others, <hi>viz.

                     <p>BUt our pretended <hi>Patriots</hi> could not thoroughly have express'd their care, unless they had made it the concern of <hi>God</hi> as well as the <hi>King,</hi> for which Reason <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> must be taken in, and every thing call'd an <hi>Innovation,</hi> which tended to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Church</hi> or conduc'd in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>Decency and Order</hi> in the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of <hi>Divine Worship</hi>: And this Clamor of Redressing <hi>Religious Grievances,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho by degrees it threw all open, and brought in upon us an universal <hi>Deluge</hi> of <hi>Licentiousness, Prophaneness, Enthusiasm, Atheism,</hi> and what not, yet the <hi>Factions</hi> are so impudent as to continue the Charge, and with that false <hi>Mother,</hi> care not how the <hi>Church</hi> be torn, or cut in pieces, so they may have their spiteful <hi>Wills.</hi> Thus <hi>Ludlow</hi> will have it, that <hi>the Clergy's influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the King, was alwaies greater than could consist with the peace and happiness of</hi> England, <hi>p.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> whereas it was never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than then, and nothing but a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Establishment</hi> in the Church could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it so, as the <hi>King</hi> knew very well,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49784:53"/>
which made him so earnest to <hi>Support it</hi>; and the other Party knew it too, which made them so earnest to <hi>pull it down.

to the wearysom Solicitations of those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be called Puritans, wherewithall the last Parliaments have been exceedingly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd; which sort of Men, whilst in the Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyness of their Spirit, they labor, and strive to advance a new Eldership, they do nothing else but disturb the good repose of the Church, and Commonwealth: And as the Case stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it may be doubted, whether they, or the Iesuit do offer more danger, or be more speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be redress'd</hi>; with much more to the same purpose, even <hi>Prophetical</hi> of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs they have since produc'd.

                     <p>In this Excellent <hi>Posture,</hi> and Regular <hi>Subordination,</hi> did this Prudent <hi>Princess</hi> leave an exact and practicable <hi>Model</hi> of

It was likewise no small Prejudice to our <hi>English Church,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> came accompanied with so great a Retinue of his own <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> whose <hi>Kirk-Leven</hi> put our <hi>Puritans</hi> into a <hi>fresh Ferment,</hi> made them <hi>Swell</hi> and <hi>Domineer,</hi> with their usual insolence upon the least Countenance of Connivance from such as are in <hi>Power,</hi> or have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the <hi>Government.</hi> Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I cannot but take Notice of a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in <hi>Bishop Hacket</hi>'s Life printed before his Sermons; He was born of <hi>Scotch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> dwelling in <hi>London,</hi> during the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Time. <hi>They were both true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, great Lovers of the Church of England, constantly repairing to the Divine Prayers and Service thereof, and would often bewail to their young Son, after the coming in of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49784:56"/>
their Country-men with King</hi> James, <hi>the seed of Fanaticism then laid in the Scandalous neglect of the Publick Liturgy, which all the Queen's time was exceedingly frequented, the People then resorting as Devoutly to Prayers, as they would afterwards to hear any famous Preacher about Town. And his Aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents often observ'd to him, that Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, Iustice and Love amongst Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, gradually declin'd, with the disuse of our Publick Prayers.</hi> This Observation was made at first, which we have since seen <hi>Fatally</hi> verify'd and cursedly <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was likewise no small prejudice to the Interest of our <hi>English Church,</hi> that a <hi>Scotch Peer Top'd</hi> an <hi>Archbishop</hi> upon her, no ways qualify'd with <hi>parts</hi> or <hi>principles</hi> for so great a <hi>Trust:</hi> The Story stands thus; Upon <hi>Archbishop Bancroft</hi>'s Death, such as wish'd well to the <hi>Church,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and other great Men about <hi>Court,</hi> recommended <hi>Bishop Andrews,</hi> a Person every way unexceptionable, to the <hi>King,</hi> who approv'd so well of him, as they thought their Business fix'd, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to press it further; when the <hi>Earl of Dunbar,</hi> a powerful <hi>Minister</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> saith my <hi>Author,</hi> put in for his <hi>quondam Chaplain Abbot,</hi> and got the <hi>King</hi>'s Hand for passing the <hi>Instrument</hi> before the

Matter was discover'd; and then too late to prevent: God grant <hi>Scotch Peers</hi> may never more recommend <hi>English Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates!</hi> Indeed the less any of them have to do with our <hi>Church,</hi> the better, although in this great Time of Tryal amongst them, (where all <hi>Religious Order</hi> is run into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm</hi> and <hi>Madness</hi>) there are several have signalis'd themselves with a <hi>Zeal</hi> truly <hi>Primitive,</hi> not only <hi>to the spoyling their Goods,</hi> but the loss of all their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,</hi> and of some of their <hi>Lives.</hi> For our New <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> when in <hi>Place,</hi> he fell very much short of what his own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers expected; to be sure his <hi>Remiss Government,</hi> and unexcusable <hi>Partiality</hi> towards the <hi>Puritans,</hi> neglecting all those worthy Methods his two Predecessors, <hi>Whitgift</hi> and <hi>Bancroft</hi> had prosecuted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd those many <hi>Desolations, Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Schisms,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> hath not yet, and 'tis a Question whether will be ever able to weather; for whilst seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral worthy <hi>Prelates</hi> in his Time, and his <hi>Successor</hi> who next came in Place, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to continue or revive such <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Injunctions,</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> as had been fram'd in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, and to reduce the <hi>Church</hi> to the same <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Regimen</hi> in which <hi>Abbot</hi> found it: These forsooth must be all exclaim'd against for

                        <hi>Innovations,</hi> and a <hi>Moulding of her to a nearer compliance with the See of Rome,</hi> as <hi>Ludlow</hi> suggests, which I shall farther take notice of in the next <hi>Paragraph,</hi> and for the present only mention what <hi>Archbishop Laud</hi> told a Friend of mine, when in the <hi>Tower, That he endeavoured the Repair of an Old House, but it had been so much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and run to ruin, as to fall about his Ears in the Attempt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, for the former part of <hi>King Iames's Reign,</hi> things went smoothly on, in an easy careless course, without any considerable rub or disturbance, the first <hi>Grumblings</hi> of <hi>Discontent</hi> arose from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Match, which the <hi>King</hi> had set his Heart upon, and <hi>People</hi> as much against; the truth of it is, our <hi>Crown</hi> had generally Married there, or in <hi>France,</hi> but as there had been no Occasion for such an <hi>Alliance</hi> since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> so the different Perswasions now on foot, as to <hi>Religion,</hi> made it very difficult to accomodate that Matter: The <hi>English Papists</hi> were extreamly Zealous therein, beyond the bounds of <hi>Common Discretion,</hi> which made the rest of the <hi>Nation</hi> suspect there could come no good from what they were so forward to promote; and herein the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> would be sure to Lead the <hi>Van,</hi> who clamour'd and made a noise as if the <hi>Pope</hi>

had been as nigh our <hi>Gates,</hi> as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was sometime those of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ran down all as that way dispos'd, who would not be as Mad, and violent as themselves, believe Impossibilities, or fly in the face of <hi>Royal Authority.</hi> And about this time it was they began that <hi>popular</hi> charge of <hi>Innovations,</hi> which had the same Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious effect upon all <hi>Orthodox, Eminent Divines,</hi> as that of <hi>Grievances</hi> upon <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State,</hi> the proof whereof must likewise depend upon <hi>Common-fame,</hi> or which is worse, a <hi>Common Appellation</hi> of their own fixing, as to some particular <hi>School,</hi> or rather <hi>Philosophical</hi> points, most innocent and harmless in themselves, yet so manag'd by a well-contriv'd spight, as the People became possest that an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> was as dangerous as a <hi>Papist,</hi> and as nigh an Affinity between them, as there prov'd afterwards to be between <hi>Puritan</hi> and <hi>Rebel.</hi>

                     <p>However, their proceedings then were with something of deference to the <hi>Church,</hi> remitting the whole matter to the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi> whom they knew more than enough prejudic'd for the <hi>Puritan</hi> and their <hi>Reprobation Doctrine</hi>; and perhaps were assur'd aforehand, that he resolv'd upon an <hi>Admonition,</hi> which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done: But then the <hi>King</hi> was his <hi>Ordinary,</hi> to whom with the <hi>Convocation</hi> an Appeal lay, and there the <hi>Derniere Resort</hi> rested, and thither he Address'd himself in a fresh piece, called <hi>Appello Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarem,</hi> which made fresh work in <hi>K.

make it appear, (which would have been highly acceptable, and most pestilently advantageous to the <hi>Faction's Calumnies</hi>) so matter of Fact speaks quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; For as soon as they came to be capable of <hi>Instruction,</hi> their <hi>Education</hi> was wholly at the <hi>King</hi>'s Direction, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with extraordinary Care, Piety, and Judgment; And whatever Clamours or Conjectures may be made to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I have been inform'd by very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious <hi>Observers,</hi> that the <hi>Queen</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Passive therein, and carried her self with a great deal of <hi>Deference</hi> to what the <hi>King</hi> Ordered: If any of them <hi>Warp'd</hi> afterwards, it was upon our compelling them into <hi>Exile,</hi> and for that, as I said before, our selves must bear the Blame; to force <hi>Princes</hi> abroad can never turn to Account for this <hi>Nation.</hi>

and confin'd to such a Proportion, as the <hi>King</hi>'s great <hi>Exigencies,</hi> and small Revenue would admit.

'Twas high time as to his Age, and more highly requisite,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49784:70"/>
in that he was the only <hi>Male</hi> of the <hi>Royal Line,</hi> that he should be dispos'd of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and to what purpose was it for People to cry a <hi>Protestant Princess</hi> had been better, when they could find none such, agreeable to his <hi>Quality,</hi> nor that mutual intercourse which such <hi>Alliances</hi> generally produce? For tho' 'tis true, <hi>Kingdoms</hi> never Marry, and we find a <hi>War</hi> broke out soon after, and partly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, yet it might be also the sooner Accommodated upon the same account: To be sure, if there be few private <hi>Families,</hi> of any <hi>Degree,</hi> but have some Consideration of this Nature, when they dispose of their <hi>Children,</hi> we must allow the same to <hi>Crown'd Heads,</hi> both in respect to one another, and their several <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Potentates,</hi> who are never without <hi>Caballing Interests,</hi> and other <hi>Intriegues of State.</hi> Neither could that liberty of the <hi>Romish Rites</hi> indulg'd her, and those of that persuasion in her Family, have been any ways prejudicial, had they who made such a Noise, so violently complain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, jointly concur'd in the Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof to its proper <hi>Bounds,</hi> or Modestly <hi>Address'd</hi> his <hi>Majesty</hi> whenever exceeded; but the Froppishness of that <hi>Crooked Generation</hi> was for perverting every thing that <hi>Good Man</hi> did to the utmost extremity, as he complains in

                     <p>So likewise for the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of that Persuasion, if they had any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour more than usual, it was not so much from the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Sollicitation, (tho' that was commonly objected) as for that they frankly proffer'd to Advance Money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>King</hi>'s Necessities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by exasperated the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as well in crossing their Designs, as upbraiding their <hi>Refractory Humour</hi>; although 'twas ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their <hi>Iealousy,</hi> than any real Effects the <hi>Loyal Gentlemen</hi> found of Kindness.

                     <p>THe <hi>Iealousies</hi> between the <hi>French King,</hi> and <hi>Hugonots,</hi> were so great on either side, that all their <hi>Accords</hi> seem'd rather as a <hi>Cessation</hi> to take Breath, till a convenient opportunity might serve for a fresh Breach, than any real design of a lasting Peace: King <hi>Iames</hi> frequently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd herein, and did many good Offices for the <hi>Protestant Interest</hi>; and <hi>King Charles,</hi> whilst the Match was in Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by his <hi>Ministers</hi> there, patch'd up a Treaty between them, that thereby the <hi>French</hi> might be at more leisure to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> then our Enemy, both in <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean:</hi> In order whereunto they agreed with us for the Loan of Seven <hi>Ships,</hi> on Man of <hi>War</hi> and six <hi>Merchants,</hi> as they had with the <hi>Dutch</hi> for twenty, which joyning their <hi>Fleet</hi> there, might block up <hi>Genoa,</hi> and all other ways annoy them, as occasion should serve. But whilst this Design was carried on, and the <hi>Army</hi> march'd towards <hi>Italy; Sobiez,</hi> the most considerable <hi>Chief</hi>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:49784:75"/>
of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> next his Brother the <hi>Duke of Rohan,</hi> alledging, a certain <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress</hi> was not demolish'd, according to Agreement, got together some small <hi>Ships, Seiz'd</hi> upon the <hi>Isles Rhee</hi> and <hi>Oleron,</hi> with what Vessels they found there, and so set up for a <hi>Piratical War,</hi> having <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> and those <hi>Isles</hi> or their Retreat. This made the <hi>French Court</hi> alter their Measures, ordering their Land-Army back upon these New <hi>Revolters</hi>; and <hi>Memorancy</hi> the <hi>French Admiral,</hi> having got together what <hi>Ships</hi> they could of their own, after a great deal of <hi>Wheadle,</hi> and many <hi>Protestations,</hi> had ours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd him, the <hi>Dutch</hi> making no demur; nay, as some say, had, by a <hi>New Treaty,</hi> agreed thereunto; with all which, he went directly against <hi>Sobiez,</hi> and disabled him for ever appearing at <hi>Sea</hi> again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering both <hi>Isles</hi> and <hi>Ships,</hi> but a few which got under <hi>Rochel:</hi> And in the same manner they prosecuted their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks at <hi>Land</hi> so vigorously, as though it cost them longer time, yet in the end they carried all, for which the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> and other <hi>Hugonots,</hi> could justly blame none so much as themselves, not only in that they broke the <hi>Treaty</hi> as soon as made; but afterwards, when our <hi>King</hi> appear'd in their Defence, they refus'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49784:76"/>
to comply with such <hi>Resolutions,</hi> as in the Judgment of <hi>Sobiez,</hi> and their other best <hi>Officers,</hi> were most proper thereunto. However, this Misemployment of our <hi>Ships</hi> was highly resented by his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and many severe <hi>Expostulations</hi> arose thereupon, that our <hi>Ships</hi> should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from their intended expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Spain,</hi> which was solely design'd and promis'd; whereto the <hi>French King</hi> reply'd, <hi>That he had no Enemies then but the Spaniard, and his intent no other, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the like Contract with the Dutch Ships; but his Rebellious Subjects, the Rochellers, starting this necessity upon him, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd to suppress the dangerous Consequence, with the advantage of those Ships, against Rebellion, which he conceives, and he hoped all Christian Princes conclude, such Subjects the greatest Enemies to all Sovereignty.</hi> With this, and the return of our <hi>Ships,</hi> fully satisfied for their Hire, these Heats for the present were allay'd, though with other Discontents, and Provocations, the next year, they broke out into an open War. Which <hi>Ludlow,</hi> with his <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth Charity,</hi> tells us, The <hi>King engag'd in, not upon the account of those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, as was pretended, but grounded upon personal Discontents, to gratify the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and Lust of his Favourite,</hi> Pag. 3.</p>

Let us then, according to this <hi>Rule,</hi> examine the Judgment, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and Integrity of this great <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:</hi> He tells us in the precedent <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,</hi> of several Steps he would have the <hi>King</hi> set, in order to the Establishing an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> (which we have already taken notice of) more especially the Committing of several <hi>Members,</hi> as he saith, <hi>For complaining of the Grievances of the Nation</hi>; as others, for their <hi>Riotous</hi> Deportment in the <hi>House,</hi> Locking up the <hi>Door,</hi> holding the <hi>Speaker</hi> in the Chair, till they had pass'd what Votes they thought fit, with many such like Heats, upon an intimation of their <hi>Dissolution:</hi> Now what we are here to take notice of, is his <hi>Transition</hi> from this <hi>Relation</hi> to the next; <hi>The King having thus assum'd this extraordinary Power, resolv'd to make a War with</hi> France; whereas the <hi>French</hi> War was begun before that <hi>Parliament</hi>

was call'd, and in a fair prospect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, when those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> were so unhappily committed.

                     </p>
                     <p>But to come to the War, the <hi>King</hi> had too just Grounds to engage therein, tho' too mean a <hi>Fund</hi> to go through therewith; and the one in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had not been given, but that they saw how unlikely it was, he should ever be supply'd as to the other.

in <hi>Germany:</hi> And which was worse, gave occasion to the <hi>Male-Contents</hi> here at home, to complain of <hi>Mismanagement,</hi> and the No-Fruits of their <hi>Subsidies</hi> given to recover the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> when it all proceeded from the little Faith, and less Honour, of our <hi>Allies.</hi> And there was no more consistency in that mighty <hi>Huff,</hi> of the <hi>French King,</hi> and <hi>Court,</hi> upon the dismission of our <hi>Queen's Domesticks,</hi> since he had been guilty of the like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Retinue of his own <hi>Queen,</hi> not long before, and for ought appears, upon far less Provocation.

<q>When the <hi>Duke</hi> with his Fleet appear'd before <hi>Rochel,</hi> they who once much long'd for his coming, now shut their <hi>Gates</hi> against him: Hereupon, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sobiez</hi> went ashore with Sir <hi>William Beecher,</hi> from the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> (Sir <hi>Will.

by joyning <hi>Forces</hi> with the <hi>English,</hi> he said he would, and did protest before <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> in the Name of the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Master,</hi> That his said <hi>Master</hi> was fully acquit of his <hi>Engagement</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> for their Relief.</q>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49784:79"/>
their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Vows</hi> should be for the happy progress of such <hi>Actions,</hi> as the <hi>Fleet</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> should undertake.</q>

readily to a Peace, which set all things in <hi>Statu Quo,</hi> with this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on our side, that they became more <hi>Complaisant</hi> and <hi>Obliging</hi> in their outward carriage; did not think fit to look <hi>Big</hi> and <hi>Insult</hi> upon every private <hi>Disgust,</hi> tho' their underhand <hi>Practices</hi> were much to be Suspected, as hath been already Observ'd.</p>

Mankind was never Ingenious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be left at his own Freedom.

                     <p>Here then come in their <hi>Majesties De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,</hi> and more especially relate to the foremention'd Circumstances; upon a <hi>prudent Consideration, as King Charles</hi> saith of his <hi>Father, That if these Times were taken from them, the meaner sort, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hard all the Week, should have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations at all to refresh their Spirits</hi>; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there less of Prudence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, in the several <hi>Limitations</hi> of this <hi>Innocent Freedom,</hi> as <hi>First that no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Recreations be us'd as the Laws of the Kingdom, and Canons of the Church prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, for some such it seems there were, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Bowling to meaner sort of People.</hi> 2dly. <hi>That this Liberty be not taken till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Divine Service; nor</hi> 3dly. <hi>That any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, but such as are present at the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof.</hi> We may here likewise add, the reasons given, why the <hi>Declarations</hi> came out at those particular Times, which if well weighed cannot be except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against; <hi>As first the Advantage the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists took thereby, to discourage People from coming into, or continuing in our Church, by perswading them that no honest Mirth, or Recreations were tolerated in our Religion:</hi>
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:49784:94"/>
And this indeed gave the first occasion to <hi>King Iames,</hi> who in his <hi>Progress</hi> through <hi>Lancashire</hi> received several Complaints thereof, and having inform'd himself how justly, gave a Check to the <hi>precise</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of such <hi>Iustice over-does,</hi> as stretched the <hi>Laws</hi> beyond their proper <hi>Intent,</hi> and true Reason of the thing; whereto like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise agrees what the <hi>judicious Sanderson</hi> tells us, that in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the Rigid, froward Disposition of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> oblig'd many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People to continue, if not turn <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> between which two Parties, that <hi>County</hi> was mostly divided.</p>
                     <p>Another Reason given, is <hi>for that this Prohibition barreth the common and meaner sort of People from using such Exercise, as may make their Bodies more able for War, when we, or our Successors shall have occasion</hi>; for, as it goes on, <hi>When shall the Common People have leave to Exercise, if not upon the Sundays, and Holy Days, seeing they must apply their Labour, and win their Living in all working Days?</hi> All which in no more than their Common Practice at <hi>Geneva,</hi> as hath been already mention'd; and it ought further to be consider'd, so strict a Confinement from all Diversions of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> cannot but by degrees <hi>oppress</hi> and <hi>darstardise</hi> Men's <hi>Spirits,</hi> of <hi>English

Mastiffs,</hi> make them in the end become <hi>Setting-Dogs</hi> to some <hi>Foreign Power:</hi> To these <hi>King Charles</hi> adds, a 3d. <hi>The rather because of late in some Counties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we find, that under pretence of taking away abuses, there hath been a general For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding, not only of ordinary Meetings, but of the Feasts of the Dedication of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> &amp;c. which besides preserving the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi> thereof, as he was certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, tended very much to <hi>Civilising the People, composing</hi> of Differences by the Mediation of Friends, encreasing <hi>Love and Unity, by those Feasts of Charity; with Relief and Comfort to the Poor, the Richer part in a manner keeping open House.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though what is mention'd just before in this <hi>Corroborating part of King Charles,</hi> might probably prevail more with him, than all the rest, <hi>viz.

King Iames</hi> had an ill Habit of Body, very unwiel'dy, and full of gross Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which improv'd the more upon him, for that he was so uneasy, as to the <hi>Regiment</hi> of his <hi>Health,</hi> either from his Own, or <hi>Physicians</hi> Observation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon falling into a <hi>Tertian Fever</hi> at <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balds,</hi> 'twas thought by most Men, amongst the rest him himself, that Crasy <hi>Constitution</hi> of his would not be able to withstand its frequent <hi>Assaults</hi>; and it happen'd accordingly.

                        <hi>Death</hi> it was <hi>whisper'd</hi> about <hi>Court,</hi> that the <hi>Duke</hi> had recommended something of a Cure for his <hi>Ague,</hi> without the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi> advice, which doing no <hi>good,</hi> must be presum'd to do <hi>hurt</hi>; this coming to the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Ear, he concern'd himself so far, as to have the Matter examin'd by the <hi>Physicians,</hi> where the <hi>Lady</hi> appear'd and disclos'd that great <hi>secret</hi> of an <hi>Ague-Cure,</hi> (few of that Quality, amongst their <hi>Country Neighbours,</hi> (for she was a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> an <hi>Essex</hi> Lady) being without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that kind,) which was only a <hi>Plaster</hi> of <hi>Methrydate,</hi> with a Posset Drink of <hi>Harts-Horn,</hi> and <hi>Marygold Flowers.</hi> This for that time put an end to the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> but about two Years after, in the Second <hi>Parliament,</hi> it was Reviv'd again, and made an <hi>Article</hi> against the <hi>Duke,</hi> which they that please may Consult, with his <hi>Reply,</hi> and perhaps be satisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; if not I shall only add further, <hi>Lord Keeper Williams</hi> perform'd the last <hi>Offices</hi> of a <hi>Divine</hi> to <hi>King Iames,</hi> continued with him several Days and Nights before his <hi>Death,</hi> so that had he observ'd or suspected any such <hi>foul</hi> Play, there is no doubt but it would have made a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Noise both in <hi>Parliament</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, when the <hi>Duke</hi> caus'd the <hi>Seal</hi> to be taken from him; and the <hi>Author</hi> of

                     <p>And now to show how Artificially the <hi>Master</hi> was brought in, as concern'd, with what the <hi>Servant</hi> never did; when the <hi>Articles</hi> were Exhibited against the <hi>Duke:</hi> Sir <hi>Dudly Diggs</hi> who as <hi>Foreman</hi> manag'd the <hi>Prologue,</hi> and gave a Summary of the whole <hi>Charge</hi>; was reported to have said these Words, <hi>That he was commanded by the House, concerning the Plaister apply'd to the King, that he did forbear to speak far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard to the King's Honour, or Words to that Effect,</hi> whereupon the <hi>King</hi> ordered him to be Committed, and Sir <hi>Dudly Carlton Remonstrated</hi> the same to the <hi>Commons,</hi> but upon his own and the <hi>Two Houses Compurgation,</hi> that no such, nor such like Words were spoken, he was again discharg'd, yet whoever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults that <hi>Eloquent Harangue,</hi> as Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Rushworth,</hi>

foundation of what the <hi>Defence,</hi> or his fellow <hi>Pamphleteer</hi> relates of that worthy <hi>Dominican</hi> Convert, <hi>Gage,</hi> who might agree with the <hi>Iesuit</hi> when both about to turn <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and joyn together in some forgery which might merit their reception, although their Orders are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable, and will believe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no more than an honest man of sense and understanding will believe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them.

                        <hi>Hamilton</hi> give him a very honourable <hi>Character,</hi> as to whatsoever he advised in those unhappy affairs; although neither he, nor any of his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Faithful Loyal Subjects of either <hi>Kingdom,</hi> were satisfied with those unreasonable conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentions, he was wheedled into, for that it was most visibly apparent, the more he yielded, the more insolently they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in further demands, being so far from setting one step forward, as to stand back with the greater Obstinacy, and consider what was further to be insisted upon, in defiance of all <hi>Honour, Right,</hi> and <hi>Law</hi>; for, as <hi>Ludlow</hi> relates, <hi>The King by Commission impowered the Marquess of</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, <hi>to treat them into a Submission, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the suppression of the Liturgy, High-Commission Court, and Articles of</hi> Perth, <hi>but the</hi> Scots <hi>insisting upon the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of Episcopacy, and the King refusing his consent to it, they did it themselves in an Assembly held at</hi> Glasco. This is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral account, and which is very much, and rare. True, but there were several Circumstances in the management there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of very considerable: As first, they that understood and wish'd best to the <hi>King and Kingdoms</hi> interest, thought <hi>Hamilton</hi> a very improper person to be employ'd in that affair, for that several of his nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49784:121"/>
                        <hi>Relations,</hi> were chief of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> party, his <hi>Mother</hi> more especially, so great a <hi>Heroine</hi> as to ride with Pistols at her <hi>saddle Bow,</hi> and defie both <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> in defence of so good a <hi>cause. Secondly,</hi> there were several other prejudices against him, which whether true or false, made many honest men move with the less vigor, because they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no good Event from whatsoever he engag'd in; and this was most unhappily confirmed by the <hi>Concessions</hi> he <hi>cajol'd</hi> the <hi>King</hi> into as to the <hi>Liturgy, High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> &amp;c. For after a long and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Treaty with the <hi>Covenanters</hi> at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi> attended with three several journeys to the <hi>English Court,</hi> instead of <hi>Treating</hi> them into a <hi>Submission</hi> as <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> words it, they <hi>Treated</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all to that time their most inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent demands. What is alledg'd in his defence, <hi>That he knew the Kings condition, how unable he was, or hard it would be to bring an Army into the Field,</hi> is no ways valid, for he was then as able as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and delays were rather to their advantage, than his, and since all men of observation concluded the <hi>Scots</hi> would never give off without blows, the <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio</hi> of first <hi>Aggressor</hi> was nonsence, they never stood upon it, when it would serve
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49784:121"/>
their turn, and that their so grosly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused <hi>Sovereign</hi> should not take the best opportunity of chastising them is against all Rules of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; but to speak freely the <hi>King</hi>'s great tenderness, and regard to those his natural and <hi>Native Subjects,</hi> as he term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, was so unfortunately misplac'd, upon the most <hi>ungrateful</hi> set of <hi>people</hi> that ever trod upon <hi>God</hi>'s Earth, to his and their own ruine, as well as all others concerned with them. But if <hi>Hamilton</hi> impos'd upon the <hi>King</hi> by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joling him into the most groundless concessions ever any <hi>Prince</hi> yielded to, so doubtless the <hi>Covenanters</hi> impos'd altogether as much upon him, for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any correspondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them or not as to this particular, (which for ought I can find remains still in the dark) he could not but ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally presume it would be an eternal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, to procure in one single <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> a full grant, of whatever all their <hi>Supplications, Remonstrances, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations,</hi> &amp;c. had hitherto demanded; and so indeed the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> took it, subscribing a Letter of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> in one of the most <hi>Rhetorical</hi> Flights I have generally met with, owning <hi>that such acts of

<q>To punish such as under the name of <hi>Tables,</hi> or a <hi>Committee</hi> of the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> shall presume to sit without his consent, to order Affairs of <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> refusing when questioned the Authority of his <hi>Majesty, Council,</hi> or <hi>Iudges,</hi> and appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a General Assembly, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously calling it <hi>Christ's own immediate Council,</hi> and claiming a <hi>Sovereign Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency,</hi> from <hi>King, Council, Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                           </q> These are some of the Reasons his <hi>Majesty</hi> himself gives for that unwilling War these furious <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> forc'd him upon. <hi>That the Clergy of</hi> England <hi>were not wanting to promote the New-Levies,</hi> as <hi>Ludlow</hi> saith, is true, but <hi>That they were the principal Authors, and Fomentors of the Troubles, is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly False,</hi> as likewise, <hi>That what the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Gentry did, was rather out of complement, than affection to the design</hi>: there was a party indeed whom the <hi>Scotch</hi> had <hi>Bit,</hi> and made as <hi>Mad</hi> as themselves, but all men of sound <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and sober judgments, foresaw that the neighbour <hi>Kingdom</hi> being on <hi>Fire,</hi> if good care were not taken to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49784:125"/>
quench it, ours might shortly catch the <hi>Flame,</hi> and both be consumed together, contributed with all the alacrity and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction imaginable, neither had there ever appear'd upon those <hi>Borders</hi> a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Army,</hi> or more resolutely bent to beat the <hi>Scotch</hi> into better <hi>manners,</hi> whatever Arts were us'd to affright, and intimidate them, for those of that <hi>Nation</hi> in his own <hi>Family,</hi> did him more mischief than the whole <hi>Covenanters Army,</hi> by betraying his <hi>Counsels,</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representing their <hi>strength,</hi> and more especially letting him know how averse his <hi>Majesty</hi> was to come to the extremity, otherwise his <hi>Army</hi> wanted neither power nor will, at one single blow to have decided that dispute, which afterward cost so many, and to very little purpose; 'tis said that when the old Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> (who knew his <hi>Country-men,</hi> aswell, perhaps better than most others) came to take his leave of his <hi>King</hi> at his set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward to the <hi>North,</hi> desired leave to give his <hi>Majesty</hi> three <hi>Advertisments,</hi> before his going. <hi>First, that he would suffer none of the</hi> Scotch <hi>Nation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in his Army, assuring him that they would never fight against their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but rather hazard the whole by their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49784:125"/>
Tergiversation.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> was, <hi>That he should make a Catalogue of all his Counsellors, Officers of Household, and Domestick Servants, expunging every one of the</hi> Scotch <hi>Nation, beginning with the Bishop himself, by which means he could not be accused of Partiality, when a person who had served him and his Father above Sixty Years so Faithfully, appear'd in the Front. A third</hi> was, <hi>that be must not think to win upon them by condescentions, the sweetness of his disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Acts of Grace, but resolve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to their duty, by such ways of Power as God had put into his hands.</hi> Thus far that wise experienced <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and his <hi>Majesty</hi> not following such wholesome advice, I take to be the <hi>Origin</hi> of all his following <hi>Troubles,</hi> and <hi>Ruine:</hi> for the <hi>Scotch</hi> taking him now to be in good earnest, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ill provided they were to make opposition, having not above 3000 <hi>compleat Arms</hi> amongst them, (whatever flourishes those false <hi>Lowns</hi> their <hi>Countrymen</hi> made both in <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Camp</hi>) thought it requisite to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert that approaching danger, they had so justly drawn upon themselves; and hereupon addressed themselves to

the <hi>Earl of Essex,</hi> whom the <hi>King</hi> had sent before from <hi>York,</hi> to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of <hi>Berwick,</hi> to him they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of some of their own <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,</hi> who had provoked the <hi>King</hi> against them, protesting still their own Innocency, Loyalty to the <hi>King,</hi> and Affection to the <hi>English,</hi> requesting him to procure a <hi>Pacification,</hi> by any means whatsoever, which should be thought expedient on both sides: the like <hi>Address</hi> they made to the <hi>Earl of Arundel, General,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Earl of Holland Lieftenant General of the Horse,</hi> in whom they had a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary confidence (as knowing how well that whole <hi>Family</hi> was affected to their <hi>Covenant cause</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only justified themselves in their former proceedings, but request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his assistance to promote their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, in a <hi>Petition</hi> tendred to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's hands.</hi> By these and such-like sly Addresses, his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s good nature was too easily wrought upon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and agree to a <hi>Pacification,</hi> which being once signed, he fell immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Execution of every <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> on his side, forthwith disbanding a brave <hi>Army,</hi> Govern'd by <hi>Colonels</hi>

                     <p>Nevertheless it shall be acknowledged that this little Success turn'd infinitely to their advantage, for, having got pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> had a <hi>Magazine,</hi> they extended their Quarters as far as <hi>Durham,</hi> with a corner of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> after miserably harassing all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they came, those four <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of <hi>Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland,</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned corner of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> far from the largest or richest in <hi>England,</hi> were <hi>Sess'd</hi> at a <hi>Contribution</hi> of 850 <hi>l. per Diem,</hi> which, I fancy, was more than <hi>Cromwell</hi> could make of their whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> when he by the Just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven had brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same circumstances, nay, which is more, made an <hi>absolute Conquest.</hi> And this, I presume is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ludlow</hi>'s blunder, which hath something of approach to truth, but he abhors to come close up to it, <hi>that upon the King's calling his great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at</hi> York, <hi>they advis'd a Cessation of Arms, and to Summon a Parliament, which, to the great trouble of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,

How careful is this Good man of the <hi>Parliaments pleasure,</hi> and free of the <hi>Kings</hi> condescention? whereas impartially speaking, they had carv'd themselves the forementioned <hi>Contribution,</hi> and moreover <hi>seiz'd</hi> the total of all <hi>Estates</hi> belonging to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, Prelates, Incendiaries,</hi> &amp;c. in brief, of all the <hi>Loyal, honest Gentlemen</hi> throughout that <hi>District of their new Usurpation.</hi> Afterwards indeed when the Treaty was at <hi>Rippon,</hi> the <hi>English Commissioners</hi> requir'd their demands as to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi> of their <hi>Army,</hi> whereto they modestly return'd answer 40000 <hi>l. per. mensem</hi> should content them for the present, and for their losses they would afterward give a particular estimate.

                     <p>And hitherto according to the course of all other <hi>Tragedies,</hi> their two or three first Acts have been very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and advantageous, what remains looks every <hi>Scene</hi> darker than other, and is at last Consummated in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Catastrophe</hi>; for whether that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Duke</hi> Hamilton to rescue <hi>K.

                     <p>And now by way of <hi>Epilogue</hi> to the forementioned <hi>Tragedy,</hi> it may not be improper to take notice, how grosly the <hi>Scotch</hi> mistook their Politicks in stirring up and promoting those hellish broils and confusions throughout the two <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> it could be nothing but a cursed spight the <hi>Devil</hi> ow'd them, to act so contrary to that <hi>cunning</hi> and <hi>over-reaching</hi> foresight, wherein at other times few <hi>Nations</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> can bear up with them.

Neighbours the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> could not furnish them with any other Precedent more proper for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49784:139"/>
his Heir might come afterwards, be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to reverse the Outlawry, and recover his Ancestor's Estate.</hi> These and many such like <hi>Rebel Tenents</hi> were publish'd that <hi>Session,</hi> after the Murder of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> an abundant confirmation, how requisite his <hi>strict</hi> Hand was for such a <hi>loose</hi> People, which to astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Government did not see, or would not take notice of, till the <hi>Knife</hi> was at their <hi>Throats,</hi> and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of them <hi>cut</hi>: although they must have all a-long observ'd how uneasie the <hi>Irish</hi> had been under their <hi>Conquest,</hi> (tho' better govern'd perhaps than had it been in their own hands) how strangely influenc'd by their <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>bigotted</hi> upon that account; so that they might alledge the same pretence of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> with their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and have just the same reason to <hi>Rebell,</hi> that is none at all. But that which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth me most is, that these People should have <hi>liberty</hi> to sit in <hi>Parliament, Comptrol,</hi> and <hi>Vote</hi> against whatever <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> had been, or were farther to be enacted, in order to keep them the better in <hi>subjection</hi>; the freedom of their <hi>Consciences</hi> might surely have been thought enough, but the <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49784:140"/>
too, must bring all to confusion, as it here happen'd to a horrid degree. But 'tis not my <hi>Province</hi> to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this, or any of their other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions</hi> farther than the <hi>Reputation,</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> of our <hi>Royal Sufferer</hi> is concern'd, whose treatment, as to these <hi>Irish Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,</hi> was more barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane than all the rest, as well from the <hi>Forgeries</hi> on their side, to inveigle and abuse the People, as the villainous spreading of them here, where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd some time to procure a right <hi>Information.</hi>

                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:49784:141"/>The first reproach which this <hi>false and feather Bird</hi> Ludlow <hi>howls</hi> forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>King,</hi> is, <hi>That whilst in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>he had News of the</hi> Irish <hi>Rebellion, how the Papists throughout the Kingdom were in Arms,</hi> &amp;c. and then closeth the Relation with this Villainous hearsay, <hi>The News of this Rebellion (as I have heard from persons of undoubted Credit) was not displeasing to the King, though it was attended with the Massacre of many thousands of the Protestants there,</hi> p. 17. Though we are not to take his word for the <hi>Credit</hi> of the persons who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this, yet we may take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures from his relation, that they were equally to be credited with himself, that is not all; for all this is <hi>gratis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> without the least Authority, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of a reason, or so much as probable conjecture for so hellish an Aspersion. Whereas there is express matter of Fact even to demonstration, that never any thing more sensibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected him, in that upon the first no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, he sent Sir <hi>Iames Stewart</hi> to the Lords of the <hi>Privy-Council at</hi> Dublin <hi>with Instructions what he thought most proper to be done, and furnish'd them with all that Money his present stores could
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49784:141"/>
supply.</hi> He mov'd also the <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> to a speedy help, but they desir'd to be excus'd <hi>till the States of</hi> England <hi>were consulted; who, if they thought fit to use any of their men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions should be made in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> designing to make a <hi>Market</hi> to themselves, of their Neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons miseries; wherein notwithstanding many of their own <hi>Countrymen</hi> were concerned. At the same time likewise he sent Post to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where several <hi>Resolves</hi> were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and <hi>Votes</hi> made, but little effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done till the <hi>King's</hi> Return. To speak truly, had <hi>Ludlow</hi>'s reflection been made upon them, there had been much more <hi>Credit</hi> for it, since they laid hold of all advantages thereby, not only to slander and abuse his <hi>Majesty,</hi> but to help themselves forward in that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> they were just <hi>ripe</hi> for acting, as will by and by be made appear.</p>
                     <p>With the same <hi>Owl-light Credit,</hi> he proceeds and tells us, <hi>About this time great numbers of</hi> English <hi>Protestants fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Bloody hands of the</hi> Irish <hi>Rebels, arrived in</hi> England, <hi>filling all places with the sad complaints of their Cruelties: whereupon the Parliament ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49784:142"/>
press'd the King to proclaim them Rebels, but could not obtain it to be done till many weeks, and then but forty of those Proclamations were Printed, and not above half of them Published, which was the more observ'd, and resented, by reason of the different treatment the</hi> Scotch <hi>had met with, who no sooner appear'd in a much better cause, but they were forthwith declared Rebels in every Parish Church within the Kingdom,</hi> p. 19. A very plausible story, but for want of one thing, and that is <hi>Truth,</hi> whereof it hath not the least <hi>Syllable</hi>: For first the <hi>Parliament</hi> never press'd the <hi>King</hi> for a <hi>Proclamation</hi>; Secondly, the <hi>Fourty Proclamations</hi> printed, were not for this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but <hi>Ireland</hi>; So that <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there could be no ground of resentment upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> account, but by such <hi>pick-thank</hi> fellows as <hi>Ludlow</hi> and his Party. In short, the matter of Fact stands exactly thus: The <hi>Parliament,</hi> as they were very inquisitive to catch at every thing which might give them an advantage against the <hi>Court,</hi> having underhand information that a <hi>Warrant</hi> was sent to the <hi>Printer</hi> for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd <hi>Proclamations</hi> to be forthwith provided, open'd very loud upon it,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49784:142"/>
                        <hi>Why so few? Why no sooner,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Printer</hi> was summon'd, the <hi>Warrant</hi> produc'd, and a mighty bustle made, as generally <hi>the cry is greatest where the least Wool</hi>: In the midst of which heats, the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State</hi> gave this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter, <hi>that the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were printed at the Request of the Lords Iustices and Privy-Council in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>who desir'd to have twenty sign'd by his Majesty's own hand, and no more,</hi>

                           <hi>Dr,</hi> Nals. Coll. Vol. 2. p. 529.</note> who <hi>nevertheless order'd forty, and sent them accordingly</hi>; I do not remember the cause was given to the <hi>Parliament</hi> why so sign'd: But 'tis probable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate that <hi>forg'd Commission</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they had fix'd the <hi>Kings Broad-Seal</hi> granted to a private person upon a Title of <hi>Land.</hi> Otherwise there had been <hi>Proclamations</hi> several from the first day the <hi>Rebellion</hi> broke out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the only place where requisite. But why not in <hi>England</hi> as well as against the <hi>Scotch</hi>? as our Author insinuates: whereto I reply, First, the <hi>Scotch</hi> had seiz'd upon, at leastwise assum'd the <hi>Administration</hi> of the whole <hi>Civil</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, so that no <hi>Proclamation</hi> could come out against them there. Secondly, they had too many abettors in <hi>England</hi>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49784:143"/>
who encourag'd them to begin, and were resolv'd to follow the first op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. So that <hi>thirdly</hi> the <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> must come from hence or not at all, and was equally requisite against both. What he adds farther of the <hi>Scotch</hi> being <hi>the much better Cause,</hi> is only the private opinion of a fellow <hi>Rebel</hi>; they were both so bad as upon an impartial scanning it would puzzle their <hi>Infernal Patron</hi> to tell which was worst.</p>
                     <p>Having had the confidence to averr two such impudent falshoods as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, 'tis strange how he comes to mince the matter so much as to the third, and tell us <hi>the Rebels in</hi> Ireland, <hi>pretended a Commission from the K. for what they did</hi>; and his Abstract, the <hi>Defence,</hi> gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Copy therefore, but withal goes no farther than <hi>that it was said to be given by the King to his Catholick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in</hi> Ireland, p. 14. Whereas there was no one Slander more confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown abroad than that, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued longer; nay, I have met with several <hi>Fanaticks</hi> within these few years, who still take it for an undoubted <hi>truth,</hi> and what they have so long enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, nothing but the final <hi>Iudgment</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:49784:143"/>
can make them renounce. Once for all therefore, to silence this Infamous <hi>Calumny,</hi> we must know the <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty</hi> of the <hi>Native Irish,</hi> having liv'd a long time in Peace and Amity with the <hi>English,</hi> were not without some <hi>Reverence</hi> to that <hi>Government,</hi> and so could not in plain and direct terms be easily led into an avowed <hi>Rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their <hi>King,</hi> whereupon their leaders <hi>Phelim Oneil,</hi> &amp;c. were forced to perswade them, that they took up <hi>Arms</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Defence</hi> of his <hi>Lawful Prerogative</hi> against the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanical Parliament in</hi> England, <hi>who had invaded it in many parts, and that what they did was by his Majesty's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and Authority.</hi> And to gain the greater Credit to that Fiction, they produc'd a Commission, whereto the <hi>Broad-Seal,</hi> taken from a private grant, was affix'd, as aforesaid, which made it no difficult matter to perswade rude and <hi>unexperienced people</hi> to believe it real; all which in a short time was clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, as well by several <hi>Irish Rebels</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Prisoners,</hi> as <hi>English Protestants,</hi> who escap'd their fury; particularly Dr. <hi>Maxwell,</hi> a Reverend <hi>Scotch Divine,</hi> (against which <hi>Nation</hi> they were not

till in the end they gain'd enough to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine him, as well as his <hi>Ministers</hi>; for whatever popular <hi>Clamors</hi> were made, none stood up so much for the true <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Constitution</hi> as they, never denying that <hi>Parliaments</hi> were the best Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to settle Affairs in all great Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, if they would go regularly about it; but they Both thought what the One hath declared,<note place="margin">

                     <p>What comes next is one of the best improv'd <hi>Lies</hi> in the whole <hi>Libel, of a treacherous Design set on foot not without the King's Participation, as appear'd under the King's own Hand, to bring up the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Army, and by Force to Dissolve the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; the Plunder of</hi> London <hi>being promis'd to the Officers and Soldiers as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for that Service; this was confess'd by the Lord</hi> Goring, <hi>Mr.</hi> Percy, <hi>and others. The</hi> Scots <hi>Army was also try'd,</hi> &amp;c. p. 15. This is his <hi>Story,</hi> Let us now see Truth.

                     <p>To shew farther that the <hi>Parliament</hi> was always in danger the <hi>King</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally plotting against them, they never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, our <hi>Author</hi> tells us,

                        <hi>Whetstone.</hi> That the Fellow should be so impudent to charge the <hi>King</hi> with raising <hi>Tumults,</hi> or threatning Force, when all the World knows it was the chief <hi>Engine</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> had to carry on all their mischievous Enterprises, and when any thing stuck with him or the Lords, a <hi>Rabble</hi> of 5 or 6000 were immediately summon'd out of the <hi>City</hi> to affright and threaten all that would not comply according to their Desire, and in their passage by <hi>Whitehall</hi> did the same to the <hi>King,</hi> till their <hi>Insolencies</hi> grew so intolerable, as he was forc'd to leave that and <hi>Parliament</hi> at once, for which they had the confidence to charge him, and yet would take no care he might be secure with them; and this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd what <hi>Ludlow</hi> relates, Several <hi>Gentlemen</hi> about Town, more especially at the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> were asham'd to see <hi>Majesty</hi> so scandalously affronted, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd their service for the security of <hi>Whitehall,</hi> his <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> which was kindly accepted, and some little Entertainment made for them, from whence this vile Fellow rais'd his great Story. And since he hath given me this just provocation, it will be here very proper to give some small account of those many violences from the <hi>insults</hi>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49784:165"/>
and <hi>tumults</hi> of the Rabble, how necessary the Faction found them, and thereupon what Encouragement they had.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bill of Attainder</hi> against the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> went on very slowly in the House of <hi>Lords,</hi> and 'tis probable but for the <hi>Menaces</hi> of the <hi>Mob</hi> had never pass'd, whereof 5 or 6000 came up to <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> fill'd the <hi>Palace-Yard,</hi> posted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at all the Entrances to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament House, and stopped every Coach crying <hi>Iustice and Execution,</hi> which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Sign given was repeated with such an hideous Noise as to create Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the greatest Constancy. Such Lords as they knew were averse to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour them, they threatned most severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had the Impudence to add, if they had not the <hi>Leiutenant's Life, they would have the King's</hi>; whereof his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty complained by Message to the Lords, they to the Commons, and there it stuck: For sometime after when <hi>they trudg'd away to cry no Bishops,</hi> as <hi>Hudibras</hi> hath it, and the Lords complained in a Conference with the Commons, of their horrible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency, Mr. <hi>Pim</hi> their chief Setter cry'd <hi>God forbid we should proceed to dishearten People from obtaining their just Rights</hi>; and the rest of that cursed <hi>Cabal</hi> secretly whisper'd, <hi>they must not discourage their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49784:166"/>
Friends, this being a time to make use of them</hi>; which vile Abettings made them so Impudent as to threaten <hi>White-hall</hi> too, and declare as they pass'd by, <hi>there should be no Porters Lodg, but they would come to speak to the King without Control, and at their own discretion:</hi> And when presently after there was another descent of the same Rout, and some Opposition made upon their Attempt upon <hi>White-hall Gate,</hi> till the <hi>Sheriffs of London</hi> and <hi>Middelsex</hi> with what <hi>Guard</hi> they could draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, seiz'd, and committed some of them, the Commons immediately posted up Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> to the Lords, complaining 'twas a Violation of <hi>the Liberty of the Subject, and an affront to the Parliament,</hi> and so the <hi>Good Boys</hi> must be discharg'd. 'Twere too tedious to relate the several Insults of this kind, both King and Lords were forc'd to put up, the Commons under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand giving them all Encouragement imaginable, and had their <hi>Setters</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> to be ready on the first Intimation, whereof Dr. <hi>Cornelius Burges,</hi> a <hi>Lectur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beautifeu,</hi> was chief, seconded by a <hi>Lay Brother</hi> one <hi>Ven,</hi> the <hi>Captain Tom</hi> of those Times; the Dr. as he led up these Doughty <hi>Champions,</hi> was wont to look back and cry,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>These are my Ban-dogs, I can set them on, and I can take them off again;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49784:166"/>
by which means,</hi> saith my <hi>Author, four parts in five of the Lords, and two parts in three of the Commons, were frighted out of the House, to leave the Faction absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters thereof.</hi> All these before unheard of Affronts to Majesty and Government, our faithful Recorder of Memoirs takes no Notice of, but a few honest Loyal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, asham'd to see such abominable Insults, and therefore coming to defend, if occasion serv'd, their abused, ay and threatned Prince, must pass for a Plot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Parliament, and they forsooth must have a Guard. With like veracity he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the <hi>Kingston</hi> Plot too, where the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> with Colonel <hi>Lunsford,</hi> in a Coach and Six, and three or four Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men attending, pass'd for a Body of 500 Horse; with many such like extravagant Rumors, rais'd on purpose, that their Worships might be thought to stand in need of a Guard, whereas if such a thing was wanting it must be to Guard the King and Government from them.</p>
                     <p>In that <hi>Divine Pourtraicture of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Solitudes and Sufferings,</hi> there are two Chapters, one upon the many <hi>Iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies rais'd, and Scandals cast upon the King, to stir up the People against him.</hi> The other upon the <hi>Insolencies of the Tumults,</hi> in both which he doth so passionately set forth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49784:167"/>
how abominably he and his Subjects were abus'd by their <hi>Lyes and Slanders,</hi> as would Convince, ay and Convert too any Reprobate whatsoever, but a <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi>: As to the Tumults, how just and reasonable is that Resentment of his;
<q>I confess, <hi>saith he,</hi> when I found such a Deafness, that no Declaration from the Bishops, who were first foully inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd and assaulted; nor yet from Lords and Gentlemen of Honour, nor yet from my self, could take Place for the due Repression of these Tumults, and securing not only our Freedom in Parliament, but our very Persons in the Streets; I thought my self not bound by my Presence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to higher Boldness and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; I hoped also by my with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing to give time both to the Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of their tumultuous Fury, and others regaining some degrees of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and sober Sense.</q>
But his hopes were altogether frustrated, they perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd at the same Rebel rate, till, as he foretold,
<q>the Just Avenger of all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, made those Men, and that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, see their Sin, in the Glass of their Punishment, which soon after happen'd in the same way they had offended.</q>

                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49784:167"/>But never was this <hi>Meteor Mob</hi> so high in <hi>Meridian Altitude,</hi> as when the five Members were accus'd; it was indeed the sole Support of that cursed Cause, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the King had curs'd them all to the Scaffold, and so sent them to their proper Place, where all Rebellions are first laid, and in the end Punish'd. Here then let us see how <hi>Ludlow</hi> palliates this Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which being clear Matter of Fact he had no way to flourish off but with his continu'd Impudence in reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King, <hi>whose violent Ways not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, he fell upon other Measures in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance more moderate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 20. <hi>and to colour his Proceedings with a Form of Law, sent Sir</hi> Edward Herbert <hi>his Attorny Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to accuse of High Treason in the name of his Majesty, Mr.</hi> William Stroud, <hi>&amp;c. and Lord</hi> Kimbolton, <hi>accquainting them, that he intended to proceed against them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law</hi>; and then gives us the Articles which are foul enough, yet not exact to the Original, no where calling them Traytors, as that justly doth: But whatever he further saith as to the House of Commons is altogether a <hi>Chymera</hi> of his own, there were no Foot-steps of it, in all the <hi>Procedure.</hi> His Words are these,
<q>Upon this the House made answer to the Attorny General, that they were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49784:168"/>
the proper Judges of their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: That upon his producing the Articles, if they found Cause, they would leave them to be Proceeded against according to Law; but commanded him at his Peril not to proceed further against them or any other Member, without their Consent.</q>
After which they published a <hi>Declaration</hi> to the same purpose, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 24. upon which Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Author, give me leave to make these few Remarks, as <hi>first.</hi> This Charge of the <hi>Attorny General</hi>'s was given in to the <hi>House of Lords</hi> as a <hi>Court of Iudicature,</hi> whereupon they fell to Debate. 1<hi>st, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Accusation of the Attorny General's be a regular Proceeding.</hi> 2dly, <hi>Whether there were any such Proceedings ever before in this House.</hi> 3dly, <hi>Whether an Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of High Treason may be brought against a Peer of Parliament.</hi> With some others; and yet this blundering Fellow supposes all this to be done in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and frames an Answer accordingly; but any thing will pass with the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> from a confiding Brother, who, perhaps too, will like it the better for being Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous and False. 2<hi>dly,</hi> Supposing that to be their Answer, as it was indeed the Sense of all their <hi>Votes, Speeches,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,</hi> what Law made them Judges
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49784:168"/>
of their own <hi>Members? From the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not so.</hi> Nor 3<hi>dly,</hi> That a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> could not be proceeded against with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their leave, we have been told, that formerly no Priviledges could secure any Member from Justice for <hi>Murder, Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and <hi>Treason</hi>; but now, having made <hi>Prerogative</hi> a <hi>Cypher,</hi> they might add as many as they pleas'd, to Multiply what they thought fit to call their Rights; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in order thereunto methinks they should have repeal'd that scurvy <hi>Proverb,</hi> of <hi>Asking ones Fellow whether he be a Thief.</hi> 4<hi>thly,</hi> Had the Gentlemen accus'd been really Innocent, they need not have made such a Noise and Pudder, nothing could have been a greater Baffle to his Majesty than such an unjust Charge; the contrary is therefore to me <hi>Demonstration.</hi> 5<hi>thly,</hi> The Commons indeed, when the King was gon, fell upon the <hi>Attorny General,</hi> and had him Interrogated at the <hi>Lord's Bar</hi> by a <hi>Committe</hi> of theirs, whereto his Answer not being Satisfactory, they made some angry Resolves, but I cannot any where find he was sent to Prison, for his Proceedings in that Matter, as <hi>Ludlow</hi> saith.</p>
                     <p>Well, the <hi>King</hi> finding the <hi>Lords</hi> afraid to burn their Fingers, by questioning these <hi>Idols</hi> the Rabble so ador'd, took an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49784:169"/>
Course, sent one Mr. <hi>Francis</hi> a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Arms</hi> to the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> to <hi>demand of them, and Arrest of High Treason the five Members,</hi> which was done as order'd, and their Names declar'd; whereupon four Members were order'd to attend his Majesty, and acquaint him, <hi>that the Message was a matter of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and the House would take it into Consideration, with as much speed, as the greatness of the Business will permit:</hi> But notwithstanding their fair Words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of complying herein, Sir <hi>William Fleming</hi> and another Gentleman, who by Warrant from the King had seal'd up the Studies and Trunks of the five <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> were apprehended by Mr. <hi>Speaker's Warrant,</hi> as <hi>Delinquents, and Order'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Serjeant's Custody till further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>; so that it seems they could Commit though the King must not.</p>
                     <p>Neither of these Courses taking effect, his Majesty resolv'd upon a Third, which was to go to the House, and demand them himself; which he did with all the Tenderness and Regard imaginable; for whatever <hi>Ludlow</hi> saith of 3 <hi>or</hi> 4 <hi>Hundred, and amongst them several Desperados enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at</hi> White-hall, the whole number did not consist of above one, the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Pensioners</hi> in Course, with other <hi>Lords
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49784:169"/>
and Gentlemen</hi> then in Attendance, or about <hi>Court,</hi> who were commanded to move no further than the Stairs, nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Violence, though provok'd; <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the Elector Palatine</hi> only, entring in; where he found the <hi>Birds flown,</hi> and the whole House, as soon as he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, flew after them into the City, with a grievous Complaint to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors the Rabble, that they could not speak and act Treason at Pleasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being question'd by his Majesty; in short what a prodigious Advantage the <hi>Faction</hi> made of this just and reasonable Demand, what Out-cries and Revilings follow'd there upon, is altogether unima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, by such as were not Witnesses thereof, so that having fix'd their Party in the City, by tarrying there some Days, they return'd to <hi>Westminster,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd with an hideous cry of <hi>Rabble-Guards</hi> both by Land and Water.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Majesty</hi> seeing it was absolutely impossible to have any Justice done against these accused Persons, who were so surely Intrench'd in the Rabble's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that they were out of the reach of Law; and finding also, that he was in perpetual Danger of having his Person as well as Authority, expos'd to the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Affronts of the deluded <hi>People,</hi> who

all which is true, and that is much; as likewise that the <hi>Declarations on both Sides prov'd inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,</hi> wherein notwithstanding it was observ'd that the <hi>King's</hi> had all the force of <hi>Law, Reason</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi>; theirs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Cant, popular Wheadles,</hi> and <hi>false Suggestions:</hi> He goes on to tell,

The <hi>King</hi> on the other Hand was left destitute of all Things but the <hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>Loyal worthy Gentlemen,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he found more than his <hi>Enemies</hi> ever imagin'd; and were not a little surpris'd at; with which Stock alone, and hopes of <hi>God's Blessing</hi> upon his just <hi>Cause,</hi> he lay'd aside all Thoughts of Treating with those unreasonable Men, for that he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently saw, they resolv'd to seize upou the <hi>Militia</hi> by Force, since they could not obtain it by Perswasion; and their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine Pretences to <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> had been only to gain Time for ripening their Rebellion, of all which he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to let the World know how sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he was, by Publishing his <hi>Grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> from <hi>York</hi>; wherein he saith ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truly,
<q>'twas more than Time after so many Indignities to his Person, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts to his Kingly Office, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Pamphlets against his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to Vindicate himself from those damnable Combinations, and Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49784:171"/>
contriv'd against him;</q>
giving a full Account of his own sincerity as to his many and too gracious Concessions, since they, on the other Side perverted all to <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Treason</hi>: Amongst other Charges he brings one against an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Fellow call'd Sir <hi>Henry Ludlow,</hi> who said Publikly,
<q>That the King was not worthy to be King of <hi>England,</hi> that he hath no Negative Voice, that he is fairly dealt with that he is not depos'd, that if they did that, there would be neither want of Modesty or Duty in them;</q>
upon which I shall only observe that our <hi>Author</hi> could be no <hi>Bastard:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> there tells them further,
<q>how they Committed his great Officers for doing their Duty: Rais'd an Army, and chose <hi>Essex</hi> General, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to destroy all that adher'd to him. Converted the Mony given to discharge the Kingdom's Debts, and for Relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> to carry on their Rebel-War;</q>
whilst his Levying a few <hi>Gentlemen</hi> for his <hi>Guard,</hi> must be Voted <hi>waging War against the Parliament.</hi> Now this <hi>Declaration</hi> was too much to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for <hi>Ludlow</hi> to take Notice of, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any thing else which gives an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Relation, how the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fury</hi> of those Men, engag'd the whole <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49784:172"/>
to Lanch into a <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Blood.</hi> Neither doth he mention how the <hi>King</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire,</hi> &amp;c. to assure the <hi>Gentry</hi> of his upright Intentions, and confirm them in their <hi>Loyalty</hi>: Only his going into <hi>Leicestershire</hi> must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, because he had a <hi>Brother</hi> there, one of the first in <hi>Rebellion</hi> against his <hi>King,</hi> and first taken Prisoner, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us'd than he deserv'd.</p>
                     <p>But tho' <hi>Ludlow</hi> takes no Notice of the <hi>King's Declaration,</hi> he would be sure not to omit the 19 <hi>Propositions</hi> sent by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which 'tis strange he should say were intended <hi>that they might leave no means unattempted to perswade the King to return to them,</hi> p. 30. whereas he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately adds, and more truly, <hi>much of the Parliaments Intentions appear'd in them, and they were in effect the principal Foundation of the ensuing War</hi>; for which Reason he thinks it not amiss to recite them at large; it had been more Candid, and <hi>Historian</hi> like, to have recited the <hi>King's Answer</hi> too, so full and express, as they never thought of any other <hi>Reply</hi> but by <hi>Essex's Army,</hi> and therefore no wonder if omitted here. Amongst other things the King tells them, <q>some of their Demands are in the Style not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Equals, but Conquerors, and tend
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49784:172"/>
so far to the Subversion of this equal, well-pois'd Government as to make him from King of <hi>England,</hi> a Duke of <hi>Venice</hi>; and this of a Kingdom a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:</q>
And in that which we may call another <hi>Answer,</hi> those <hi>Divine Meditations</hi> of his, he declares,
<q>How in all those Propositions little or nothing could be observ'd, of any Laws dis-joynted, which ought to be restor'd; of any Right invaded, of any Justice obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, of any Compensations to be made, of any impartial Reformation to be granted; to all or any of which, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Religion, and true Policy, or any other Humane Motives might induce him: But the main Matters propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which is either great Novelty, or Difficulty, relate to what were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly look'd upon as Factions in the State, or Schisms in the Church, and so punishable by the Laws; though now they have the Confidence, by vulgar Clamors and Assistance, to demand not only Toleration of themselves, in their Vanity, Novelty, and Confusion; but also Abolition of the Laws against them; and a total Extirpation of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whose Rights they have a mind to invade.</q>
Thus solidly did his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> refel the little <hi>Rebel Flourishes</hi> of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49784:173"/>
                        <hi>Westminster Iunto,</hi> and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they were deliver'd to the <hi>King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Success,</hi> they knew before-hand he had more <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> than to grant them; otherwise would not have caus'd them, to be presented; and if he thought as <hi>Ludlow</hi> would perswade us he did, <hi>as good terms as these might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, if reduc'd to the last Extremity,</hi> he had great Reason so to do, for doubtless no one breathing did then so much as dream of, or imagin that <hi>execrable Act,</hi> their continu'd draughts of Blood did in the end prompt them unto.</p>
                     <p>In which unnatural <hi>Broils</hi> of <hi>State Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide,</hi> and <hi>Domestick Fury</hi> as I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my self no further than this base Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and his Comrades, reflect upon the Memory of our <hi>Royal Martyr</hi>; So I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but observe his Design hath been all along hitherto to manage his <hi>Lyes</hi> with so much Art and Cunning, as to make the <hi>King</hi> according to the Procedure of their horrid <hi>High Court of Iustice,</hi> the first Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressor and Promoter of the War: The <hi>Parliament</hi> were as Innocent as an <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> of so many <hi>Devils,</hi> and desir'd only to do with him and his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> his <hi>Queeu, Children,</hi> and his <hi>Friends</hi> as they pleas'd, which his Stubbornness refusing, the Charge their <hi>Insolencies</hi> had assum'd to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49784:173"/>
themselves, resolv'd to force him, as they really did, which yet he (<hi>Ludlow</hi>) would have turn'd upon them: What I shall first mention, tho' there are several such like Hints before is <hi>p.</hi> 16. <hi>The King hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid his Designs in</hi> Ireland, <hi>as will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward appear, was not without great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, prevail'd upon by the Parliament, to consent to the Disbanding those eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Irish Papist, that had been rais'd there by the Earl of</hi> Strafford: How far that <hi>Army</hi> was from being <hi>Irish Papists</hi> will appear from this, that all the <hi>Irish Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> of that <hi>Perswasion,</hi> agreed with the <hi>Faction</hi> in our two <hi>Houses</hi> here to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Disbanding that <hi>Army,</hi> which had it been kept on Foot, the <hi>Rebellion</hi> could not have Succeeded there, nor consequently here. The next Instance I shall give is <hi>p.</hi> 22. <hi>The King's violent Ways not succeeding, he fell upon other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in appearance more moderate,</hi> &amp;c. What violent Ways were these? Why those few <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> and other <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> who proffer'd their Attendance to secure him from the <hi>Insolency</hi> of the <hi>Tumults,</hi> (which this bad Man, for whom no bad Name is bad enough) takes no Notice of, though got up to that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious hight as the <hi>King</hi> could not think those, and all his other Friends able to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49784:174"/>
secure him at <hi>White-Hall.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s demanding <hi>the Five Members,</hi> p. 25. <hi>The Parliament-sensible of this Violation of their Priviledges, and fearing they might be further intrenched upon,</hi> &amp;c. a strong Violation that, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Traytors</hi> to <hi>Iustice,</hi> but 'twas their Interest to oppose it, otherwise they might have all follow'd: For having related, after their many other Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how well the <hi>Parliament</hi> approv'd Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham's Conduct,</hi> declaring <hi>he had done well in denying the King admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into</hi> Hull, 'tis added next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, <hi>p.</hi> 29. <hi>The Parliament began now to provide for the securing of all Places</hi>; whereas there was not a Place of any Importance, they had not secur'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; even to <hi>York</hi> it self, in which, by his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s too great Passiveness, they had a <hi>Committee</hi> to observe and beard all his Undertakings.</p>
                     <p>And this brings me to the last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this modest Man's Veracity, p. 38.
<q>The King having set up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham</hi> the 24th of <hi>August,</hi> 1642,</q>
for he tells us to a Day, and 'tis well he doth,
<q>The Parliament thought themselves oblig'd to make some Preparations to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</q>
whereas in the <hi>Paragraph</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49784:174"/>
precedent, he declar'd how <hi>the Fire began to break out in the West,</hi> what success the <hi>Earl of Bedford</hi> had there upon the <hi>Parliament</hi> Account, and how the <hi>Governour of</hi> Portsmouth <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the King, that was besieg'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by their Forces.</hi> And for a fuller Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of this, let us compute the time of raising these <hi>Forces; Essex</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a <hi>Guard</hi> to the <hi>Parliament</hi> had been levying Men all that <hi>Spring</hi>; on the tenth of <hi>Iune</hi> the <hi>Order</hi> past both <hi>Houses</hi> for the <hi>Citizens</hi> to bring in their Plate, to carry on the <hi>War,</hi> which they did most zealously; on the 9th <hi>of September, Essex</hi> march'd out of <hi>London,</hi> in a great deal of Pomp, having all his <hi>Masters</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, 16000 strong; very little more than a Fortnight after the <hi>King</hi> set up his <hi>Standard,</hi> where there did not appear the fourth part of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Number. But the <hi>Parliament</hi> had got that common artifice of all bad Men, to <hi>cry Whore first,</hi> as the <hi>Proverb</hi> expresses it, inflame the <hi>Peoples</hi> Minds with Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Designs, that the <hi>King</hi> intended to levy War against them; whereas 'twas design'd against the King, who most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declar'd from <hi>York</hi> how far his Desires, and Thoughts were from it; and had this attested by more than forty
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49784:175"/>
Lords then with him, how <hi>they saw no<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any colour of Preparations or Counsels that might reasonably beget the Belief of any such Design; and were fully perswaded his Majesty had no such intention:</hi> But when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood what preparations they were making at <hi>London,</hi> and indeed every where else, that <hi>Hotham</hi> had deny'd him, <hi>Hull,</hi> and <hi>Essex</hi> was coming to take him from his Evil Counsellors, then he thought himself oblig'd, <hi>to make some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for himself</hi>; that I may turn <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's</hi> impudent Falshood into Truth.</p>
                     <p>But suppose the <hi>King</hi> had begun sooner as 'tis great pity he did not, exerted the just right of his Prerogative, and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, against the many encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they daily made, and unknown Priviledges they constantly assum'd, all the Laws of God and Man would have born him out therein. For most Men of Sense long before the Sword was drawn, clearly discover'd, nothing would satisfy them but a total Subversion of the whole Government. An honest Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man expostulating with Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> upon the King's many Concessions what they could expect further, he reply'd, <hi>they expected he should commit himself, and all that was his to their care</hi>; an exact Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of what the <hi>Wolves</hi> propounded, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49784:175"/>
if the <hi>Sheep</hi> would put away their <hi>Dogs,</hi> they would be very careful of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; and though the Proposal did not take, yet the Design was carryed on, and the Nation, most abominably wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, the just Judgment of Heaven giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to the cursed credulity of an infatuated People who could take none but <hi>Wolves</hi> for their Protectors.</p>
                     <p>As I have already declar'd to be no further concern'd in this dismal <hi>Scene</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Slaughter</hi> than the <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> is concern'd; so I must further add, that whatever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations our <hi>Author</hi> makes, as to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Battle, or other considerable war-like Action, is so Lame, Partial, and False, as the Diurnals of those times (which nevertheless ly'd most abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on each side) may pass for Authentick <hi>History,</hi> in comparison with him. But then for his own dear Self, as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Warder Castle,</hi> and other little Atchievements in <hi>Willshire,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, (in which too, generally, his rashness brought him by the <hi>Lee</hi>) the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he gives is so vain and fulsome, trivial and tedious, that 'tis hard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve whether he makes the greater Discovery of his <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>Folly,</hi> to be sure they are both very transcendent.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49784:176"/>
The <hi>Vindicator of Ol. Cr.</hi> exposes him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briskly for those many impertinent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigyricks upon himself, and will have it a plain Demonstration, of the <hi>Narrowness of his Soul and the Lowness of his Genius</hi>; and I fancy, he might have added, the <hi>Insolency of his Temper.</hi> To confirm what I said of a lame and partial Account of Things, his Relation of that first <hi>Battle</hi> at <hi>Edge-Hill</hi> is a full Testimony, where this Man of <hi>Iron</hi> owns himself at a loss from his <hi>Troop,</hi> at the beginning, and tells little but his own wanderings up and down to find them: Yet by all means the Victory must be theirs, and there was a great Defect somewhere, the Fight was not renew'd next Day, whereas such as were in it had enough the Day before; and he intimates as much by saying,
<q>that Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> taking advantage of the Disorder our own Horse had put the Foot into, press'd upon them with such Fury, that he put them to Flight. And then adds, If the time which he spent in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them too far, and plundering the Waggons, had been employ'd in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Advantages as offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Place where the Fight was, it might have prov'd more serviceable to the carrying on the Enemies De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49784:176"/>
                           <bibl>p. 50.</bibl>
                        </q>
Which is very modestly express'd because to the <hi>King's</hi> prejudice, otherwise he might have said, had not the <hi>Prince</hi> been guilty of that gross <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, Neglect,</hi> or <hi>Rashness,</hi> for 'twas all in one, that Day had in great Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, put an end to the Dispute; the <hi>Army</hi> had never return'd to their <hi>Masters</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> nor our <hi>Author</hi> any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to trouble the World with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency of his <hi>Memoirs</hi>: for to speak-freely, yet nothing but Truth, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces indescretions of that Kind, his great <hi>Courage,</hi> and little <hi>Conduct,</hi> in whatsoever <hi>Battles</hi> he engag'd in, conduc'd more to the discomfiture of the <hi>King's</hi> just <hi>Cause,</hi> than all the <hi>Rebel Forces,</hi> or whatever other <hi>Arm of Flesh</hi> appear'd against him, as may be further on observ'd.</p>
                     <p>However that their Advantage was not considerable, appears from what he further adds, <hi>that the Army return'd to</hi> London, <hi>not like Men that had obtained a Victory, but as if they had been beaten,</hi> p. 52. which is a shrewd Circumstance that they were so, and to that he joyns another every way as considerable; <hi>upon the King's advance with part of his Army to</hi> Maydenhead, <hi>or there abouts</hi> (for it was really <hi>Colebrook,</hi> and those seven Miles were a considerable Addition to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach)
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49784:177"/>
                        <hi>the Parliament sent to him, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him their earnest Desire to prevent the effusion of more Blood, and to procure a right understanding between his Majesty and them.</hi> A certain <hi>Omen</hi> they were not much transporteed with the <hi>Victory,</hi> this being the <hi>first last</hi> time, they began a <hi>Motion</hi> for <hi>Peace:</hi> He goes on,
<q>The King profess'd in his Answer to desire nothing more, upon which they thought themselves secure; whereas the next Day he took the Advantage of a Mist, and March'd within half a Mile of <hi>Brandford</hi> before discover'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                           <bibl>p. 53.</bibl> and beat off what Forces were there;</q>
though he tells us they made a brave Defence. This coming by way of surprise, he calls <hi>Treachery,</hi> and all the <hi>Round-heads</hi> about Town made a loud <hi>Clamor</hi> upon the <hi>King's</hi> forfeiture of his <hi>Royal Word</hi>; whereas upon enquiry all the <hi>Trick</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi> was on their side; for as they propounded no <hi>Cessation</hi> of <hi>Arms</hi> in their <hi>Petition,</hi> so the <hi>King</hi> had <hi>News</hi> brought, <hi>that</hi> Essex <hi>was drawing his Forces, and Ordinance out of</hi> London <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him,</hi> so that without seizing <hi>Brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> their Forces at <hi>Windsor, Kingston,</hi> and <hi>Acton,</hi> might have hemm'd him in, and his Army depriv'd both of Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Subsisting: So that after a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49784:177"/>
Paper <hi>Scuffle</hi> upon the Matter, the <hi>Parliament</hi> were forc'd to own,
<q>That they gave direction to the Earl of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> to draw the Army out of <hi>London,</hi> and that part of it was at <hi>Brandford</hi> whilst the Committee was with the King;</q>
and conscious to themselves of a just <hi>exception</hi> cautiously add,
<q>That they sent a Messenger to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Majesty intended forbearance of Hostility, but he found them in fight, and could not pass <hi>Brandford.</hi>
                        </q>
So that having kept up the <hi>Ferment</hi> among their <hi>City Gulls</hi> by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>Slander,</hi> which our impudent <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> calls the <hi>treacherous Design of the late Expedition,</hi> they again sent <hi>Propositions to</hi> Oxford, <hi>being the same in effect with those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at</hi> York, <hi>but they found no better Reception than the others had done,</hi> p. 56. Neither did they expect otherwise, or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed desire, considering the insolency of their Demands, which the King tells them in his <hi>Answer,</hi>
                        <q>Had he not given up all the Faculties of his Soul to an earnest endeavour of Peace and Reconciliation &amp;c. he could not but resent their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Charges, and not suffer the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches cast upon him:</q>
The whole procedure of that <hi>Treaty</hi> may be seen in <hi>Whitlock's Memoirs,</hi> who treats the <hi>King</hi>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:49784:178"/>
like a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and speaks Truth where himself was concern'd, for neither of which this our <hi>Brute</hi> hath the least Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, nay seems wilfully to defy both. I must not here omit what that scribling Fellow, K. <hi>Ch. No Saint, nor Martyr,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; That he took a most Bloody and Treacherous Advantage of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Army near <hi>Colebrook,</hi> whilst he was under Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> with them, p. 4. whereas the Treaty at <hi>Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> was more than Two Years after. Would the present Age be content with such licentious Impudence to Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, and expose them in the next?</p>
                     <p>In this Year 43 our <hi>Governor</hi> of <hi>Warder Castle</hi> before he falls upon his great Charge, and weighty Atchievements there, gives a cursory Relation of what pass'd in other Parts. <hi>In the Spring,</hi> he saith, <hi>our Army was Master of the Field; The King making it his Business to be on the defensive, till the Queen should arrive with an Army to his assistance,</hi> p. 58. and when her Army was come with other <hi>Necssa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was in the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest Condition of the whole Four Years, for so long the contest was in dispute; and had there not been Neglect, Treachery, or both, amongst his <hi>Councils,</hi> either of State or War, he had unnestled the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>

In relating how the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> took <hi>Reading,</hi> it must not be omitted that Sir <hi>Arthur Ashton a Papist was Governour therof,</hi> to which I shall add that Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> had been brought up a <hi>Soldier</hi> in <hi>Foreign Wars,</hi> a Person of good Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who as soon as he found we were running into his Bloody Profession, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his Service to the King, more than once, who as often reply'd, that <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had brought such a Slander upon him in reference to those of his Perswasion, it would much prejudice his Cause to imploy him:</hi> at length he came to the King and shewed him a Letter, wherein <hi>Essex</hi> profferd him a <hi>Command</hi> in the <hi>Parliament Army,</hi> and told his Majesty plainly <hi>that he was a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Fortune, and that if he could not be entertained on the one side, he would betake himself to the other</hi>; and by this Means he became <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Reading:</hi> for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as they had several <hi>Papists</hi> in their Service, so 'twas nothing but a vile Interest made them reject the rest, force them into the <hi>King's</hi> Quarters, that they might have the benefit of their Estates, and the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>Odium</hi> of their <hi>Company.</hi> In the mean while I would
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49784:179"/>
gladly know whether a <hi>Loyal Papist</hi> be not a better Man, ay and <hi>Christian</hi> too, than a <hi>Rebel Protestant</hi>; to be sure <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> and his Gang agreed with them in the most exploded, and pernicious <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> was ever laid to their Charge, and what but few of them, and that very clandestinely have maintain'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Deposing,</hi> and <hi>Murdering Kings</hi>; for which Reason I look upon him, as a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Man than <hi>Fryar Iacob,</hi> or <hi>Ravillac,</hi> and the whole set of <hi>Regicides,</hi> the most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable <hi>Assembly</hi> that ever met, since the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> preferr'd <hi>Barabbas</hi>; to be sure they brought upon the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the greatest <hi>Reproach Hell</hi> its self could suggest, and yet for ought I see not only the Reproach but the Practice is like to continue.</p>
                     <p>Though <hi>Essex</hi> was Master of the Field in <hi>Spring,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> had the Command all Summer, his Forces making so great a Progress in the <hi>West</hi> as to take <hi>Exeter, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol,</hi> and many other considerable places, give a total defeat to Sir <hi>Will. Waller</hi> at <hi>Devizes,</hi> and so clear'd all those Parts from any Enemy in a <hi>Body,</hi> as indeed they had none at <hi>London</hi>; hereupon it was debated in several Councils, of War and private Cabals, whether was best, to march directly thither or to stay and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49784:179"/>
take <hi>Glocester</hi> first, the only place of any considerable Strength, which remain'd to the Enemy in those Parts; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vogue went for the <hi>March,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry considerable Reasons urg'd for it, both <hi>Essex's,</hi> and <hi>Waller's Armies,</hi> were crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled away, the City of <hi>London</hi> in Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, an Insurrection in <hi>Kent</hi> for the King, the Lords voting a Treaty, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in dismal Frights. On the other side it was urg'd how ill it would look to leave such a place behind them, that 'twas ill situated, and not well fortified, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Men, so that a few Days would certainly make the King <hi>Master</hi> thereof, long before the Enemy could get a Recruit, much less <hi>March</hi> so far to relieve it: Of this Perswasion was <hi>Prince Rupert,</hi> and most of the <hi>Sword-men,</hi> which made some suspect they fear'd the <hi>War</hi> would be done too soon, and were the more confirm'd therein, for that the <hi>Siege</hi> was carryed on at such a slow rate; so that after a whole Month of precious time lost, and <hi>Essex</hi> appearing unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly with a considerable <hi>Army,</hi> they were forc'd to raise the Siege. I have been told a Passage much credited by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in those times; that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the <hi>King</hi> made that fatal halt, a certain <hi>Peer</hi> finding <hi>Essex</hi> very pensive
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49784:180"/>
in the <hi>Lords Lobby,</hi> ask'd him <hi>how Affairs went?</hi> He reply'd, <hi>very ill, and they must be all ruin'd, unless the King could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to lie down before</hi> Glocester, <hi>which he hop'd by one Engine to bring about</hi>; what or who that <hi>Engine</hi> was the World is yet to learn; but that there were too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such about his <hi>Majesty,</hi> appear'd in most undertakings he engag'd in. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the <hi>Battle</hi> upon their Retreat, at <hi>Newberry,</hi> so advantagiously manag'd as it might have been, for the <hi>Royal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> having happily got Possession of the <hi>Town,</hi> and consequently stood in their way to <hi>London,</hi> should have been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the <hi>Defensive,</hi> so plac'd their <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,</hi> and lin'd the Hedges, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty should have been on the <hi>Enemy's</hi> side to force their Passage, which they must either have done or starv'd, for to my certain information, in the <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage</hi> where they were oblig'd to stop two Miles <hi>West</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi> they had neither <hi>Bread,</hi> nor <hi>Drink,</hi> not somuch as <hi>Water,</hi> it having been a dry Season, the Ponds were little else than <hi>Puddle,</hi> the Springs low, and the few <hi>Wells</hi> so soon drain'd, as several <hi>Officers</hi> did proffer a handful of <hi>Money</hi> for a <hi>Pint</hi> of clear Water; so that it must be right down <hi>Grinning Honour,</hi> as <hi>Hudibras</hi> terms it, which put the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers</hi> upon attacquing them in their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49784:180"/>
thick Hedges, or otherwise coming within reach of their <hi>Cannon,</hi> which let alone, they must have try'd to <hi>Eat</hi>; yet at this rate Things were carryed till ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost a great many <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Brave Gentlemen,</hi> and their <hi>Ammunition</hi> almost Spent, they withdrew into the <hi>Town,</hi> and set the <hi>Enemy</hi> a free return, more than they expected, or to be sure deserv'd.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> ends this Year with bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Scots,</hi> and relates how prettily Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> trick'd them,
<q>In removing the last and greatest difficulty, about some doubtful Words in the Covenant which was to be taken by both Nations, concerning the Preservation of the King's Person, and reducing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline of both Churches to the Pattern of the best Reformed;</q>
For which Sir <hi>H.</hi> 
                        <q>found an expedient, by adding to the first Clause, In <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Laws of the Land, and Liberty of the Subject:</hi> And to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>According to the Word of God,</hi> 
                           <bibl>p. 79</bibl>.</q> and by this <hi>Evasion</hi> look'd upon themselves as oblig'd by neither,
but left free to <hi>Murther</hi> their <hi>King,</hi> and use the <hi>Covenant</hi> as it deserv'd. He saith like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>that for their, the Scots Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Lords and Commons sentenc'd, and caus'd Execution upon</hi> William Laud, <hi>Arch-Bishop
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49784:181"/>
of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>their Capital Enemy.</hi> Which nevertheless was not till that time <hi>Twelve-month</hi>; however done it was, and perhaps thought a very <hi>Christian act,</hi> by such as had nothing thereof. And here to put his <hi>Murthers</hi> together, we are also told Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham and his Son, were condemn'd to lose their Heads,</hi> for they could make <hi>Treason</hi> in reference to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at pleasure, though the King was not to be heard upon the justest Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet this is certain, had not they acted that <hi>Treason</hi> against the King, there could have been no occasion for the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> pretences. Sir <hi>Alexander Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew was also beheaded for endeavouring to betray</hi> Plimouth; whereupon I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this passage, that Worthy Brave <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> Sir <hi>Bevill Greenvil,</hi> was Knight of the <hi>Shire</hi> for <hi>Cornwal,</hi> with this Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> and upon the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Business, came to him with this request; <hi>I pray Sir</hi> Alexander <hi>let it not be said the Representatives of our County, had any thing to do in the Blood of this Great Man</hi>; Whereto he reply'd with much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>I will vote for the Bill, though sure my Head were to be Cut off on the same Block,</hi> which accordingly fell out. Could the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> meet with any thing like such Instances of <hi>Divine Vengeance</hi> on the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49784:181"/>
other side, what a Noise would they make? what an <hi>Annus Mirabilis</hi> should we be plagu'd withal?</p>
                     <p>In this following Year 44. <hi>Ludlow</hi> scarce finds occasion to make one Invective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his <hi>Majesty</hi>; the Misfortune, or as he would have it <hi>Mismanagement</hi> of their own Affairs, took up all the <hi>Gall</hi> he had to <hi>vent,</hi> tho' very well stor'd therewith: For now I perceive the <hi>Independent, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth Party</hi> both in <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> began to <hi>pique</hi> at <hi>Essex</hi>; indeed all the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> in <hi>Command,</hi> and most of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> as <hi>Linsy-woolsy Brothers,</hi> which did their Business by halfs. His greatest Disgust is that <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> divided their <hi>Army,</hi> yet owns that <hi>Waller</hi> had the more <hi>Forces</hi> when routed at <hi>Cropredy-Bridge</hi>; and the <hi>King's Forces</hi> were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prevalent in the <hi>West,</hi> so that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was lay'd well enough, only the foremention'd <hi>Rout</hi> gave the <hi>King</hi> an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of following <hi>Essex,</hi> to his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Defeat in <hi>Cornwal</hi>; where his <hi>Majesty</hi> was put upon another most destructive <hi>Halt,</hi> in lying down before <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and not marching up to <hi>London,</hi> by which Delay the two shatter'd <hi>Armies</hi> had time to recruit, and the <hi>Foot</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> had seiz'd in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> being discharg'd upon Condition, never to take <hi>Armes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49784:182"/>
him more, were absolv'd by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy,</hi> and the other <hi>Presbyterian Iesuits,</hi> and so took up <hi>Arms</hi> again, which (<hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> commends for an <hi>Heroick Act,</hi>) and fought like <hi>perjur'd Villains,</hi> who knew they ought to be hang'd if taken. But the greatest Prejudice to his <hi>Majesty's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi> this Year, was <hi>Prince Rupert</hi>'s rash Conduct, and consequent Defeat at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston Moor,</hi> which lost most of the <hi>North,</hi> and gave part of the <hi>Rebel Army</hi> leisure to return, and obstruct his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Progress in the <hi>West</hi>: The two <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> meeting, a second time about <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> reliev'd <hi>Denington Castle,</hi> and proffer'd Battel: But the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel Generals</hi> disagreeing amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, it was not accepted; whereupon he March'd to <hi>Oxford</hi>; and they, disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their <hi>Army</hi> to <hi>London.</hi> His Majesty upon both his Successes, at <hi>Cropredy Bridge,</hi> and in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> sent Overtures of Peace to the Men at <hi>Westminster,</hi> which were coldly receiv'd; yet being further press'd by him from <hi>Oxford,</hi> they could not but comply, to have a Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> but to little Purpose; for though the <hi>King's Commissioners</hi> consented to many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and Alterations of great Importance, the others would not abate one tittle, but insisted peremtorily upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49784:182"/>
first Propositions, which were an Absolute, Dissolution of all <hi>Old Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishments,</hi> indeed the <hi>whole Frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> both <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil:</hi> So that all <hi>Ludlow</hi>'s Flourish upon this Occasion is false, and mention'd only to express his continu'd Spite at the <hi>Church,</hi> as if the <hi>Treaty</hi> came to nothing upon that sole Account, that the Proposition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was rejected; <hi>p.</hi> 150. whereas they were as positive, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Militia, Ireland,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else came under Debate. It had likewise been a great Omission in such a foul-mouth'd Fellow as himself, to have pass'd by, what that <hi>Lecturing Beautifeu Love</hi> preach'd in the <hi>Town</hi> whilst the <hi>Treaty</hi> was on Foot, although every Word he saith of the Matter is as false, as what the other preach'd; for <hi>first</hi> he was not <hi>Chaplain</hi> attending the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Commissioners</hi>; for when the <hi>King's Commissioners</hi> complained of his <hi>Treasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Insolence,</hi> they answer'd he was not of their <hi>Train</hi>; neither in the <hi>Second Place</hi> is it probable the <hi>Preachment</hi> was before the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> for it was a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> on the <hi>Market-Day,</hi> and they had something else to attend. Nor <hi>Thirdly,</hi> were the Words spoken as he relates, that <hi>the King was a Man of Blood,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49784:183"/>
they were not come to that height of Impudence, till the <hi>Independents</hi> were <hi>Trump,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> in their <hi>Hands,</hi> and therefore as it was related, when <hi>complain'd</hi> of, the <hi>Words</hi> run thus, <hi>That the Commissioners came with Hearts full of Blood, and there was as great distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Treaty, and Peace, as Heaven and Hell.</hi> I shall only add further, that when <hi>Ludlow</hi> and his <hi>Complices</hi> had <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and assum'd the <hi>Power,</hi> they <hi>cut off</hi> Love's <hi>Head,</hi> though upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Account; yet not without the just <hi>Reflections</hi> of many, as a retaliating <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> for his <hi>Seditions,</hi> and <hi>Bloody Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> with so much <hi>Untruth</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,</hi> vented here.</p>
                     <p>We are come now to that unhappy Year 45. wherein <hi>Ludlow</hi> according to his no <hi>Divinity,</hi> would have <hi>Iudgment given against the King, by that Power to which both Parties had made their solemn Appeal</hi>; for though indeed it put an End to the Fighting Part between <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet thereby the <hi>Nation</hi> did but <hi>Triumph</hi> over its self, and <hi>perish,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> of Old, <hi>suis &amp; ipsa viribus</hi>; the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd <hi>Factions</hi> being the more at leisure, to foment their <hi>Feuds,</hi> and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply those <hi>Distractions,</hi> which the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> now saw, and were sorry for, but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49784:183"/>
could not prevent. The first Onset the <hi>Independents</hi> gave the other <hi>Iunto,</hi> was the <hi>Self-denying Ordinance,</hi> which our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> handles very Tenderly, yet cannot forbear to let us know. By this means the Earl of <hi>Essex, Manchester,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller, were laid aside, the latter rather to show their Impartiality, than from any distrust of him, he having never disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to that Time, any Inclination to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the King's Cause,</hi> p. 146. The Truth of it is, the two former were sensible, with several of their Confederates, to how deplorable a Condition they had brought Affairs, <hi>sed revocare gradum</hi>; but to set them right, heal the Wounds, repair the Breaches they had made, 'twas as much beyond their Power, as to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it without something of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Satisfaction that he mentions, <hi>about the same time the Parliament made Sir</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Fairfax <hi>General, the King made Prince</hi> Rupert <hi>so of his Forces, notwithstanding his late ill Success at</hi> Marston Moor,<note place="margin">Short Life of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> by <hi>P. H.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>p.</hi> 148. whereto I find a much honester Man adding, <hi>his apparent want of Age, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Conduct for so great a Trust.</hi> I say this was probably mention'd with no little <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> because that <hi>Prince's Rashness,</hi> and <hi>Indiscretion,</hi> contributed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49784:184"/>
more than any one Thing, to their curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Success</hi> at the <hi>fatal Naseby,</hi> which he gives an Account of with great Insult; but what he adds, <hi>that it was the more astonishing, because obtain'd by Men of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Experience in Affairs of that Nature, and upon that Account despis'd by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is false</hi>; besides several Old <hi>Soldiers,</hi> there were few or none but had had the Experience of <hi>three Years War,</hi> and if that will not inform any Man of Sense, I would advise him to follow some more <hi>innocent Imployment</hi>: Neither were they despis'd by their <hi>Enemy,</hi> but look'd upon as the best <hi>Body</hi> of Men the <hi>Parliament</hi> ever had together; notwithstanding which, had not <hi>Prince Rupert</hi> given <hi>Cromwel</hi> the same Advantage here, as before at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston-Moor,</hi> it might have prov'd the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding Battel</hi> to the <hi>King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what Compleated the <hi>Triumph</hi> to their unworthy, mean-spirited <hi>Souls,</hi> was <hi>the taking his Majesty's Cabinet, with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Letters in it, most of them to the Queen,</hi> which they Published to their eternal <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> and this Fellow with like Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness revives here again. The <hi>Grecians</hi> in their Wars with <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> a <hi>Foreign Prince,</hi> and most <hi>unjust Usurper</hi> upon his Neighbours, having intercepted a Pacquet of his <hi>Letters,</hi> of the rest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49784:184"/>
they made what use they could, but those to his <hi>Queen,</hi> they never offer'd to open, but sent them back with all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and Tenderest regard imaginable; how much those Heathen <hi>Greeks</hi> out-did our <hi>Christian Barbarians</hi> is very unhappy to reflect: Yet not at all strange that <hi>Ludlow</hi> should continue the same inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane way of Procedure, 'tis as Natural to him as <hi>Poyson</hi> to a <hi>Toad,</hi> although he is much put to it, to find any thing there which may feed that base <hi>Humor</hi>; what he urgeth of the <hi>Lord</hi> Digby's <hi>Letter, that the Design of making War upon the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, was therein discover'd to be early,</hi> is absolutely false, <hi>p.</hi> 154. for it was after the <hi>Tumults</hi> had forc'd the <hi>King</hi> from <hi>White-Hall</hi>; the <hi>Parliament</hi> had fix'd their <hi>Guards,</hi> and were securing the <hi>Militia,</hi> &amp;c. and then `twas time for his <hi>Majesty</hi> to consult his Friends, and look to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But I find our <hi>Author</hi> very forward to catch at every thing which may tend in the least to make the <hi>King</hi> first Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor, wherein his many Fetches have as ill Success, as that of the <hi>Commission</hi> with Sir <hi>Phelim Oneal.</hi> He adds, <hi>besides the many Printed, others of no less Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence were suppress'd, as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, by some of those that were intrusted with them, who since the King's return have
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49784:185"/>
been rewarded for it,</hi> p. 156. The little Truth herein stands thus: A Person im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by the <hi>Parliament</hi> to <hi>uncypher</hi> those <hi>Letters,</hi> found several <hi>Figures</hi> he could not compass, and so was forc'd to let them stand; and to save his <hi>Bacon</hi> upon the <hi>Restaration,</hi> alledg'd it a design'd <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> in regard to his <hi>Majesty's Honor</hi> and <hi>Reputaution,</hi> which nevertheless few or none believ'd, he being then as zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and forward in the <hi>Faction</hi> as any, though to so little Purpose, as he hath, since run into the contrary Extream of as great <hi>Indifferency</hi>; neither do I believe he had any other reward, than what the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Indemnity</hi> oblig'd him with; which was too much to a great many, unless they had made more grateful Returns.</p>
                     <p>But whatever was really writ, or their venemous Rancor think fit to Comment thereupon, all Men of Honour and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue must acknowledge, what his <hi>Majesty</hi> writ to <hi>Secretary Nicholas,</hi> and publish'd in a <hi>Declaration</hi> upon that Account,
<q>that the Papers contain nothing an honest Man, or good Protestant may blush at, yet would fain know that Person, who would be willing the Freedom of his private Letters should be publickly seen, as mine have been, however (so that one Clause be rightly understood)
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49784:185"/>
I care not so the rest take their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; it is concerning the Mongrel Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The Truth is, the Earl of <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> his Factiousness at that time, put me somewhat out of Patience, which made me freely vent my Displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those of his Party, to my Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This Expression I find <hi>Ludlow</hi> and his Fellow <hi>Libellers</hi> more than once carping at, which yet cannot be stretch'd further than that some <hi>cross-grain'd</hi> Dispositions might be among them, who having some <hi>Ferment</hi> of the <hi>Westminster Leven, halted</hi> between both Parties, for whom no <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet</hi> could be more proper than that of <hi>Mongrel,</hi> and with too many such the <hi>King</hi> was plagu'd: Upon the whole there was no one thing expos'd the <hi>Factions</hi> more to <hi>Obloquy</hi> and <hi>Scorn</hi> than this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Act, all their own Party, who had any regard for <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> were asham'd of it; and such as more narrowly look'd into things, observ'd there such a <hi>Royal</hi> Mixture of <hi>Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Great Iudgment,</hi> as considering him in those several Respects of <hi>Husband, Father, Master,</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> it would be hard to find his Parallel: Afterwards when at too much leisure, in his Confinement, he pen'd that Excellent <hi>Meditation</hi> of his, upon this their inhumane Usage, which

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49784:186"/>
should cordially submit, and take the <hi>National Covenant</hi> appointed by <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi>; and therefore it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd that such as stood out and yeilded not but by force upon their <hi>Garrisons,</hi> obtain'd much better Terms from the <hi>Commanders</hi> and <hi>Generals,</hi> than others found from those <hi>Sneaking</hi> Fellows at <hi>Westminster,</hi> who indeed would be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times angry at it, especially the <hi>Oxford Articles</hi>; but the <hi>Army</hi> beginning to grow <hi>Masterless,</hi> they must begin to let them have their Humor.

                     <p>THE <hi>King</hi>'s being withdrawn from <hi>Oxon,</hi> and not known whither gon, made a mighty Disturbance amongst the <hi>Grandees</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi>;
<hi>Ludlow</hi> tells us, <q>they suspected he might design to come to <hi>London,</hi> to raise a Party against them, publishing an Ordinance, that whosoever should harbour or conceal the King's Person, should be Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against as a Traytor to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; <bibl>

By what <hi>Law</hi> this I beseech you? The truth of it is, the Expences and other Mischiefs by the <hi>War,</hi> had made the <hi>City</hi> so sensible of their former <hi>Infatuations</hi>; that 'twas ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believ'd had the <hi>King</hi> appear'd amongst them, the <hi>Rabble</hi> as well as more sensible Part of Men, would have endeavour'd their utmost to set him upon his <hi>Throne</hi>; but 'tis easier to pull down, than build up, to make, than retrieve, <hi>Alterations,</hi> as appear'd afterward when the <hi>Army</hi> so tamely rid them. But in few Days they were freed from that Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49784:187"/>
though not more surpris'd at his Loss, than to find him in the <hi>Scotch Hands,</hi> who would be sure to make the best of so good a <hi>Prise.</hi> There had been no small <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trasts</hi> between them and their <hi>English</hi> Brethren before, who finding the fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Work nigh over, were desirous to be quit of some of their own Forces, much more of such troublesome, and chargable <hi>Hirelings:</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Side,
as <hi>Ludlow</hi> tells us, <q>repeated their Instances, for a Consideration of the Articles of Religion contained in the Covenant, to give a speedy Peace to his Majesty, to pay them near two hundred thousand Pounds, which they pretended to be due for their <hi>Arrears,</hi> and make a just Estimate of the Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they had sustain'd by <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> &amp;c. which they computed at more than the former Sum, <bibl>

He goes on to relate, <q>how the Parliament thought it not convenient to comply with the King's Propositions; demanded an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Account of what was due to them, and requir'd that they would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Garrisons from such Places as they possest in <hi>England.</hi> Some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences he saith likewise there were with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners, about the King's Concern in the Militia; their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49784:188"/>
intermedling with the Government of <hi>England,</hi> the Education of the King's Children, the disbanding the Army, and an Act of Oblivion; in which Matters the Parliament would not have the <hi>Scots</hi> to interpose; and by degrees the Debates grew so warm, as there being found in those Demands of the <hi>Scots</hi> some Expressions very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the Parliament, the two Houses declared them to be Injurious and Scandalous, and order'd them to be Burnt by the Hands of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Hang-Man,</hi> 
                           <bibl>p. 175</bibl>.</q>
During these Controversies the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army continu'd in the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts upon free <hi>Quarter,</hi> at an abominable rate harressing the Poor People to the utmost Extremity; till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some Month's Time, Matters being accommodated a little for the present, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Advance of 30000. <hi>l.</hi> with <hi>Shooes, Stockings</hi> and other Necessaries; they were prevail'd upon to Besiege <hi>Newark,</hi> at which <hi>Leaguer</hi> the <hi>King</hi> came to them, just as <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Surrender</hi> were agreed upon, and so the more at leisure to march off with him to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> for 'tis false what <hi>Ludlow</hi> affirms, <hi>that the King soon after his Arrival in the</hi> Scots <hi>Quarters, gave Order for the Delivery of</hi> Newark <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Hands</hi>; the <hi>Articles</hi> were agreed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49784:188"/>
upon before the <hi>King</hi> came thither, or his Friends in the <hi>Garrison</hi> dreamt thereof; however it happen'd very Opportunely for the <hi>Scots</hi> to march off with their <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yal</hi> Purchase, and prevent the <hi>Clamors</hi> from their <hi>Brethren</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
who as <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> tells us, <q>forthwith sent an Order to their Commissioners in the <hi>Scots</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to demand the Person of the King, judging it unreasonable that the <hi>Scots</hi> being in their Pay, should dispose of him otherwise than by their Order; resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further that he should be Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Warwick</hi> Castle, and the next Day commanded their Army to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, in Order to hinder the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the King's Forces with the <hi>Scots,</hi> 
                           <bibl>p. 176</bibl>.</q>
Whereof doubtless they were sore <hi>affraid,</hi> 'tis pity they were not <hi>hurt,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> by that one Act might have expiated all their former <hi>Perfidy,</hi> but to expect that, had been to <hi>wash</hi> a <hi>Blackamore,</hi> so <hi>Blessed a good</hi> was not to, be thought of from those <hi>accustomed so much to the worst of Evils, Rebellion and Sacriledge</hi>; and therefore 'tis probable it gave them some ease to hear, that though <hi>Levens</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> General, had march'd with the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>New-Castle,</hi> he had by <hi>Proclamation</hi> forbidden his Forces to have any <hi>Communication</hi> with the <hi>King</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49784:189"/>
and thereupon only order'd that the <hi>Scots</hi> should keep him for the <hi>English Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and so they did, but must pay a round <hi>Sum</hi> of Mony, before they should have him.</p>
                     <p>We are next to see what Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>King</hi> had among the <hi>Scots,</hi> who though they pretended to be much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd, as <hi>Ludlow</hi> tells us, <hi>yet afterwards it appear'd that this Resolution had been Communicated to them before,</hi> p. 116. The Truth of it is, <hi>Montrevil</hi> a <hi>French Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador</hi> or <hi>Agent</hi> in the <hi>Scotch Camp,</hi> had adjusted the Matter with <hi>Levens,</hi> and other <hi>General Officers, who engag'd to secure him, and as many of his Party as should seek for Shelter with them, and to stand to him with their Lives and Fortunes:</hi> Yet in that excellent <hi>Meditation</hi> his <hi>Majesty,</hi> penn'd upon this Occasion, 'tis own'd a forc'd Push, <hi>where Necessity was his Counsellor, in an Adventure upon their Loyalty, who first began his Troubles,</hi> for which Reason <hi>he studied to fortify his Mind, so as not to offer up his Soul's Liberty, or make his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science their Captive; but no less conform his Words to his inward Dictates now, than if they had been, as the Words of a King ought to be amongst Loyal Subjects full of Power:</hi> And <hi>Good Prince</hi> he was soon put to his <hi>Tryal,</hi> for though the <hi>Committee</hi> of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49784:189"/>
                        <hi>Estates</hi> at <hi>Edingburgh,</hi> upon the first No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his being in their Hands, sent <hi>Commissioners,</hi> with great Expressions of their <hi>Duty,</hi> and <hi>good Intentions, protesting how dear the Preservation of his Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and his just Power and Greatness should ever be to them,</hi>
                        <q>yet their Actions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately spake the contrary, as if all were intended with the tacit Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Covenant Clog,</hi> and such harsh Usage as might bring, or force him thereto, for within few Days the King call'd both the chief <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> and the <hi>Commissioners</hi> sent out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in presence of <hi>Monsieur de Montrevil</hi> did Expostulate; That whereas he did come to their <hi>Army</hi> upon the Assurances <hi>Monsieur Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trevil</hi> had given him, that he should be safe in his <hi>Person, Honor</hi> and <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> the two last were not kept; for he was pressed to settle <hi>Religion</hi> as they desir'd, wherewith his <hi>Conscience</hi> was not satisfy'd: Next his <hi>Subjects</hi> had not free access to him, but <hi>Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were issued out, forbidding them to come to him; neither was the <hi>Ceremony</hi> due to him as <hi>King,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be paid him at his entry to <hi>New-Castle:</hi> And lastly his <hi>Servants</hi> were not suffer'd to wait on him. And his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49784:190"/>
                           <hi>Majesty</hi> attested <hi>Montrevil,</hi> if those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were not made to him, who confidently affirm'd it in all their Presence, and that he had the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Assurances</hi> in <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> retired to think of an <hi>Answer</hi>; but when they return'd they desired his <hi>Majesty</hi> would put <hi>Montrevil</hi> to it, to declare what those <hi>Assurances</hi> were, and who gave them; but this was not done. Next they said, they would not treat with the <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>Presence,</hi> nor admit the Interposition of any <hi>Foreign Agent,</hi> between them and their <hi>Native Prince.</hi> And the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of the <hi>Army</hi> resolv'd, that no suspected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should be suffer'd to wait on the <hi>King,</hi> with which his <hi>Majesty</hi> was highly displeas'd, and for some Days would not eat in <hi>Publick,</hi> but only in his <hi>Chamber.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This last Passage I have from an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable <hi>Authority,</hi> whose Affection to his Native <hi>Country</hi> could give Place to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Truth,</hi> and therefore he seems to palliate the Matter a little on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; that <hi>Montrevil</hi> did not declare what the <hi>Assurances</hi> were, nor who gave them, which yet seems not to be his Fault, for that they fully resolv'd against his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> and <hi>Interposition</hi> for the future in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49784:190"/>
any such like Affairs. And upon the same account, he declares further on, <hi>it did not appear what Grounds</hi> Montrevil <hi>had for giving the King those Assurances, and must be very slight, and only from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Persons, not any Iunto or Iudicatory,</hi> Such a secret Transaction could not be done with all the <hi>Formalities</hi> of a <hi>Solemn Treaty,</hi> yet doubtless <hi>Montrevil</hi> had his Assurances from <hi>Levens</hi> with most of the other <hi>General Officers,</hi> and <hi>Scotch Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners</hi> then before <hi>Newark,</hi> which was a considerable <hi>Iunto</hi>; and I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Iudicatories</hi> have little to do in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of that Nature. But it had been all one though never so exactly drawn up, and would have been as little observ'd, as the first <hi>Pacification,</hi> or last promise, of <hi>never drawing Sword against him more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But my particular Business is to trace <hi>Ludlow,</hi> who tells us,
<q>The Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Parliament joyning with those who were before with the King, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to perswade him to agree to the Propositions of the Parliament; but he disliking several Things in them, and most of all the abolition of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, to which Interest he continu'd obstinately stedfast, refused his consent, upon private Encouragement from some of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49784:191"/>
more easy Terms, or to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without any at all, <bibl>p. 183</bibl>.</q>
The <hi>Encouragement</hi> he mentions is only a <hi>Flam</hi> of his own, the <hi>Scots</hi> kept too strict a <hi>Guard</hi> upon him, to have any but his <hi>Enemies</hi> to converse with; nay, which is worse, they oblig'd him to discharge all his Friends then in <hi>Arms,</hi> not only here in <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Montross</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ormond</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Neither was the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> the main Obstacle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was hard, when he alone by himself had so shamefully bafled their great Champion <hi>Henderson</hi> upon that Subject, to be so violently press'd from a Truth they could so little disprove. But setting aside this Fellow's Spite, who would needs make this the chief obstacle, the <hi>King</hi> in his brisk <hi>Answer</hi> to the whole body of their <hi>Propositions</hi> from <hi>Newcastle</hi> August. 1. 46. tells them,
<q>They were such as did import the greatest Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in Government both in Church and Kingdom;</q>
yet these were posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively sent for his <hi>Majesty's</hi> Concurrence, without allowing the <hi>Commissioners</hi> to give <hi>Reasons</hi> for their <hi>Demands,</hi> or the hearing the King's Reasons against them, which occasion'd his smart Reply upon their saying, <hi>They had no Power to treat that, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Honour of the Business, an honest
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49784:191"/>
Trumpeter might have done as much.</hi> To these <hi>Propositions, Ludlow</hi> tells us, the <hi>Scots Commissioners,</hi> especially <hi>Lord Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> press'd the <hi>King</hi> very earnestly to comply; telling him <hi>that though they were higher in some Particulars than they could wish, yet if he continu'd to reject them, he must not expect to be received in</hi> Scotland, <hi>whither they must return, and deliver him up to the Parliament in</hi> England. <hi>But whatever they or the</hi> English <hi>said made no impression,</hi> &amp;c. p. 184. The Truth of it is after all the <hi>Scotch Rodomantades, Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don's</hi> in particular, <hi>how much it was against the Laws of Nature, Nations and Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to Deliver, and betray those that had fled to any for Succour</hi>; their <hi>Brethren</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> knew how much there was of <hi>Iudas</hi> amongst them, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd their demand of a <hi>Million,</hi> to 400000 <hi>l.</hi> agreed upon the Payment of one <hi>Moyety,</hi> and the <hi>Publick Faith</hi> for the other, to have the <hi>King Deliver'd</hi> to them,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Upon the Scots Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very the K.</hi>
                        </note> who good Man laments <hi>that his Price should be so much above his Saviours.</hi> And to clear himself from the base Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections they made upon his Steady, well grounded Resolves, he declares <hi>what they call Obstinacy, I know God accounts honest Constancy, from which, Reason and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as Honour forbid me to recede.</hi>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:49784:192"/>
For you must know the <hi>Scots,</hi> whilst in their Hands, not only permitted, but encourag'd the most Rigid of their <hi>Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> to bait him at an impudent Rate, as well from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> as otherwise, as positively denouncing him damn'd for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as 'tis to be fear'd, might fall to their lot, for <hi>forcing</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>In the next <hi>Paragraph,</hi> p. 186. <hi>Ludlow</hi> Commenceth a Quarrel with all the World both at Home and abroad; for upon the <hi>French Embassador's</hi> coming over to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Reconciliation between <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> he tells you how <hi>it was rejected, they resolving to determin it themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interposition of any</hi> (an infallible sign of a just <hi>Cause,</hi> where no body but themselves must <hi>Iudge</hi>) <hi>having experienc'd that most of the Neighbouring States, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Monarchical, were at the bottom their Enemies.</hi> That they were not their <hi>Friends</hi> was certain, but that they should be so little their <hi>Enemies,</hi> was a great Shame, that so many <hi>Crown'd Heads</hi> should stand by and see a <hi>Brother Monarch, Dethron'd</hi> and <hi>Murther'd</hi> at so barbarous a rate, was a Sign that which is call'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Honour</hi> was at a very low <hi>Ebb,</hi> and the <hi>Sacro-Sancta Mrjestas</hi> left destitute of all Appeal but to the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> who for ought we know may be still making
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49784:192"/>
                        <hi>Inquisition</hi> for that <hi>Blood,</hi> this <hi>Son of Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> so much thirsted after, and never at rest till poured forth: and therefore henceforward 'tis his sole Business to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh against all that would not go along with him, and his <hi>Crew,</hi> in that horrid <hi>Perpetration</hi>; first he falls upon the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi> for their frequent <hi>Overtures of Peace made to the King, though he had not a Sword left wherewith to oppose them,</hi> p. 187. The <hi>Overtures</hi> were not frequent, or if so, always the same, and totally destructive of all <hi>old Establishments</hi> without condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to debate or alter any thing. And for his not having a <hi>Sword</hi> left, denotes our <hi>Author</hi> to be of the same Principle with that <hi>Atheist, Virgil</hi> so judiciously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses for his <hi>Dextra mihi Deus</hi>; because they depended upon the Sword, must it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>King</hi> had no other Right? To be sure they found it a very precarious <hi>Title,</hi> for the same Sword which set them up, more than once pull'd them down, and after all, Right took place of the several <hi>Usurping Powers,</hi> and it will be never found so in the end. But what makes him the more out of Humour, is the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples expectation of the <hi>King's</hi> return to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> being inform'd the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Heads</hi> had promis'd the <hi>Scots,</hi> that as soon as they had disbanded the

                        <hi>Army</hi> they would bring him to <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Honor and Safety:</hi> The People might expect, and certainly did desire this, but whoever observ'd the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment both in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and here, how obstinately they adhered to their <hi>Covenant</hi> Rigours; and how conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously positive the <hi>King</hi> was to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, could see little hopes of an Accord.
<q>These Things, he saith, made the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ready to conclude, that though his Designs had been wonderfully defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Armies beaten out of the Field, and himself deliver'd into the Hands of the Parliament, against whom he had made a long and Bloody War; yet certainly he must be in the Right; and that tho' he was guilty of the Blood of many Thousands, yet was still unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, in a Condition to give Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and not in need to receive any: which made them flock from all Parts to see him as he was brought from <hi>Newcastle</hi> to <hi>Holmby,</hi> falling down before him, bringing their Sick to be touch'd by him, and courting him as only able to restore to them their Peace and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement.</q>
This really was the Temper of the People at that time, who now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover'd those <hi>Mists,</hi> and <hi>Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Factions</hi> had so
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49784:193"/>
long amus'd them; and were very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to have the <hi>King</hi> reestablish'd, that they might be once more so, in that abundance of all things, they even wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonis'd in, when under his sole <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 'Twas likewise well known to them that a violent Party in <hi>Parliament</hi> forc'd the <hi>King</hi> to stand upon his own <hi>Defence</hi>; and when to make an Invasion upon all his just <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> they had open'd an Issue of <hi>Blood,</hi> how incessantly did he endeavour to stop it, by <hi>Messages</hi> and <hi>Overtures</hi> of <hi>Treaty,</hi> and <hi>Peace?</hi> which like so many deaf <hi>Adders,</hi> he could never Charm them into: and as at the time he is now upon, there was not one in many Thousands had the impudence to charge the <hi>King</hi> with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the <hi>War,</hi> and the <hi>Effusion of Blood</hi> thereupon, so those few that did, knew or believ'd the contrary, (amongst whom our <hi>Ludlow</hi> is chief) but could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise carry on that execrable Design, the Devil had so thoroughly engag'd them in; and this makes our Author so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to inveigh against all the rest of his <hi>Partisans,</hi> whom either <hi>Shame, Guilt,</hi> or Sense of their <hi>Countries</hi> Desolation, had caus'd to desist, or desire an <hi>Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as <hi>Men of a neutral Spirit,</hi> who would

not, <hi>Cataline</hi> like, add to their former <hi>Evils,</hi> the total Ruin of the Nation, for that was it's, then real Condition, the <hi>King</hi> their Prisoner, and the whole <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> their Slaves; and that <hi>decisive Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Heaven, by which alone they claim'd their Power,</hi> was no other than what a <hi>Gang</hi> of <hi>High-Way Robbers</hi> may pretend to, which in several <hi>Sets,</hi> the just Vengeance of Heaven, suffer'd to harress this proud and foolish <hi>People,</hi> till in the end they were broke quite in Pieces, some of them <hi>Hang'd,</hi> though not enough, by our <hi>Author</hi> at least, unless his long and lingring <hi>Exile,</hi> had brought him to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Remorse; and this I take to be the <hi>decisive Iudgment,</hi> as to this Life, and as to the next shall only say, that if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one whose <hi>Conscience</hi> doth not accuse him were thereby <hi>justify'd,</hi> final <hi>Imponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> would be an happy <hi>End.</hi>

                        <q>What Part God will have me now to Act, or suffer in this new and strange Scene of Affairs, I am not much Solicitous; some little Practice will serve that Man who only seeks to represent a part of Honesty and Honor. In this my Surprise I tell the World, That a King cannot be so low but he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, adding weight to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty where he appears:</q>
And so goes on, most judiciously observing the Hand of <hi>Divine Iustice,</hi> how they that by <hi>Tumults,</hi> first occasion'd the raising of <hi>Armies,</hi> are now chastned by their own <hi>Army</hi> for new <hi>Tumults</hi>;
<q>The Members of both Houses who at first withdrew, (as my self was forced to do) from the rudeness of the Tumults, were count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deserters, and outed their Places in Parliament; such as staid and enjoy'd the Benefit of the Tumults, were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted for the only Patriots: Now on the contrary the Deserters are abetted by the Army, and such as remain'd,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49784:195"/>
and kept their Stations, are charg'd for Tumultuary Insolencies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the Freedom and Honor of Parliaments;</q>
and doubtless amidst those many Distractions and Perplexities this <hi>Excellent Prince</hi> labour'd under, it could not but be some Satisfaction to see such visible <hi>Retaliations,</hi> since there was not a Member of the <hi>Covenant Class,</hi> but might take up <hi>Adonibezek</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, <hi>As we have done, so the Lord hath requited us.</hi>

                     <p>The manner of <hi>Ioyce</hi>'s carrying off the <hi>King</hi> hath not one Syllable of Truth as to the Circumstances thereof, in <hi>Ludlow</hi>'s Relation. He saith,
<q>

whereas upon the King's demanding a sight of his <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> that, saith the impudent Fellow, you shall see presently, and drawing up the best part of his Party into the inner Court as near as he could to the King, say'd, these Sir are my <hi>Instructions</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majesty Smilingly reply'd,
<q>Your Instructions are in fair Characters, and Legible without Spelling:</q>
Neither is it true, that the <hi>King</hi> would have retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Promise to <hi>Ioyce</hi> upon the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner's</hi> Perswasion; it was by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49784:196"/>
the <hi>Guards</hi> were taken off their <hi>Lodgings</hi>; and when <hi>Ioyce</hi> press'd the King to go along with him, no Prejudice being intended, but rather his Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>upon the King's saying he would not stir unless the Commissioners went with him</hi>; the other reply'd, <hi>that for his Part he was indifferent.</hi> Neither did the <hi>King</hi> take Horse, but went in a Coach, with the <hi>Earls, Pembrook, Denbeigh,</hi> and <hi>Lord Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> who as the rest of their Fellows were very <hi>Shagreen</hi> upon this Force, his <hi>Majesty</hi> being observ'd the Merryest in the Company: And when Colonel <hi>Brown,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crew</hi> return'd to the Parliament is not certain, to be sure they did not go from <hi>Holmby,</hi> but attended the King to <hi>Hinchingbrook,</hi> tho an Express was sent from the first Notice of <hi>Ioyce</hi>'s Approach. The whole Passage of this Force, (with several others very considerable from hence forward, to his <hi>Majesty's Murder</hi>) is most faithfully related in the <hi>Athenae Oxon.</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi> had them from Sir <hi>Thomas Herbert,</hi> a constant, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sole <hi>Attendant</hi> upon the <hi>King,</hi> in all those his <hi>Solitudes and Sufferings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all probability, it was with no little regret to our <hi>Author,</hi> before he saw whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it tended, that the <hi>Army</hi> paid so great a Deference to the <hi>King, suffer'd
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49784:196"/>
his Officers to continue, and publickly own'd the Design. Colonel</hi> Francis Russel, <hi>and others attending the King, became soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the Splendor of his Majesty,</hi> &amp;c. p. 193. And some Pages before, 177. he inveighs bitterly against Colonel <hi>Brown</hi> the <hi>Wood-monger,</hi> for that having been as great a Rebel as himself, (indeed much more Considerable and Mischievous) he <hi>no sooner came into the King's Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but became a Convert,</hi> which <hi>Ludlow</hi> would have the effect of a <hi>low and abject Original and Education,</hi> whereas there cannot be a greater Instance of a generous Temper, to acknowledge his Mistakes, and beg his Majesty's Pardon when there was nothing but <hi>Obloquy</hi> and <hi>Persecution</hi> from the prevailing Power, which he met withal sufficiently, and was as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to return when occasion serv'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the <hi>Bloodyest Butchers of the Parliament's Friends,</hi> p. 178. Indeed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Restauration</hi> he was very forward in apprehending, and condemning the <hi>Regicides,</hi> and it was by an unlucky Chance this Fellow escap'd his Hands. The Devils knowing themselves under Sentence of Eternal Reprobation, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver better pleas'd, than to have engag'd a Man so far, as to lay aside all Thoughts of Pardon, of Reconciliation with God;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49784:197"/>
and really I never met with a Person more truly Proselyted to Hell, upon that, and indeed all other Concerns, than our <hi>Author,</hi> as having not only abandoned all Thoughts of <hi>Peace and Mercy</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but an implacable Spite against such as were any ways inclin'd thereto; on the contrary wherever his Majesty met any of such ingenuous <hi>Christian</hi> Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he certainly Convinc'd them of their Mistakes, and brought them over to his <hi>Party:</hi> There are too many Instances of this Kind, and too well known to be here set down;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 244.</note> That of Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> in Dr. <hi>Perenchief</hi>'s Life, is very Considerable, because as rigid a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> as the rest, who declar'd <hi>he had been deluded into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Thoughts of the King, but was now convinc'd to an exceeding Reverence of him, and hoped so of others,</hi> &amp;c. There was one <hi>Dell</hi> an <hi>Army Chaplain,</hi> counterpart to <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> and tho less a <hi>Buffoon,</hi> yet as much a <hi>Rogue,</hi> they jointly giving out, when their Villanies were ripe, <hi>that the King was but as a dead Dog</hi>: This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Wretch said once in my hearing, that whilst in the <hi>Army,</hi> it was told him the King express'd a desire to see <hi>Dell</hi>; but said the Fellow,
<q>I would not come at him, because we found he had a cunning way of getting into Men, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49784:197"/>
making them think well of him, and his Cause:</q>
This indeed I find from several Particulars, that the Prejudices of such <hi>Ulcerous</hi> Minds kept them off upon a false Surmise, that the <hi>King</hi> could Pardon and Forgive no more than they; upon which <hi>String</hi> I observe <hi>Ludlow</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten harping, especially upon his Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Army's</hi> respect in this Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, whom he seems to laugh at for <hi>not considering how easy it would be for him to break through all his Promises and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, upon pretence of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Force,</hi> p. 193. 'Tis true, they had violated the solemnest <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Tyes</hi> imaginable in putting a <hi>Force</hi> upon him; whereas he, <hi>good Man,</hi> was so <hi>Religious</hi> to his bare <hi>Promises,</hi> as in the end it cost him his Life.</p>
                     <p>What he further relates of Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> is, as we are told from a <hi>Manuscript,</hi> written by Sir <hi>Iohn Barkly,</hi> and left in the Hands of a <hi>Merchant</hi> at <hi>Geneva</hi>: That Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> since Lord <hi>Iohn Barkly,</hi> was attending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King at this Time, is certain, and we will grant 'tis his Manuscript, to be sure none of our <hi>Authors,</hi> being of a more polite Stile, pen'd like a Man of Sense and Business, so that wherever brought in, it looks like <hi>a piece of New Cloth,</hi> to make
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49784:198"/>
bold with the Parable, <hi>put to an Old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and renders his <hi>thred-bare Stuff,</hi> an abominably <hi>patch'd</hi> Business. From these Papers he would have us believe that the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the Army, <hi>Cromwel, Ireton,</hi> &amp;c. were once in so good a Mood as to design the <hi>Restauration</hi> of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> whose ill Conduct in not following Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Directions, and caressing them as expected, spoil'd all. And this ought to be taken into Consideration, because I have met some honest Gentlemen too forward in giving Credit thereto; and the Commonwealth's <hi>Men</hi> run away with it as infallible, notwithstanding the quite contrary appears from <hi>Ludlow</hi>'s own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; who perhaps too hath pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several of Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Expressions to the King's Prejudice, (for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so base and false he would not be guilty of upon that Account) as when he is reported to break away from them, and say,
<q>Well, I shall see them glad e're long to accept of more equal Terms, <bibl>
                              <hi>p.</hi> 203</bibl>.</q> and that <q>

                              <hi>p.</hi> 205.</bibl>
you cannot be without me; you will; fall to ruin if I do not sustain you;</q>
which manner of Carriage he saith was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd with <hi>Amasement,</hi> and so it might well, for he was never observ'd to do so by any other Author, or Person: And
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49784:198"/>
when a little further on, 'tis said Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> was the <hi>Governour</hi>'s own <hi>Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> it must certainly be <hi>Ludlow,</hi> for Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> certainly knew him to be his Brother. From these and several such like Instances, it may be inferr'd, that though such Papers were left by Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet might they be alter'd, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to by <hi>Ludlow,</hi> to <hi>Blacken,</hi> as their Term was, his Majesty's Discretion and Policy, though they could not his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. It may be further observ'd there was no good Understanding between Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Asburnham,</hi> though both of them doubtless very Faithful and Loyal; Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> really believ'd the Army was in good Earnest, the other very much suspected, and who of the two had most Reason therein, the Event declar'd, the King in the mean while might hesitate between both, and rather incline to Mr. <hi>Asburnham</hi>'s Opinion. To pass by therefore, those Difficulties and Distractions the several contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties lay under; and how impossible it was for his Majesty to come to any thing of a fix'd <hi>Resolution</hi> amidst so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Confusions; we will come to this one Enquiry, whether <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ever really intended to establish the King upon his Throne? For I look upon
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49784:199"/>
them two as the gand <hi>Intriguers,</hi> driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a distinct Design of their own, which none of their Comrades then so much as dreamt of, but were implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried on to promote what at first they could not see, nor at last prevent: For that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was the exactest Piece of Dissimulation Hell ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd, must be own'd on all Hands; so that he and his Confederates, sending <hi>Sir</hi> Allen Appesly <hi>to Sir</hi> John Barkly, <hi>and desiring them both to assure the Queen, and Prince of their good Intentions,</hi> was but a Blind to fortify their Interest against the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who as <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> or the Paper tells us, though much weakned by the Absence of the <hi>Eleven Members,</hi> pass'd a Vote, that the King should be brought to <hi>Richmond,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he inclin'd, so that the Army were oblig'd to cause the Parliament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call their Vote: Neither were <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s Protestations to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> the least to be regarded,
<q>Of that tenderest Sight his Eyes ever beheld, the Interview between the King and his Children; and that never Man was so abus'd as he, in his sinister Opinion of the King, who he thought was the most Upright, and Conscientious of the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
concluding with this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49784:199"/>
Wish,
<q>That God would be pleased to look upon him according to the Sincerity of his Heart towards the King, <bibl>
                              <hi>pag.</hi> 199</bibl>.</q>
Such Tricks as these were as natural to him as his Meat and Drink; and no less requisite to support the Life of his cursed Designs: Did he not at the same time assure the Parliament,
<q>That the Army should at their first Command, cast their Arms at their Feet; and solemnly Swear, that he had rather himself, with his whole Family should be consumed, than the Army break out into Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</q>
Yet at the same time did he by his <hi>Creatures,</hi> administer new <hi>Fewel</hi> to those <hi>Flames</hi>; and posting down to the <hi>Head Quarters,</hi> set the whole <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue</hi> of <hi>Agitators</hi> on Work, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them in carrying on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy; and therefore however Sir <hi>Iohn's Sanguin</hi> Temper, and good-natur'd Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position might be impos'd upon by <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Arts, the King was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out considerable Cautions from others, of the no Trust which was to be put in any thing he said, that amongst his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents <hi>he did frequently boast of his fine Arts in imposing upon the King, and that thereby he intended nothing less than his Destruction</hi>: It must indeed be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49784:200"/>
that some of the General Officers were Sincere to his Majesty, really his Converts, one of which seeing <hi>Cromwel</hi> hold the King's Hand between his own during a solemn Protestation of unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Assurances, and even washing it with Tears; when he came out, ask'd the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer who stood by, <hi>whether he had not acted his Part very well?</hi> Who replied, <hi>Why were you not in good Earnest? Not in the least replied he,</hi> for which he ever after Abominated him, and acquainted the King with what a <hi>Devil incarnate</hi> he had to deal withall.</p>
                     <p>And here I must observe no small Piece of Perfidy in our Author, that he will not let us know what Part Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> what himself bears in relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Affairs; for what I question'd as to some harsh Expressions he would have the King use towards the Army, seems much confirm'd from an absolute Falshood he relates, as the effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which runs thus,
<q>
                           <bibl>
                              <hi>pag.</hi> 205.</bibl> The King having thus bid Defiance to the Army, thought it necessary to bend all his Force against them, and especially to strengthen their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Parliament. To this end a Petition was fram'd to press them to speedy Agreement with the King,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49784:200"/>
and presented in a Tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by a great Number of Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and Rabble, back'd by many Dismiss'd and Disaffected Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This indeed was the last Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the <hi>Presbyterian Iunto</hi> to preserve themselves from the Army's Lash; but as it took no Effect, so the King was not at all concern'd therein, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd with the Army, and upon very good Terms; for it was not time to throw off the <hi>Vizard,</hi> till as <hi>Cromwel</hi> whisper'd <hi>Ludlow, they had pull'd the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament out by the Ears,</hi> page 189. In the mean while, to show how <hi>Ludlow</hi> contradicts himself; the King who just now was said to bid defiance to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, upon showing his Answer to the Officers before it was sent, they seemed much satisfyed with it, and promised to use their endeavours for a <hi>Personal Treaty</hi>; Cromwel <hi>and</hi> Ireton <hi>and many of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the House, pressing the King's desires with great earnestness; wherein contrary to their expectation, they found a vigorous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 213. This Fellow <hi>Ludlow,</hi> cannot be so ignorant of those Intrigues as he would seem: That <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> and his Confidents <hi>ran with the Hare, and hunted with the Hound</hi>; set on their <hi>Properties</hi> in the <hi>House,</hi> and Agitators in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49784:201"/>
the <hi>Army,</hi> to complain of that free Access all the Cavaliers had to the King at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court: Of Sir</hi> John Barkly<hi>'s, and Mr.</hi> Ashburnham<hi>'s Intimacy with the Chief Officers of the Army; that</hi> Cromwel<hi>'s and</hi> Ireton<hi>'s Doors were open to them, when shut to those of the Army; whereat,</hi> saith our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Cromwel <hi>was much offended, telling Mr.</hi> Ashburnham <hi>and Sir</hi> John, <hi>that if he were an honest Man, he had said enough of the sincerity of his intentions; and if he were not, nothing was enough,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 212. So likewise he tells us, <hi>Cromwel</hi> wheadled with the <hi>King,</hi>
                        <q>acquainting him with his danger, and protesting it was not in his power to undertake for his secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the place where he was, <hi>viz. Hampton-Court</hi>; assuring him of his real service, and desiring God to deal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before;</q>
all which was abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Trick to affright the King into those Nets and Toyls, he had so craftily set for him, till a fit opportunity of proceeding to his Murder: And that all the <hi>Caresses,</hi> wherewith most of the Army, more especially those two <hi>Nonparells</hi> of Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son in Law</hi> court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King, tended thereto, is clear from every Circumstance of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; as likewise from that Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>Ireton</hi> gave <hi>Ludlow</hi> at first, who
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49784:201"/>
tells us,
<q>he went down to <hi>Mayden-head,</hi> their Head-Quarters, where <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> suspecting these Things (their caressing his Majesty) might occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jealousies in me, and others of their Friends in Parliament, desired me to be assured of their stedfast Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the publick Interest, and that they intended only to dispense with such Things as were not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, till they could put themselves into a Condition of serving the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple effectually, <bibl>

And when the Army drew up that bloody Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance <hi>November,</hi> 48. in order to taking away the King's Life, the same <hi>Ireton</hi> sent him Word, <hi>that now he hop'd he should please him,</hi> which he owns <hi>they did, by the way they were taking,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 266. Now had <hi>Ludlow</hi> been a Man of any Thought, any Reflection upon himself, he must needs have consider'd, what a contemptible Fellow they took him to be, as not vouchsafing to trust him in a Design, his wicked Soul most earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly desir'd to have Accomplished.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s ambitious <hi>Enthusiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirit,</hi> that he had some thoughts by removal of the <hi>King,</hi> to ascend the height he at last attain'd unto; there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inducements to perswade. <hi>Ludlow</hi>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:49784:202"/>
tells us of many Passages and Actions which when the <hi>Riddle</hi> was unfolded, discover'd what he aim'd at.
<q>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly about this Time, when the King was in the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> there were frequent Consults and Conferences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, about reconciling Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and fixing a Government; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Cromwel</hi> kept himself in the Clouds, and would declare neither for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical, Aristocratical, nor Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical, maintaining that any of them might be good in themselves, or for us according as Providence should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, <bibl>

And when Providence suffer'd this glaring <hi>Meteor,</hi> with all it's Evil Influences, to rest so long upon our <hi>Horizon,</hi> and his vain Mind affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to add the Regal Title to that Power, he had so unjustly assum'd, one main Inducement of his attempting it, was thought to be a Dream he had of being King, whilst a young Rake in <hi>Sidny College, Cambridge,</hi> (for so he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was) which he frequently declar'd to his Companions, and was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle proud of; and that it made a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Impression upon his Mind, than any Learning he got there, give me leave to add this odd Passage, when he was Protector, I knew an Old Man, who
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49784:202"/>
in his younger Days had been Serving-Man to his Uncle Sir <hi>Thomas Stewart,</hi> was the <hi>Fac totum</hi> in the Family, and had more especially charge of the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, where he told me, <hi>Cromwel</hi> and he toss'd the Pot many a Time, and when his natural <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> was assisted by a good Dose of strong Liquor, would thus vent himself;
<q>Well, <hi>Iames,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing my Uncle's and Aunt's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses, I may yet be a great Man before I die; I had a lucky Dream at the College, and I have a young Daughter, a shrewd Girl she is, who will be often telling me, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will be a Great Man Father, I cannot sleep soundly a Nights for Dreaming of your being a Great Man; indeed Father you will be as Great as the King; and then he would go on; I don't know <hi>Iames,</hi> nor can I see any thing of likelyhood yet; but God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times brings strange things about, and if he should call me to any thing extraordinary, sure I should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand to prosecute my own advantage.</q>
This the Old Man told me, he would be often repeating over his Cups, several years before the Wars broke out; which as he laugh'd at then, so he had thought upon it a thousand times with astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49784:203"/>
since he came to be <hi>Protector.</hi> I hope this Story will not be thought alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impertinent upon this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that it shows how much his Mind was puff'd up with hopes, even when there was no ground for them; but when he saw all sorts of Mischiefs and Rebellions, begin to work with such Hellish success, and himself got into the Second Command of the whole Army, under such a Cypher of a General, as he manag'd him no less than he did the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officers, most of whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to oppose all Superiors, as well their Masters the Parliament, as their <hi>Sovereign</hi>; This doubtless made him dream of a <hi>Crown</hi> every Night, and think a Year an Age, till possest of the sole Power. For having Modell'd the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament according to his Will, made them as tractable as Setting-Dogs, to whatsoever he and his <hi>Mirmidons</hi> thought fit to put them upon; and wheadled the King into a Prison, under a Property of his own; for whatever <hi>Ludlow</hi> or Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> relates of <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Surprise and Consternation at the News, <hi>pag.</hi> 218. the History of <hi>Independency</hi> assures us, he had been with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who sent him down fully Instructed, as to his Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Critical Affair: And from
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49784:203"/>
hence forward we hear no more of his Caresses and Protestations: <hi>May the Lord deal with him according to the Sincerity of his Heart towards the King,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>WE are now come to the last Act; so full of Horror and Amase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as nothing but the doing it could make the Attempt credible; and seems to <hi>transverse</hi> that Old Conceit of the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthropi, Wolves</hi> and <hi>Tygers</hi> appearing not only in humane Shape, but humane Societies; for of some such Composition must those several <hi>Scenes</hi> of <hi>Regicides</hi> be, which made up those Conferences our <hi>Author</hi> mentions, <hi>p.</hi> 238. and forward; in the first of which he tells us, the <hi>Commonwealth's-men</hi> declared,
<q>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy was neither good in it's self, nor for us. That it was not desirable in it's self they urg'd from the 8<hi>th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the first Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49784:204"/>
8<hi>th.</hi> Verse, where the rejecting of the Judges, and the choice of a King, was charg'd upon the <hi>Israelites</hi> by God himself as to rejecting him.</q>
                        <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is so much out of these Peoples way, as they never blunder more, than when they think to support their Cause from thence, as will appear from this short Account of the whole Story: Where first, it was not the <hi>Israelites</hi> rejecting the <hi>Iudges,</hi> but the <hi>Theocracy</hi> which gave the Provocation, for so <hi>Almighty God</hi> himself declares in the precedent Verse 7. upon <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Complaint, <hi>they have not rejected thee, but me they have rejected that I should not reign over them. Samuel</hi> was not only as a <hi>Viceroy</hi> to see those Laws observ'd, which the <hi>Supreme Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> had already <hi>Enacted,</hi> but as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and so the Mouth of God, further to declare whatever <hi>Divine Will</hi> thought fit to Prescribe. And if in the second Place, if he believ'd or would have it thought there was any thing of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi> in the <hi>Iudges Regency,</hi> it is a gross Mistake; indeed when the <hi>Monarchy</hi> was interrupted upon the Death of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> we find no <hi>Successor</hi> appointed by him, as <hi>Moses</hi> had done, nor fix'd upon by the People; and 'tis probable every <hi>Tribe</hi> became a <hi>State Provincial</hi> in their several
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49784:204"/>
                        <hi>Allotments,</hi> for the Text saith, <hi>The People served the Lord all the days of</hi> Joshua, <hi>and of the Elders that out-liv'd</hi> Joshua, <hi>who had seen all the great Works the Lord did for Israel,</hi> Judg. 2. 7, 8. <hi>But when all that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration were gather'd to their Fathers, there arose another Generation which knew not the Lord, nor the Works he had done, but followed other Gods of the People that were round about them, and bowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto them, and provoked the Lord to Anger</hi>; and here indeed I take them to be a true <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> a <hi>Free-State,</hi> with a <hi>General Toleration,</hi> every one <hi>doing what was right in his own Eyes.</hi> But this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Liberty pleas'd none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor themselves long neither, for the Text further adds, <hi>the Anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them into the Hands of the Spoilers, that spoiled them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. till sensible of their Folly, and Ingratitude, upon their humble Address unto the <hi>Lord, he raised up Iudges, and was with the Iudges, and dilivered them out of the Hand of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my all the days of the Iudges,</hi> vers. 18. Yet to see how steady all popular Resolves are, the next Verse declares, <hi>when the Iudge was dead, they return'd and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves more than their Fore-fathers, in following other Gods, &amp;c. they ceased not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49784:205"/>
from their own doings, and their stubborn ways,</hi> vers. 19. Whereupon I shall take leave to make this general <hi>Observation,</hi> That when God designs to curse a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into Misery and Ruin, he leaves them to their own evil and foolish Ways, which will never be redress'd, without true Repentance, and a return to such Establishments as are agreeable to his Will. And therefore, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'tis an abominable Mistake to urge that Text in <hi>Samuel</hi> as an Argument against all <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> in general, whereas the Charge God brings against them, the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> was their rude and undutiful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, their Mutinous manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a <hi>King,</hi> and the reason they gave for it, <hi>that they might be like other Nations,</hi> which he had taken all possible care they should not be, and most strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyn'd them not to imitate any of their Practices; and this is clear; for that as their Government had been always <hi>Monarchical</hi> when under <hi>God</hi>'s Hand; so he foresaw, and consequently cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd them against such popular tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Heats, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14, &amp;c. <hi>when thou art come unto the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, &amp;c. and shalt say, I will set a King over me, like as all the Nations which are about me: Thou shalt in any wise
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49784:205"/>
set him a King over thee, whom the Lord thy God shall Chuse. God</hi> was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they should have a King, but reserv'd the Election to himself; he would have no transferring of Rights, no mutual Contracts, but chuse his own Representative.</p>
                     <p>He proceeds to his other <hi>Topick, That it was no ways conducing to the Interest of the Nation,</hi> (viz. <hi>Monarchy) was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to be prov'd by the infinite Mischiefs and Oppressions we have suffer'd under it.</hi> 'Tis the modestest Expression in his whole Book to say it was <hi>endeavour'd to be prov'd,</hi> since it hath been already made appear, that the little Finger of these <hi>Commonwealth-Iobbers</hi> prov'd heavier to the whole Nation than all the <hi>Monarchs</hi> which ever sat upon the Throne. So likewise further on he tells us,
<q>The Question in dispute between the King's Party, and us, being as I apprehend it, whether the King should Govern like a God by his own Will? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the People be govern'd by Laws made by themselves? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                           <bibl>p. 267</bibl>.</q>
If he will apprehend things wrong it cannot be help'd, for neither the King nor his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ever intended the People should be otherwise Govern'd than by their own Laws; 'twas what they stood up for,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49784:206"/>
and endeavour'd to preserve according to all antient Establishments; but God thought not fit to give them a present Success, that the People might experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally find the Madness and Folly of their Innovations. Mr. <hi>Thomas Farnaby,</hi> who had been the famous School-Master of those Times, was committed by an <hi>Order of the House</hi> in 41. for saying, <hi>he believ'd we should find it better to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one King than</hi> 500; how Legal that <hi>Commitment</hi> was is easily resolv'd, yet went they on in the same Arbitrary Course for five or six Years together, Committing whomsoever they dislik'd, or so much as suspected to dislike them. Did not these Men govern by their own Wills? Yes surely, though more like Devils, than God. Neither yet did it rest here, the 500 were reduc'd to a Rump of less than 50. and they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw'd by a Military Rabble of more than twice 15 Thousand; Were not the Good People of <hi>England</hi> excellently represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now? Their Laws and Liberty in a hopeful Condition? And their Purses free, when the Soldiers commanded them?</p>
                     <p>And this is the next Diabolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue our Author very frankly declares they design'd to enterprise; for however
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49784:206"/>
the several <hi>Iuntos</hi> had hitherto jointly concurr'd, nay even contended who should make the greatest Invasions not only upon the Peoples, but there Prince's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; yet now <hi>hath</hi> become <hi>divided within its self,</hi> a major part of the House being not willing to concurr with the Army in Murdering that Person whom they had nevertheless both agreed to <hi>Un-King</hi>; and this, as <hi>Ludlow</hi> tells us,
<q>occasion'd another Meeting between some Members and Officers of the Army, wherein it was resolv'd to purge the House once more of all such Members as should attempt to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate what these Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> were resolv'd to go through with, <bibl>
                              <hi>p.</hi> 266</bibl>.</q>
and to justify himself herein he brings another Text of <hi>Scripture,</hi> whether with more Impudence or Folly let the Reader judge, <hi>that Blood defileth the Land, and cannot be cleansed but by the Blood of him that shed it,</hi> Numb. 35. 33. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready observ'd if the <hi>Wolf</hi> may be Judge, no <hi>Sheep</hi> shall be Innocent, and as these <hi>Beasts</hi> of <hi>Prey,</hi> began the Chace, and worried all that would not go with, or dar'd to oppose them, till <hi>their Blood was shed like Water round about the Land,</hi> so that <hi>Royal Effusion</hi> in the end, must doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less have brought such a Stain upon it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49784:207"/>
as we may justly fear will never be washed out; whereof several worthy Loyal <hi>Patriots</hi> in the <hi>Parliament</hi> 60. were so Religiously sensible, as they propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that not only the rest of the <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides</hi> should have receiv'd their due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but that for every one of the <hi>King's Party</hi> who suffer'd by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> there should have been a <hi>Retaliation</hi> upon the same Number of such as had been most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in those base and unjust Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; this might have done something towards an Expiation, and put away the Guilt of <hi>Innocent Blood amongst us,</hi> by neglect whereof to return the Text up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ludlow</hi> and his Party, 'tis to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Land still continues defiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</hi>

                     <p>And next to this of Blood-guiltiness, give me leave to add my Suspition, that we have another deep Arrear, for their gross Abuse and Profanation of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> whereof our <hi>Author</hi> hath given an exact <hi>Specimen</hi> in the two foremention'd Texts, although he is very sparing in comparison with his Fellow-Rebels, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the violent Pulpit-Drivers, who studied nothing so much as to pervert it, and that not only to their own, but the whole Nations destruction: <hi>Curse ye

Meroz,</hi> &amp;c. did more Mischief than all the Trumpets in the Army, and made as loud a Noise; and their numberless Fast-Sermons, were but a wresting so many Texts to <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Treason.</hi> In the same manner likewise they manag'd <hi>Controversies</hi>: All Church-Government must be fram'd according to the new-fangled Conceits of their <hi>Geneva Rabbies,</hi> though the continued Sense and Practice of Antiquity, speak the quite contrary: And because the <hi>Doctrine of Obedience</hi> is so expresly laid down in 13th. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and elsewhere, they hammer'd out this Impudent Evasion, that the <hi>Apostles deliver'd what the Circumstances they lay under forc'd them unto,</hi> not <hi>hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Strength to make Opposition,</hi> otherwise might have been as very Rebels as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

afresh, too many of our present Divines being very backward to consider those two Words themselves, or attend to the Information of others, and yet a very nice Case depends thereupon. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to our Modern <hi>Commonwealth's Men,</hi> who finding with how ill Success their Predecessors made use of Scripture, have taken a much shorter Cut, set up for <hi>Theists,</hi> or <hi>Atheists,</hi> and thereby su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persede all Authority from thence.</p>
                     <p>What he relates as to the <hi>Treaty</hi> in the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> is a barefac'd discovery of their Design, that having got the King there, with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>City</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Lash, they were now resolv'd <hi>to kill and take Possession</hi>; his Majesty therefore is no more caress'd by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Sir <hi>Iohn Barkly</hi>'s cold Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the <hi>Officers</hi> at <hi>Windsor,</hi> was a full discovery of what they all along had in purpose. Yet since he takes no Notice of the King's Deportment in that grand Affair, but represents their Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies of him, according to the Guilt of their own just Deservings; I shall take leave to observe, that never any Prince strugled with so many different and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Interests, as this good Man at that <hi>Treaty,</hi> nor deported himself with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Honor, Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>Discretion.</hi> The

                        <hi>Presbyterian Iunto</hi> in the House, tho sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of that deplorable Condition they had brought both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> into, yet stood so stifly upon their first Propositions, as their <hi>Commissioners</hi> were not allow'd to recede one <hi>Ace</hi> from them. The <hi>Scotch</hi> likewise stood by rather to serve themselves than him, and observe how they should next play their Game, for now every Eye could discover what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Protestations they made, <hi>Mony and Covenant</hi> was the only <hi>Diana</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for. The <hi>Independent</hi> Party in the House, tho out-Voted as to the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> yet were able to start so many <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Restrictions, and Delays,</hi> as might baffle much sincerer Intentions than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in their Opponents.

One Passage I must needs relate from our Author, whereby we may guess at his, and all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices Ingenuity; he saith when some

                     <p>The breaking off that <hi>Treaty</hi> by the Army, their Force upon his Majesty there, bringing him from thence to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with the Hellish Pageantry of his <hi>Tryal,</hi> was insult enough for our <hi>Author</hi>'s bloody Mind, to relate Matter of Fact

Nevertheless according to <hi>Civil Law,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49784:218"/>
Testes Domestici</hi> are adjudg'd invalid, which will wholly exclude the two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foremention'd, who relate nothing but what they had from the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself; a Person so <hi>Ambitious, Popular,</hi> and <hi>vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affected,</hi> as because his Lady a rich Widow, and of some Quality, fell in Love with him, fondly conceited all others must have the like Admiration; whereas indeed his Composition was of such an unhappy <hi>Eantre deux</hi> as to fix him no where; he had too much of a Gentile, Good-natur'd Humor to be a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and too little of a <hi>Solid Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> for the Church of <hi>England</hi>; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever being patroniz'd by, and match'd into <hi>Puritanical Families,</hi> he ran with that Stream, and took it very ill <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> was trick'd into the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> when he was design'd for the same Place, and County: Although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same time he fell into better Company, that is, Archbishop <hi>Laud's,</hi> whose Convert he became, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occasion: The Archbishop tho' kept in the <hi>Tower</hi> by the two Houses, yet neither of them would dispose of any of his Preferment when fallen void, but only recommended such as could make best Friends amongst them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Deanery</hi> of <hi>Bocking</hi> (for so that

                     <p>But to return to the <hi>King's Book,</hi> I shall here likewise venture to give a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49784:219"/>
little Account of my own Private Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for going to School with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Sequestred Divine, (during those times of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and <hi>Commonwealthism</hi>) I remember to have heard him frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention, with much Respect, and tender Affection, his Brother <hi>Symonds</hi>; that they were <hi>Comrades</hi> together in the <hi>King's Quarters,</hi> all that War; from whence they accompany'd one another beyond Seas; and that upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>London,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated, and reliev'd them both, (they having been old Acquaintance, and all <hi>Puritans,</hi> till they saw what Madnesses that desperate Party ran into) furnish'd my Master with Money to go to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and as he would say, was very liberal to <hi>Brother Symonds,</hi> whilst he attended upon Printing the <hi>King's Book</hi>; and this agrees with what the worthy <hi>Vindicator</hi> relates from <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Allen,</hi> sometimes Servant to the Doctor, that the Copy was borrowed of Mr. <hi>Symonds,</hi> p. 32. which his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Obligations in those Necessitous Times, might easily command. And upon this doubtless was the <hi>Doctor's Claim</hi> founded; Mr. <hi>Symonds</hi> dying soon after at <hi>Graves-End,</hi> stealing over to the Young King, then at the <hi>Hague,</hi>
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:49784:220"/>
there was no other Copy left, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed need of any, the <hi>Book</hi> being Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to serve a false Pretence. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless it was very cunningly done of the Doctor to continue it a Secret at the <hi>Restauration</hi>; for had it been then as publickly pretended to as now, more than enough would have appear'd to divest him of his borrowed <hi>Plumes,</hi> and sufficiently expose both his Folly and Presumption; as another was, though not in a pretence of so high a Nature, which it may not be amiss here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; when at that time the two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>Sheldon,</hi> and <hi>Morley</hi> were more especially entrusted to recommend such Suffering Divines, as deserv'd Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the <hi>Church's Re-establishment</hi>; a certain Person came to the latter, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Morley,</hi> desiring to be consider'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Account; he having moreover written several Things very beneficial to the <hi>King</hi>'s Interest; the Bishop desir'd to know what they were, that he would name some one Piece; whereto he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>Killing no Murder</hi>; nay said the Bishop, herein you must excuse me, that was written by a <hi>Lay Man,</hi> and beyond Seas, I saw every Page as it was Penn'd before dry upon the Paper: And there is no doubt had Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> made his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49784:220"/>
Declaration then, before the same Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, he would have made the like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or something of that Nature, which should as easily disprove him; and that might have hindred his first Advance, and next Remove; as likewise, sav'd the Expence of <hi>Clapham-house,</hi> which if it were built upon an Expectation of <hi>Winchester,</hi> was such a Vanity as none but the two <hi>Brothers</hi> could be guilty of; for had the Thing been really done, the pretended Secret a Truth, there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others who had done, and suffer'd to a much higher degree, and every way infinitely more deserving both of Church and Crown.</p>
                     <p>What the <hi>Vindicator</hi> further urgeth as to their different Stiles, must likewise be absolutely convincing, to every unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd Mind; no two Things as to Speech and Writing, can bear a greater Disproportion, than that <hi>Strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and <hi>Majesty of Expression,</hi> which flows through every Line of the one; compar'd with those <hi>Frothy, Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Flourishes,</hi> the sole-set off to whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the other said or writ. It well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Eminence and Gravity to write an <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>Women's Painting,</hi> yet that Discourse of <hi>Artificial Beauty</hi> was certainly his, and the Language hath great Affinity with the Subject, a <hi>daub</hi>
                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:49784:221"/>
a <hi>fucus</hi> of Words, without any thing underneath, either Solid or Satisfactory. And I would desire the Author of the foremention'd <hi>Life,</hi> (who as he abounds in Words, so pretends to Sense,) that he, and his <hi>Fraternity,</hi> would for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while divert their Thoughts and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, otherwise continually imploy'd in undermining Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in considering the foremention'd Difference both as to Words and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then resolve whether there is not the same Disproportion, as between the abominable <hi>Rhymes,</hi> and <hi>Prose,</hi> of <hi>Withers, Prynn,</hi> and <hi>Vicars,</hi> compar'd with that <hi>Masculine</hi> way of Expression their admired <hi>Milton</hi> hath in both those Kinds, the abused Excellencies of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad Man.

from that Fit, yet they seldom find it brought to that Strength of Sense or Health, as formerly, and under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Apprehensions of a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Relapse. How many returns we have had of this Kind, is a very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Reflection; to be sure we seem so much weakned thereby, in our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual</hi> Part, as to admit none but the same, or such like <hi>Quacks</hi> as first brought us into this unhappy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have all along discover'd, that they design more the Tryal of their own foolish Experiments, than to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estate us in that perfect Vigour of Health and Strength, which before their tampering, we abundantly enjoy'd: And hereupon some have further taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that a <hi>Gubernandi Pruritus</hi> seems to have superseded that other of <hi>Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi</hi>; an <hi>Epidemical Itch</hi> of being all <hi>Governors,</hi> sets not only our Fingers, but our Heads on Work; hath more than once already brought us from <hi>Scratching</hi> to right down <hi>Blows,</hi> and in the end must certainly ruin all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
