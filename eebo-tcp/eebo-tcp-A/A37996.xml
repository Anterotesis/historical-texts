            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>PSALM cxix. cxlij.</bibl>
                  <p>Thy Righteousness is an Everlasting Righteousness,
and thy Law is the Truth.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is not to be doubted that the Subject of this
<hi>Psalm</hi> is the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> or the Precepts of
Just and Righteous Living, which are contain'd
in the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> and which we find
interspersed in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Writings, especially in the
Book of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> The Royal Prophet direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here his words to God, calls these <hi>his Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness</hi>
and <hi>his Law,</hi> and he adds that this Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness
is <hi>Everlasting,</hi> and that this Law is <hi>the
Truth.</hi> The most easy and obvious meaning of the
former clause of which words is this, that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law which he is speaking of, had its Existence
from Everlasting, it was alwaies what it is now.
Which is of the same import of what he saith in the
160. v. of this <hi>Psalm, Thy Word is True from the
beginning, i. e.</hi> from Everlasting, for these two are
synonymous, as appears from <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 23. The Rules
and Measures of what is Just and Right were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
and fix'd from Eternity. And besides, they are
of Perpetual and Eternal Obligation, they are such
Laws as shall never be repeal'd: whence our <hi>Psalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist</hi>
saith in another place, <hi>All God's Commandments
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49880:4"/>
are sure, they stand fast for ever and ever. Ps. 111.</hi>
7, 8. For what is Good or Evil in its own nature,
can at no time, or upon any account be alter'd.
Which brings me to the Interpretation of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Clause of the Words, <hi>Thy Law is the Truth,
i. e.</hi> these Rules of Moral Righteousness must needs
be Immutable and Perpetual, because they are no
imaginary and precarious things, nor do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon humane Institution and Arbitrement;
but they are Real and True in themselves, they are
Solid and Substantial, there being an Intrinsick
Goodness and Excellency in them. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they have <hi>Subsistence</hi> and <hi>Reality,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may properly and strictly be said <hi>to be,</hi> and <hi>to
be True.</hi> Which is a Notion that a Profound Man
among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had long since attain'd to; for
he tells us, that the Law of Nature or True Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
is<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>the finding of being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the Proposition that I will Entertain
you with at present, that the Reasons of Good and
Evil are Eternal and Unchangeable; that there are
such things as Right and Wrong, without any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Law or Constitution; that these had the start
of all human Contracts and Customs; and, in short,
that Religion and Virtue are ingrafted in our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nature, and are every waies suited to the frame
of Rational Creatures. This I will evince 1. From
the Nature of God. 2. From what we find in the
Mind of Man. 3. From the Behaviour and Actions
of Mankind. 4. From the Universal Consent of
the World.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>God's Nature</hi> or <hi>Mind</hi> is the Eternal Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Goodness and Righteousness, and therefore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49880:4"/>
these cannot but be Real and Eternal. It is certain
that the <hi>Essential Bonity,</hi> which is in Mens Actions,
is grounded on the <hi>Chief Good,</hi> that which <hi>Plato</hi>
frequently calls<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> De Leg. &amp; alibi.</note> 
               <hi>Goodness it self, and the Idea and
Pattern of all Goodness.</hi> For whence could Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be fetch'd, but from this Divine Source? It
could neither be deriv'd from Angels nor Men,
(and we can't think of any rank of Beings else
whence there is a probability of its being deriv'd)
because they themselves are from God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it would be unreasonable to think, that that
which is Best in them was not from Him. Yea,
from Him alone it must necessarily be, in whose
Perfect Nature the Ideas and Platforms of it were
from Eternal Ages: for as the Ideas of <hi>Truth</hi> were
eternally Existent in God's <hi>Understanding,</hi> so his
<hi>Will</hi> was pregnant and replenish'd with Goodness
and Holiness. Which is a Notion that we cannot
but form of the Divine Being, because he being
<hi>most Perfect,</hi> we can't possibly conceive of him
without apprehensions of both these, <hi>viz.</hi> his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
fraught with Truth, and his Will with
Goodness. Now, from this Eternal Fountain the
Goodness and Righteousness of Men have their
Original, and consequently they can't but be Real
and True, and have an inward worth in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
whatever partakes of the Divine Nature and
Perfection is really worthy and excellent. It is then
the holy Nature of the Divine Being that is the prime
Source, as well as Rule of human sanctity and
righteousness. It is this on which they depend,
for it is the Pattern of them. Goodness in us is
but a Copy of that Original, that Essential and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49880:5"/>
Goodness, which is in the Supreme Good.
This is the true Root of all Rectitude, Justice and
Righteousness. The Eternal Laws of Just and Good,
which are in the Divine Mind, are the Pillars on
which the Moral Goodness of Rational Beings is
founded. Hence it is that the Laws of Good and
Evil, of Just and Unjust among Men, are in their
own nature firm and solid, and never to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
for they are eternally Good, and grounded
on the unchangeableness of the Supreme Being.
The Reasons of them did exist from Eternity in the
Divine Nature, and they were ever conformable
to the upright Will of God, and for that Reason
cannot be otherwise. Thus it appears, that Moral
Righteousness being originally founded in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Nature of God, must consequently be
Immutable.</p>
            <p>2. The Intrinsick and unchangeable Nature of it
is demonstrated, not only from our tracing it up to
its First Head, but from its being seated by God in
the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man. For <hi>this</hi> is the very Image and
Pourtraiture of God himself, and consequently,
seeing <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> are Essential to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature (as was said before) these Excellencies
are also inseparable from the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man. And
therefore from the Nature of human Souls, as such,
it were easy to prove that there were Innate No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
not only of <hi>True</hi> and <hi>False,</hi> but of <hi>Good</hi> and
<hi>Evil,</hi> imprinted on them at their first make. And
tho' we have not the <hi>use</hi> of these Original Notions
presently, or in our Infancy and Childhood (as
some urge) yet it is ridiculous to infer thence, that
they are not in the Soul: for on the same ground
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49880:5"/>
it might be prov'd, that a Man hath no <hi>Rational
Soul</hi> for several years, because the Faculties of it
do not actually exert themselves. But we are sure
that those Mental Impressions were in all Men from
the beginning, because they are the First Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their natural frame, as they are Reasonable
Beings, and as their Souls resemble the Divinity.
Hence it follows, as a clear and incontestible Truth,
that, tho' by the early Apostacy of the First Man
our human Nature is deprav'd, our Faculties are
corrupted, and we have an inward proclivity to
what is vicious, so that it is the work of the <hi>Holy
Spirit</hi> to enable us to do any Good that can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God: yet there are remaining in us, as
we are Human Creatures and Rational Agents,
Natural Principles and Sentiments of Morality.
And therefore we may observe, that One, who is
an unquestionable Asserter of the original depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mankind, is yet very positive in this, that
<note n="*" place="margin">Quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam inesse humanae menti, &amp; quidem naturali instinctu, divinitatis Sensum, extra con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversiam ponimus. <hi>Calvin.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. l. 1. c. 3. Omnious inditum esse divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis semen experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Ibid. c. 4.</note> 
               <hi>there is in the Souls of Men a Sense of Divinity
and Religion, and that even by a Natural Instinct;</hi>
and accordingly he spends a whole Chapter to
prove the existence of this Inbred Principle in the
Minds of all Men. And truly, every Man alive,
that is attentive and unprejudiced, may feel this in
him as soon as he is arrived to the use of Reason,
(for he can't exspect it should actually display it
self till then) or whenever he hath occasion given
him to exercise his thoughts concerning Moral and
Divine things. To this the Great Apostle refers
in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. when he tells us, that <hi>the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
who have not the Law, (i. e.</hi> the written Law)
<hi>do by nature (i. e.</hi> by vertue of these radical notions
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49880:6"/>
of Moral Goodness in their minds) <hi>the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Law,</hi> they are push'd on to it by this
Natural Principle within them. Hence it is that
tho' <hi>they have not the Law,</hi> yet <hi>they are a Law
unto themselves,</hi> because they have this inward Law
in their own minds, which instructs them what to
do, as to the great duties of Natural Religion.
Therefore he adds, that <hi>they shew the work of the
Law written in their hearts,</hi> namely in these Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Characters by God's own hand. So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be said more plainly to Establish these
inward Signatures and Impresses of Goodness on
the Soul.</p>
            <p>And they were Engraven there for <hi>Great</hi> and
<hi>Excellent Purposes</hi> in the life of Man: whence we
may further evince, that there are <hi>indeed</hi> such Inbred
Principles and Notions. There being so many
waies of Delusion and Error in the World, such a
diversity of avocations from Religion and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the Worship of the Divine Being, and
such Charming Temptations every where to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Life; it was requisite there should be such <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Directors</hi> as these in Mens breasts. There
being such Impediments to Truth and Goodness
as Passion, Prejudice, Interest, Pleasures, and these
continually operating upon us; it was necessary
there should be something within us to remind us
of what is True and what is Good, something
within us that opposes it self to all the foresaid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles
and hindrances. There was a necessity that
there should be a Divine Principle in our Souls,
which should be as it were a continual <hi>Fund</hi> to our
Consciences, alwaies to supply and furnish them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49880:6"/>
with Virtuous dictates. Amongst the most rude and
barbarous People it is <hi>This</hi> that keeps up some kind
of Notion of Honesty and Goodness. Yea, and
among those that are Civiliz'd, these would be in
danger of being lost, if there were not this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rooted in their minds. All that is Just and
Right would have been banish'd out of the World,
unless this prevalent Inmate had acted its part, and
kept us from being wholly bereft of them. We
had long since been absorpt of Atheism and Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
if this had not powerfully secur'd us. Were
it not for this active Spark, the Fire of Virtue
would have been extinguish'd, and it would have
been impossible to preserve it in the midst of that
Deluge of Vice, which hath broken in upon us.
God took care therefore, that there should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
in the heart of every Man, learned or illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
these Moral Impressions which I am speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, which will not suffer Mankind to be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alienated from a sense of what is Good and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.
It may be attributed to this, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the General Depravation and Corruption,
there is yet a Face of Religion in the World. For
it is an undoubted Truth, that <hi>This</hi> buoys up
Goodness when it is sinking, this supports it when
it is falling, this keeps it alive when it is even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring.
So absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> was the implanting
of <hi>these Notions</hi> in Mens minds from their very
birth. And then (which is the thing I have been
proving) these Innate Principles of Good and Evil
thus implanted in us, are a certain and unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
eviction of the Intrinsick Excellency of Moral
Religion, and of all Virtuous and Just Actions,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49880:7"/>
which are but Transcripts and Exemplifications of
those Original Conceptions placed by God in the
minds of Men.</p>
            <p>3. As the real and unchangeable nature of Moral
Righteousness is proved from its conformity to the
Supreme and Eternal Good, and from the Images
of Good, which our minds are furnish'd with from
our birth, so it may be evidenc'd from the constant
<hi>Behaviour and Practice of Mankind</hi> afterwards.
This I will make appear from these following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
1. From Mens excusing their sins. 2. From
their desiring Secrecy when they commit them.
3. From the Regrets and Remorses which they feel
afterwards. 4. From the Fear of Punishment which
haunts them. 5. From that Dislike and Hatred
which even Bad men themselves have of Vice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> the Intrinsick Excellency of Vertue is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
from mens <hi>Excusing</hi> their sins and vitious
practises, and devolving them upon others. This
was in the World as soon as Sin it self. <hi>Adam</hi>
would needs cast his Transgression and Guilt upon
his Relative, and she put it off to the <hi>Serpent.</hi>
This hath been the practice of sinners ever since:
tho' they know themselves to be really Criminal,
yet they endeavour to throw off their faults, and
they use all sorts of palliations and pretences to
clear themselves; and particularly they are wont to
usurp the Names and Titles of Virtue to conceal
their evil deeds, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ondly disguising these latter under
a shew and resemblance of the former. But whilst
they do so, they confess, that <hi>Virtue</hi> is Excellent
and Laudable, otherwise they would not emulate
the likeness of it: and they acknowledge, that <hi>Vice</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49880:7"/>
is in it self base and reproachful, and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
nature of Man is averse to it, else they would
not excuse it, and shift it off: nay, 'tis certain they
would own it, if it were Good and praise worthy.
But they have natural convictions of the contrary,
which makes them strive to clear themselves of it:
and these evasions are a palpable proof that Vice is
a thing opposite to the reasonable frame of their
Souls, and is of its own nature Evil, and that there
is a distinction between Just and Unjust, Right and
Wrong, founded in the nature of things.</p>
            <p>Again, this also appears from men's desiring of
<hi>Secrecy</hi> when they commit sins, and after they have
committed them. For though one reason of their
sculking and absconding is, because they would not
be defeated in what they undertake, or be detected
when it is performed; yet this is another reason of
their affecting of privacy, namely, because they are
<hi>ashamed</hi> to act those vile things in the Eyes of the
World. Vice is so ugly and deformed, that they
would not have it seen: and when it is, they blush
and are confounded at their own evil doings.
Which is signify'd to us in that Expostulation <hi>Rom.</hi>
6. 21. <hi>What profit had ye in those things whereof ye
are now ashamed?</hi> This blushing argues an inward
turpitude in vitious actions: whereas Virtue, which
is Good in it self, is daring, and carries Confidence
with it. If there were not a real blemish and stain
in unjust and lewd practises, why should men be
ashamed of them? Why should they be put out of
countenance, and look like Malefactors? Why
should they fly to their Coverts, and run into
corners, and fear a discovery? There was an early
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49880:8"/>
Example of this in the first Sinners, they retired,
and <hi>hid themselves, Gen.</hi> 3. 8. On which an Antient
and Pious Father of the Christian Church hath
these remarkable words,<note n="*" place="margin">S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost. Hom. 12. ad Pop. Antioch.</note> 
               <hi>Why did</hi> Adam, <hi>after
he had sinned, hide himself, seeing at that time there
was no written Law? The Reason was, because he
had a natural inbred knowledge that he had done ill,
he being self-instructed in the knowledge of Virtue.</hi>
And thence arose in him that inward bashfulness
and dejection of Soul after the commission of Sin,
and thence he fondly attempted to hide not only
himself, but his Crime from God. And it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
that <hi>Cain</hi> refus'd to discover his murdering
of his Brother; when God demanded of him where
he was, his surly reply was, <hi>he knew not, Gen.</hi> 4. 9.
Which concealing of Vice argues the intrinsick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of it, for why else is it mask'd with privacy and
retirement, and kept from the knowledge of others
as much as it is possible, yea even of those sometimes
that can't hurt us? This is an argument that Virtue is
good and lovely, and that the contrary is vile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable,
and that the mind of Man naturally approves
of Moral Goodness, and dislikes Vice and Immorality.</p>
            <p>Further, the <hi>Regrets</hi> and <hi>Remorses</hi> of Sinners for
their acting contrary to the Divine Laws, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Testimonies of this Truth. Why do they call
themselves to an account, and arraign, and pass
Sentence upon themselves for what they have done?
Why are they uneasy and dissatisfy'd, and find an
unspeakable Trouble in their minds? Is not this
from Natural Conscience, and those inbred impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which are in the Soul of every Man? Yes,
without doubt, these cause them to rebuke and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49880:8"/>
chastise themselves, and that very severely, when
they offend against these inward dictates. Thence
come those Vexations and Torments which willful
Transgressors feel in their breasts, yea tho' their
faults be kept secret, and none knows them but
themselves. Notwithstanding this, they are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and disquieted, and as the <hi>Satyrist</hi> well remarks
of such men,
<q>
                  <l>Tacitâ sudant praecordia culpâ<note n="*" place="margin">Iuv. Sat. 11.</note>
                  </l>
               </q>
But especially the more open and profligate Sinners
have frequent experience of these inward Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
Sweatings and Agonies, which render them
a Plague and Torment to themselves. <hi>Cain</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
that <hi>his iniquity</hi> (for so the original word
should be rendred) <hi>was greater than he could bear,
Gen.</hi> 4. 13. That is, the guilt of his heinous Sin
became an insupportable burden to him. So <hi>Iudas,</hi>
from the horror of his guilt, sunk into despair.
And who sees not that the usual effects of great and
flagitious enormities are Pain and Torture of mind,
Deliquiums of Soul and Body, and the wasting and
macerating of the flesh and spirits, by continual
restlesness and disturbance? The ground of it is
obvious, for Sin is a violent distorting of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and primitive temper of Man, and therefore it
cannot but create extreme anguish and perturbation.
One reason why men are displeas'd with themselves
after the commission of what is Immoral, is because
they find they have acted contrary to their Native
Principle, because they have done something that
is unsuitable to the rational nature which they are
endued with. It appears hence that Sin is naturally
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49880:9"/>
Evil, and that it is an affront to our Reasons and
Understandings to transgress the Laws of Morality.
Thus a Man's own mind establishes the Equity and
Goodness of these Laws, and convinces him that
the Foundations of Moral Righteousness are sure
and stable.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this may be made evident from <hi>the
Fear of Punishment,</hi> which haunts and possesses the
minds of Evil men. Thus <hi>Cain,</hi> the first Murderer,
was afraid that <hi>every one that found him would slay
him:</hi> he had a perpetual dread of the fatal recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
which was the merit of his villany. And
Natural Conscience tells all other Sinners that they
deserve Punishment: <hi>they know the Iudgment of
God, that they who commit such things, are worthy
of death,</hi> as the Apostle speaks: and this knowledge
unavoidably breeds Fear and Dread. Some would
needs persuade us that this Passion is rais'd by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Heads, by Wise Rulers and Governours,
merely to aw their dastard Subjects: but it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that this is a falsity, because Princes and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
themselves are liable to these impressions; nay,
we know they actually have been under the force
and prevalency of such Principles. <hi>Belshazar</hi> the
Great Babylonian Monarch fell into fits of shaking
and trembling, when the Hand-writing on the Wall
put him in mind of his Profaness and Debauchery,
and the just Deserts of both. King <hi>Herod</hi> after the
murder of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was restless in his mind,
and had the terrible sight of that Holy Man conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
represented to his fancy, and<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 14. 2.</note> 
               <hi>he thought he
was risen from the dead,</hi> and was come to Torment
him. <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour was not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49880:9"/>
the terrors and affrightments of his Conscience,
after all his unnatural Lusts and Cruelties. <hi>Nero</hi>
after all his prodigious villanies could not dissemble
his horrors, and his being haunted with Spirits,
and tormented with Furies and Flames. Which
plainly shews, that this dread of mind is no Politick
Invention, no Feigned Passion and Representation,
no idle Phantom or Mormo; but that it is a real
thing, and flows from the natural dictates of the
Mind, and not these from Fear, as some would
suggest. Why should Men be affraid of the Divine
Being, if they deserv'd not his Displeasure? And
how can they deserve it, unless they have done some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amiss, <hi>i. e.</hi> broken some Law, which they
were oblig'd to keep? There must then be some
obligation on Man from <hi>Nature</hi> to observe such and
such Laws: for I speak even of those who have
thrown off all Obligations but this. Their being
conscious to themselves that they have not acted as
they ought, and that thereby they are become guilty,
creates this Timerousness and Dread in them, and
gives them an apprehension of the great Day of
Doom.</p>
            <p>In the next place I argue from that <hi>dislike</hi> and
<hi>hatred,</hi> which even Bad men themselves have of
some <hi>Vices,</hi> and from that great <hi>Esteem</hi> which they
have of some <hi>Virtues. Pride</hi> is universally disrelish'd,
and the very Persons who cherish it in themselves,
abhor it in others. Nothing is more generally
abominated than a Proud and Arrogant Man; and
on the contrary, nothing is more valu'd, lov'd, and
caress'd than one that is <hi>Humble</hi> and <hi>Meek.</hi> Even
those very Persons, whose practice is a remonstrance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49880:10"/>
against Humility, have at the same time an inward
liking of this Virtue, yea and outwardly express
their approbation of it. The <hi>Avaritious</hi> and <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Niggard</hi> is scorn'd and laught at by every one:
but the <hi>Liberal</hi> and <hi>Generous</hi> are applauded by all.
<hi>Clean</hi> and <hi>Chast Discourse</hi> meets with an universal
acceptance: but <hi>Obscenity</hi> and <hi>Ribaldry,</hi> tho' dress'd
in the Garb of Wit, are generally nauseous and
offensive, and the Organ of Hearing is as 'twere
disoblig'd, and even hurt by them; and oftentimes
the Hearer blushes, because the Speaker doth not.
A <hi>Lyar</hi> is a Title of the greatest reproach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
among men: a <hi>lying Tongue</hi> is not only one
of those things which<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 6. 17.</note>

Speaking,</hi> without any dissimulation or reserve, is
a very graceful and amiable thing, and nothing is
more valu'd and commended in the World. Again,
<hi>Oppression, Violence, Rapine, Persecution,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if these proceed to <hi>Bloodshed</hi> and <hi>Slaughter,</hi>
are hated of all Persons, yea of those who practice
these Vices most of all. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> had ever in
his mouth that of <hi>Euripides,<note n="‡" place="margin">Sueton. <hi>in</hi> Iul. Caes.</note> If Right at all may
be violated, it must be for the sake of a Crown; but
in other matters let us be exactly just.</hi> The greatest
Invaders acknowledge Justice to be good, and it is
Interest only that warps their judgment. The <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti</hi>
and <hi>Rapparees</hi> rob for mere Gain, and even <hi>Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines</hi>
and <hi>Ruffians</hi> must be well paid to do their work;
which shews there is no temptation in the Thing it
self. A <hi>Common Thief</hi> had rather find than take
away another Man's goods; and whilst he doth the
latter, he disapproves of it. Or say, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49880:10"/>
of it in himself, yet he detesteth it in all
others. So <hi>Perfidiousness</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi> meet with
a Catholick abhorrence; and those who reward
these practises, yet hate the things themselves, and
the Actors of them are alwaies odious in the World,
and sometimes signally punish'd by them who set
them on work. But <hi>Faithfulness, Sincerity, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
Frankness</hi> and <hi>True-heartedness</hi> are belov'd
by all Men. And it were easy to shew in other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
that Vicious and Immoral Actions are loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
even by Sinners themselves, and that they who
dare not practice Wisdom and Virtue, yet<note n="*" place="margin">Neque enim un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in tantum convales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet nequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam sic contra vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurabitur, ut non Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neat. <hi>Sen.</hi> Epist. 14.</note> praise
and commend it, and are willing to see it thrive in
the world. Thus from the <hi>Behaviour</hi> and <hi>deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of Men, even those who are of the worst sort,
it is evident that Virtue is praise-worthy in its own
Nature, and that there is an inward Principle in all
Men, that makes them pay respect to Goodness
and Honesty, and to disparage what is vicious and
unlawful.</p>
            <p>In the last place, I will prove the Laws of Moral
Goodness to be Intrinsick and Natural from their
being <hi>universally receiv'd.</hi> For that of <hi>Tully</hi> is an
unquestionable Maxim,<note n="†" place="margin">Consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um jus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanda est.</note> 
               <hi>When all People agree in
a thing, we are to look upon it as the Law of Nature.</hi>
Now, it is evident that there is among all Men an
Agreement, as to the main, about the Notion of
Good and Evil. Just and Right are every where,
and among all Persons the same,<note place="margin">Tusc. Q. l. 1.</note> as <hi>Fire burns here
and in Persia,</hi> (to use the words of the famous
<note n="‡" place="margin">Ethic. l. 5. c. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Stagyrite.)</hi> We are told by <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi>
that the very Barbarous <hi>Scythians</hi> took care of their

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49880:11"/>
whereupon he makes this seasonable Remark,

Virtue is born with us rather than made and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion'd.</hi>
And indeed it must needs be so, because
the notices and impressions of Good and Evil on
Mens minds are <hi>Universal:</hi> and it is impossible they
should be otherwise, because they are <hi>Natural,</hi> for
Nature universally spreads it self in every individual.
Hence is that <hi>Common Consent</hi> in all Men concerning
the grand Points of Morality: they are voted to be
Reasonable and Just, by the whole Assembly of
mankind throughout the World.</p>
            <p>I know this is oppos'd by the Learned Mr<note n="†" place="margin">De Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. l. 1. c. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and some others, especially of late, who hold
that <hi>Universal Consent</hi> is no argument to prove the
Law of Nature. Or rather, they say, there is no
such thing as Universal Consent, there being so
many various Opinions and Practices in Morality
and Religion. But I desire these following things
may be consider'd, which will fully answer the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of those who oppose this doctrine. First,
I grant that God hath judicially given over some
People to a reprobate sense, and that because <hi>they</hi>
have given <hi>themselves</hi> over first to their Lusts, and
have willfully shut their Eyes against the light. Hence
it is that they have in many things corrupted and
distorted the Law of Nature, and then it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that they have been permitted to fall into the
most irrational practises, as that of Idolatry, and
the like.</p>
            <p>But I add next, that this Corruption is not in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49880:11"/>
the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>General Principles</hi> of Nature, but in
some undue <hi>Inferences</hi> and <hi>Deductions</hi> thence.
Thus in the case of <hi>Polytheism</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which
is the adoring of False Gods, and was ever a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
crime among the common sort of Heathens,
there is the <hi>General</hi> dictate of Natural Religion
kept up, <hi>viz.</hi> the worshipping of a Deity, though
they are so ignorant and corrupted as to conclude
this and the other thing to be a God, tho' they are
not. So there is no Man or Nation extant, who
think it lawfull to <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>injure</hi> any one: but there
is some disagreement as to the <hi>Particular Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
which may arise from these Premises; and in
some particular Instances, <hi>that</hi> may be thought by
some to be hurtful and injurious, which is not deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so by others. And thus those Usages among
<hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations, which are so far different from
ours, may be reconcil'd, as namely, their eating
the dead, in stead of burying them; and their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching
their old sick Parents out of the World,
which they look upon as a Courtesy done to them,
and several the like practises. In which the first
and general Principles of Morality are not violated,
but only some false Conclusions are drawn from
them. Notwithstanding which, the main and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Laws of Good and Evil are the same, and
are own'd to be so.</p>
            <p>Again, with particular relation to Mr <hi>Selden's
Objection</hi> (which a late Writer hath borrow'd from
him, and makes great use of) <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no
Natural and Universal Law of Morality, because
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are so vicious, and act so contrary to
the light of Reason; I answer, that when I assert
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49880:12"/>
the Law of Nature to be Universal, I mean, that
it prevails among all Men in the World that are
of <hi>sound minds,</hi> and who carefully <hi>attend to</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Natural Conscience, and who <hi>use</hi> their
Understandings, and make Reflections, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their Faculties. But if there be some (and too
many there are) who are stupid and sottish, and
attend not to the Inbred Notions of their minds,
(whereby these Notions are in a manner defaced,
and almost extinguish'd) I am not to answer for
these. When I speak of <hi>Universal Consent,</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it of those that think and consider, and
are not wont to debauch and distemper their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as those Rude and Savage <hi>Gentiles</hi> do.
Wherefore we are not at all concern'd for the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silians</hi>
or <hi>Caribes,</hi> no nor for the <hi>Soldanians</hi> and
<hi>Hotentots,</hi> with the noise of whom our Ears are
mightily grated of late. The strange behaviour of
these People is no real reproach to Human Nature,
nor any impeachment of the General Laws of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
which all People agree in who rouze their
inward Principle, and give heed to it. And thence
I gather that the Precepts of Virtue are immovable
and unalterable, for they are fix'd and riveted into
the very Nature of mankind, or else there would
not be an <hi>Universal Agreement</hi> about them.</p>
            <p>I might go on to farther Proofs of the Intrinsick
Nature of Good and Evil, from those <hi>Absurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,</hi>
which would follow from the contrary.
<hi>First,</hi> if there be no such thing, and if, notwitstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what hath been alledged, Virtue and Vice are
casual and contingent, then our Faculties were given
us to cheat and abuse us, and they are continually
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49880:12"/>
impos'd upon, and that about their proper Objects:
which is a doctrine that would destroy even a <hi>Deity,</hi>
and we could say nothing to prove there is such a
Being. Or, allowing a God, it would be a reproach
to his Goodness and Wisdom, to bestow such men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Powers upon us as are constantly deceiv'd, and
to implant such Notions in the Souls of all Men as
are false and erroneous, and which have nothing
real and solid in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> this also would be a Consequence from
the premises, that we may live and act as we please:
for if there be no fix'd Laws and Rules of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Righteousness, then nothing can be said to
be Lawful, and consequently nothing can be said to
be Unlawful: or what is Lawful to day, may be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to morrow. For if there be not any Inward
Reason of the Moral Laws enjoin'd us by God, if
they be not in themselves, and in their abstract
nature Good; he may prescribe us other Laws, and
those contrary to these which we now have; and
so God may command us to hate him, and to hurt
and mischief our neighbours. If these things are
not intrinsically evil, so that they can never be Good,
they may in time become our Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this is another Consequence, that our
<hi>Happiness</hi> would be precarious and uncertain: for
the Happiness of Rational Creatures depends on
the Goodness of their Actions. And by this means
we should be wholly unacquainted with the Great
<hi>End</hi> of our lives, which is the thing that is to steer
us in this World, and to direct us in all we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.
These are some of the egregious Blunders
and monstrous <hi>Absurdities</hi> which attend the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49880:13"/>
Opinion, and may serve to confirm us in this
weighty Point, that there is an Intrinsick Goodness
in Virtuous actions, and an Intrinsick Evil in Vitious
ones, and that the Reasons of both are congenite
to our Rational Nature, and flow from it, and are
ever agreeable to it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have Establish'd the Doctrine which I
undertook to discourse of. And it was necessary
to do it, because tho' the generality of mankind
(as was said before) do unanimously averr, that
Goodness is not plac'd in the arbitrary opinions of
Men, but in nature it self; yet there have been of
old, and are at this day those who contradict and
oppose it. The Antient <hi>Scepticks</hi> were infamous
for this, who had learnt of their Master <hi>Pyrrho,</hi>
that there is<note n="†" place="margin">Laert. <hi>in vit.</hi> Pyrrh.</note> no difference between Good and
Evil by <hi>Nature,</hi> but only by <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Custom
Laertius</hi> acquaints us, that it was the positive opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of one of that sort of Men, that a Wise Man
will not stick to commit Sacriledge, or Adultery,
or to Steal, whenever he hath a fit opportunity;

the vulgar apprehension concerning them, which
the rabble of Fools and Ignorant People have taken
up. <hi>Tully</hi> testifies concerning the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that

thing, set forth and commended to the World by
a mere empty sound of words. This also was the
Sentiment of some that pretended to be <hi>Christians,</hi>
as the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> and especially <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> who
was a Great Man with that party: he with much
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49880:13"/>
earnestness avow'd, that all<note n="*" place="margin">

as <hi>Theodoret</hi> bears witness concerning him, and

            <p>But to come down lower, they have, it seems,
a power in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to change the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Vice and Virtue. It is agreed on by the
the chiefest Writers of that Communion, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> hath such a <hi>Plenitude of Power,</hi> that he can
dispense with Just and Right, and any Law of God,
excepting only the Articles of Faith. So saith the
<hi>Glosse</hi> upon the Canon Law, and <hi>Panormitan</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
of it. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> their Great Champion,
speaks home to the business,<note n="†" place="margin">Si autem Papa erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, vel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibendo virtutes, teneretur Ecclesia credere vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia esse bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, nisi vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let contra conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care.

could erre so far as to command the practice of Vice,
and to forbid the practice of Virtue, the Church
in that case is oblig'd, unless it would sin against
Conscience, to believe Vice to be Good, and Virtue
to be Evil. Judge now whether the Reasons of
Good and Evil be not taken away by the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> when it can alter the property of Virtue
and Vice, and when their People are bound in
Conscience to take one for the other. Judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do not ascribe more to their Great <hi>Pontif</hi>
than can be attributed to God himself: for certainly
it is so far from being in the power of any Man to
alter the Natural and Moral Law, and to take away
the obligation of it, that it is not within the verge
of Divine Power it self. It is the decision of the
Famous <hi>Grotius</hi> (who is alwaies very wary when
he speaks concerning <hi>what God can do,</hi> as indeed
it doth become us: yet it is the peremptory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49880:14"/>
I say, of that Great Man) in his Excellent
Book of <hi>the Rights of Peace and War,<note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 1. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
cannot change this Law of Natural Goodness,
he cannot make that which is intrinsically evil to be
no evil.</hi> And the Reason is, because then he would
not be God, for his Nature would be chang'd,
which is a thing utterly impossible, and the very
supposition of it is to be abhorred.</p>
            <p>The Great <hi>Gallick</hi> Philosopher, who discourses
so admirably concerning the <hi>Moral Virtues,</hi> was
enclin'd to think, that they were not founded on
immoveable Reasons: for in some places of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles</hi>
and in his <hi>Answers,</hi> where he holds that
Goodness as well as Truth eternally depended on
the <hi>Divine Will</hi> and its free determination, he
seems to mean that God could have determin'd them
otherwise, if he had pleas'd: and so, that which is
now Good, might have been Evil. But this mistaken
Notion of this Learned Man arose from his not
considering and remembring, that the <hi>Will</hi> of God
is alwaies the same as to its real intrinsick nature,
and therefore what it now is, it ever was, and can
never be otherwise, and consequently Goodness is
unvariable, and that which is Good now can't be
Evil at another time. Which if that Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
had bore in his mind, he would not have
argu'd from God's <hi>Will</hi> in that manner which he
seems to do.</p>
            <p>But I am sorry to find that in our own Nation
likewise there are those who oppose the Intrinsick
Nature of Moral Goodness, and render it dubious
and arbitrary. Among these ought to be mention'd
in the first place that known Person, in whose <hi>State
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49880:14"/>
of Nature</hi> (which he laies down as the Foundation
of his whole System) nothing is virtuous or vitious,
just or unjust; for he holds that these arise only
from Compact and Society. The <hi>Magistrate</hi> is Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi>'s <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> is the maker of Good and
Evil, and he can unmake them when he pleases.
Which is said well enough for such a Philosopher
as holds a <hi>Man</hi> is nothing else but <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Carkase.</hi>

            <p>Another<note n="†" place="margin">De Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae Disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soph.</note> Learned Writer (tho' a professed
Enemy to the former) resolves all Moral Philosophy
into <hi>Geometrical and Mechanick Principles:</hi> which
perhaps was design'd on purpose by that profound
and sagacious Person to convince some in an Age
of <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> He is follow'd and vouch'd by

to thrust this Conceit on the World, that <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Observation</hi> is the Standard of all Goodness
and Morality: but I believe you will agree with me
in this, that this is spoken rather like a <hi>Virtuoso</hi>
than a <hi>Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another, who in his <hi>Brief Disquisition of
the Law of Nature,</hi> hath refin'd upon both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Writers, and makes it his work to shew that
the proof of Natural Laws or Dictates of Reason,
can be drawn only from the use of our <hi>Senses.</hi> He
holds, that <hi>by the motion impress'd on the Organs of
our Senses, God delineates the Ideas or Images of all
Moral Actions on our minds.</hi> He thinks there is no
Notion of Moral Goodness or Evil but what is
communicated to us by these, and consequently it
is not <hi>Innate.</hi> Tho' by the bye it is well worth our
observing, that he freely grants, that<note n="‡" place="margin">Chap. 2. § 20.</note> 
               <hi>Beasts</hi> derive
not all their knowledge from their <hi>Senses,</hi> but are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49880:15"/>
born with peculiar <hi>appetites and inclinations, and
have natural Instincts, or Impressions stampt by God
on their very natures.</hi> So unkind are these Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Masters to their own <hi>Species,</hi> as to grudge it
the Prerogative and Excellency of a <hi>Brute.</hi> They
not only degrade mankind, but thrust them below
the rank of Irrational Beings. But if you would
know the particular way how Moral Sentiments are
derived to us, they tell you, this is the method,
and they admit of no other; <hi>God makes external
Causes operate on our bodily Organs, and by this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and motion, in a certain and determinate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
we attain to a notion of what is Vitious or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</hi>
It is by the influence of outward objects,
and them only, that all Principles of Morality come
to be known to us. But to disprove this, and at
the same time to baffle the like Doctrine of another
late Author,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I ask, how can <hi>General Notions</hi> of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
be produc'd by the <hi>External Senses?</hi> Is there
any cognation at all between <hi>Abstract Ideas of
Goodness</hi> and mere <hi>Bodily Objects?</hi> Can a Man
imagine that Universal and Complex Apprehensions
can be the off-spring of the particular matters of
Corporeal Sense?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> if this Author and his Friends be in the
right, then those Beings that are destitute of Bodily
Sense can have no Notion of Good and Evil. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<hi>Angels</hi> to be Incorporeal, Morality is a thing
not known to them; nor is it known to <hi>Separate
Souls,</hi> nor <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, nay not to <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
because these are exempted from Bodily Senses,
and consequently they are not capable of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Moral Propositions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49880:15"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this Opinion, that Natural Motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
Moral Goodness, is such a confounding and
jumbling together of <hi>Physicks</hi> and <hi>Ethicks,</hi> that
none who have clear and distinct conceptions of
things will admit of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and lastly, this Opinion makes all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
contingent and uncertain, for all Natural and
Bodily Motion (on which he holds it depends) is
so: at one time or other it varies. External and
Corporeal Causes are shifting and fickle: Objects
work on us differently, yea the operations of the
same Objects are not alwaies the same; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Moral Goodness, which is founded on these,
is no fix'd thing, but is unsteady and floating: we
know not where to have it, according to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
These are the Reasons why I cannot approve
of this New Method, which he hath taken to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Truth of Morality, or rather to cashier
and defeat it. Which he chuses rather to do, than
to acknowledge any Inbred Principle in the Soul
of Man.</p>
            <p>I could have wish'd that Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> had not so
contemptibly reflected on the Inbred Notions
and Characters of Truth and Goodness on Mens
minds, as to reproach them with the Title of<note n="*" place="margin">Reflections on the Essay of Humane Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> 
               <hi>mere
Iargon and unintelligible Cant;</hi> especially seeing one
that hath larded <hi>some of his Writings</hi> with so many
unintelligible high-flown Strains, and <hi>Platonick
Gibberish,</hi> (and even in the present matter which
is before us talks of <hi>the presentialness of the Ideal
World to our Souls, which is the Divine Essence,
wherein we see and understand all things)</hi> might
have been more favourable in his Censure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49880:16"/>
Another late Ingenious Author will by no means
hear of Natural and Congenite Principles of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
but roundly tells us in these express words,
that<note n="†" place="margin">Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Men come to the knowledge of Moral Principles
and Duties by Tradition: their Fathers taught them
them, and their Grandfathers their Fathers, and so
up to Adam the common Parent of all.</hi> And a little
after he uses such language as this, <hi>Moral Duties
are convey'd to all the World as Spinning and Weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and such like inventions. Whereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
the Notions of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Reveal'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and yet it is observable that in those <hi>Dialogues</hi>
he first distinctly Discourses of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi>
and then of <hi>Reveal'd.</hi> Whence it is evident that
he not only contradicts himself, but mightily grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the <hi>Theist,</hi> whom he hath to deal with, and
pretends to confute: but he not only baulks one of
the greatest and strongest proofs we have of the
Truth of Moral Notions and Offices, but he ridicules
all Morality, by setting it on no other bottom than
what the Trade of <hi>Weavers</hi> and <hi>Spinsters</hi> hath. Thus
we pull down that with our own hands which we
pretend to build up; and even whilst some among
us are confuting of <hi>Deism,</hi> they promote and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it.</p>
            <p>There is another Writer yet behind, who seems
to shew himself as backward to own a Natural
Principle of Religion, as any of the forenam'd ones;
for he sticks not to say, that<note n="*" place="margin">Essay of Humane Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. <hi>Book 1. Chap. 2.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>there are no Notions
naturally imprinted on the mind; for then,</hi> saith he,
<hi>Children and Ideots would have them.</hi> But it is
certain he might as strongly have argued, that there
is no Reason or Prudence in mankind, because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>Children</hi> nor <hi>Ideots</hi> are observ'd to exercise
these. The <hi>Logick</hi> is every whit as good. And in
another place, conformably to his denial of all
Practical Principles in the mind of Man, he speaks
very doubtfully of <hi>Virtue</hi> it self;<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Essay,</hi> B. 1. c. 3. p. 23.</note> 
               <hi>The name or sound
of VIRTUE,</hi> saith he, <hi>is hard to be understood,
it is liable to much Uncertainty in its signification:
and the thing it stands for is much contended about,
and difficult to be known.</hi> And again, VIRTUES
<hi>and</hi> SINS <hi>are words of uncertain signification, and

               <hi>he makes the
Law, whereby we judge of</hi> Virtue <hi>and</hi> Vice, <hi>to be
nothing else but the Consent of Private Men.</hi> And in
the same place he is positive, that <hi>the measure of what

<hi>is Approbation or Dislike, Praise or Blame.</hi> And

               <hi>Nothing else but that which hath the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance

(tho' he attempts to correct them in a later Edition)
I am <hi>somewhat enclin'd</hi> to understand according to
the plain and obvious meaning of them, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because it is <hi>probable,</hi> that as in <hi>other</hi> very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Points, so <hi>here</hi> he Symbolizes with the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> in whose steps he affects to
tread, and borrows some of his Thoughts. For as he
follows him in his Opinion of <hi>the Necessity of only One
Fundamental Article of Christian Faith,</hi> and in his
Notion of <hi>Thinking matter,</hi> and particularly in that
of the likelyhood or possibility of the <hi>Materiality of

disbelief of the <hi>Resurrection of the same Body,</hi> and
in his ridiculing of the <hi>receiv'd Explication of<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Bishop of</hi> Worcester, pag. 361, 362, 363.</note> the
Doctrine of the Holy Trinity,</hi> and in his general
favouring of <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and in his
denial of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Inbred Notions;</hi> so likewise
he seems to be an humble imitator of the foresaid
Philosopher, in his belief of <hi>the precarious and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
nature of Morality:</hi> tho' it is true in a flourish
he pretends at another time, that <hi>Morality as well
as Mathematicks may be demonstrated.</hi> Surely that
Proposition aforemention'd, <hi>viz. Nothing else but
that which hath the allowance of publick Esteem is
Virtue,</hi> may pass for <hi>the Leviathan Epitomiz'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by the way I would observe this to you,
that the Persons who speak contemptibly of <hi>Reveal'd
Religion</hi> or any part of it, are, if you look narrowly
into them, and their Writings, as deficient in their
apprehensions and esteem of that which is <hi>Natural</hi>
and merely <hi>Moral,</hi> which yet they so much pretend
to cry up. Whilst they strike at the <hi>Principles</hi> of
<hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Fundamental Articles</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi>
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> they cut the Sinews and take away
the props of <hi>Morality</hi> it self, and discard the true
Grounds and Reasons of it. Which shews that
their design and project is against Virtue in general,
and that their aim is to put all out of order, to
transpose and ranverse what ever hath any respect
to <hi>Religion,</hi> and to confound every thing belonging
to it, and thereby to expose Relgion it self, and to
make sport for the Atheistical and Scoffing part of
the World.</p>
            <p>The greater reason therefore is there that we
should be settled in our minds concerning these
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49880:17"/>
things, and that we should confirm and establish
our selves more and more in this necessary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Truth, (which I have endeavour'd to make
good) that there are Eternal and Immutable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Good and Evil, that there is in all Immoral
Actions a repugnancy to a Rule of Right in our
own breasts, as well as in the mind of our Creator.
This is the true account of Moral Righteousness,
namely, that it is built on the Nature of God, and
of Humane Souls, and the Universal Behaviour of
Mankind. So that, to speak plainly, those that
designedly set themselves against the Doctrine of
<hi>Inbred Principles of Good and Evil,</hi> detract from
the <hi>Divinity</hi> it self, and from the Essential Nature
and Guise of <hi>Mankind.</hi> And we may assure our selves
that such a Perswasion is the most debauching Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
in the World, and that those who wilfully
and obstinately maintain it have a very ill design
upon Mankind. Which was the only ground of
my so <hi>free</hi> and <hi>plain dealing</hi> with them, for 'tis in
vain to Palliate where we design to Cure.</p>
            <p>It remains that in the last place I should shew the
<hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Efficacy,</hi> the <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>Usefulness</hi> of
the Premises: which might be done in several Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
but I will offer only this one Practical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from the whole. Let the Doctrine discours'd
of be a mighty <hi>Incentive to all Virtue and Goodness.</hi>
Seeing these are consonant to our Natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and dispositions, we have all the reason imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to comply with them. Why should we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
our own Propensions, and be Rebels to our
Selves? As it is in Natural Motion, not <hi>Crooked</hi>
lines, but <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Streight</hi> ones are aim'd at: so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49880:18"/>
it is in Morals, Man's Reasonable Nature aims at
that which is his <hi>Direct</hi> and plain duty: and when
he deviates from this <hi>Right</hi> path, he acts against
his true Primitive temper and genius. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
then, that we ought to be Virtuous, because
our very Nature obliges us to it. We are invited
to be Just and Good by something that is within
us, and by the intrinsick Beauty of Goodness it self.
We should prize Religion and a Holy Life, because
they commend themselves to us by their own inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and abstract worth. Let us not be backward
in the practice of Virtue, seeing its own native ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
encourages us to it. Those were Curious

I have been speaking of, whereby we are naturally
enclin'd to live Virtuously. For tho' (as was said
in the beginning of this Discourse) by the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
deriv'd from our First Progenitors, both our
Understandings and Wills are miserably shatter'd;
yet these Original Impressions are not effaced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are of the very <hi>Nature of Man</hi> as he is
a Rational Creature. Therefore these cannot be
wholly expung'd out of Mens hearts, they are the
Indelible Stamp of God on every Soul. And the
more conformable any Man's life and actions are to
them, the more clear and bright is his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and judgment concerning the truth and reality,
as well as the excellency of them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let us descend into our own breasts,
and be acquainted with our selves: and by that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49880:18"/>
means we shall come to find in our minds a Stock
of Principles, which will very much endear Religion
to us: for as it will hugely please us to see a great
part of our Religion born in us and bred up with
us, so it will be a powerful motive to us to exert
those Virtues which are so fitted to our Natures, and,
as I may say, were Calculated for them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having this prevalent <hi>Incitement,</hi> let us not be
cold and indifferent in the practice of Righteousness
and Holiness; let us manfully break through all
obstacles and impediments, and let us be vigorous
and zealous in the waies of Religion, even of that
which God by an Insite Principle dictates to us:
and the rather, because this is so considerable a step
to and a part of that Higher Strain and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which we are <hi>chiefly</hi> to be concern'd for,
namely, the Institution of the Blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> our
conformity to which is absolutely necessary in order
to our Salvation and Happiness. To conclude, let us
be <hi>stedfast</hi> and <hi>unmoveable</hi> in our duty, seeing the
<hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> of it are <hi>such.</hi> And let it
evidently appear in our lives, that the esteem and
love we have for Goodness and Virtue are not Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not Imagination, but Solid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
