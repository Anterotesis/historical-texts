            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Holy Eucharist</hi> is a Rite of the greatest Honour and Endearment that ever God vouchsafed to Men, and the most Sublime

and Blissful Instance of our Communion with him. For therein he calls us to his own <hi>Table,</hi> not to attend as <hi>Servants,</hi> but to Feast with him as his <hi>Friends:</hi> He treats us with the most Magnificent Fare, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting That to us for our Food, which one would think were not to be <hi>eaten,</hi> but <hi>adored,</hi> even the most Sacred <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of his own <hi>Son</hi>; in which he conveys to us all the Benefits of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And being thus apt to excite in us the highest Devotion, and to enrich us with the greatest Fulness of Grace and Blessing, one would expect it should be had in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
<pb facs="tcp:52843:3"/>
and most Thankfull Received by every Christian.</p>
            <p>But yet in our Days what part of Religion doth so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally suffer, or is so universally neglected among Men? For the greatest Numbers have either little or no Reverence at all for it, or too much, which makes them afraid of it; they Neglect it thro' Carelesness and Causeless Scruples, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane it by Unworthy and Disrespectful Usage: So that among all the Professors of Christianity, few pay that Honour to their Lord, or secure that Benefit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Receiving, which
<pb facs="tcp:52843:4"/>
he intended All should do.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is the Grief and Complaint of all, who have any just Honour for their Dearest Saviour, and this Venerable Ordinance; or any generous Compassion for the Souls of others. And that, by the Grace of God, I may help something to redress it, I have endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a <hi>Worthy Communicating,</hi> and to set out both the Duty and Advantages of it in this Treatise, that thereby I may recommend it to the Choice of all who are Wise, and to the Consciences of all that are Religious. In the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
<pb facs="tcp:52843:4"/>
whereof, I have shunn'd all fruitless Disputes, and nice Speculations, seeking onely to get it Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Loose, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Careless, and to reconcile it to the Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and to make the Duty as Clear, Easie, and Useful as I can to all. Particularly, I have designed all along to make it not onely an Honourable Remembrance of our Dear Lord, but a most Solemn and Strict Engagement to a Good Life in all that use it; for then I am sure they will be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Happy in it.</p>
            <p>And this Discourse, <hi>My No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:52843:5"/>
Lord,</hi> I here humbly offer to Your Lordship, desiring it may stand as a Publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the great Honour and Affection I have for those Excellencies that shine so clear in You. God has endow'd Your Great Mind with a strong Love and a steady Choice of Virtue; and, what I have beheld with Pleasure, with a Generous, and, as there is Place for it, an Active Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion for those that want it. You have the True Wisdom, upon Deliberate and Well-studied Reasons, to be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and the Courage, in this Audacious Age, when Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion is set up for the onely
<pb facs="tcp:52843:5"/>
Creditable Dress, to own it, and study to be thought so. For 'tis Your Lordships Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to think that nothing can truly make You Greater, than to be an humble Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper, and Faithful Servant of Your Holy Saviour. This Noble Piety and Zeal for Goodness, will endear You, <hi>My Lord,</hi> to Almighty God, and to all Good Men. And if by these Papers I may in any wise contribute to them, I shall think my self happy in having serv'd to set on the Virtuous Growth of One whom I hope God has set out in a Time that so infinitely needs it, for an Illustrious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb facs="tcp:52843:6"/>
that may give both Ornament and Support to Religion.</p>
            <p>But besides this, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have another End in this Dedication; and that is, That these Sheets may remain a Lasting Monument of my Gratitude for the Endearing Favours I have received from Your Noble Hand. They were Composed for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of a Place where I am now fixed, and whereto I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd by Your great Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and Nobleness, when I thought of nothing less. For so truly Publick was Your Lordships Spirit in the Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:52843:6"/>
of that Church, that You pitch'd upon a Person whose Face You had never known, and who never knew of it, only because You believed he would make it his Care to promote Religion, and to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit those Souls which You had to commit to him. And this, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I humbly beg Your Lordships Leave to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not for Your own, but for the Publicks sake. For in this degenerate Age, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Filthy Lucre, or at least some other mean and sordid End, have made a Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, and bred Corruption even in the most <hi>Sacred Trusts,</hi> I think the World has need of <hi>such Examples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52843:7"/>I have nothing more to add, but to beg of Almighty God, That he who brings about the Noblest Ends by the Weakest and most Unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Instruments, would make this Book effectual to his own Honour and Service; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so bless Your Lordship with a Continuance and Encrease of all Virtuous Excellencies, Honour, and Happiness in this World, till at last he shall take You to shine in his own Immortal Glory in the World to come.

  To Communicate Worthily, is to do it with such Tempers and Behaviours as are worthy of it, and becoming Things which are meant by it. The <hi>First</hi> End was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Christ, both, <hi>first,</hi> As our Lord and Master, which calls for Honour and Reverence in our selves, and a care to maintain his Honour among others. For mindfulness of his Commands, and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Obedience. <hi>2.</hi> As our most kind Friend and Benefactor, which calls for Love and an hearty Affection for him. For Joy and Gladness in what we receive from him. For Thankfulness for all his Kindnesses, particularly in Dying for us. And as this Death was a Sacrifice for our Sins, the Remembrance of it calls for a deep sense of our own unworthiness. An utter Abhorrence of our Sins, which caused his Sufferings. A Resignation of our selves to his Vse, as thereby we are become his own Purchase. The <hi>Second</hi> End was to confirm the New Covenant with God which his Blood procured. This calls for Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Faithfulness. A <hi>Third</hi> End
  <pb facs="tcp:52843:10"/>
  was to confirm a League of Love and Friendship with all Christians. This calls for Peace and Charity to all Persons, and particularly for Alms to the Necessitous. A Summary Repetition of these Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. A Belief of these Things, which carries us on to these Tempers and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, is the Faith that makes us Worthy Communicants. <hi>page 48</hi>

                     <item>CHAP. III. A further Account of this Worthiness.

These recited Tempers are all necessary in the Person Communicating, but not at all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be expresly exercised in the Time of Communion. A Direction in which it may be fit to lay out our Devotion at that time. All these are provided for in the Churches Prayers, so that we may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise them worthily if we go along devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at all the Parts of the Communion Service. <hi>page 87</hi>

To silence the Complaint of extraordinary difficulty in coming worthily to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, three things noted. <hi>1.</hi> All the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of worthy Receiving, are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parts of Duty, and of a good Man; so that no more is required to fit us for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, than is required to fit us to dye, or to go to Heaven. <hi>2.</hi> They are all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Qualifications of an acceptable Prayer, Vow, or Thanksgiving; so that no more is required to it, than to a worthy discharge of all other Acts of Religion. <hi>3.</hi> However they may be commended, yet they are not necessarily required in more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense, and transporting degrees in it, than in other instances of Devotion. The only unworthiness, which can put us by this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, is Impenitence: if Repentance will go down with any man, nothing else need stick with him. This Point of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicating summ'd up. <hi>pag. 100</hi>

                     <item>CHAP. I. Of the Duty of Communicating.

To Communicate is a Duty incumbent on us, as appears, <hi>1.</hi> From the obliging import of the Command about it. This Command of Christ shewn, and several Notes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which reatly recommend and enforce it, <hi>viz.</hi> It is such an Instance, as best shews our peculiar Reverence and Love to him; the whole yoke of <hi>Jewish</hi> Ceremonies is taken away, and only it, and Baptism, two cheap and easie Rites, imposed in stead of them; it was his last Command, he gave it the Night before he suffered; in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Commission to Preach the Gospel, it was particularly specified; without greatest Danger to our selves it cannot be neglected, as appears from our Saviours Words, <hi>Joh. 6.53.</hi> which are shewn to speak of it; and from the Danger of Neglecting the <hi>Jewish</hi> Passover, which answered to it. <hi>2.</hi> From the obliging Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of those things which are meant by it, <hi>viz.</hi> Because therein we publickly own Christ and his Religion, and solemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb facs="tcp:52843:11"/>
him, and confirm the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and a League of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with our Brethren, and are vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed the highest Honour, and receive To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of greatest Love, and enjoyment of present Graces, and pledges of future Glory from him: all which no Good man ought, and no Ingenuous man will decline, when he is call'd to them. This Duty obliges those only who are of Age for it, and them too only at such times as they have an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and a fit Occasion offered. An Objection against its being a Duty, from <hi>1 Cor. 11.25,</hi> answered. The Neglect of it is a great Sin. This God may excuse in those good Souls, who through Ignorance or Error are held back, and because of their over-high Veneration for it, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unworthy to come to it, whilst in the honesty of their Hearts they thus mistake it. But he will not excuse it in them when they are better inform'd; and much less in others, who neglect it because they are careless of it, or too Wicked and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to receive it. <hi>Page 126</hi>

The Sacrament is full of Blessings, which make it not only our Duty, but our Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. In the <hi>general,</hi> it is the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means in all Religion to recommend our Prayers, and make them powerful; and so is the likeliest way to attain all Mercies. <hi>In particular, 1.</hi> It seals to us the Pardon of our Sins for the Peace of our Consciences. <hi>2.</hi> It encreases and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in us all Graces. Those are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily such as we bring along with us. It confers Grace, <hi>1.</hi> By the Natural Virtue and Tendency of those Duties, which it both exercises and excites in us. <hi>2.</hi> By those inward Assistances, which it conveys to us. Since on all these accounts it is so excellent a Means of Grace and New Life, 'tis the best Rule any Person can observe who would go on in the Work of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. All these Motives to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, both from Duty and Interest, summ'd up. <hi>Page 167</hi>

<list>
                     <item>CHAP. I. Two Hindrances from Communicating.

One most general Hindrance, that keeps men from the Sacrament, is a Fear of their being Vnworthy and Vnfit to receive it. This Answer'd, by shewing, <hi>1.</hi> The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of it, because they are not so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous about Neglecting, as about Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Receiving, though there be the same Cause for it. <hi>2.</hi> That every true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is worthy of it: Yea, he that has only fully purposed Amendment, though he has not had time to perform it. <hi>3.</hi> Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenee, which unfits them for it, is no Excuse for the Neglect of it. <hi>4.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent men, who alone are unfit, if they understand the danger of their State, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continue in it, but amend it, and then they may worthily Communicate. <hi>2.</hi> A <hi>Second</hi> Hindrance is, because an Vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiver eats his own Damnation, <hi>1 Cor. 11.29.</hi> which makes not Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:52843:13"/>
seem the safer side. By Damnation is meant, <hi>1.</hi> A Damning Sin, which is deadly till we repent of it; and such are both unworthy Eating, and sinful Abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so that they are equal as to that Point. <hi>2.</hi> Temporal Penalties, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for their Intemperance at this Feast, and other Disorders peculiar to those Times, and are not now usual in ours; so th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t the Fear of them need not discourage us from it. <hi>Page 197</hi>


                     </item>
                     <item>CHAP. II. Of Three other Hindrances from Receiving.

A <hi>Third</hi> Hindrance is, because therein they are to promise concerning every Sin, that they will no more commit it; which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise some dare not make, because they fear they shall not keep it. If this be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to hinder any man from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; it ought also to hinder him from Prayers, and being Baptized a Christian. But it must not hinder men from any of them. <hi>1.</hi> Let them promise this Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and keep it, and then the Doubt is answered. They ought to make it. And by God's Grace they may perform it, if they have a mind to it. <hi>2.</hi> If after some
<pb facs="tcp:52843:13"/>
time they happen to break it in any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, they have the Benefit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance afterwards. A <hi>Fourth</hi> Hindrance is the great difficulty supposed to be in it, and want of time and leisure to prepare for it. This lies not more against the Communion, than aganst an Holy Life, and all Religion. But it must not put us by from any of them. For, <hi>1.</hi> If it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired all that Time and Pains which is supposed, that would be no Excuse for any of us to neglect it. To true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, the Time and Pains is not so great as is imagined. It requires more of Ill men, but less of Good, who may prepare for it in a less time, yea, if used to Self-examinations, upon a few Minutes warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>3.</hi> The poorest and most imployed have time sufficient, if they would use it to that end: and where they have fewer helps, and less time, the less Preparation is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of them. A <hi>Fifth</hi> Hindrance is, because they see others, or have found themselves to be no better by it; so that 'tis not worth their while to fit themselves for it. If this have any Force, it is not to be restrained to the Sacrament, but holds stronger against Prayers, and other Parts of Worship. But it ought not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Persons. For, <hi>1.</hi> Where it is true, there is no Excuse from it. <hi>2.</hi> In all good
<pb facs="tcp:52843:14"/>
mens case 'tis false, for they are really better by it; many by improving in their goodness, all by continuing in it, for which it is richly worth their pains to come to it. <hi>3.</hi> Where they are not bettered at all, or not so much as might be expected; that is purely through their own Fault, in not using the means of improving by it: so let them amend that, and this Hindrance is removed. <hi>Page 223</hi>


                     </item>
                     <item>CHAP. III. Of want of Charity.

A <hi>Sixth</hi> Hindrance is a Fear lest they want that Charity, particularly towards Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and those who have given them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, which is required to it. An account what Love is, and what is not due to such Persons. <hi>1.</hi> We are bound to shew them all the Offices of general Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are due to our Neighbour at large, or to all others. This Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it all the Particular Offices of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Charity, and Peace, which are due to all mankind: It is transgressed by all the opposite Instances, but by nothing more than hard and uncandid Censures and Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions. The commonness and sinfulness of this Carriage. The want of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb facs="tcp:52843:14"/>
unfits men for this Feast; but so i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> doth for Prayers, and all other Religious, Worship. <hi>2.</hi> We are not bound to shew them all the Offices of special Esteem, Trust, and Confidence, which are not fit to be placed on all men, but on such only as are qualified for them. When they sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew Repentance of their Fault, they are to be re-admitted to the same state of Favour and Friendship. We must be Candid in Judging when their Repentance is sufficiently evidenced. An humble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is ordinarily a sufficient Proof of it for the first Fault; but not when it has been oft repeated. <hi>Luc. 17.4,</hi> which seems to affirm it, answer'd. Several Cases clear'd, which are sometimes thought by Pious Souls to be a breach of Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Enemies, but in reality are not. As, not forgetting Injuries or Vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, but still retaining a Remembrance of them. Thinking the worse of those who offered them. Being troubled at the sight of them, as that puts them in mind of the great Losses they have sustain'd by them. Shewing more reserve, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a greater distance in Conversing with them, than with other men. These are no breach of Charity towards them, nor can be a just Hindrance from the Communion. <hi>Page 262</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:52843:15"/>CHAP. IV. Of Law-Suits.

They are an Hindrance from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when there is sin in them. They are not sinful in themselves, which is shewn, <hi>1.</hi> From the necessity of them. <hi>2.</hi> From the Magistrates Office being appointed for them. <hi>3.</hi> From Gods taking Legal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations upon himself, as if he were the Author of them. <hi>4.</hi> From Courts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by consent in the Apostles Days, which ministred to them. These St. <hi>Paul</hi> prescribed to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor. 6.</hi> They are the Assemblies mention'd <hi>Jam. 2.2, 5.</hi> From our Saviours, and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Practice, who in claiming the Benefit of them, warranted and authorized them. An Objection from <hi>Mat. 5.38, 39, 40.</hi> consider'd; which is shewn not to condemn defending our selves in any case when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers implead us; nor moving Suits in all, but only in case of lighter Losses and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, such as our Saviour there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or making them minister to Revenge in any others. And <hi>1 Cor. 6.7.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, which makes them not a Damning sin, but only when some Virtuous ends do not require them, a Defect and Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution.
<pb facs="tcp:52843:15"/>
But they are sinful, <hi>1.</hi> When they are begun upon an unjustifiable Ground. Such they always are, <hi>1.</hi> When they are Vindictive, not Reparative; as when we sue insolvent Persons; or others upon such Words or Actions, for which, besides Costs, no Damages that are valuable are like to be allotted us. <hi>2.</hi> When they are for Reparation of small things, which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail not the evil and hazard of a Suit, but ought to be a matter of Patience and Forgiveness, and so be quietly put up without recourse to it. In judging of this smallness, we must not estimate by our own Pride and Passions; but by the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Things, and the Judgment of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, humble, and dispassionate Persons. This is true, not only in case of Injuries to our own selves, but also in case of Trust, when we have the charge of others. <hi>2.</hi> Suits are sinful when they are carried on by a sinful Management: As they are, when they make us transgress any of those Duties towards our Adversaries, which oblige us towards all Persons. To avoid all these in Suing, is an hard Point: So we must be slow in coming to it, and very circumspect when we are forced upon it. The Answer to this Hindrance summ'd up. <hi>Page 304</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:52843:16"/>CHAP. V. Of Three other Hindrances.

A <hi>Seventh</hi> Hindrance, is, because others are not in Charity with them, so that they are afraid they want that Peace which is required to it. As for other mens uncharitableness, it is their sin, and so unfits them; but not being ours, it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits not us for Receiving. If that ought to exclude any from the Sacrament, it had excluded Christ and his Apostles, and the Primitive Christians, since none had ever such implacable Enemies as they had. Care to be taken that their Enmity be not continued through our Fault; so that if we have given just occasion, we must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Reconciliation; and if we gave none, be careful not to hate them again. An <hi>Eighth</hi> Hindrance is, because 'tis a Presumption in us to come to it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Humble man ought in all modesty to abstain from it. But, <hi>1.</hi> 'Tis no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption to come when we are call'd, and to do what we are bidden. <hi>2.</hi> 'Tis a very great Presumption to stay away, and leave it undone. <hi>3.</hi> If the height of Priviledge and Honour in it be sufficient to make an humble man refuse the Communion; it
<pb facs="tcp:52843:16"/>
will also carry him to renounce the whole Christian Profession. A <hi>Ninth</hi> Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance is, because many good People are seldom or never seen at it, so that they have good Company, and may be good too, if they abstain from it. But, <hi>1.</hi> In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after our own Duty, we are not to ask whether others practise it, but whether Christ has any where enjoyn'd it. <hi>2.</hi> If any Good People keep from the Sacrament, that is no part of their Goodness, so that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are not to be imitated. <hi>3.</hi> Though they might be acceptably Good, whilst through innocent Scruples and honest Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they were afraid to come to it: yet will it be a very great Fault even in them to Neglect it after they are better informed, which will not be forgiven, but upon their Amendment of it. <hi>Page 362</hi>


                     </item>
                     <item>CHAP. VI. Of Two more Hindrances.

A <hi>Tenth</hi> Hindrance is, because others who are unworthy of it, are admitted to join in it. But, <hi>1.</hi> They ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in judging others unworthy, lest they be mistaken in it. <hi>2.</hi> When some, who, as they have great cause to think, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, do receive, yet ought not that to
<pb facs="tcp:52843:17"/>
hinder them from joining in it. For if it be a sufficient Hindrance, it had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hindred our Saviour Christ, and the Primitive Christians. It ought not only to hinder us from the Communion, but also from being Members of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church and Profession; but 'tis plainly of no Force for either of them, since one man shall not bear anothers, but every man his own burden. <hi>3.</hi> If still any are really offended at the Communion of the Wicked, upon complaint made in the Congregation they are to be suspended from the Holy Table, and denied the Sacrament. An <hi>Eleventh</hi> Hindrance is the Gesture of Kneeling, which is required to it. When any are absent upon this account, there is no excuse from it. Three things insisted on to prevent their being hindred by it. <hi>1.</hi> Kneeling is no unsuitable Posture in receiving, so that if we were left at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, we might have enough to justifie our selves in making use of it. <hi>2.</hi> It is appointed by our Governours, whom God Commands us to obey in all lawful Things; so that every Good man ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it. But if it neither had Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to injoyn, nor Reason to recommend it, but another Posture might be better used: Yet, <hi>3.</hi> Since it may lawfully, though not so well, be used too, for the Sacraments sake,
<pb facs="tcp:52843:17"/>
which is not otherwise to be had, we should at least comply with it. No Hindrance to this Complyance, because the Gesture of Kneeling is different from what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour used. For so is sitting too, and therefore they and we are equally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to answer it. The Posture he used was no part of the Institution, so that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution is not broken when the Posture is altered. Neither it, nor any other, has any Command of God for it; so that none is necessary, but all are still indifferent. When a Posture, different from that at the first Institution, was intro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uced in Sacraments, our Saviour himself, and they too have submitted to it. Again, no hindrance to it from the fear of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bread, or its being a Popish Rite. A conclusion of this point. <hi>Page 381</hi>

An Account of some other Hindrances. One abstains because the day before he was at a Feast. Another, because his Child is sick, or he himself is lighty indisposed. A third, because his Wife or Husband cannot come along with him to joyn in it. A fourth, because he has a Visit to make,

or a Friend come in, who in all civility must be attended. A fifth, because of a Showr of Rain, or a sharp Air abroad, so that he must endure a piercing Blast, or wet his Foot, to go out to it. These are no Excuse from it, but still Men are bound to Communicate. Some Devout Meditations and Prayers to help them in a Worthy Discharge of it.

               <p>IN this matter of the Holy Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> there are two great Faults which are every where incurr'd, and which all that Love their Saviour or their own Souls ought most carefully to avoid; and they are, a <hi>Refusal</hi> or <hi>Neglect,</hi> and an <hi>unworthy Vsage</hi> or <hi>Prophanation</hi> of it; both which are most offensive to Almighty God, and to our dear Lord. For our Blessed Saviour has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, and expresly commanded us to come to it, and shew'd us by manifest To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52843:19"/>
that he lays a particular weight upon it; so that we are greatly undutiful and disobedient if we keep back from it: And he has appointed it for sacred Ends and solemn Purposes, which call for a very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent and Devout Carriage; so that we prophane it if we come carelesly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves unworthily when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thereto. It is a most <hi>necessary</hi> part of our Religion, and therefore not to be passed over, and let alone through Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and a most <hi>awful</hi> one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be perform'd with disrespect, and an irreverent Carriage.

               <p>Thus are both a <hi>careless Forbearance,</hi> and an <hi>indecent unworthy Vsage</hi> of this Holy Feast, great Indignities to our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lord, and criminal Violations of it. It suffers on either hand, so that to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it in its just esteem and due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, both are carefully to be removed. And to do what Right I can to this Holy Ordinance, and what Service I am able to all such as shall seek help from this Treatise, I shall endeavour, what in me lies, to cure, or prevent both, in that which follows.</p>
               <p>Now to do this with the greater clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in Discoursing upon this Subject I shall do these five things.</p>

These things usually commemorated by Festivals. <hi>2</hi> End is in

And this our Blessed Lord expresly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the time of Institution, <hi>This do,</hi>

                     <p>To <hi>Remember</hi> one, is not barely to <hi>call to mind</hi> that once there was <hi>such a Person</hi>; but also to think of their <hi>particular Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>Relation,</hi> what they are to us, or what they have left with us, or what they have done for us which is worth Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring.

In desiring any of these, or any others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member us, we mean not barely that they should call to mind how once there were such men as we in being; but, over and above that, that they be particularly mindful of the Relation wherein we stand, and think of what we have done, what we deserve, or what we desire or expect from them.</p>

                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52843:22"/>And this our Blessed Lord intends, when in this Holy Feast he Desires, and Commands us to remember him. He would have us think of him in all those Capacities, and reflect upon him under all those Relations, wherein he so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserves to be remembred by us: Such as are that of a <hi>Faithful Teacher,</hi> a <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Governour,</hi> an <hi>intire Friend</hi> and noble <hi>Benefactor,</hi> doing the highest kindnesses, and working the greatest deliverances <hi>for us,</hi> and for <hi>all Mankind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> He would have us remember him as our <hi>Faithful Teacher,</hi> who has made known to us the whole Counsel of God concerning us, and to call to mind those excellent things which he has revealed to us. As namely, That for the sake of his Death, and through the merits of his Blood, all mankind, who were utter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies before, shall be put into a way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, and have the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a New Covenant, which proffers Pardon to all that truly Repent, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual help and inward Grace to all that carefully indeavour with it, and the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of Heaven and Happiness to all that are intirely obedient, promising that at our Death our Souls shall go into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, and at the General Judgment our Bodies, which till then were held in their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52843:23"/>
Graves, shall be raised up again to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> He would have us remember him as our <hi>Gracious Governour,</hi> whom God has anointed to give Laws to us, and to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and bear in mind those Commands, which, as our Soveraign Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he has laid upon us. As namely, That we love God, and trust in his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and submit to his Providence, and Worship him with Prayers and Praises, but above all with an Holy and a God-like Life; that we be Humble and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-minded, Chaste, Temperate, and Contented; that we be dutiful to our Governours, respectful to our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, courteous to our Equals, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scensive to our Inferiours, grateful to our Friends, loving and obliging to our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and just, charitable, and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards all Persons, of whatsoever Nations, Sects, or Parties, even to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> He would have us remember him as our <hi>most intire Friend,</hi> and noble <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor,</hi> who let us in so deep into his Heart, and heaped his Favours on us at so prodigious a rate, as never was, nor ever will be equall'd. For he loved us without any thing of our own Deserts; and in spite of our highest Provocations;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52843:23"/>
and without expecting any other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, besides the Pleasure of being kind to us; and to such a degree, as made him forego the greatest pleasures which he might have held without all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in Heavenly places, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man of Sorrows, and lead a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, difficult, and necessitous Life, and at last dye a most exquisitely pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ignominious Death for our sakes, which ransom'd us from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Curse, and procured us the most valuable Blessings that our Nature can admit of. And this Benefit of his Death, being not only in it self the cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest, but the very price and purchase of all the rest, he would have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred above all others in this Feast; and accordingly he has suited the Food in it to be broken Bread, and Wine poured out, which do most lively represent it. <hi>As often as you eat this Bread, and drink this Cup,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>you</hi> exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit to all that look on and observe it, or <hi>shew</hi> forth <hi>the Lords Death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26.</p>
                     <p>These are the things which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ calls us seriously to remember and consider of in our own minds, and which the Actions themselves commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and shew forth to others, when we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52843:24"/>
eat Bread and drink Wine in this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. When we partake of this Feast, which he has appointed us, he would have us remember him, and think with our selves how <hi>Faithful a Teacher</hi> he was to us, and what good Lessons and Declarations he has left with us; how <hi>gracious a Lord</hi> and Master he proved, and what Commandments he has laid upon us; and lastly, how <hi>kind a Friend,</hi> and <hi>noble Benefactor</hi> he shewed himself, and what astonishing kindnesses he has done for us in all the Labours of his Life, but especially and above all in his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bloody Death for our sakes, which purchased us the Forgiveness of our Sins, the Grace and Spirit of God, and Eternal happiness. All this <hi>Faithful Teacher,</hi> and <hi>Gracious Governour,</hi> and <hi>intire Friend,</hi> and <hi>noble Benefactor</hi> Christ is to us in the highest Measures, and to all imaginable Degrees; and since he is so, he would have us to bear it in mind, and oftentimes to think of it. And that we may be sure to do it, he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted this Feast on purpose for it, and told us that our work is to call to mind and remember him whensoever we come to it.</p>
                     <p>And this way of having these things remembred, by appointing Feasts for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52843:24"/>
Commemoration of them, has been very usual in the World. Thus the <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <p>This then is the first end of our eating Bread and drinking Wine at the Lords Table, it is <hi>in remembrance of our Saviour Christ,</hi> and <hi>of what he has done for us.</hi> So that when we partake in this Feast of his appointment, we must seriously reflect on him who has appointed it, and bethink our selves that he is our Faithful Teacher, calling to mind his Revelations; our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord and Master, remembring his Commandments; our intire Friend, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and Benefactor, who has done strange things for us, but above all, who has laid down his own Life to purchase us the Pardon of our Sins, and Spiritual Grace, and Eternal Happiness, upon our Repentance, Obedience, and Virtuous endeavours. With these Thoughts he would have us entertain our minds, at the same time we Feast our Bodies with the Creatures of Bread and Wine which he has prepared for us: and if we would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his end in it, and be welcome Guests at this Feast when he calls to it, we must be sure so to do.</p>
                     <p>And as we must eat Bread and drink Wine at the Lords Table in remembrance of our Saviour Christ, and of his dying for us; so must we,</p>

                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52843:25"/>2ly, <hi>In Confirmation of the New Covenant, which his Death purchased and procured us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Covenant is a <hi>mutual contract and ingagement between God and us</hi>; and consists of several Articles agreed to on <hi>Gods</hi> side, and several on <hi>ours.</hi> As for <hi>Gods part, to all Believers, i. e.</hi> to all that believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and particularly that part of them, these his promises, without a belief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they will have no lift or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to set about the performance of the Conditions required on their parts: to all Believers, I say, he promises <hi>three</hi> Things, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>forgiveness of Sins,</hi> the <hi>assistance of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Eternal happiness.</hi> And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably on <hi>their Parts</hi> they promise <hi>three</hi> more, which three indeed are all summ'd up in one, <hi>i. e.</hi> the last of them: and those are, to <hi>Repent of all their Sins,</hi> to <hi>endeavour with his Grace,</hi> and to <hi>obey all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He promises to <hi>forgive them all their Sins.</hi> For this is one Article of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as the Apostle relates it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>This is the Covenant I will make with them in those days, I will be merciful to their unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and their sins and iniquities will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no more, v.</hi> 10.12. But then at the same time he expects, and accordingly they promise that they will <hi>Repent of them,</hi> and <hi>forsake them.</hi> For he orders <hi>Repentance</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52843:26"/>
and <hi>Remission of Sins</hi> to be preached both together, <hi>Luc.</hi> 24. <hi>That Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins should be preached in his Name to all Nations,</hi> v. 47; and tells us expresly, that <hi>except we repent we shall all perish,</hi> Luc. 13.3.</p>
                     <p>He promises them the <hi>assistance of his Spirit to enable them to do his will and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obedient.</hi> For this also is reckoned as another Article of <hi>the Covenant made with Abraham, that he would grant unto us</hi> the Power <hi>to serve him in Holiness and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness all the days of our Lives,</hi> Luc. 1.72, 73, 74, 75. and the great Promise of the Gospel is, that <hi>God will give his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to those that ask him, Luc.</hi> 11.13. But then he expects, and accordingly they promise, that they will use and improve his Grace whensoever it is intrusted with them, and endeavour after all Virtues as they stand in need of them. <hi>God works in us both to will and to do,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when we join with him, and <hi>work out our own Salvation, Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13: and 'tis only <hi>to him that hath,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>i. e.</hi> to him that hath improved the <hi>Talents</hi> bestowed on him, as those <hi>Good Servants</hi> had done, who had gain'd the one <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <p>He promises them, lastly, <hi>eternal Life and happiness. This,</hi> says St. <hi>John, is the Promise which he hath promised us, even Eternal Life,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.25. But then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and at the same time we promise, that we will obey all his Laws, and do every thing which he requires of us. For <hi>Christ is become the Author of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>to those</hi> only <hi>that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9: and <hi>blessed are they that do his Commandments,</hi> says St. <hi>John, for they</hi> only <hi>have Right to the Tree of Life,</hi> Rev. 22.14.</p>
                     <p>So that the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is a <hi>mutual Contract</hi> and <hi>Ingagement between God and Men,</hi> wherein he promises to <hi>all that Believe,</hi> and accordingly they accept it, that he will <hi>forgive them their Sins when they Repent of them,</hi> and <hi>help them to any Graces when they concur with him and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after them,</hi> and <hi>give them Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life after they have intirely obeyed him.</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52843:27"/>
He promises Pardon, Inward Grace, and everlasting Happiness; but then they, having Faith or Belief already, without an actual exercise whereof they would not seek after this Covenant, nor, if they did, could be admitted to it, make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to him again of Repentance, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous endeavours, and an intire obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which must confer a claim, and give them right thereto.</p>
                     <p>This is the New Covenant, and this Christs Bloody Death has purchased and procured for us. God would not dispense with the <hi>First</hi> Covenant without a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some that might remove all hindrances, by securing the Honour of his Holiness, and utterly discouraging all future offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and satisfying all the ends of Justice: and because that could not otherwise be so well effected, as he thought fit it should, Christ himself became an <hi>expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice,</hi> and, by dying for it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the <hi>Second.</hi> And for this cause it is called the New Covenant in his Blood, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Covenant which was confirmed and purchased by it. <hi>This,</hi> says he, <hi>is the New Testament,</hi> or rather, the <hi>New</hi>

                        <hi>Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a good Conscience towards God; i. e.</hi> it is the <hi>Federal Promise,</hi> or <hi>undertaking</hi> of it, which every Person makes when he is Baptized. And this is plain from that <hi>form</hi> of the <hi>Baptismal Vow</hi> which the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians used, and which <hi>we</hi> use now at present, wherein, if they are <hi>grown</hi> Persons, they <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> or if <hi>Children,</hi> their <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> in their Names do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly Covenant and ingage for that <hi>Faith, Repentance</hi> or <hi>Renouncing</hi> of all Sins, and <hi>Obedience</hi> to Gods Laws, which are required by it.</p>
                     <p>And as we <hi>first entred</hi> into this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> when we were <hi>Baptised</hi>; so are we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>renew</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> it every time we are invited to <hi>sup</hi> with our Lord in this Holy <hi>Sacrament.</hi> When he Summons us to eat Bread, and drink Wine in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Death at this Feast; he calls us withall to confirm this New Covenant, which his Death procured,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52843:28"/>
and which was the price and purchase of it. He invites us to receive ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from God of his promised Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to give him ingagements of our Duty and Service: to be assured by him, that, if we do <hi>believe</hi> the Scriptures, he will <hi>forgive</hi> us our Sins upon our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and give his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> to our <hi>endeavours,</hi> and make us <hi>eternally happy</hi> upon our <hi>obedience</hi>; and to assure him, that we do so <hi>believe,</hi> and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd so to <hi>repent, endeavour,</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> that so by virtue of his Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise we may have right thereto. He intends our eating and drinking at his Table as a <hi>Federal Rite,</hi> and for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal and Ratification of this League of Love and Friendship: So that at the same time we eat and drink in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christs Death which procured the Covenant, we must solemnly give our Consent to it, and expresly ratify and confirm it too.</p>
                     <p>This may fairly be presumed to be one end of the Holy Communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the end of <hi>Baptism,</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls a <note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</note> 
                        <hi>Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and which, as we have seen, is our entrance into the <hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> And since it is so evidently the use of that, in great
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52843:28"/>
likelihood it is of this too; for both the Sacraments were still held of like <hi>Vse, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Signification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, this was the end, not only of the <hi>Christian,</hi> but also of the <hi>Jewish Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> which shews it was not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to any one, but runs through all of them.</p>
                     <p>For as for <hi>Circumcision,</hi> it was a Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rite or Sign. It bound the <hi>Jews</hi> (as before it had done the <hi>Patriarchs</hi>) to God, and God to them, in the <hi>Covenant Moses</hi> gave them, by a mutual Obligation. For therein they promised to perform all that the <hi>Law injoined—He that is Circumcised,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, is a Debtor to keep the whole Law, Gal.</hi> 5.3. And thereby they were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of the <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Benefits God</hi> had <hi>promised</hi>—Abraham <hi>received Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision as a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith,</hi> says the same Apostle, <hi>i. e.</hi> as a Seal or Confirmation of the Promises made to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. And because it was thus a sign to both parts, and a Rite used at their engaging in it, <hi>Circumcision</hi> is call'd <hi>the Covenant, i. e.</hi> the Solemn Ceremony and undertaking of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.8.</p>
                     <p>And then as for the <hi>Passover,</hi> it also was a <hi>Covenanting Ceremony</hi> and <hi>Federal Rite,</hi> as may sufficiently appear from its being a <hi>Feast on Sacrifice,</hi> which is the most So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn

way of <hi>Covenanting</hi> with God. And this use of the <hi>Passover</hi> is of the greater weight to conclude the same of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> because among us this answers to it, and comes in stead of it. It answers to it, I say; for our <hi>bleeding Lord</hi> was the Great thing which their <hi>Sacrificed Lamb</hi> signified, whence he is called <hi>the</hi>

And at the Institution of the Holy Sacrament, our Saviour intimated that the Passover was abolish'd, and that this was hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward to succeed and come in stead of it.

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52843:29"/>And now since 'tis <hi>the general Nature of Sacraments,</hi> both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> to be <hi>Covenanting Rites</hi>; since <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism plainly is, that goes hand in hand with it</hi>; and since the <hi>Passover was, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded and answered to it,</hi> this being substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in place, and put instead of it: in all likelihood the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a Federal Feast,</hi> and a <hi>Covenanting Rite</hi> too.</p>

                     <p>And we are all bid to <hi>drink</hi> of it, which is a <hi>Federal Rite,</hi> and was then a known Ceremony of confirming any Covenant. <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> says he to his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.27.</p>
                     <p>This drinking of it, as it is an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to our selves, and taking it into our own Bodies, is a plain sign of our ingaging in it, and adhering to it; for thereby we shew that we close with, and embrace it. But this is still further evident, because anciently among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and other <hi>Eastern Nations, eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> were <hi>Federal Rites,</hi> whereby they were wont mutually to Seal <hi>Leagues of friendship,</hi> and <hi>confirm Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants</hi>

with each other. For they used to bind their Compacts by a <hi>Friendly Treat,</hi> and to consummate them in all <hi>Hospitable Entertainment.</hi> Thus we read in the Story of <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> for when <hi>Laban</hi> demands, <hi>Come thou, let us make a Covenant, I and thou</hi>; Gen. 31.44; <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Consent to it is expressed by this, —<hi>he said unto his Brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap, and did eat there upon the heap</hi>; by that Note of Friendship answering the Demand, and confirming the Covenant which was proposed, <hi>v.</hi> 46.

And <hi>Obadiah</hi> mentions <hi>being in Covenant</hi> with any one, and <hi>Eating Bread</hi> with him, as Words that signifie the same Thing, whereof the <hi>one</hi> is the <hi>others</hi> Explication. <hi>The men of thy Confederacy have brought thee even to the border,</hi> says he, <hi>i. e.</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most quite bereft thee of thy own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; <hi>the men that are at Peace with thee, have deceived thee; they that eat thy Bread, have laid a Wound under thee</hi>: in which

                     <p>Since in the Words of Institution then our Saviour tells his Disciples, the <hi>Cup</hi> is the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and bids them <hi>drink</hi> of it, which was well known among them to be a <hi>Federal Rite</hi>; he plainly shew'd his meaning was, that they should <hi>ratifie</hi> and <hi>confirm the New Covenant</hi> by it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                        <hi>Body of the Passover,</hi> and <hi>the Body of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schal Lamb,</hi> to shew, that the <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> was to be <hi>his Body</hi> in the same sense now, as the <hi>eating of the Paschal Lamb</hi> had been hitherto. Which Relation to the <hi>Passover</hi> that he had then in hand, and to their manner of expressing it, I think is one very obvious and natural Account of his calling this <hi>New Feast his Body</hi> when he spake of it.</p>
                     <p>And this also shews it to be a <hi>Covenant-Rite,</hi> because the <hi>eating of the Paschal Lamb</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> was <hi>his Body</hi> in a <hi>Federal</hi> sense, as a <hi>Federal Conveyance</hi> of it. For their <hi>Slain Lamb</hi> was a Figure of our <hi>Dying Lord,</hi> as hath been proved, and was accepted to all the purposes of his <hi>Blood</hi>: and their <hi>Feasting on it,</hi> as in all other <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> was their <hi>Federal joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in, and partaking of it. For to <hi>Feast on a Sacrifice,</hi> was to joyn in the <hi>Covenant</hi> made by it, and to partake of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings promised to it, as shall presently be shewed.</p>
                     <p>And since in the Words of Institution our Saviour says of the <hi>Eating of the Bread</hi> that it is <hi>his Body,</hi> to the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as the <hi>Eating of the Paschal Lamb</hi> was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52843:32"/>
in that Jewish Sacrament, which was so in a <hi>Federal</hi> sense, as a <hi>Federal Conveyance</hi> of it: he plainly intimates his own Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be a <hi>Federal Feast,</hi> and that we confirm the <hi>New Covenant</hi> by joyning in it.</p>
                     <p>And as this appears from the Words of Institution, wherein the <hi>Cup</hi> is called the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and they are bid to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> which is a <hi>Federal Rite</hi>; and the <hi>Eating of the Bread</hi> is called <hi>Christs Body</hi> to the same intent as the <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> was, which was so in a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral</hi> sense, as it <hi>Federally conveyed</hi> it: So doth it also,</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> From its being a <hi>Feast upon Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> which is a <hi>Federal Feast</hi>; for <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> is one way of <hi>Covenanting with God</hi>; and by <hi>Feasting on the Sacrifice,</hi> we <hi>joyn</hi> in, and <hi>partake</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> I say, is a <hi>Feast</hi> upon <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> It was the way both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that when they brought an Offering to God, they who offered it were to come, and Feast on some part of it. Thus it was in the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which <hi>Aaron</hi> made to it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32: <hi>He built an Altar before it, and offered Burnt-offerings and Peace-offerings, and the People sate down to Eat and to Drink, i. e.</hi> upon part of what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52843:32"/>
they had offered, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. And thus it was in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which <hi>Samuel</hi> blessed, 1 Sam. 9: <hi>The People will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the Sacrifice, and afterwards they eat that be bidden,</hi> v. 13. And to this Usage several Places of the <hi>Scripture</hi> allude, as namely <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.28. —<hi>they joyned themselves unto Baal-P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

And as it was thus in the <hi>Religious Feasts</hi> both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> so it is also in the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> Our Saviour gave his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our Sins, <hi>putting away Sin,</hi> as the Apostle says, <hi>by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himself,</hi> Heb. 9.26. And having thus made the Oblation, according to what was in use both in the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Sacrifices, he institutes this Treat of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> as a <hi>Feast</hi> upon it. This I suppose is aim'd at, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> brings in an <hi>Altar</hi> speaking of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Feast,</hi> which sufficiently intimates its relation to a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as a <hi>Treat upon it: We have an Altar,</hi> says he, <hi>whereof they have no right to eat that serve the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, i. e.</hi> wherein the strict Judaizers may not partake; for Judaism excludes Men from the Communion especially,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52843:33"/>
and indeed from all Parts of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Worship, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. And this he also shews concerning it, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it with the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Gentile Feasts on Sacrifices,</hi> making them answerable and parallel to it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 18, 20, 21. And this he directly affirms of it, when he says, <hi>Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, therefore let us keep the</hi> Eucharistical <hi>Feast, i. e.</hi> upon this Sacrificed Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Feasts upon Sacrifice</hi> are <hi>Federal Feasts, i. e.</hi> Feasts that ratifie and confirm Covenants; for <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is <hi>one way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with God,</hi> and <hi>Feasting upon it</hi> is the way of <hi>participating</hi> or sharing in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> I say, is <hi>one way of Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God.</hi> When God would enter into Articles, and bind himself in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants with Men, he chose to do it in shedding the <hi>Blood</hi> of some <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that Typified the <hi>Blood of Christ</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> which is the onely thing that moves him to deal with us in any Concern that either implies or tends to Friendship and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Thus he did with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> when he promised him the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> if he would continue <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, 2.</note>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52843:33"/>
and engage it to him. <hi>Take an Heifer,</hi> says he, <hi>and a she-Goat, and a Ram, &amp;c. And Abraham took them, and divided them in the midst, and when the Sun went down, behold a smoaking Furnace, and a burning Lamp that passed between those Pieces,</hi> wherein, 'tis like, God Consumed and Feasted on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sacrifice; <hi>and in that same day the Lord made a Covenant with Abraham, saying, Vnto thy Seed have I given this Land, &amp;c:</hi> Gen. 15.8, 9, 10, 17, 18. And thus he did with the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Nation,</hi> when he ratified that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, which <hi>Moses</hi> gave them; he chose the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Burnt-offerings,</hi> that therein he might seal it t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ation</hi> (such as our <hi>Saviour Christs</hi> is in most signal manner, whereon we <hi>Feast</hi> in the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>) served among the <hi>Jews</hi>: they were <hi>solemn Compacts</hi> and <hi>Stipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> wherein <hi>he promised Pardon,</hi> and they <hi>Amendment,</hi> after any Offences. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>accept the Life of the sacrificed Beast in lieu of theirs,</hi> and to exempt them because it had suffered; and they enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>amend the Fault which they sought to have atoned,</hi> and never more to repeat it. This 'tis plain they did, from that <hi>Form of Penitential Confession</hi> in use among them, when they brought an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice</hi> to the Lord: <note n="†" place="margin">Obsecro Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, peccavi, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui, rebellavi, hoc aut illud feci, nunc autem poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiam ago, sitque haec hostia expiatio mea. <hi>Vi.

                        <hi>O Lord! I have sinned, and dealt wickedly, and rebelled against thee in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this or that; now I am sorry for it, and asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it, and will never more return to it; and therefore beg this Sacrifice may atone for it.</hi> And if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52843:34"/>
they had not thus repented of it, the <note n="†" place="margin">Isa. 66.3.</note> Sacrifice would have been of no avail to the Forgiveness of it. For, <hi>to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me, saith the Lord,</hi> so long as you shew no Repentance with them? But <hi>wash you, make you clean, cease to do evil, learn to do well: Come now, and let us reason to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they shall be as white as Snow,</hi> Isa. 1.11, 16, 17, 18. <hi>The Sacrifices of God,</hi> says the Psalmist, <hi>are a broken Spirit, i. e.</hi> they must be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and presented with it; <hi>a broken and a contrite Heart, O God, thou wilt not despise,</hi> Ps. 51.17.</p>
                     <p>Thus were <hi>Sacrifices</hi> a <hi>mutual Stipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Engagement,</hi> consisting of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Pardon on Gods part,</hi> and a <hi>Promise of Repentance and Amendment on Mans</hi>: so that they were in the nature of a <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Contract</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> between them. And this God plainly intimates concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, when he tells of his <hi>Saints</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Covenant with him by Sacrifice: —Gather my Saints,</hi> saith he, <hi>who have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice,</hi> Ps. 50.5. and calls <hi>Salt, wherewith every Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Meat-offering was to be seasoned, the Salt of the Covenant,</hi> because it was to season all those Sacrifices wherein the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52843:35"/>
Covenant was confirmed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                     <p>And as <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is <hi>one way of Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God,</hi> so is <hi>Feasting upon it the way of sharing and partaking in it.</hi> He who joyned in the Feast, was looked upon by God himself to joyn also in the Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to <hi>promise</hi> all the <hi>Duty</hi> which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and to <hi>partake</hi> in all the <hi>Blessings</hi> which it procured for them. <hi>They which eat of the Sacrifices,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Altar,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.18. And therefore he forbids them to joyn in the <hi>Gentile Feasts,</hi> where they <hi>sacrificed to Devils,</hi> because that were <hi>to partake</hi> and <hi>have Fellowship with Devils,</hi> v. 20, 21.</p>
                     <p>And thus, from this also, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lords Supper being a Feast on Sacrifice,</hi> it appears to be a <hi>Federal Rite,</hi> because <hi>Sacrifice is the great way of Covenanting with God,</hi> and by <hi>Feasting on it, we joyn in and partake of it.</hi> In <hi>eating Bread</hi> and <hi>drinking Wine</hi> at the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> agreeably to what the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> did at their <hi>Religious Feasts,</hi> we feed on the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; and that Sacrifice confirmed the <hi>New Covenant</hi> with Almighty God, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he says, sealed <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.25.</note> 
                        <hi>in his Blood,</hi> so that by our Feasting on it we are made to share in it, and give our full Consent thereto.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52843:35"/>3<hi>ly,</hi> That our Eating and Drinking at the Lord's Table is a Covenant-Rite, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>all the particular Blessings of the Covenant being conveyed by it,</hi> which otherwise than by <hi>Federal Promises</hi> and <hi>Performances</hi> are not to be had.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Particular Blessings</hi> promised in the Covenant, I say, are all <hi>conveyed</hi> by it. Our Saviour tells us of the <hi>Bread</hi> we eat, and of the <hi>Wine</hi> we drink, that they are his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood:—This is my Body,</hi> says he, and <hi>this is my Blood of the New Testament,</hi> Mat. 26.26, 28. By which, altho' we are not to understand that they are so in their <hi>Natures,</hi> yet the least we can understand is, that they are so in their <hi>Effects, i. e.</hi> that they convey to us all those Blessings, which the piercing of his Body, and the shedding of his Blood procured for us. Those Blessings are contained in the New Covenant, and, as I said, are chiefly these <hi>three, viz.</hi> the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sins,</hi> the <hi>Assistance of Gods Spirit</hi> to aid and strengthen us, and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life</hi> and Happiness: and all these the Eating of Bread and Drinking Wine in the Holy Sacrament are designed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to us.</p>
                     <p>They convey to us <hi>Forgiveness of Sins,</hi> and assure us, when we perform them as we ought, that God is in Favour and at
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52843:36"/>
Peace with us. Of this we have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Assurance, because we <hi>Feast upon a Sacrifice,</hi> which is Gods Meat, and are entertained at his own Table, as <hi>his Guests</hi> whom he has invited: and the least which that can mean is, that he admits us into a State of Love and Friendliness, since we do not invite those we will not be Friends with to our own Tables. When any one calls another to a Treat, it is a plain Sign he either <hi>would be,</hi> or <hi>is,</hi> or at least <hi>makes shew of being</hi> reconciled. It is a most Natural Sign, and <hi>now</hi> every where <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>always was</hi> a Note of Friendship and Endearment. And as such the Scriptures are wont to speak of it. When those whom he <hi>had shut out,</hi> should <hi>knock at the door</hi> to be let in, and claim Acquaintance, our Saviour tells us, they will say to him, <hi>We have eaten and drunk in thy presence,</hi> Luc. 13.25, 26. And when he shews his <hi>Apostles</hi> how high Favour, and what great Interest they shall have with him, he tells them, they shall <hi>eat and drink at his Table in his Kingdom,</hi> Luc. 22.29, 30. And when he declares how kind he will be to those <hi>that hear his voice, and open unto him,</hi> he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ays, he <hi>will come in and sup with them, and they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>th him,</hi> Rev. 3.20. So that when God enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains us at his own Table, and invites us
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52843:36"/>
to Feast with him, as he doth in the Holy Communion; we may be sure, if we come worthily as we ought, he is in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with us, and our Sins are forgiven. And this our Saviour plainly intimates, when he tells us at the giving of the <hi>Cup,</hi> that it is <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 26.28.</note> 
                        <hi>his Blood shed for the Remission of Sins,</hi> and bids us <note n="*" place="margin">ver. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>drink of it,</hi> that so we may have it in our selves, and be assured we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Atonement. And this, we must observe, is a Privilege which God never vouchsafed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> no not to the <hi>Priests</hi> themselves: for in all their <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> he would never give them the <hi>Blood of Expiation,</hi> to assure them of their Sins being atoned by it, (nay, nor the <hi>Flesh</hi> neither in the <hi>Great Sacrifice of Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which <hi>was burnt</hi>

And if he had not in express Words declared it, in all Equity and Reason this might most justly have been presumed: For since in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God gives us the Body and Blood of his own Son, than which nothing can be dearer to him; we may justly argue as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, and say, <hi>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up,</hi> both <hi>for,</hi> and to <hi>us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8.32.</p>
                     <p>Thus are all the <hi>Particular Blessings</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which Christs Blood has purchased, and which God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and made over in it, conveyed to us in this Holy Sacrament.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52843:38"/>
all these Benefits upon our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of certain Conditions; so that we cannot have them conveyed to us on <hi>his</hi> part, otherwise than by undertaking at the same time for these on <hi>our own.</hi> He will not <hi>forgive</hi> any <hi>Believers their Sins,</hi> unless they <hi>repent</hi> of them; nor help them to any <hi>Graces,</hi> unless they <hi>endeavour</hi> after them, nor reward them at last with <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> unless they have <hi>intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed</hi> him, as we have already seen. And therefore wheresoever <hi>those</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, <hi>these</hi> are either performed, or sincerely promised too.</p>
                     <p>So that from this Reason also, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a <hi>Federal Rite,</hi> and a Ratification of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and of our <hi>Baptismal Ingagement</hi>; because all the Blessings of that Covenant are conveyed by it, which otherwise than by Federal Performances or Engagements are not to be had.</p>
                     <p>And thus we see, upon all these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is intended not onely for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Death of Christ,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for a <hi>Renewal</hi> and <hi>Ratification of the New Covenant</hi> which was purchased by it. For so much the <hi>General Nature of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are Covenant-Rites,</hi> of <hi>Baptism which goes hand in hand with it,</hi> and of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52843:39"/>
                        <hi>the Passover which preceded and answered to it,</hi> do fairly intimate; and so much also the <hi>Words of Institution,</hi> at the Blessing both the Bread and Wine <hi>declare,</hi> and its being a <hi>Feast on Sacrifice infers,</hi> and its <hi>conveying all the Blessings of the Covenant proves concerning it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is the <hi>second</hi> End of our Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread and Drinking Wine in the Holy Sacrament; namely, to <hi>renew our Baptismal Vow,</hi> and in most solemn sort to <hi>confirm the New Covenant</hi> with Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God. So that when we come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our Saviour Christ in this Feast, we must come also to give and receive Engagements with our Blessed Lord, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising that we will believe all his Words, and endeavour after all Virtues, and obey all his Laws, and repent of all our Faults: and then hoping assuredly that his Mercy shall forgive us, his Grace and Spirit assist us, and his Bounty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us with Eternal Happiness when we do.</p>
                     <p>But besides these Ends, of its being in <hi>Remembrance of Christ</hi> and his Dying for us, and in <hi>confirmation of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> which his Death procured us; there is yet another,</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> And that is, in <hi>Ratification of a League of Love and Friendship with those
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52843:39"/>
Brethren that Communicate with us, and with all others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eating and Drinking together at the same Table, and joyning in the same Feast, was always a Note of Friendship, and a Profession of Love and Kindness among Men. It is the common way of the World to <hi>compose Differences,</hi> to <hi>keep up Friendliness in Neighbourhoods,</hi> and to <hi>beget Endearment</hi> and <hi>mutual Love in all Fraternities.</hi> And this our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it should be among us. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us all to eat of the <hi>same Loaf,</hi> and to Feast at the same Table, that we may embrace as Friends, and love as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and be knit together in the same Fellowship and Communion. <hi>We being many,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, are one Bread, and one Body; for</hi> in the Sacrament <hi>we are all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that one Bread,</hi> which is a firm Bond of Union to make us one also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. It links us together by the most <hi>Powerful Arguments</hi> of our being <hi>Servants of the same Lord,</hi> and <hi>Sharers in the same Privileges,</hi> and <hi>Members of the same Body,</hi> which are all most <hi>strong Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> to Peace and mutual Kindness; and besides all this, by our own <hi>Solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and <hi>Engagement</hi> also. For in coming to this Feast, we are not onely <hi>excited</hi> to it by mighty Reasons which suggest it;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52843:40"/>
but are to <hi>Covenant</hi> and Promise Love to all our Brethren, and to plight our Troth for it. And thus the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> understood it, and accordingly made use of it, whose <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> in this Point were so apparent, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves, who looked any thing into their Religion, took notice of it. For <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Letter to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Trajan,</hi> wherein he gives an Account of the <hi>Christians Meetings,</hi> reports their <hi>Communicating</hi> to be a <hi>Religious Compact</hi> and <hi>Combination among themselves, to do no hurt to each other,</hi> but to love as Brethren, and live as Friends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <note n="†" place="margin">Soliti stato die ante lucem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire; carmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Christo, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si Deo dicere se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum invicem: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Sacramento non in scelus ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod obstringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, sed ne furta, ne latrocinia, ne Adulteria com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitterent, ne fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem sallerent, ne depositum appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati abnegarent: quibus peractis morem sibi disce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi fuisse, rur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>susque coeundi ad capescendum cibum, promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um tamen &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxium. <hi>Plin. ep. l.</hi> 10. <hi>ep.</hi> 97.</note>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52843:40"/>
each other, they depart home, and meet again at a promiscuous and Friendly Treat, where they innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Feast together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This then is a <hi>third</hi> End of our Eating Bread and Drinking Wine in the Holy Sacrament, namely, to be a <hi>Solemn Profession of our Communion</hi> and <hi>Fellowship with our Brethren,</hi> and an Engagement of mutual Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to those who Communicate with us, and to all others. So that when we come therein to remember our Saviour Christ, and to confirm the New Covenant with Almighty God, we must enter into a League of Love with all our Brethren, and promise an inviolable Friendship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them too.</p>
                     <p>And thus we see what is the meaning of Eating Bread and Drinking Wine in the Holy Communion, and what we must intend and understand by them, that we may, as the Apostle says, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.29.</note> 
                        <hi>discern the Lords Body in them.</hi> When we Eat Bread and Drink Wine according to Christs appointment, we must fix our thoughts upon him, and <hi>remember what Love and Friendship he had for us,</hi> what <hi>Lessons, as our faithful Guide and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52843:41"/>
he has taught us</hi>; what <hi>Commands, as our Lord and Master, he has left with us</hi>; and what <hi>inexpressible Things, as our most Precious Saviour and Benefactor, he has done for us,</hi> in being <hi>made Man,</hi> and leading a <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>necessitous Life,</hi> but above all in <hi>dying a most ignominious</hi> and <hi>painful Death</hi> for our sakes, and that he might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase us the <hi>Favour of God,</hi> the <hi>Graces of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Happiness.</hi> We must <hi>renew that Engagement which we made when we were Baptized,</hi> and confirm again that <hi>New Covenant</hi> with Almighty God which his Blood procured; professing that we <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>will believe his Word,</hi> and <hi>repent of every Fault,</hi> and <hi>endeavour with his Spirit,</hi> and <hi>obey all,</hi> not <hi>wilfully</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing <hi>any</hi> Commandment; that so we may have Right to that <hi>Forgiveness, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Happiness,</hi> which upon these Terms he has purchased. And lastly, we must <hi>confirm a League of Love and Friendship with all our Brethren,</hi> professing that we <hi>do</hi> and <hi>will</hi> forgive all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure us, and be kind to all about us, and never fall into Hatred or cause Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with any Persons, but be at Peace and live in Charity with all the World. The Bodily Eating is but the out-side, and the least part in this Feast; but the chief thing required is this Spiritual
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52843:41"/>
Work and Business which is to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it. So that when our Saviour Christ calls us to Eat and Drink at his own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he calls us not barely to Feast our Bodies, for that is the least thing that he intends; but chiefly and principally to employ our Souls, in remembring him, his Laws and Benefits, and among <hi>them,</hi> above all, that of his Dying for us; in confirming the New Covenant with God, and a Covenant of Peace and Brotherly Love with his Members throughout all Mankind.</p>

                        <p>To Communicate Worthily, is to do it with such Tempers and Behaviour as are worthy of it, and becoming the Things which are meant by it. The <hi>First</hi> End was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Christ, both, <hi>first,</hi> As our Lord and Master, which calls for Honour and Reverence in our selves, and a Care to maintain his Honour among others. For mindfulness of his Commands, and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Obedience. <hi>2.</hi> As our most kind Friend and Benefactor, which calls for Love and an hearty Affection for him. For Joy and Gladness in what we receive from him. For Thankfulness for all his Kindnesses, particularly in Dying for us. And as this Death was a Sacrifice for our Sins, the Remembrance of it calls for a deep sense of our own Vnworthiness. An utter Abhorrence of our Sins, which caused his Sufferings. A Resignation of our selves to his Vse, as thereby we are become his own Purchase. The <hi>Second</hi> End was to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52843:42"/>
confirm the New Covenant with God which his Blood procured. This calls for Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Faithfulness. A <hi>Third</hi> End was to confirm a League of Love and Friendship with all Christians. This calls for Peace and Charity to all Persons, and particularly for Alms to the Necessitous. A Summary Repetition of these Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. A Belief of these Things, which carries us on to these Tempers and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, is the Faith that makes us Worthy Communicants.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving shewn hitherto what is the meaning of Eating Bread and Drinking Wine in the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I proceed now, in the next place, to shew <hi>wherein lies the Worthiness of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</hi> And this had need be clearly stated, not onely because the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Scruple against Communicating lies in it, but also because really 'tis a Matter of great account, and there hangs a great weight upon it. <hi>For he that eats and drinks unworthily,</hi> says the Apostle, commits a Damning Sin, which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him, unless he repent of it; <hi>he eats and drinks Damnation to himself,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29; and <hi>is guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> v. 27.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52843:43"/>Now to <hi>Do this Worthily,</hi> is to <hi>Do it with such Tempers and Dispositions as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it,</hi> and <hi>are worthy of it.</hi> For this Eating and Drinking not being to satisfie Hunger, but for Sacred Ends, 'tis fit we come to it with a suitable and a Sacred Carriage, and in that consists the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of the Usage. Were it onely a Feast on <hi>Common Food,</hi> we should behave our selves worthily at it, by <hi>thanking God</hi> for it, and being <hi>Temperate.</hi> But being a Feast wherein <hi>Religion</hi> is concerned, and whereat we are to <hi>remember the Death of our Lord,</hi> and to <hi>Seal the New Covenant with God,</hi> and a <hi>League of Love with all the Christian World</hi>; to the doing this worthily, and as 'tis fit we should, there is more required. For we deal very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily in <hi>remembring the Death of our Lord,</hi> if we are not <hi>thankful for it</hi>; and in <hi>ratifying the New Covenant</hi> with God, if we are not <hi>sincere</hi> in it; and in <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Love</hi> to all the <hi>Christian World,</hi> if we are in <hi>enmity</hi> and <hi>hatred.</hi> These Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ends must be answered with a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Temper, and a Devout Carriage, and then they are treated as they ought, and as their Worth requires. This is signified by several Copies, which in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. read not barely, <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall eat this Bread and drink this

Ends with Sacred and suitable Carriage and Dispositions. And therefore that we may see what Behaviour is worthy of it, 'tis fit we run over those several Ends, and inquire what Tempers every one of them requires of us.</p>
                     <p>Those Ends are Three.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> To <hi>Remember Christ our Blessed Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and particularly his <hi>Dying for us</hi>; which call for <hi>Love, Joy, Gratitude, Obedient Resolutions,</hi> and such like Tempers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> To <hi>Confirm the New Covenant</hi> with Almighty God; which is not worthily done by us, unless we come to it in <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> and with <hi>full Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> and <hi>Performance</hi> of that <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> which we <hi>profess</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> To <hi>Confirm a League of Love and Friendship with all our Brethren and Fellow-Christians</hi>; which requires that we lay aside all <hi>Envy, Hatred,</hi> and <hi>Malicious Thoughts,</hi> and come to it in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Forgiveness</hi> of all that have any ways of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended us.</p>
                     <p>If we <hi>Believe</hi> all these things which <hi>Christ</hi> our Great <hi>Prophet</hi> has revealed to us, and our <hi>Faith</hi> shews it self in <hi>these Tempers,</hi> and carries us on to <hi>these Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi>; we are <hi>Worthy Communicants,</hi> and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52843:44"/>
have that <hi>Faith</hi> which will render us welcom Guests at the Lords Table, and acceptable to him at all other times.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> One End of our Eating Bread and Drinking Wine at the Lords Supper, is to <hi>remember Christ,</hi> not onely as our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> and <hi>Teacher</hi> (which I do not make a <hi>Distinct</hi> Head now, because the <hi>Belief</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to that is exercised thro' the whole Action, and falls in at all the other) but as our <hi>Blessed Lord, Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor</hi>; and above all his Benefits, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to remember <hi>his Dying for us</hi>: and this, to do it worthily, calls for <hi>Love, Joy, Gratitude, Resolutions of Obedience,</hi> and other such like Tempers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Remembrance of any thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and long since past, brings it back into our Minds, and gives a sort of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> to it. And therefore when things are brought to our Remembrance, they should work upon us, and affect us, as if they were before us. When we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Saviour Christ then, we must bear the same Mind towards him, as we should if we saw him, and were conversing with him: and that will consist in these Things that follow. We must <hi>Honour him,</hi> and <hi>resolve to Obey him,</hi> as he is our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master</hi>; and <hi>Love him,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him,</hi> and <hi>give Thanks to him,</hi> as he

And this accordingly God has expresly required of us. <hi>He hath committed all Judgment to the Son, that all should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father,</hi> Joh. 5.22, 23; and <hi>highly exalting him, hath given him a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52843:46"/>
Name above every Name, that at the Name of Jesus every Knee should bow, of things in Heaven, and of things in Earth,</hi> Phil. 2.9, 10. He incomparably deserves our utmost Worship and Reverence, and has a most absolute Claim to them; so that we must needs treat him with the most submissive and respectful Carriage, and should deal most unworthily by him, and do what utterly misbecomes us, if we should do otherwise.</p>
                     <p>Thus must we Remember our Lord and Master Jesus Christ with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Veneration,</hi> if we would do it in such sort as is <hi>worthy</hi> of him.</p>
                     <p>Nay, we must not onely Honour and Reverence him <hi>our selves,</hi> but, if we would deal worthily by him, seek to <hi>make him Honourable,</hi> and promote his Honour among <hi>others.</hi> We must be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy always to plead his Cause, and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his Precepts, and to side with his Servants, and express a just Distaste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those who transgress his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands themselves (and much more against those who set up for the Party of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and seek to draw in others) who prophane his Ordinances, or lightly and irreverently use his Name, or any ways vilifie any Person or Thing which he ought to be Glorified and Honoured
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52843:47"/>
in. And this we shall be sure to do, if we have any high Esteem, and Zeal of Love, and affectionate Concern for him. For when these are strong in them, every <hi>Servant</hi> will perform this Office to his <hi>Master,</hi> and every <hi>Man</hi> to his <hi>Friend</hi>; they will not sit still, and tamely hear his Name abused, or see his Commands sleighted, his Interest opposed, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Dependents injured, his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments disparaged, or his Person any way traduced or disgraced, without expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Discreet and well-tempered Zeal in his Cause, and concerning themselves in a sober and just Vindication. This, I say, they ordinarily will do, as I am sure they always ought to do, when they have an high Esteem for any Man. And if, thro' lowness of Spirit, or Cowardise of Temper, they draw back from the Trouble or Hazard they are like to run in his Vindication; they are very much wanting to their Friend or Lord, and deal unworthily by him. So that if we would deal worthily by our Friend and Master Jesus Christ, we must neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him our selves, nor, if we can help it, at least not without expressing our dislike of it, suffer it to be done by others. And therefore to make this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Remembrance worthy of him,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52843:47"/>
it must not onely be in shewing Honour and Reverence to him our selves, but in a readiness to maintain his Honour, and promote his Interest among others also.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> We must Remember Christ our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> with <hi>mindfulness of his Commands,</hi> and <hi>Resolutions of Obedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is another Temper, which Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Authority over us call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> for. For the most proper Duty of <hi>Subjects</hi> towards their <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> and of <hi>Servants</hi> towards their <hi>Masters,</hi> is <hi>Obedience,</hi> or a Careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to perform whatsoever they injoyn and require of them. <hi>Put them in mind,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>to be subject to Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers, and to obey Magistrates,</hi> Tit. 3.1. And <hi>Servants obey your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in all things, not with eye-service, but in singleness of heart, fearing God,</hi> Col. 3.22. And <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>and do not the things which I say?</hi> Luc. 6.46.</p>
                     <p>Thus is Obedience the great Duty which we owe to all Masters and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that have Authority over us. We must neither forget the Commands they have left with us, nor knowingly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress them, but carefully call them into our Minds, and conscientiously practise them when we do.</p>
                     <p>And this we are then especially bound
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52843:48"/>
to, if they are not onely our <hi>Masters,</hi> but our <hi>Dearest Friends,</hi> and <hi>Noblest Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> also. For these are Names that add new Bonds, and higher Obligations, which will have a great force so long as there is any thing of Ingenuity left in us. And therefore since our Blessed Master Jesus is not onely our Rightful Lord and Governour, but withal our most surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing kind Friend and Benefactor, we ought in all Duty and Gratitude to be mindful of what he desires, and to do any thing that he would have us; and we deal most undutifully and unworthily by him, if we do otherwise. So that this also is another Instance of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of this Remembrance, to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Laws which he has given us, and to think of them with a Readiness and firm Resolution to obey.</p>
                     <p>These are the things then which must render our Remembrance worthy of him under this Relation. When we Eat and Drink in Commemoration of Christ our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> we must <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> him <hi>our selves,</hi> and be concerned to <hi>maintain his Honour</hi> and <hi>promote his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests among others,</hi> and be <hi>mindful of the Commands</hi> he has left with us, and <hi>ready and resolved to obey</hi> them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> In Eating Bread and Drinking
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52843:48"/>
Wine at the Lords Supper, we are to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Christ</hi> as our <hi>most kind Friend and Benefactor</hi>; and to do this worthily, we must remember him with <hi>Love of him,</hi> and <hi>Delight in him,</hi> and <hi>grateful Resentments</hi> and <hi>hearty Thanks</hi> for all the Kindnesses which we have received from him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> We must remember him our most <hi>kind Friend</hi> and <hi>Benefactor</hi> with <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>an hearty Affection for him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is due to him as he is our <hi>Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord,</hi> and indeed in every Relation that he stands in, since in all he is most wonderfully winning and obliging. For even there he seeks our own Good in every thing he commands us, and treats us with much gentleness, and encourages every thing that is well in us, and pities our unavoidable Infirmities, and bears our many and high Provocations with invincible Patience, and sends Messengers of Peace to entreat and sue for a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with us upon any Difference, tho 'tis not his Interest but ours, and tho' not he but we are the Offenders; and, when he is forced to punish, doth it always with the greatest reluctance; but when he can take an occasion to reward, doth that with the greatest Joy and Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; all which are strangely inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and must needs constrain all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52843:49"/>
Tempers to be heartily in Love with him.</p>
                     <p>But our Love is due to him more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as he is our <hi>most kind Friend,</hi> that loves us as he doth his own Life; and our most <hi>noble Benefactor,</hi> who has so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely obliged us, and done such Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses for us, as we are not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.</p>
                     <p>He is our <hi>true Friend,</hi> who espouses our Interests as his own, and is sensible of all our Wants, and pained in all our Afflictions, and rejoyces in all our Joys, and seeks to make us share in his own Happiness, and would part with any thing he has to please us, nay, give his own Hearts Blood in any Case which were worth the while to do us a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>He is our most <hi>noble Benefactor,</hi> who has done us such Kindnesses as are beyond all Expressions, having procured for us the Favour of God, the Help of the Spirit, and the assured Hope of Eternal Happiness, when all these seemed irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably lost, and no ways attainable by us; and when he could not gain them at a less Rate, than by laying down his own Life for the Purchase.</p>
                     <p>And these are Endearments which pass all Imagination; they are such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52843:49"/>
to a reciprocal Love and Kindness, as cannot be withstood by any Man. So that having received all this Love from him, we musts needs return the small Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Love to him again, or else we should be the unworthiest of any Persons living.</p>
                     <p>And this is one Temper which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to a worthy Remembrance of so <hi>kind a Friend,</hi> and so <hi>noble a Benefactor</hi> as we have of our Blessed Saviour: We must love the Thoughts of him, and be most kindly affected towards him, or else we shall shew our selves utterly unworthy of him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> We must Remember him our most Noble <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and the Favours he has done us, with <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Gladness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a Temper very necessary in us, when we would worthily Commemorate the Receipt of Benefits. For when we rejoyce in them, we shew what Rate we put upon them, and how much we are pleased in them, and how happy we think our selves in that Love which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed them on us. And this will make the Person that conferred them think them well placed, and please himself in what he has done, concluding, that we, who are so sensible of a Kindness when 'tis shewed us, are worthy to receive one.

                     <p>And this we all ought to shew when we Commemorate those Blessings which our Blessed Saviour has conferred upon us. He has got all those things for us which our Hearts can wish, no less than the pure and perfect Joys of Heaven, and Eternal Happiness; and these he has taken the hardest Pains, and been at the greatest Cost to compass, laying down his own Life for them, rather than he would suffer us to go without them. And this we ought not at any time to think of, without Joy and Gladness. When we reflect upon so great Love, and such inestimable Benefits, 'tis most fit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable we rejoyce over them, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may shew forth how happy we think our selves in them. And our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lord may well think he threw them away upon us, and repent that ever he bestowed, or took such pains for them, if after all he sees us insensible of what is done, and still as cold and unaffected as if we had received nothing. So that if we would worthily Commemorate the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52843:50"/>
Receipt of so great Happiness, we must do it with joyful Hearts, and chearful Looks, and an open shew of Gladness; as we are told the <hi>Disciples</hi> did in the <hi>first</hi> Days, who, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> says, <hi>continued dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Temple, and breaking Bread, eating it with Gladness of Heart,</hi> Act. 2.46.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> We must Remember him our most <hi>Noble Benefactor</hi> with <hi>grateful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments</hi> and <hi>hearty Thanks for all his Kindnesses,</hi> particularly for that of <hi>his Dying</hi> for us.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Thankfulness</hi> are implied <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> A <hi>grateful Acknowledgment of the Gift,</hi> and a <hi>Praising him that gave it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> A <hi>Readiness</hi> and <hi>Endeavour accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Power to requite it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It implies a <hi>grateful Acknowledgment of the Gift,</hi> and <hi>a Praising of him that gave it.</hi> For when we receive an undeserved Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, it is very fit that we let the <hi>Donor</hi> know we are sensible of it, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand very well both our own Happiness in receiving, and his Kindness in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. We must give him the Praise of his Beneficence, and express a Sense of our own Obligations: For if we fail in this, we shew either that we <hi>contemn his Gift,</hi> and set no <hi>value</hi> on it; or that we think it onely a <hi>Tribute to our own Desert,</hi> so as that we are not <hi>beholding</hi> to him for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52843:51"/>
it; or that we would be <hi>independent,</hi> and are too proud to be obliged by it; all which, had they been known to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, would have made <hi>him</hi> and <hi>all men</hi> judge us most <hi>unworthy</hi> to receive it.</p>
                     <p>It implies also a <hi>Readiness</hi> and <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour according to our Power to requite it.</hi> For Love should engage Love, and the Kindnesses which are done us, oblige us upon all Opportunities to do the same again. To encourage Benefits and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing Favours, we ought to take care that they who gave them never have any just cause to repent of them, and to let them see, that if we had the Power and Opportunity, we would do as much for them. For Kindnesses should be a sort of <hi>Loans,</hi> which, upon any fit occasion, are to be repaid back to him who shewed them, that so all Men may be encouraged to abound in them, and never be hindred by a fear lest afterwards they should be offended with themselves for having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed them. And if any Man is either so <hi>stupid,</hi> or so <hi>proud,</hi> that he will take no notice of them, nor endeavour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to requite them, by the consent of all he is unfit to be dealt with in this <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous</hi> way of Love, and is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to receive them.</p>
                     <p>Thus doth Thankfulness imply, both
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52843:51"/>
an affectionate Acknowledgment of the Gift, and Praising him that gave it; and also a Readiness and Endeavour accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Power to requite it.</p>
                     <p>And this we owe in the highest Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to our Saviour Christ, and must be sure always to pay him, when we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the inestimable Benefits which we have received from him. We must not remember the great Things he has done for us, in delivering us from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death, and gaining us the Favour of God, and the Joys of Heaven, when it cost him no less than his own Hearts Blood for the Purchase, without affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Resentments, and Mouths full of Praise, and a fixt Readiness and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind to make what small requital we are able in our Zeal for his Service, and our Kindness to his <hi>Brethren,</hi> whom he looks on as his own Members, resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Good that is <hi>done to them, as if it were done to himself,</hi> Mat. 25.40. And this Duty of Thankfulness is a most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Requisite to our worthy Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Benefits in this Feast. For <hi>Praising God</hi> is reckoned as one Particular of the Disciples Carriage in their <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread,</hi> Act. 2. <hi>They continued daily breaking Bread,</hi> says St. <hi>Luke, which they eat with gladness, praising God,</hi> v. 46, 47.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52843:52"/>
Nay, so great a share has Thanksgiving and Praise in this Business, that the whole Action is called the <hi>Eucharist, i. e.</hi> the Giving of Thanks to God for those Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which are therein Commemorated.</p>
                     <p>And these are the Things which must render our Remembrance worthy of him, when we Commemorate him as our <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Benefactor</hi> in this Holy Supper. We must <hi>love</hi> him for his Kindnesses, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in his Benefits, and be <hi>thankful</hi> for all his Favours, particularly for that which is therein especially Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his <hi>Dying</hi> upon our accounts, burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into <hi>grateful Acknowledgments</hi> and <hi>Words of Praise,</hi> and being <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved</hi> by our <hi>Zeal in his Service,</hi> our <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of his Laws,</hi> and our <hi>Kindness to his poor Members,</hi> to make him all the small <hi>Requital</hi> we are able, so that he may never have any cause to repent of what he has done for us.</p>
                     <p>But besides this Remembrance of his Friendship to us, and <hi>Benefits</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> which require in us these forementioned Tempers; we are <hi>especially</hi> to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the <hi>Benefit of his Dying for us,</hi> which more particularly calls for certain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

his most tender Love for him, whom he valued as his own Right Eye, could not hinder but that he should bleed and die for them. It lets us see also how <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom</hi> they had made us to our <hi>best Friends,</hi> and how <hi>shamefully burdensom</hi> and <hi>expensive</hi> to the <hi>Blessed Jesus.</hi> For when he long'd and labour'd to redeem us from them, he could not be <hi>our</hi> Friend unless he would cease to be <hi>his own,</hi> nor do us any good at all, except he would give his own Life a Ransom. And what Man now can ever think of this, but he must hide his Face, and be quite buried in a shameful sense of his own Unworthiness? He may see how vile he was, when God was so highly offended with him, and thought no Punishment too heavy for him, and would not be reconciled at the Intercession of his own Son, unless he would die in stead of him; and it was so dangerous and costly a thing, no less than the laying down his own Life, for his Saviour to shew himself a serviceable Friend to him. And if this Sight doth not work shame and self-abasement in him, he will be concluded by all to be the basest Man alive, and utterly unworthy that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52843:53"/>We must also remember his Dying for us with <hi>an utter abhorrence of our Sins, which were the Causes of his Sufferings.</hi> For if we do not hate and abhor them, when we consider what Tortures he endured for them, we shew we are very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for his Ease, nor have any feeling of his Pains, nor any Zeal at all against the Occasion of his Sorrows. And this is a very bad Requital of his undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all those Pains for our sakes, and a most unworthy Usage. So that if we would worthily Commemorate his Dying for us, we must be humbled and ashamed of our selves, at the sense of our own Unworthiness, seeing we had deserved such insupportable Punishments, and have put him to such exquisite and intense Pains; and particularly we must turn our abhorrence on our Sins, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all this Mischief, and made him, if he would befriend us, to undergo such hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Tortures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> We must remember his Dying for us, with a <hi>Resignation of our selves,</hi> both <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies, to his use, as we are bought with his Blood,</hi> and <hi>thereby become his own Purchase.</hi>

                        <hi>The Son of Man,</hi> saith he, <hi>is come to give his Life a Ransom for many,</hi> Mat. 20.28. And since he has bought us, and paid so dear for us, to deliver us from Hell-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Eternal Death, which is not <hi>his,</hi> but <hi>our own</hi> Advantage; in all Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reason he ought to have the Use of us, and we should be wholly devoted to his Service. And this the Scripture requires of us. <hi>The Love of God constrains us,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to live to him, <hi>because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. And again, <hi>Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a Price; therefore glorifie God in your Body and in your Spirit, which are Gods,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. And since his Dying for us has made us his own Propriety, and acquired him an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Right over us to his own use, which we had infinite Reason to desire, but he had no need of; if we would remember it <hi>worthily,</hi> we must do it <hi>justly,</hi> by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly devoting our Souls and Bodies, and assigning them over to him, to be wholly at his Service.</p>
                     <p>And these are the Things which must render our Remembrance worthy of him, when in the Holy Sacrament we Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52843:54"/>
his Dying for us, and shedding his most precious Blood a Ransom for our Sins. We must be <hi>humbled</hi> with the sense of our own Unworthiness, and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor our Sins,</hi> which brought him to these Sufferings, and <hi>resign up our selves,</hi> both Bodies and Souls, to be wholly at his use, and employed where and in what he pleases, as thereby they are become his own Purchase.</p>
                     <p>And thus it appears what Tempers are becoming us, and worthy of this <hi>first</hi> End of Eating and Drinking in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Remembrance of our Lord and Saviour Christ, and his Dying for us.</hi> We must remember him with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> with a <hi>careful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to maintain</hi> and <hi>promote his Honour</hi> among others, with <hi>mindfulness of his Commands,</hi> and <hi>Resolutions of Obedience,</hi> as he is <hi>Lord</hi> over us: with <hi>Love</hi> of him for his Kindness, and <hi>Delight</hi> in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and <hi>thankful Acknowledgments,</hi> and <hi>Words of Praise,</hi> and <hi>grateful Returns,</hi> in any thing he can receive, or we can give, for <hi>all</hi> his Favours, particularly his <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our account,</hi> as he has so <hi>highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended,</hi> and <hi>infinitely obliged</hi> us; and with an <hi>humble sense of our own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and an <hi>utter abhorrence of all our Sins,</hi> which were the Causes of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52843:55"/>
and an <hi>intire Resignation of our selves,</hi> both Souls and Bodies, to his use, to be employ'd as his own Purchase in what he pleases, as his Death was a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> for our Sins, wherewith he bought and redeemed us. All these are Duties, which, were he now before us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with us, we ought to pay him; and which therefore in our Remembrance of him, which makes him present to our Minds, we must not deny him: and in them consists the Worthiness of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and Commemoration.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> A <hi>second</hi> End of our Eating Bread and Drinking Wine in the Lords Supper, is to <hi>confirm the New Covenant with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God which Christs Death procured:</hi> And to do this <hi>worthily,</hi> we must come to it in <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> and with <hi>full purpose</hi> and <hi>performance</hi> of that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> which therein we solemnly <hi>profess</hi> and <hi>promise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We must come to it, I say, in <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness.</hi> The great Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is requisite in all Compacts, is <hi>Faithfulness.</hi> For they are the great Means of Security among Men, and the great Thing which, in their Expectations from each other, they have to depend upon: and therefore it is both <hi>pretended,</hi> and <hi>expected</hi> by all that make them, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52843:55"/>
they will not prove false and deceitful in them. Every Man that Covenants, expects those he Contracts with should mean what they profess, and perform what they promise; and makes shew also himself, that he will do so likewise. And if he doth not, he is a very dishonest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Man, such as the <hi>Gospel</hi> condemns, and will sentence, unless he repent, to eternal destruction: <hi>Covenant-breakers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ranked among those who <hi>in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God are worthy of Death,</hi> Rom. 1.31, 32.</p>
                     <p>And this <hi>Sincerity</hi> or <hi>Faithfulness</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in this, that we come in <hi>full purpose</hi> and <hi>performance</hi> of that <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> which we <hi>profess</hi> and make <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> of. In this Covenant, to all us <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> God <hi>offers at present</hi> a <hi>Right to Pardon,</hi> his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>; and we again <hi>profess,</hi> and make offer to him of our <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> And this Right <hi>he promises</hi> still to <hi>continue</hi> to us upon the same Terms; and answerably <hi>we promise</hi> to perform them upon that expectation for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. And both in these <hi>Professions</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> we must deal sincerely with him, and neither pretend a present offer of them, when we want them; nor make Promises of them for the time to come,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52843:56"/>
when we have no fixed Design and well-weighed Resolution to perform them.</p>
                     <p>When we come therefore to renew our <hi>Baptismal Engagement,</hi> and to confirm the New Covenant with Almighty God, giving him both the <hi>Profession</hi> and the <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>these Duties,</hi> and receiving from him the <hi>Proffer</hi> and the <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>these Graces,</hi> we must be hearty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned with him. Our Souls must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be acted by that Repentance which we profess, and fully intend to make good that Obedience which we promise. And if we perform in both these, we are <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> in this Business; but if we fail in either, we are <hi>Dissemblers</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> who <hi>act a Part,</hi> and go to impose upon Almighty God, which is a very <hi>unworthy</hi> part of us.</p>
                     <p>And this Sincerity God expresly calls for at this Feast, and requires us to be faithful with him when we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the New Covenant by partaking of it. <hi>Christ our Passover,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, is sacrificed for us, therefore let us keep the Feast, not with the Leaven of Malice and Wickedness,</hi> by adhering still to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wicked ways, which therefore we are to repent of, <hi>but with the unleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. And as for <hi>Repentance</hi> particularly,

which is the great Condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant renewed in it; it is the great Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of all worthy Receivers, and is most indispensably required in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>We must not come to it in <hi>Envy, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi> and <hi>Malicious Thoughts</hi>; for that were to give the Lye to our selves, and to contradict our own Professions.

sakes, yet for the sake of Christ, who has bore a thousand times more from us, and deserves infinitely beyond what this comes to at our hands.

And thus the <hi>Ancient Christians</hi> constantly used to do in the Apostles times. For then at every Lords Supper, they had another of their
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52843:58"/>
own, which they call'd a <hi>Love Feast,</hi> or <hi>Feast of Charity,</hi> Jud. 12. This consisted of such Provision as every Communicant brought along with him; they that were <hi>Rich</hi> brought in much, and the <hi>Poorer</hi> sort less, but when it came, they all sate down in a Brotherly way, and shared in common. Which when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> failed to do, every one eating as they came without tarrying for their Brethren, and the Rich taking their own large Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to themselves, and leaving the Poor to blush at the scantiness of theirs; the Apostle reproved them sharply, telling them how much they prophaned this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Feast by such corrupt usage. <hi>In eating,</hi> says he, at this Feast, instead of joyning all like loving Brethren at a common Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>every one taketh before other his own Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> or that which he brought for his own share, <hi>and one,</hi> who brought little, <hi>is Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> through his scarceness, <hi>and another,</hi> who brought much, <hi>is Drunken</hi> with the excess of his. <hi>Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.21, 22. And when this way of being Charitable to the Poor at this Feast, by reason of abuses crept into it, was laid aside; another was still used, which to this day is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in many and the best of our Churches, as 'tis fit it should in all, and that is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52843:59"/>
                        <hi>offerings for the poor</hi> at every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which may afterwards be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among them. Which is a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way, and excellent opportunity, not only of exercising that Charity which therein we profess to them; but also of expressing our Thankfulness to our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, for the invaluable benefits we have received from him. For in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus kind to his poor Members, whom he is so tenderly concerned for, we make some sleight return and poor requital un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, who puts their Receipts upon his own score, taking what we do to them as done to his own Person. <hi>In as much as ye have done it unto these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> Mat. 25.40.</p>
                     <p>And these are the things which must render our eating and drinking, as it is in <hi>Confirmation</hi> of a <hi>League of Love and Friendship with all our Brethren,</hi> worthy of that signification. We must lay aside all <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malicious Thoughts,</hi> and come to it in <hi>Forgiveness</hi> of all that have offended us, and in <hi>Charity</hi> to all our Neighbours, which we must express, as in other things, so particularly in <hi>giving Alms</hi> to such whose necessities require it of us.</p>
                     <p>And all these the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self marks out as necessary Qualifications in all <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicants. Let us keep the Feast,</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:52843:59"/>
says the Apostle, <hi>not with the Leaven of Malice,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.8. <hi>When ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one place,</hi> says he again, <hi>I hear there be Divisions among you: And,</hi> when there are so, <hi>this is not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> one End whereof is to unite you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 20. <hi>If thou bring thy Gift to the Altar,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>and there remembrest that thy Brother hath ought against thee, leave thy Gift before the Altar, and go and first be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift,</hi> Mat. 5.23, 24. And as for the <hi>Distribution of Alms</hi> at this time; that, as we saw, was the <hi>Apostolical</hi> way in the <hi>Love-Feasts,</hi> as also in the <hi>Collections for the Poor as every Man had laid by him in store</hi> on the <hi>First day of the Week,</hi> (when they always had a Sacrament) which St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And thus at last we see wherein consists the <hi>Worthiness</hi> of Eating and Drinking in this Holy Feast, and what Tempers and Dispositions in us are worthy of all those Ends which are signified and designed by it. We must Eat and Drink in <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52843:60"/>
of Christ,</hi> and of his <hi>Dying for us,</hi> with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> with a <hi>careful Concern to maintain</hi> and <hi>promote his Honour</hi> among others, with <hi>mindfulness of his Commands,</hi> and <hi>Resolutions of Obedience,</hi> as he is <hi>Lord</hi> over us: with <hi>Love</hi> of him for his Kindness, and <hi>Delight</hi> in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and <hi>thankful Acknowledgments,</hi> and <hi>grateful Returns for all his Favours,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly his <hi>Dying on our account,</hi> as he so highly <hi>befriended,</hi> and <hi>infinitely obliged us</hi>: and with an <hi>humble sense of our own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,</hi> and an <hi>utter abhorrence of all our Sins,</hi> which were the Causes of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and an <hi>intire Resignation of our selves,</hi> both Souls and Bodies, <hi>to his use,</hi> to be employed as his own Purchase in what he pleases, as his Death was a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our Sins,</hi> wherewith he bought and redeemed us. We must Eat and Drink in <hi>confirmation of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> professing our hearty Consent to it, and Resolution to stand by it, in all <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi>; coming to it with that <hi>Repentance</hi> of all our Sins, and those <hi>obedient Hearts</hi> which we <hi>profess</hi>; and with a <hi>full purpose</hi> afterwards to make good all we <hi>promise.</hi> And, lastly, we must Eat and Drink in <hi>confirmation of a League of Love and Friendship with all our Brethren,</hi> laying aside all <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi>

towards them, and making <hi>Restitution</hi> where we have wronged them, and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> heartily where we have any Grudge against them, and giving <hi>Alms</hi> as our Ability and their Necessities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them, and so being in perfect <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> with all Men.</p>
                     <p>And if we <hi>believe all these things,</hi> and are thereby carried on to <hi>all these Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> and <hi>Performances,</hi> we have that <hi>Faith</hi> which will render us <hi>Worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi> and acceptable to God at all other times.

                        <p>These recited Tempers are all necessary in the Person Communicating, but not all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be expresly exercised in the Time of Communion. A Direction in which it may be fit to lay out our Devotion at that time. All these are provided for in the Churches Prayers, so that we may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise them worthily if we go along devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at all the Parts of the Communion-Service.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the <hi>former</hi> Chapter I have reckon'd up those Tempers which render us <hi>Worthy Communicants,</hi> and fit us to be bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Welcome at the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he invites and calls us thither.</p>
                     <p>But of them I must observe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they are <hi>all necessary in the Person Communicating</hi>; yet are they <hi>not all of necessity to be particularly</hi> and <hi>expresly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the Time of Communion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are <hi>all necessary,</hi> I say, <hi>in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Communicating,</hi> and he is not worthy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52843:62"/>
to <hi>remember</hi> such a <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> to <hi>sign the New Covenant with Almighty God,</hi> and a <hi>League of Amity</hi> and <hi>Friendship with all the Christian World,</hi> who wants any of them. They are altogether <hi>due</hi> from us, as we have seen, and may in all reason be <hi>expected</hi> of us, as we stand in these <hi>Relations,</hi> and are admitted to these <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments:</hi> So that we act <hi>unworthily,</hi> and fail of our Duty, if our Souls are not endow'd with them, when we are in those Capacities, and about those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, which do so justly challenge and call for them.</p>
                     <p>But they are <hi>not all necessary to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi> and <hi>expresly exercised in the Time of Communion.</hi> They will be all <hi>implied,</hi> 'tis true, and <hi>virtually contained</hi> in what is then done; but they are not all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be <hi>particularly insisted on.</hi> And for this there is a very good Reason, because that Time doth not ordinarily allow sufficient Space for them. For most Communicants are not of such active Minds and quick Apprehensions, as that they can pursue so many Busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or work themselves up into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Fervour of so many particular Tempers at one Exercise. And those that are, chuse rather often-times to fix upon some few, that so, having the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52843:62"/>
more time to stay upon them, they may raise themselves up to greater Degrees, and act them over in much higher Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. And because, where all cannot be exercised, it is of great use to know which are best and fittest to be singled out, I shall here set down which of all those Tempers I conceive it were most proper to stir up at that time, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously to exert and heighten in our own Minds.</p>
                     <p>If any then, who come to the Holy Communion, find that they are either <hi>tired out</hi> with the <hi>length,</hi> or <hi>distracted</hi> by the <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>many</hi> Particulars, and that their Devotion in this Feast goes better on, and is more full and perfect when they restrain it to a <hi>few</hi>; I think they may do well to lay it out in these that follow.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>remembring</hi> our Saviour Christ, who, as then we are to believe, <hi>died</hi> for us, and purchased us the <hi>New Covenant</hi> by his Death, offering us the Pardon of our Sins upon Repent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. A <hi>joyful</hi> and <hi>affectionate Thankfulness</hi> for this his unspeakable Love and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52843:63"/>
particularly for his Dying for us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. An <hi>intire Resignation of our selves,</hi> both Souls and Bodies, <hi>to his use,</hi> as they are his own Purchase<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In which <hi>two</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the main Worthiness of this Part, they being the Things which are most becoming us in this Remembrance.</p>
                     <p>And in <hi>confirming the New Covenant</hi> with Almighty God, whereto we must believe we are then invited, we may act,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Repentance of all our Sins,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of all those which we find are most apt to win upon us; and <hi>make him Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> that in all the Instances of Duty, but in them especially, we will joyn our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to his Grace, and obey his Laws: and when we promise this, it must be with a <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> Heart, and with full Intentions of Performance, which are the great Duty incumbent on us in these Engagements.</p>
                     <p>And in <hi>confirming a League of Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship with all our Brethren,</hi> which we must think we are then called to likewise, we may exercise,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Charity towards all Persons,</hi> forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all that have any ways offended us, and laying aside all Envy, Strife, and malicious Thoughts, and resolving to shew Kindness both in Word and Deed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52843:63"/>
to all about us, nay to all Men, as we have ability and opportunity, but the <hi>Poor</hi> especially, who ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten at such times; which is the Great Thing required of us, and becoming us in this part of the Service.</p>
                     <p>So that when we come to the Holy <hi>Communion,</hi> where we are called to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Christ,</hi> particularly in his <hi>Death,</hi> to <hi>seal the New Covenant with God,</hi> and a <hi>League of Friendship with our Brethren</hi>; we may do well to express our selves <hi>joyfully</hi> and <hi>affectionately thankful</hi> for all his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, especially that in Dying for us, and <hi>resign up our selves,</hi> both Souls and Bodies, to his Service, and <hi>repent of all our Sins,</hi> making him faithful and unfeigned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of amending all our Faults, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly those wherein we are most liable to do amiss, and shew our selves in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>perfect Charity</hi> with all Persons. By these things we shall duly answer the Ends of this Feast, and in them lies the great Worthiness of our Carriage at it. And this our <hi>Church</hi> has sufficiently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to us in her <hi>Publick Catechism,</hi> when in return to that <hi>Question, What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> of them that come to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? It gives this <hi>Answer</hi>; To <hi>repent them truly of all their Sins, stedfastly purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to lead a new Life; to have a lively
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52843:64"/>
Faith in Gods Mercy thro' Christ</hi> (which, as we have seen, is thorowly exercised from the <hi>beginning</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament) <hi>to have a thankful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Death, and be in Charity with all Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When we come therefore to the Holy Sacrament, whilst the <hi>Minister</hi> himself is Communicating, or whilst <hi>others</hi> are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, we may lay out our selves on these things, and spend the time in the Exercise of these Duties, acting them in Devout Prayers and Holy Meditations in our <hi>own Hearts.</hi> Or if we are not able of our selves, but need the Help of others to suggest Thoughts, and to go along with us in this Service, let us joyn hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily in the <hi>Churches Prayers,</hi> which it has appointed for this purpose. For in them we have an Exercise of all these Virtues, and they have excellently provided for our Needs in this Case; so that we may duly express these Tempers, if we are careful to joyn fervently with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in all the Parts of the <hi>Communion-Service.</hi> And because it may be of use to some to see how all these Duties are exercised in it, that so, being aware of it, they may particularly design them when they come to it; I will shew it of them all particularly.</p>

                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:52843:64"/>1. It leads us on to an <hi>affectionate Thankfulness</hi> and <hi>joyful Praise,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> great Qualification, in a strain which truly to me is most transporting. For thus it helps us to give Thanks <hi>before</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. <hi>It is very meet, right, and our bounden Duty, that we should at all Times, and in all Places, give Thanks unto thee, O Lord, Holy Father, Almighty, Everlasting God: Therefore with Angels, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, and all the Company of Heaven, we laud and magnifie thy Glorious Name, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more praising thee, and saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts, Heaven and Earth are full of thy Glory: Glory be to thee, O Lord most High.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. It leads us also to <hi>resign up our selves,</hi> both Souls and Bodies, <hi>to his Service,</hi> in the Prayer immediately <hi>after</hi> receiving in these words.</p>

                     </p>

                        <hi>Ye that do truly and earnestly Repent you of your Sins, and intend to lead a new Life, following the Commandments of God, and walking from henceforth in his Holy Ways; draw near with Faith, and take this Holy Sacrament to your Comfort, and make your

                        <hi>Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness, which we from time to time most grievously have committed, by Thought, Word, and Deed, against thy Divine Majesty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We do earnestly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and are heartily sorry for these our mis-doings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And to prepare us for this profession of Repentance in <hi>this place</hi> of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I think it very adviseable to take what time there is, whilst the Bread and Wine are in preparing before the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the <hi>Office,</hi> to recollect our <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Sins which we are most liable to incur, and at <hi>every one</hi> of them to make God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and six Resolutions of amending them in our own minds; after which we may the better say in <hi>General</hi> we <hi>Repent</hi> of them, and will no more Commit them, and thereupon beg <hi>Pardon</hi> for them, and receive <hi>Absolution,</hi> as it is in this part of the <hi>Service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. And lastly, it leads us to act <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to all men, when in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation before</hi> receiving, it tells us we must <hi>be in perfect Charity with all Men</hi>; and in the <hi>invitation,</hi> calls such as <hi>are in Love and Charity with all their Neighbours</hi>: at
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52843:66"/>
which words our hearts may strike in with it, and earnestly profess they at <hi>present</hi> are, and are fully resolv'd at all times <hi>after</hi> so to be.</p>
                     <p>Thus doth the <hi>Church</hi> it self in our <hi>Publick Service,</hi> go before us, and lead us on in these great Duties of <hi>joyful Praise</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> of <hi>Resignation of our selves,</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faithful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses</hi> and <hi>promises of Obedience,</hi> and of <hi>Charity to all Persons,</hi> which are to render us welcome Guests, and worthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants. Nay, it doth not only call us to, and bear us Company in these <hi>chief Duties,</hi> wherein above all consists a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers worthiness</hi>: but also in <hi>most others</hi> mentioned above, so that scarce any Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is requir'd in us at this Feast, but, if our Hearts go along with it, it puts in act, and makes a place for it.</p>
                     <p>It exercises our <hi>humble sense of our own unworthiness</hi> in the Prayer <hi>before Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in these words. <hi>We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord, trusting in our own Righteousness, but in thy manifold and great Mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the Crumbs under thy Table.</hi> And so again in the Prayer <hi>after receiving</hi> in these. <hi>Though we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, through our manifold sins, to offer up unto thee any Sacrifice; yet humbly we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52843:66"/>
thee accept this our bounden Duty and Service; not weighing our Merits, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning our Offences, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It exercises our <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>abhorrence of our Sins,</hi> which caused Christs Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the <hi>Confession of Repentance</hi> in these. <hi>The remembrance of our mis-doings is grievous unto us, the burden of them is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it exercises our <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and <hi>Honour to Christ,</hi> either in <hi>words</hi> that <hi>express</hi> it, or in <hi>things</hi> that <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> it, being <hi>real</hi> proofs and effects of it, in every thing that is done through the whole Service.</p>
                     <p>If every Receiver therefore that <hi>has</hi> these Tempers, doth but <hi>go along heartily</hi> and <hi>affectionately</hi> with the <hi>Churches Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and joyn with the <hi>Minister</hi> and the <hi>Congregation</hi> in the <hi>Communion Service</hi>; he acts them over as he ought, and doth Honour to his Saviour, and is a worthy Communicant. He shews all those qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications which God has required, and receives as a worthy Guest, if he can do nothing more than go along, and strike in heartily at every part of the <hi>Publick Worship.</hi> Which I speak, not for the ease of those who, either by their <hi>own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> or the <hi>help of Books,</hi> can set their
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52843:67"/>
own Minds on work, and employ their own Thoughts in meditating and acting over all these Tempers, whilst the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is distributing the Sacrament: I speak it not, I say, for the ease of these Persons, as if, beside what they do in the Churches Prayers, they should not more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over do what they can otherwise. But for the sake of others, who have not these abilities, that they may not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; and to let them know, that, if they are good men, and <hi>have</hi> these Tempers, there is <hi>exercise</hi> of them suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the <hi>Publick Prayers,</hi> were there nothing else from the help of <hi>Books,</hi> or their own <hi>invention,</hi> to make them <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus we see wherein lies the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of receiving,</hi> and what Virtues are fit for him to exercise, who would be a welcome Guest at the <hi>Holy Communion.</hi> When he <hi>remembers the Death of Christ,</hi> and <hi>confirms the New Covenant with God,</hi> and a <hi>League of Love and Friendship with all the Christian World,</hi> by <hi>eating Bread,</hi> and <hi>drinking Wine</hi> according to Christs appointment; he must exercise himself in <hi>joyful Praise,</hi> and <hi>affectionate Thanks,</hi> and <hi>Resignation of his whole man,</hi> both Soul and Body, <hi>to Christs Service,</hi> and in <hi>Repentance of all his Sins,</hi> making God faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52843:67"/>
of New Obedience, and in <hi>Charity towards all Persons</hi>: all which he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press in joyning heartily with the <hi>Churches Prayers,</hi> besides what he doth, whilst the Bread and Wine are in preparing, or whilst others are Communicating, in his <hi>own Meditations.</hi> And if he believes these things, and is carryed on by such belief to these Performances; he is welcome to the Table of his Lord, and may justly esteem himself a worthy Partaker of this Blessed Sacrament.</p>

                        <head>The Contents.</head>
                        <p>To silence the Complaint of extraordinary difficulty in coming worthily to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, three things noted. <hi>1.</hi> All the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of worthy Receiving, are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parts of Duty, and of a good Man; so that no more is required to fit us for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, than is required to fit us to dye, or to go to Heaven. <hi>2.</hi> They are all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Qualifications of an acceptable Prayer, Vow, or Thanksgiving; so that no more is required to it, than to a worthy discharge of all other Acts of Religion. <hi>3.</hi> However they may be commended, yet are they not necessarily required in more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense, and transporting degrees in it, than in other instances of Devotion. The only unworthiness, which can put us by this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, is Impenitence: if Repentance will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

need stick with him. This Point of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicating summ'd up.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving hitherto shewn wherein lies the <hi>worthiness of receiving,</hi> and what those Qualifications are which fit us for this Holy Feast: I shall now only note some things that <hi>may silence all good mens Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints about the hardship of it,</hi> and <hi>shew plainly who are unworthy to join in it,</hi> and <hi>what they must do to fit and prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for it,</hi> and so conclude this Point.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> I shall Note some things that <hi>may reconcile all good minds to this Feast,</hi> and <hi>silence their Complaints of the hardship, and extraordinary difficulty of coming worthily to partake in it.</hi> And this had need to be done, and may prove of great use when once it is; because one <hi>chief</hi> thing, which causes even <hi>good People</hi> to come so <hi>seldome,</hi> is the <hi>apprehended difficulty,</hi> and <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> solemnity</hi> of the <hi>worthy receiving.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to satisfy all good Souls in this point, and to remove these hard though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s of it, I would suggest to them these <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1st, That <hi>all these Tempers, which are required to a worthy Communion, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary parts of Duty, and of a good Man; so that no more is required of us to sit our selves for receiving, than is required to fit us to dye, or to go to Heaven.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> That <hi>however they may be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet are they not necessarily required, as some have imagined, in more intense and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sporting degrees in it, than in other instances of Devotion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> I say <hi>all the Tempers,</hi> which I have mentioned as <hi>necessary to a worthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> are <hi>necessary parts of Duty, and of a good Man; so that no more is required of us to sit our selves for a worthy receiving, than is required to sit us to Dye, or to go to Heaven.</hi>

                        <hi>Charity</hi> with all the world. All these are Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties indispensably required by the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> as appears by the places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to in the <hi>Margine</hi>; they are no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, but absolutely necessary in every <hi>Christian,</hi> who would secure his Peace with God, and be sure at last to go to Heaven. And they, as we have seen, are the very things, which the Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Communicating consists of. So so that to be <hi>personally worthy</hi> for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is <hi>nothing more,</hi> than to be an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52843:70"/>
Good and Religious man</hi>: To have all those Virtues which constitute a <hi>Saint,</hi> and are necessary parts of that Obedience and Holy Living, which must get us all an <hi>Interest in Christ,</hi> and secure our <hi>Title</hi> to Salvation. And therefore if any man is contented with those Duties, which God exacts of him to make him a good Man; he has no cause to complain of those, which are necessary to a worthy Receiving. And if he doth repine at them, and refrain from the Lords Table, because he will not be at the pains to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them; 'tis plain that 'tis not the <hi>hardship of the Sacrament,</hi> but of an <hi>Holy Life</hi> that he is disturbed at; and the same difficulties that drive him from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> if he understand himself, must drive him also out of his <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>way to Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, <hi>These Duties,</hi> that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a <hi>Worthy Receiving,</hi> are required also to <hi>every Worthy Prayer, Vow,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi>; so that <hi>no more Duties are required to our worthiness in it, than to our worthiness in all other Acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

1 Cor. 11.29. So is it said of the <hi>Vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, i. e.</hi> of the <hi>wicked Petitioner</hi> too, that <hi>he who turns away his Ear from hearing the Law,</hi> even <hi>his Prayer shall be an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Prov. 28.9. and 15.8.</p>
                     <p>Thus is every man, that is <hi>Vnworthy to receive the Sacrament, Vnworthy</hi> also to <hi>pray to God,</hi> the same things being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to both of them: an <hi>Impenitent ill man,</hi> being utterly unfit for <hi>both,</hi> but a truly <hi>Penitent Good Man,</hi> being such as he accounts <hi>worthy,</hi> and most affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invites to them.</p>
                     <p>Nay he is not only unworthy to <hi>pray to God,</hi> but also whilst that <hi>impenitence</hi> lasts, to <hi>give him Thanks,</hi> to <hi>make Vows,</hi> to <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him,</hi> or to have any Entercourse and Communication in any <hi>other</hi> actions of <hi>Religion.</hi> If he tells God he is <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for his Mercies, whilst in the constant course of his Life he disobeys him; his Actions plainly give the Lye to his Words, and proclaim him a most <hi>Vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Person. If he <hi>makes him Vows</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> and <hi>Covenants to Repent of all his Sins,</hi> whilst he still <hi>lives Impenitent,</hi> and goes on in them; he only speaks him fair, intending no such thing, and therefore doth nothing else but <hi>abuse</hi> and <hi>provoke</hi> him. He doth nothing that Honours God as it should, so long as he is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52843:71"/>
man, nor must hope in any Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Religious Performances to be own'd and accepted by him. For God will have nothing to do with ill men in any way, whilst they continue impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in their sins; Christ has purchased no Reconciliation for such, nor will he, till they change that course, have any Friendship for, or take any Complacence in them. He will hear the Prayers, and accept the Thanks, and trust the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Engagement of those only, who are fully resolv'd to amend their Lives, and become Good men; so that if any man persists impenitent, which unfits him for receiving, he is also unfit for every thing else, and unworthy to perform any other Actions of Religion.</p>
                     <p>As for this business of <hi>worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi> then, there is no more cause of Complaint against <hi>it,</hi> for the <hi>difficulty</hi> and <hi>hardship</hi> of it, than there is against <hi>all Religion.</hi> The same Duties that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a worthy Receiving, are no less required to make any of us a Good man, to confer a Right to Heaven, to a worthy Prayer, Promise, or Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that if any Man will not come to the Sacrament, because he is wicked, and will not be at the pains to attain those Vertues which are necessary to a worthy
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52843:72"/>
Communion: if he understand himself, he must for the same reason keep back from Prayer, and Praises, and all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Religion. For unless he will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after these Duties, and perform them, he is unmeet to come to God, and is very unworthy in all of them. And therefore so long as he is <hi>unfit for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> he is <hi>unfit for every thing else,</hi> and, if he resolves to continue so, may as well resolve to renounce his <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the whole <hi>Christian Profession.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as these Tempers, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a worthy Communion, are no more than is required in every Good man, in every worthy Prayer, Praise, or other act of Religion: So is it to be observed,</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> That however they may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, yet are they not necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as some have imagined, in more intense and transporting Degrees in it, than in other instances of Devotion.</p>
                     <p>That which has deterr'd good People from the Sacrament, more than any thing besides, is <hi>their too awful Sense and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it,</hi> and <hi>placing it at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from other parts of Worship.</hi> They think no Virtues are worthy of it, but what are expressed in <hi>Ecstasie</hi> and <hi>Transport</hi>; and that when it requires the same Duties with other parts of Gods Service, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52843:72"/>
them in <hi>much greater Perfection,</hi> and <hi>far higher Measures.</hi> So that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they may be worthy to Pray, and Praise God, though they are unworthy to Communicate; and therefore they joyn in <hi>them</hi> ordinarily as there is occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, when, through the excess of Reverence, they scarce ever joyn in <hi>this</hi> at all.</p>
                     <p>But this is a great Mistake, which, though it be well meant, has a very ill effect, and affrights good Souls from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this Duty and Service, and paying this Honour to their Saviour, when they have no cause to be afraid of it. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be <hi>commendable</hi> and <hi>desirable</hi> when it can be had; yet is it not <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> that so it should be.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>very Commendable,</hi> I say, <hi>and much to be Desired, that we should exercise these Tempers in a higher Degree in this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, than in other Parts of Worship.</hi> It will be very well if our <hi>Prayers</hi> are more <hi>fervent,</hi> and our <hi>Praises</hi> more <hi>affectionate,</hi> and <hi>all the Virtues</hi> we have place to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, more <hi>full</hi> and <hi>flagrant then,</hi> than at <hi>other</hi> times.

and Contemplations on it. And that is the Consideration which gives greatest Force, and adds most Strength to all our Duties; so that when we have <hi>most</hi> of it, as we must have when we come for that very intent, it very well becomes us for the Honour of it to excell in them. And upon this account it will be very Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and much to be Desired, that we should be more vigorous in all our Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues at <hi>this,</hi> than at any <hi>other</hi> Ordinance.</p>
                     <p>But although this <hi>be Commendable,</hi> and <hi>much to be Desired in us</hi>; yet is it not <hi>necessary,</hi> or <hi>indispensably required of us, but that we may Communicate worthily when 'tis otherwise.</hi> For if we have these Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in <hi>such a Degree,</hi> as is <hi>necessary to our Eternal Happiness</hi>; we have so much of them as will render us worthy and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Guests at <hi>this,</hi> as well as at <hi>every other</hi> Ordinance.</p>
                     <p>And this is plain from hence, because when we have them in a <hi>saving Degree,</hi> which would procure our acceptance in other parts of Gods Service; they sit us for the Communion of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Glorified Saints in Heaven</hi>; and so cannot leave us unworthy to Communicate with <hi>him</hi> and <hi>them</hi> here on <hi>Earth.</hi> If we <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly repent us of all our Sins,</hi> and are <hi>saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thankful for all Christs Mercies,</hi> and are <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52843:73"/>
in Charity with all our Neighbours,</hi> and have a <hi>saving Faith in Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>; whether these Vertues be the pitch of the <hi>Strong,</hi> or only of the <hi>Weak in Faith,</hi> we are accepted with him, since he accepts both. And when once he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts us, we may approach to him in any Place; when he allows of the measure of our Graces, we may be welcome to shew them forth, and offer a Sacrifice of a sweet smell, when we send them up to him in <hi>any,</hi> or in <hi>all</hi> the Parts of his Worship and Service.</p>
                     <p>Let a man come then to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it be without any thing of <hi>extraordinary</hi> and unwonted Transports, and only in that <hi>ordinary</hi> exercise of these Virtues, which gains him accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in <hi>Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Praise,</hi> or <hi>other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Actions</hi>; and then let him not doubt, but that, although more were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet is this good, and will render him a worthy Partaker of the Lords Supper.</p>
                     <p>And this we have great cause to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Ancient</hi> Christians thought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they made it not an <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>separate thing,</hi> as we do now, but an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> and <hi>constant part of the Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> It went usually along with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts of the Service, and they that came to <hi>Prayers,</hi> came also to the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>;

Thus in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, they met to <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,</hi> as they met to pray <hi>every Day</hi>; and <hi>breaking Bread,</hi> was no less constant a part, than <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi> of their <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Fellowship.</hi> All <hi>the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> says St. <hi>Luke, continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</hi> Act. 2.42.

                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:52843:75"/>And thus we see, however Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it may be, that People come to this Holy Sacrament with more Intense Acts, and higher Preparation, than would serve to any other parts of Worship; yet is it not necessary they should do it. They may be welcome and worthy Partakers in this Ordinance, who are worthy to partake in others; so that they are fit for it, who are fit for any other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Service. The <hi>same Virtues,</hi> and the <hi>same Degrees</hi> suffice to it. For they fit them to Communicate <hi>with Christ</hi> and <hi>Glorified Saints in Heaven,</hi> and so must needs fit them to Communicate with him, and <hi>them</hi> here <hi>on Earth.</hi> They fitted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians for it in the <hi>Apostles times,</hi> when the <hi>Eucharist</hi> was no <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate,</hi> but an <hi>ordinary constant part</hi> of the <hi>Christian Worship.</hi> For then not only they whose Virtues were most <hi>high</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> but <hi>all the Faithful</hi> were call'd upon to Communicate, and they who were judg'd fit to meet at the Prayers and other Services, were thought worthy to meet at the Lords Table too; and since they fitted <hi>them</hi> for it in those Days, it cannot be thought but that they must needs fit us in ours also.</p>
                     <p>As for those then who have been wont
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52843:75"/>
to think more hardly of the Sacrament than of other parts of Worship, and, how frequent soever they were in them, to come but seldome unto it, by reason of the apprehended difficulty in a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy partaking of it: If they duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these <hi>three</hi> things, they will see cause to change their mind, and forbear to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain any more against it. For <hi>the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that are required of us in a worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, are all necessary parts of Duty, and of a Good Man</hi>; and <hi>are as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a worthy Prayer, Vow, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and every other act of Religion</hi>; and <hi>are not necessarily required in more intense and transporting Degrees in it, than in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Devotion.</hi> So that no Good man has any cause at all to repine at it, or abstain from it; it lies hard upon, and can be blamed by none but those, who, for the same Reason, must blame every other Ordinance and part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, which requires as much of a worthy Worshipper as this; and who, at the same Rate, as they cast off it, must renounce their Christianity, and throw aside all Religion too.</p>
                     <p>And thus having noted some things, that may help to reconcile all Good minds to this Blessed Sacrament, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Complaints of hardship in a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52843:76"/>
worthy receiving it: I shall proceed now</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> To <hi>shew plainly who are unworthy of it,</hi> and <hi>what they must do to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselves for it,</hi> and so conclude <hi>this Point.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now these, in one word, are <hi>all that are impenitent, that have committed any Damning Fault; and are not fully set and purposed to amend it.</hi> For all the Virtues of worthy Receiving, as we have seen, are necessary parts of Duty, and of a Good man; so that if any Person would <hi>Repent</hi> of all his breaches of them, and take care thenceforward to endow his Soul with them, he would be worthy to be entertained at this Feast, and fit to be bidden welcome. Besides, if <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>forsaking all his Sins</hi> will go down with him, there is no man who pretends to Religion, but may perform every thing else, which is required to this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For there would be no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in <hi>paying Christ Honour</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,</hi> and <hi>following him with Love</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> and <hi>resigning our selves up to his use,</hi> and <hi>abhorring of our Sins,</hi> if <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> were not annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; men could <hi>Love Christ hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,</hi> and <hi>Thank him freely,</hi> and <hi>Honour him abundantly,</hi> and <hi>resign themselves up to him wholly,</hi> and <hi>Believe in him chearfully,</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:52843:76"/>
if he would not peremptorily require them to <hi>amend their ways,</hi> and <hi>forsake their sins,</hi> which are the things they place their chiefest Pleasure and Delight in: So that if any man will not fit himself for Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it is not for the difficulty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duties, as if he could not brook them, but only for the difficulty of Repentance, so that <hi>Impenitence</hi> is truly at the bottom. He will not <hi>satisfie those who have suffered by him,</hi> or <hi>forgive those who have injured him,</hi> or be at <hi>Peace and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with all Men,</hi> or <hi>renounce that Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Lasciviousness, Drunkenness,</hi> or <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known sin,</hi> which, in confirming the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> he must <hi>promise God he will depart from</hi>: It is because his Heart sticks to some of <hi>these,</hi> or some <hi>other</hi> such like Transgressions, and will not go off from them, that he is an unfit and unworthy man; whereas, were it not for this, he could do all things else that are required of him.</p>
                     <p>He therefore, that is unworthy to Communicate, and unfit to receive the Sacrament, is plainly one that is <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi>; that is guilty of some Damning Sin, and is not resolv'd to leave, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends still to continue in it. He is either a <hi>careless man,</hi> that lives at large in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course of <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Worldliness,</hi> being wholly given to <hi>heap up Wealth,</hi> or
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52843:77"/>
                        <hi>aim at Honour,</hi> or <hi>follow Pleasure without Conviction,</hi> or making any pretence to serious Religion: Or, if he seems to look towards God, and is careful in <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> things to please him, he serves him not in <hi>all</hi> points as he ought, but allows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in <hi>some known Sin,</hi> continuing unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in <hi>common Swearing, Drunkenness, Vncleanness, Malice, Contentiousness, Fraud, Oppression, Slander, Censoriousness, Evil-speaking,</hi> or some other Damning Crime, which he will not be at the pains to leave for Christs sake, or for any thing that he either <hi>has,</hi> or <hi>would do</hi> for him.</p>
                     <p>Now if any of those, who read this Treatise, are such as these, and I put the matter to their <hi>own Consciences</hi>; I confess they are not worthy to come to the Sacrament till they turn away from such a known Fault, and Repent of it, and would sin against this Holy Feast and their own Souls if they should do it. But then I must tell them withall, that as they are not fit to come to this Ordinance, so, whilst they continue in that Estate, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they fit to come to any other, or to any thing else that looks towards God, and their own Eternal Happiness. For so long as they thus espouse <hi>any Number,</hi> or <hi>any one Sin</hi> against God, and daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it when they have a Temptation to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52843:77"/>
it, notwithstanding their own Hearts are sensible he has forbid it, or at least would have been sensible of it, unless they had been willfully blinded, or by long use harden'd in it: So long, I say, as they are thus <hi>Impenitent in any known Sin,</hi> they are not only <hi>unfit to come to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> but also as <hi>unfit to Dye,</hi> or <hi>to go to Heaven, to Pray to God, to utter Praise,</hi> to <hi>make Vows,</hi> or <hi>to joyn in any other actions of Religion.</hi> For an <hi>Impenitent</hi> man, whilst he continues such, is Gods <hi>Profest Enemy,</hi> and is welcome to him at no time but when he <hi>Repents</hi>; so that till that is done, he is acceptable in no Service which he pays him.</p>
                     <p>This then is the danger of their State, who lye Impenitent in <hi>many,</hi> or in <hi>few</hi> known Sins: they are unworthy indeed to receive the Communion; but they are equally unworthy to joyn in Prayers, to give Thanks, or make Vows, or dye in Peace, or hope for Happiness, or do any thing else that shews them to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                     <p>And if any mans Conscience tells him this is <hi>his State</hi>; his way is not to think there is no harm, if he doth but <hi>abstain from the Communion</hi>; for, as I say, he is as unworthy in his Prayers, and Praises, and every thing else that belongs to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:

but <hi>forthwith to Repent,</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that Fault</hi> which shuts him out from the Sacrament, and every thing else that looks towards Heaven, that so he may be a worthy and welcome Guest in <hi>it,</hi> and all of them. This Repentance will restore him to the Favour of God, and gain him acceptance with him; and then he is fit for this, and for every other part of Gods Worship, and may worthily joyn in them.</p>
                     <p>And by this it appears who is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this Feast, and what he must do to fit and prepare himself for it. Every man that is Impenitent, is an Unworthy Communicant; but if he will Repent and Amend his ways, he will find no difficulty in other Duties which make up a Believers worthiness, but may then be a worthy and welcome Guest whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he has a mind to come to it.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>Second</hi> thing I proposed, namely to shew <hi>wherein lies the worthiness of Eating and Drinking at this Feast</hi>; which I have stayed the longer upon, because both the <hi>irreverent approach</hi> of some men to it, and the <hi>scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous abstaining</hi> of others from it, do both take rise from this head, so that it well deserves to be carefully Explained and clearly Stated. And the Result of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52843:78"/>
all that I have said upon this Point is this:</p>
                     <p>When we come to <hi>Eat Bread</hi> and <hi>Drink Wine</hi> at the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> in <hi>remembrance that Christ dyed for us,</hi> and in <hi>Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the New Covenant which his Death procured us,</hi> and in <hi>Ratification of a League of Love and Friendship with all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi>; we must be careful <hi>devoutly</hi> to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,</hi> and Act over <hi>these Tempers.</hi> We must <hi>remember our Dying Lord,</hi> with <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>Resignation of our selves,</hi> both Souls and Bodies <hi>to his Service,</hi> and <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sense of our own unworthiness,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of our Sins</hi> which caused his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. We must <hi>confirm the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> which his Death purchased, in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting heartily to the Terms of it, Repenting of all our Sins,</hi> and <hi>Faithfully promising that intire Obedience</hi> which is required in it, and then <hi>Believing</hi> that for <hi>Christs sake</hi> we shall be <hi>saved</hi> by it. And we must <hi>Confirm a League of Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship with all the Christian World,</hi> in laying aside all <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Hatred,</hi> and <hi>forgiving those that have injured us,</hi> and making <hi>just amends to those who have been wronged by us,</hi> and <hi>giving Alms</hi> as our Ability and our Brethrens ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity requires, and so being in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Perfect Charity with all Persons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we are able to grasp so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52843:79"/>
in our minds, and to act them all over duly, and as we ought, at this Exercise; it may be fit to Solemnize this Feast in <hi>all these</hi> instances of Virtue. But if either our minds would be lost and burdened, or our Devotions enfeebled by the <hi>Number</hi> of these particulars; 'twill yet be fit at least to express our selves <hi>Joyfully</hi> and <hi>affectionately Thankful for his kindness,</hi> especially in <hi>Dying for us,</hi> and <hi>Resign up our selves</hi> both Souls and Bodies <hi>to his Service,</hi> and <hi>Repent of all our Sins,</hi> making him Faithful Promises that we will amend all our Faults, particularly those which oftest win upon us, and shew our selves in <hi>perfect Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity with all Persons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All these, whilst the Bread and Wine are in preparing, or whilst others are Communicating, they who have <hi>Books</hi> to suggest Thoughts, or are able to supply them out of their <hi>own minds,</hi> may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise by themselves. And they who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, as also they who can, may exercise them in joyning fervently with the <hi>Churches Prayers,</hi> all these Duties, as we have seen, being so well led on and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the <hi>Communion Service.</hi> Wherein, because there will be some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption whilst others are Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that that time may not lye idle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52843:79"/>
their hands, I think it very advisea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to joyn heartily in the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is made at the offering of the Bread and Wine to their Brethren, (as they will be sure to do when it comes to their own turn) if their Devout Zeal is not otherwise taken up by the <hi>Psalm,</hi> which, at their <hi>Pastors</hi> Discretion, is wont to be Sung at that time for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those who have done Receiving.</p>
                     <p>These Virtues being in us, and, at the time of Receiving, being thus exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by us, both in our <hi>own private,</hi> or at least in our <hi>Devout Concurrence with the Churches Prayers,</hi> make a <hi>worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this no man who pretends to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ought to <hi>Complain</hi> of, or think an hard Imposition. For all <hi>these Duties,</hi> which are necessary to a <hi>worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> are as necessary to make every one of us a <hi>Good man,</hi> or <hi>fit to Dye,</hi> or to <hi>go to Heaven</hi>; they are as necessary to a <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Prayer, Thanksgiving, Vow,</hi> or <hi>any other Act of true Religion</hi>; and are <hi>not necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required in more intense Degrees</hi> and <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sporting Measures in this, than in other parts of Worship and Devotion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These things then are necessary to a worthy Receiving, and no Good man can complain that they are so, since they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52843:80"/>
are equally necessary to all acceptable Goodness, to all comfortable Hopes, and to every other Ordinance, to all the parts of Worship and Religion, and to Gods being pleased with us in every thing that is either the <hi>Duty,</hi> or <hi>Priviledge</hi> of a Christian.</p>
                     <p>And as the <hi>Presence,</hi> and <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>these</hi> Virtues makes us worthy of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; so doth the <hi>absence</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> but especially of <hi>Repentance</hi> of all our known Sins, (which is the thing, if any, that will be wanting, and which is the cause why others are, Impenitence, as we saw, being at the bottom of all Unworthiness) make us <hi>unworthy</hi> and most <hi>unwelcome.</hi> If we continue Impenitent in <hi>many,</hi> or in <hi>any one known Sin,</hi> we are indeed unworthy to Communicate; but then withall we are as unworthy to be thought Good men, to go to Heaven, to say our Prayers, to make Vows, or to have any Dealings with God in any other Actions of Religion. And the way for any Wise man in that Case, is not to take up with abstaining from the Communion, for he ought as much to abstain from Prayer, and Praise, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other Office of a Christian, God being pleased with him in none of them; but forthwith to Repent and Abandon such ill Course, that so he may be a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52843:80"/>
Guest, and worthy to partake of them.</p>
                     <p>And thus having endeavoured to give some help to all those who desire <hi>worthily to Communicate,</hi> by shewing <hi>what is the meaning of Eating Bread and Drinking Wine in the Blessed Sacrament,</hi> and <hi>wherein lies the worthiness of doing it</hi>: I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now in the third Place <hi>to exhort and press men on to it,</hi> by shewing them <hi>how much it is every good Christians Duty to frequent it,</hi> and <hi>how great the Benefits are that come by it, which should make them seek to it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were it not commanded,</hi> of which in the next Part.</p>

                        <p>To Communicate is a Duty incumbent on us, as appears, <hi>1.</hi> From the obliging import of the Command about it. This Command of Christ shewn, and several Notes added, which greatly recommend and enforce it. <hi>viz.</hi> It is such an Instance, as best shews our peculiar Reverence and Love to him; the whole yoke of <hi>Jewish</hi> Ceremonies is taken away, and only it, and Baptism, two cheap and easie Rites, imposed instead of them; it was his last Command, he gave it the Night before he suffered; in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Commission to Preach the Gospel,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52843:81"/>

This Duty obliges those only who are of Age for it, and them too only at such times as they have an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and a fit Occasion offered. An Objection against its being a Duty from <hi>1 Cor. 11.25,</hi> answered. The Neglect of it is a great Sin. This God may excuse in thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he will not excuse it in them when
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52843:82"/>
they are better inform'd; and much less in others, who neglect it because they are careless of it, or too Wicked and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to receive it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE worthy receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I have hitherto De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, is no <hi>Indifferent thing,</hi> which may either be <hi>done,</hi> or <hi>let alone</hi> according to Discretion; but an <hi>indispensable Duty,</hi> wherein God has straitly bound, and which he has peremptorily required of every <hi>grown Christian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this will appear these <hi>two</hi> ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> From the <hi>Expressness, and Obliging import of the Command about it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, From the <hi>Obliging Nature of those things which are meant by it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> That every Christian ought to frequent the Holy Sacrament, and come to it when he is call'd and an opportunity is offered, appears from the <hi>expressness, and obliging import of the Command about it.</hi> For our Blessed <hi>Lord</hi> has given us his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> for it, and that with such <hi>particular Notes</hi> and <hi>Circumstances,</hi> as shews he lays a great weight upon it, which must needs oblige all, that have any regard to him, to frequent it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He has given us,</hi> I say, <hi>his express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it.</hi> For thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52843:82"/>
                        <hi>he injoined,</hi> when he ordained this <hi>Feast. He took Bread,</hi> says he, <hi>and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you; this DO in Remembrance of me.</hi> And <hi>after the same manner he took the Cup, saying, This Cup is the New Testament in my Blood; this DO ye, as often as you Drink it, in remembrance of me.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.24, 25. And if we had nothing more than this plain Command for it, it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make every man, who would please God and go to Heaven, to come to it when he is invited. For <hi>then ye are my Friends,</hi> says Christ, when <hi>ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I Command you.</hi> Joh. 15.14. And <hi>he that shall break the least of my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and shall teach men so, shall be least in the Kingdom of Heaven: i. e.</hi> he sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l not enter, or have any share at all there. Mat. 5.19.</p>
                     <p>But besides this <hi>express Command</hi> which he has given for it, we have <hi>other Notes</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> added, which greatly recommend it, and shew that he lays a particular weight upon it. For it is a thing, which is <hi>to be done purely upon his account, and has only our Love of him to enforce it</hi>; so that if we have any <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Reverence for him,</hi> this is the best way to shew it: <hi>it, and Baptism, are the only
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52843:83"/>
positive Commands he has given us, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the Numerous, and Expensive</hi> Jewish <hi>Ceremonies</hi>; so that in all <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness</hi> for so great a Benefit we ought to observe it: <hi>it was his Dying and last Command, he gave it the very Night before he Suffered; it was thought by him a Command so material, that in St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Commission to Preach the Gospel it was not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but particularly specified</hi>: And lastly, it is a Command which, as the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> plainly intimates, <hi>without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to our selves cannot either be unworthily kept, or neglected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> It is a thing which is <hi>to be done purely upon his account, having no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son but his Command to bind and enforce it</hi>; so that if we have any <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for him,</hi> this is the <hi>best way</hi> to shew it. As for the Duties of <hi>Humility, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Justice, Faithfulness, Gratitude, Charity, Peace, Prayers to God,</hi> and the like: Though Christ has told us of them, and expresly <hi>injoyn'd them,</hi> as well as <hi>this</hi>; yet is not he alone in that, but they were sufficiently proclaimed before he came, to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and to the <hi>Gentile World by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conscience.</hi> In declaring <hi>them,</hi> he had an open way made for him, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of all men ready to strike in with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52843:83"/>
him, which, among all good Minds, would much facilitate their Reception. But in <hi>this</hi> Command, he stands alone; for <hi>Natural Reason</hi> knows nothing of it, nor will the Conscience of any man, but a <hi>Christian,</hi> oblige him to it: So that here we have no Light but his Word, no Motive but our Obedience to him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade it; and therefore if we do it at all, must be purely for his sake, without any other Inducement.</p>
                     <p>And this is a strong Bond upon all that <hi>Love their Lord,</hi> and have any <hi>peculiarity of Respect for him,</hi> to observe it. It is the true Cause and Reason, indeed, why some neglect it, who, because their own Conscience doth not startle at it, and check them so severely for absenting from this Feast, as for Drunkenness, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Lyes, Cheating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have not only <hi>Christs Laws,</hi> but <hi>Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> also to exclaim against them, go on securely in their contempt of it. And if men have no Love for their Lord, no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Regard for any thing because he has injoyn'd it, or are not duly inform'd of his Command about it, thus it will be. But if any that see he has made it their Duty, have any peculiar Love, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him; they will greedily embrace this as the best Opportunity of shewing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52843:84"/>
their Affection to his Service, since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they can be sway'd by nothing else, and most readily Communicate, when he calls them so to do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, <hi>It and Baptism,</hi> those two <hi>cheap</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> Things, <hi>are the only positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands he has laid upon us, when he took off the heavy yoke of the Numerous, Expensive, and Laborious</hi> Jewish <hi>Precepts</hi>; so that out of <hi>Natural Equity,</hi> and to shew our <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for such a gainful Exchange,</hi> we ought most readily to observe it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were loaded with a <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Troublesome</hi> and <hi>Expensive Rites,</hi> which had no Goodness discernable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor any thing, but the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by <hi>Moses,</hi> to recommend them to their <hi>Consciences</hi>: Such as the <note n="†" place="margin">Lev. 11.7.</note> 
                        <hi>forbearing Swine,</hi> and <hi>several sorts of Flesh</hi>; the <hi>washing of their Bodies upon their</hi>

                        <hi>Corporal Vncleannesses</hi>; the <hi>bringing Offerings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice of Fed Beasts at return of Thanks,</hi> and for <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation upon any Offences</hi>; and many other cumbersome and costly Rites, which the Apostle calls <hi>the Law of Carnal Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Heb. 7.16. and 9.10, and <hi>weak and beggerly Elements,</hi> Gal. 4.9, which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52843:84"/>
were given them, not because the things deserv'd it, but only that they might be kept imploy'd, as useless Exercises are to Children to hinder them from more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Work; and so were suited only to the <hi>Infancy,</hi> and <hi>Non-age of the World,</hi> Gal. 4.3.</p>
                     <p>But from all this <hi>Burden of Ceremonies, under</hi> which, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, <hi>they</hi> and <hi>their Fathers groaned</hi> and <hi>were oppressed,</hi> Act. 15.10. by the coming of <hi>Christ</hi> we are most graciously delivered. For <hi>he has abolish'd in his Flesh, i. e.</hi> by his Death, wherein he gave his Body for us, <hi>the Law of Commandments contain'd in Ordinances,</hi> Eph. 2.15. He has <hi>blotted out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us,</hi> (hedging in the Church within the <hi>Jews,</hi> and excluding all us <hi>Gentiles) and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Cross,</hi> Col. 2.14.

And if any man has but <hi>Common Ingenuity,</hi> and will return <hi>Equitably</hi> for what is done, and much more if he has any <hi>grateful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments</hi> for so valuable an Exemption, he must needs submit with all Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

Cost he has been at for us, left this as his <hi>last Will,</hi> and both <hi>intreated</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd</hi> at parting, that we should eat and drink in Remembrance of him; if we have <hi>any shame</hi> we <hi>cannot,</hi> and if we <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess any Duty</hi> we <hi>dare not,</hi> and if we have <hi>any Love for him</hi> we <hi>will not</hi> neglect it, but come to it out of mindfulness of our <hi>gone Friend</hi> and <hi>Departed Lord,</hi> as oft as we shall have opportunity so to do.</p>
                     <p n="4">4<hi>ly,</hi> It was thought by Christ a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand so <hi>material,</hi> that <hi>when St.</hi> Paul <hi>received his Commission to Preach the Gospel, it was by name inserted, and particularly specified</hi>; and this <hi>special Designation</hi> of it shews that he was more than <hi>ordinarily</hi> concerned for it. <hi>I have received of the Lord,</hi> says he, or by his Revelation, when I was call'd by him, <hi>that which I also delivered unto you,</hi> as from him, namely, <hi>that the same night he was betrayed, he took Bread, and said, Take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23, 24.</p>
                     <p n="5">5<hi>ly,</hi> It is a <hi>Command,</hi> which, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> plainly intimates, <hi>without great danger to our selves cannot either be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily kept, or neglected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Without very <hi>great</hi> and <hi>apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to our selves,</hi> we cannot <hi>come Vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Sacrament. For he that eats and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52843:86"/>
drinks unworthily,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, eats and drinks Damnation to himself,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>without a like danger we cannot neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or keep back from it. Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you.</hi> Joh. 6.53. This the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> as is well known, understood generally of <hi>eating his Flesh in the Holy Sacrament</hi>; which is the great Reason they give for that Practice so common among them, namely, why <hi>Infants are to be Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> And of this there is great cause to understand it. For 'tis hard to think of any thing, that can support such <hi>full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as eating of his Body,</hi> and <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Blood</hi>; besides <hi>eating Bread,</hi> and <hi>drinking Wine in the Sacrament,</hi> which he calls <hi>his Body</hi> and <hi>his Blood</hi> when he insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26, 27, 28. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, in this very place he directs us to his <hi>Body Crucified,</hi> and <hi>given for the Life of the World</hi>; to shew the Eating relates to it as <hi>so represented,</hi> which is no where done but in the <hi>Eucharist. I am the living Bread,</hi> says he, which <hi>whoso eats shall live for ever: and the Bread which I will give, i. e.</hi> to be eaten, <hi>is</hi> my Body Crucified, which under that Notion is represented only in the Sacrament, or <hi>my Flesh which I will give for the Life of the World.</hi> And
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52843:86"/>
                        <hi>except ye</hi> thus <hi>eat the Flesh, and drink the Blood of the Son of Man, ye have no Life in you,</hi> Joh. 6.51, 52, 53.</p>
                     <p>This Discourse, indeed, of <hi>eating his Flesh in the Sacrament,</hi> was before the Sacrament it self was <hi>instituted.</hi> But so was his Discourse of <hi>Baptism</hi> to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> before <hi>Baptism</hi> was appointed for the <hi>standing Rite,</hi> whereby all Mankind should be <hi>Christned,</hi> Joh. 3.5. And so was his Discourse to the People, of <hi>the Death he should dye,</hi> by being <hi>lifted up,</hi> before he was <hi>Crucified,</hi> Joh. 12.32, 33. And so was his Discourse of <hi>raising up the Temple of his Body after it should be destroyed,</hi> before he <hi>was raised from the dead,</hi> Joh. 2.19.21. And so in <hi>this very place</hi> was his Discourse of <hi>giving his Flesh for the Life of the World,</hi> which they understood not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>suffered,</hi> more than they did this <hi>Sacramental eating</hi> of it before the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was <hi>appointed,</hi> Joh. 6.51. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour spake several things by <hi>Anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in <hi>sundry</hi> places, as, from this <hi>last</hi> instance, 'tis plain he did in <hi>this,</hi> which though his Hearers did not at that time fully understand, yet they would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: so that when other Reasons e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him to have spoke in this place of the Sacramental eating of his Body and Blood; the Sacrament's not being yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52843:87"/>
is no good Proof or Argument against it.</p>
                     <p>Thus is this necessity of <hi>eating his Flesh, and drinking his Blood,</hi> as ever we would <hi>hope for Eternal Life by it,</hi> spoke of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> wherein we Feast upon it. And that it should be so, has no wonder in it: For it is no more than is expresly spoke of <hi>Baptism,</hi> which is but of <hi>equal Rank with it,</hi> both being <hi>alike Duties,</hi> and <hi>equally required.</hi> For of that 'tis said, <hi>He that Believes, and is Baptized, shall be saved,</hi> Marc. 16.16. And <hi>except a man be born again of Water, and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.5.</p>
                     <p>But besides this Proof of the <hi>danger of neglecting the Sacrament,</hi> because our Lord tells us <hi>we have no Life in us without it</hi>; it may also appear from the <hi>danger of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the</hi> Jewish <hi>Passover,</hi> which <hi>answer'd to it,</hi> and was the same to <hi>them,</hi> as this Feast is to <hi>us,</hi> wherein <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7.</note> 
                        <hi>Christ our Passover is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for us.</hi> And as for the danger of neglecting that, it was great indeed, no less than of being <hi>cut off from Israel,</hi> which was the punishment God had threatned to it. <hi>Whosoever,</hi> in the Feast of the Passover, <hi>eats leaven'd Bread, from the First day to the Seventh day, that Soul shall be cut off from</hi> Israel, Exod. 12.15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:52843:87"/>Thus necessary is it for all men, who would please God, to frequent this Ordinance, and to come to the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament when they are call'd to it. They have <hi>Christs express Command for it,</hi> who, by injoyning it, <hi>has required Obedience in such an instance, as best shews their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Reverence and Love to him</hi>; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them the more to it, has <hi>freed them from all the load of</hi> Jewish <hi>Ceremonies, and imposed no heavier burden, than it and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism instead of them</hi>; and to make it have the more effect, has <hi>left it among the last words, which he spake to them</hi>; and to shew it was a matter of no small moment, would have it <hi>expresly specified in St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Commission</hi>; and tells them, That <hi>unless they come therein to eat his Flesh, and drink his Blood, they have no Life in them</hi>; and <hi>will punish the neglect, or abuse of it, as he did of the</hi> Jewish <hi>Passover which answer'd to it, with Excision</hi>: All which shew the <hi>Greatness of the Duty,</hi> and how much it is every mans Concern, who would hope to have the <hi>Favour of God,</hi> or <hi>go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as this appears from the <hi>obliging Import,</hi> and <hi>Expressness of the Command about it</hi>; so doth it,</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> From the <hi>obliging Nature of those things which are meant by it.</hi> For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52843:88"/>
we <hi>publickly own Christ</hi> and <hi>his Religion,</hi> and <hi>solemnly remember him,</hi> and <hi>confirm the New Covenant with Almighty God,</hi> and a <hi>League of Friendship with our Brethren,</hi> and are <hi>vouchsafed the highest Honour,</hi> and <hi>receive Tokens of the greatest Love,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of present Graces,</hi> and <hi>Pledges of future Glories from him:</hi> all which no <hi>Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous man will,</hi> and no <hi>Good man ought</hi> to refuse, when he is call'd to them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> In the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> I say, we <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly own Christ, and profess his Religion.</hi> This was always understood to be the meaning of <hi>Feasts on Sacrifices,</hi> both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>; they that would eat of the Sacrifice offer'd to any <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Idol,</hi> were looked on to have <hi>Fellowship</hi> and <hi>Communion with him,</hi> and thereby to <hi>own their joyning in that Worship and Service, which was paid to him.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us it was among the <hi>Jews,</hi> for <hi>they that ate of their Sacrifices were partakers of their Altars.</hi> And thus he tells us it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that they who Feasted in the <hi>Idol-Temples</hi> on the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices made to Devils,</hi> did thereby declare their Communion with them, and had <hi>Fellowship with Devils.</hi> And the same is true of the Feast of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which upon this account, he makes paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to, and compares with them. In
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52843:88"/>
                        <hi>Israel after the Flesh,</hi> says he, <hi>they who eat of the Sacrifice</hi> are sharers in the Worship, or <hi>Partakers of the Altar.</hi> And in the things which <hi>the Gentiles Sacrifice to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, they</hi> who Feast on the Sacrifices, <hi>have Fellowship with Devils.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you that Feast with the Lord at his Table, and thereby have Fellowship with him; must not mix Light and Darkness, Christ and <hi>Belial</hi> together, and by Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Devils at theirs, have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with them too. <hi>You cannot drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils; you cannot be partakers of the Lords Table, and the Table of Devils</hi>; since that were to unite the most opposite Interests, by holding Fellowship, and professing your selves to be the Servants of Christ, and of the Devil also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 18, 20, 21. Our joyning in the Holy Communion, is our avow'd owning of Faith in our Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Lord, and of our adherence to him. By eating at his Table of <hi>broken Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine poured out,</hi> which are the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of his <hi>Death</hi>; we <hi>tell it out to all the World</hi> that we are the <hi>Servants of that Lord,</hi> and <hi>Worshippers of that Jesus,</hi> who gave himself to be <hi>Crucified</hi> and <hi>to Dye</hi> for us. <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, ye do shew forth the Lords Death till he come.</hi> Ye
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52843:89"/>
                        <hi>shew forth his Death, i. e.</hi> ye <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <p>Thus is our eating Bread, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine at the Lords Table, an open profession of his Religion, and a Token whereby we give out to all the World who see what we do, that we belong to him. It is a most solemn sign of our Relation to Christ, and a publick Badge of our being Christians. And this sure no man will decline when there is a fit occasion, who is not ashamed of his Lord, nor Repents of his Profession: But if he is really a Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Christ, and would be thought one; he will let all the World know it by joyning in this Feast, which is the most Solemn Badge, and Authentick Mark, which Christ has appointed of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> In coming to the Holy Sacrament, according to our Lords appointment, we <hi>solemnly remember him,</hi> and <hi>think of the Relation wherein we stand,</hi> and of <hi>the benefits which we have received from him. Do this,</hi> says he, <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.</p>
                     <p>And when he is call'd to remember his most precious Saviour, who has both
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52843:89"/>
lived and dyed to make God his Friend, and to do him Service; there is no man sure, that has any thing of <hi>Shame,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity</hi> left in him, who will shew back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness, and begin to make excuses. For has not he done enough for us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be thought of? Do not all the inexpressible Favours he has gain'd, and all the exquisite Pains he underwent for our sakes, most justly challenge to be held in remembrance? He left <hi>unutterable Glories,</hi> and submitted to <hi>all sorts of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Calamities,</hi> and took <hi>unwearied Pains,</hi> and shewed <hi>Invincible Patience,</hi> and laid down at last his <hi>own Life</hi> to save our Souls: and must all this be forgotten now 'tis done, and quite buried in silence? What man of any <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> that has been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in such a <hi>Friend,</hi> can be averse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him? What man, that has been blessed in such a <hi>Saviour,</hi> can ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Thoughts of him? Unless we will shew our selves <hi>grossly stupid,</hi> or <hi>intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proud,</hi> and <hi>both</hi> ways <hi>Monsters of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi>; we must needs be ready to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the memory of such a Person, when we are called to do that Honour to him: and none that would be thought a <hi>man,</hi> much more a <hi>Christian,</hi> must ever refuse to remember his Saviour Christ, and give him Thanks, when in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52843:90"/>
the Sacrament he is call'd to it in Christ's own Name, and by his special invitation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> In eating Bread and drinking Wine at the Sacrament, we <hi>confirm the New Covenant with Almighty God.</hi> In this Feast, as has been shewn, we assure him that we will <hi>Repent of every sin,</hi> as ever we hope that he will <hi>forgive</hi> us; and will <hi>endeavour with</hi> his Grace after <hi>every Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> as ever we expect that he should <hi>assist</hi> us; and <hi>obey every one of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as ever we look that he should Crown us with <hi>Eternal Happiness</hi>; and <hi>believe</hi> that, for <hi>Christs sake,</hi> we shall have this <hi>Pardon, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life upon these Terms,</hi> and <hi>not otherwise</hi>: for all these Duties we give him our Word and Promise; and, on that Condition, for all these Blessings he gives us his Seal and Assurance back again.</p>
                     <p>And what man is there, who pretends to the Name of a <hi>Christian,</hi> who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to do this when he has an Authentick Summons, nay, even a Friendly Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? will he not <hi>Repent,</hi> that he may be <hi>forgiven</hi>? nor <hi>endeavour</hi> after such Graces as he wants, that <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> may <hi>help</hi> him to them? nor <hi>obey</hi> all his Saviours Laws, that he may be <hi>happy in Heaven</hi>? nor <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> that Christ has purchased these Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits for us at Gods hands, upon these
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52843:90"/>
Terms; but that without performing them we shall never have them? If he will not do all this, why doth he make any pretence to Religion? If he is unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd, and suspends about any of these Particulars, why doth he profess himself a <hi>Christian?</hi> For these things are the very substance of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and the Life and Soul of all <hi>Religion.</hi> No man can belong to Christ without them, and when he was <hi>Baptized</hi> and came to him, he solemnly undertook and ingaged for them. And therefore if any man will refuse to make God his engagement of this <hi>Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> when he is call'd to <hi>Promise</hi> and <hi>Profess</hi> them; he revolts from his <hi>Baptismal Vow,</hi> and, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in that mind, may as well renounce his Profession, and turn his back on the whole Christian Religion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4<hi>ly,</hi> In eating Bread and drinking Wine at the Lords Supper, we <hi>confirm a League of Love and Friendship with all our Brethren,</hi> this being one end, as I have shewn, of this meeting, to <hi>profess our selves in perfect Peace and Charity with all men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And who now, that owns himself a <hi>Christian,</hi> can seek shifts, and shun this when God calls him? when his Saviour, that dyed to make God Friends with him,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52843:91"/>
asks him to be Friends with all the World; can he refuse him? When he invites him to be at Peace with all his Members, and to embrace them all as Brethren; can he fly from him? If he shun this, he may as well shun every thing else, and quit all claim to his Religion. For <hi>by this,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>shall all men know that you are my Disciples, if ye have Love one to another.</hi> Joh. 13.35. And <hi>unless ye forgive men their Trespasses,</hi> says he again, <hi>neither will your heavenly Father forgive you</hi> yours. Mat. 6.15. And <hi>he that says he Loves God, and</hi> yet <hi>hates his Brother,</hi> saith St. <hi>John, is a Lyar.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.20. And <hi>if it be possible,</hi> saith St. Paul, <hi>and as much as in you lies, live peaceably with all men.</hi> Rom. 12.18. <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Friendship</hi> and <hi>Beneficence,</hi> are the great Duties which Christs Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes, and which all his Followers must be forward at all times to make professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of. And therefore if any man turns away from declaring them, when God calls him to them; he turns his back of the most Signal Duty of his Religion, and will not come to that, whereby, above all things else, he should declare himself a Christian.</p>
                     <p n="5">5<hi>ly,</hi> In Feasting with God at the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, we are <hi>vouchsafed the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52843:91"/>
highest Honour,</hi> and <hi>receive Tokens of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Love,</hi> and <hi>injoyment of present Graces,</hi> and <hi>Pledges of future Glory from him</hi>; and these no man ought to refuse, when he is call'd to them.</p>
                     <p>He <hi>vouchsafes us the greatest Honour.</hi> For he calls us to his <hi>own Table,</hi> and tells us he is most glad to see us there, and that the oftner we come, the welcomer shall we be to his Supper; he invites us as his <hi>own Guests,</hi> and thereby seeks our <hi>Company</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> and treats us as his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Confidents</hi>; which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is so high, that greater cannot be shewed us.</p>
                     <p>He <hi>gives us the surest Tokens of highest Love.</hi> For he calls us to Feast upon the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood of his own Son, i. e.</hi> upon those Blessings which the breaking of his Body and shedding of his Blood procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for men; and shews us plainly that he is still of the same mind, and is glad that for our sakes he parted with him. For his inviting us to eat the Body, and drink the Blood of Christ in this Holy Supper, imports as much as if he should say to us. <hi>Lo! here my dear and only Son, whom I gave to shed his own hearts Blood a Ransome for your Souls. When I did it, your sins were most provoking, and render'd you utterly undeserving of it; and since you
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52843:92"/>
have received it, you have not been affected as you ought, but have shewed your selves most unthankful for it: but yet all this doth not make me Repent of what I have done, or grudge you the Benefit of him. I am come here freely to present you with him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you, and exhort you, nay, intreat you to accept him. Eat his Body, and drink his Blood, i. e.</hi> those Benefits and that Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was purchased by it; <hi>I freely give them without grudging, nay, I shall take it extreamly ill if you refuse them. For I would by all means have you receive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him. I gave him once for you, and now again I give him to you; I am still of the same mind, to part with my own dear Son for your sakes, and to bestow him on you. I have nothing better wherewith to present you, but with him in this Holy Feast I do; and what higher Tokens can I give of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Love I bear you?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He <hi>gives us present injoyment of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Graces.</hi> For the Lords Supper is a Treasury of Blessings, conveying to all those, who worthily partake of it, the <hi>Pardon of their Sins,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Improvements,</hi> and <hi>growth in all Virtues,</hi> and <hi>strength against all Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> as I shall shew under the <hi>next</hi> Head.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> He <hi>gives us the surest Pledges of future Glory.</hi> For when he offers us
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52843:92"/>
his <hi>own Son,</hi> we may be sure he will not stick at any thing else, since he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is in any comparable Degree so precious and dear to him, as he is. This Gift is a <hi>Faithful Earnest,</hi> and <hi>certain Pledge</hi> of every thing else which he can give us. For <hi>he that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how shall he not with him freely give us all things</hi>? says St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>
                     <p>Thus in the <hi>Blessed Sacrament,</hi> are we <hi>vouchsafed the greatest Honour,</hi> and <hi>receive Tokens of highest Love,</hi> and <hi>injoyment of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Graces,</hi> and <hi>Pledges of future Glories from Almighty God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what man now will refuse all these, when he is invited to them? Who can turn his back upon that Ordinance, wherein God calls him, that he may give Honour to him, and shew by the highest Tokens how he Loves him, and confer upon him present Graces, and give him Pledges of future Glories, and assure him what Regard he has of him, and how happy he intends to make him? <hi>Common Ingenuity,</hi> and <hi>Good manners,</hi> nay, every mans own <hi>private Interest</hi> and <hi>Self-advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> oblige him most readily to embrace, and not to <hi>sleight,</hi> or so much as <hi>slowly to accept</hi> of such offers. So that if any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son really believes, that all this Honour is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52843:93"/>
shewn, this Love expressed, these Graces given, or these Glories assured to him in the Communion: he must needs think himself highly obliged to come to it, and never cast about to seek shifts, and make excuses, or express a backward and unwilling mind, when he has an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an Opportunity so to do.</p>
                     <p>And thus we see, that not only our <hi>Lords express Command for it,</hi> but also the <hi>obliging Nature of those things which are meant by,</hi> and of <hi>those employments which are imply'd in</hi> it, are a <hi>strong</hi> and an <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensable Obligation</hi> on all <hi>grown Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who are capable of it, <hi>to frequent the Holy Sacrament.</hi> For therein they are call'd by their Saviour Christ, <hi>publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to profess his Religion,</hi> and <hi>their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him,</hi> and <hi>thankfully to remember him,</hi> and to <hi>confirm the New Covenant with God,</hi> and a <hi>League of Love and Friendship with their Brethren,</hi> and to <hi>receive Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safements of highest Honour,</hi> and <hi>Tokens of greatest Love,</hi> and <hi>injoyment of present Graces,</hi> and <hi>Pledges of future Glories from him</hi>: all which are things that no Christian man ought to stick at, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, but with all forwardness to close with, as often as he has an Opportunity, and sit occasion for them.</p>
                     <p>And thus it appears now much all the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52843:93"/>
                        <hi>Disciples of Christ,</hi> who are <hi>grown up</hi> to it, and <hi>understand</hi> it (for no Duty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges an <hi>incapable</hi> Subject) are bound to frequent this holy Sacrament. It is their Duty to <hi>come to the Communion,</hi> as it is to <hi>come to Church,</hi> to be <hi>Chast, Sober, Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Just,</hi> or to perform <hi>any other Precept</hi> of their <hi>Religion.</hi> For they have their <hi>Saviour Christs express Command for it,</hi> who by injoining it, has <hi>required Obedience in such an Instance, as best shews their peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Reverence and Love to him</hi>; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them the more to it, has <hi>freed them from all the load of</hi> Jewish <hi>Ceremonies, and imposed no heavier burden, than it and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism instead of them</hi>; and to make it take the more effect, <hi>left it among the last words which he spake to them</hi>; and to shew it was a matter of no small moment, would have it <hi>expresly specified in St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>; and tells them, That <hi>unless they come therein to eat his Flesh and drink his Blood, they have no Life in them</hi>; and <hi>will punish the neglect, or abuse of it, as he did the neglect of the</hi> Jewish <hi>Passover, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd to it, with Excision.</hi> And the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of those things which are meant by it,</hi> and of those <hi>Employments which are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised at it,</hi> most <hi>straightly oblige</hi> them to it. For therein they shew they have <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Christ,</hi> and <hi>appertain to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:52843:94"/>
and <hi>thankfully remember him,</hi> and <hi>Seal the New Covenant with God,</hi> and a <hi>League of Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship with their Brethren,</hi> and are <hi>vouchsafed the highest Honour,</hi> and <hi>receive Tokens of the greatest Love,</hi> and <hi>injoyment of present Graces,</hi> and <hi>Pledges of future Glories from him:</hi> which are things that every <hi>Ingenuous</hi> man <hi>will,</hi> and every <hi>Good</hi> man <hi>ought</hi> to do, and no man, when he is call'd to it, can honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decline, that professes himself a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
                     <p>Thus is it a <hi>necessary Duty</hi> in every man to <hi>come</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as it is to <hi>come</hi> to <hi>Church,</hi> or to other <hi>parts of Worship</hi>: And <hi>when once we are of Age for it,</hi> and <hi>have a fit opportunity and occasion offer'd</hi>; we are in strict Duty ingaged, and by a bond of many Cords, as we have seen, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged so to do.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> I say we are <hi>bound to it, when once we are of Age for it.</hi> The Duty of this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> lies in such things, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a competent Understanding, and due Knowledge of Religion in those who must discharge them. For therein we are to <hi>remember Christ,</hi> both what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands he has left with us, and what he has done and suffered for us; and this we cannot do, till <hi>first we have learnt</hi> them. We must <hi>ingage to be at Peace,</hi> to <hi>do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:52843:94"/>
and <hi>shew kindness to all our Brethren</hi>; and this supposes that we know <hi>first</hi> what <hi>Offices of Love,</hi> and <hi>Acts of Justice are due</hi> to them. We must <hi>consent to the Terms of the New Covenant,</hi> and this implies that <hi>first</hi> we should <hi>understand</hi> them. In <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> indeed, we enter'd into it before we had any knowledge of it; but that was because God, (who deals with us after the most favourable manner of Men, who allow grown Persons to bear the Parts, and federally to undertake for Infants, in things conducing to their Advantage,) admitted our <hi>Sponsors,</hi> that knew it very well, to stand as our <hi>Representatives,</hi> and in way of <hi>Proxies</hi> to Covenant and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for us. But the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is to be our <hi>own Act,</hi> and an express assenting in our own Persons to what they undertook; and this cannot be done till we are come to years, and are able of our selves to judge of it.</p>
                     <p>Till we are grown up then to the Age of Competent knowledge in Spiritual Affairs, we are not <hi>capable</hi> of discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aright the Duty of this Sacrament. And till we are so we are not obliged to it, since no Duty obliges an <hi>incapable</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For 'tis in <hi>this</hi> Duty, as 'tis in that of <hi>making Peace,</hi> or <hi>giving good Advice,</hi> or any others; they bind us not till we
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52843:95"/>
are grown up to them, and are come to know rightly how to discharge them. For in all these Cases, God exacts an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count only of those <hi>Talents</hi> which he has entrusted with us, as we are told in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the men who had <hi>received the Talents,</hi> Mat. 25. and his Rule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is this, <hi>unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more,</hi> Luc. 12.48.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> When we are of <hi>Age</hi> for it, we are bound to it only <hi>when we have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and a fit occasion is offered.</hi> It is in the <hi>Communion at the Sacrament,</hi> as it is in <hi>our Communion in Prayers,</hi> and <hi>other parts of Worship</hi>; we are <hi>bound to join in them when they can be had, and we are not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hindered and diverted from it.</hi> But if either there is <hi>no place</hi> for them, or we are <hi>justly hindered</hi> from attending on them; we have no obliging opportunity for that time, but may without sin omit them. And thus it is when we are hindred by some <hi>call of Providence,</hi> when at that time we are call'd away to do some necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duty of <hi>Justice,</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> in another place. Or when we are detained at home by some <hi>Disease,</hi> or <hi>bodily Indisposition,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it is not safe to go abroad, or venture out beyond our own Chambers;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52843:95"/>
in which case God, who prefers <hi>Mercy before Sacrifice,</hi> when they thwart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere, <hi>i. e. Essential Duties</hi> before <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts,</hi> will excuse us. Or, lastly, when <hi>our minds are disturbed</hi> by <hi>great Grief,</hi> that cannot presently be cast off, or by <hi>sudden Anger</hi> or <hi>Discontent</hi> occasioned hard before, (which though ordinarily it be our own Fault, may yet sometimes be innocent;) at which time, since their Discomposure unfits them for so Divine a Service, they may omit it as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed for it. This St. <hi>Peter</hi> intimates of <hi>Prayers,</hi> (and the Reason is the same of <hi>this Ordinance</hi>) when he exhorts the <hi>Husband,</hi> by a <hi>discreet compliance,</hi> and <hi>patient bearing of his Wives Infirmities,</hi> to prevent all <hi>Peevishness</hi> and <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick quarrels,</hi> that so they may have no need to <hi>omit</hi> or <hi>put by</hi> their <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>; which, it seems, they would, if their minds were acted at that time by such undue Tempers. <hi>Ye Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,</hi> says he, <hi>dwell with your Wives according to Knowledge; giving Honour to the Wives,</hi> or treating them with Lenity and Care, as men do brittle Ware, because they are <hi>the Weaker Vessels, that your Prayers be not hindered</hi> by those Heats and Animosities, which very likely might arise otherwise, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>

So that when we have an opportunity for it, and no just hindrance to put us by it, to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate is a strict Precept, and in all Duty we are obliged so to do.</p>

                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:52843:96"/>But against this expresness of the Command, and strictness of the Duty to Communicate; some perhaps may urge the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me,</hi> v. 25. which words, <hi>as often,</hi> seem to limit the precept only to the <hi>Remembrance of Christ when we do Communicate,</hi> and to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, as if we had no Command to <hi>do this,</hi> and so with out sin might omit it when we please, but only to <hi>remember him when we do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in <hi>Answer</hi> to this, I observe,</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> These words, if we had no other proof of it, <hi>would not of themselves prove it a Command,</hi> and <hi>strict Duty to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi> But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly, Neither do they infer the Contrary, and prove against it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly, There are other Places enow, which sufficiently evince it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> I say, these words, <hi>Do this, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me,</hi> if we had no other proof for it, <hi>would not amount to an obliging Command, and prove it a strict Duty to Communicate.</hi> For that which is plainly and indisputably expressed in them, is not that we <hi>should Communicate,</hi> but that we <hi>should Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Christ when we do it,</hi> and they might have their full Sense, if nothing more than this were intended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:52843:97"/>But as of themselves they do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to such a Precept; so,</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, <hi>Neither do they infer the contrary, and prove against it.</hi> All that which they express, is only that we must remember Christ when we do Communicate; and this is done whether Communicating it self be a Duty, or whether it be not; and suiting thus equally with any side, as it doth not prove it a Duty to receive the Sacrament, so neither doth it prove there is no Duty in it. And of this we have still a further Argument, because if these words, <hi>as often, &amp;c.</hi> infer there is no Duty to Communicate, the same may be infer'd of Prayer, since in <hi>another Place</hi> they are spoke of it, as <hi>here</hi> they are of the Sacrament. <hi>When, i. e.</hi> as often as <hi>ye Pray,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>say, Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.2. So that if they prove we are <hi>not bound to Communicate,</hi> but only to <hi>remember Christ when we do it</hi>; they will prove we are <hi>not bound to pray,</hi> but only <hi>when we pray</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to use <hi>this Form</hi> in Prayer too.</p>
                     <p>Thus are these words, <hi>Do this, as often as ye drink it,</hi> &amp;c. neither an Argument that to Communicate is a Duty, nor an Argument against it. They are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and equally incline both ways; so that when <hi>that</hi> is the <hi>Question,</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52843:97"/>
they are no proof on any side, but other things must decide it.</p>
                     <p>And then,</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> Although <hi>this</hi> place do not prove it an express Duty to Communicate, yet there are <hi>other places enow that do sufficiently evince it.</hi> For in <hi>this</hi> very <hi>Chapter,</hi> the words of our Lord at the <hi>eating of the Bread</hi> are absolute, and imply an <hi>express Command</hi> for <hi>it: Do this,</hi> says he, <hi>i. e.</hi> Take and eat Bread as now ye do, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me</hi>; where not only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance is injoined, but also this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way of doing it, <hi>viz.</hi> by eating Bread, wherein he is to be remembred, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. And so 'tis also in St. <note n="†" place="margin">Luc. 22.19.</note> 
                        <hi>Luke,</hi> where the Words are <hi>Peremptory</hi> for the <hi>Apostles administring,</hi> and so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably for the <hi>Peoples receiving</hi> it, without any intimation of the <hi>eating it self</hi> being <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>uncommanded</hi>; which that <hi>Evangelist</hi> would not so unwarily have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, if Christ had so intended it. And our <hi>Lord</hi> shew'd us, not only that he has commanded this Sacramental eating, but that he has commanded it as a <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> thing, when he tells his Hearers, that <hi>except they thus eat the Flesh, and drink the Blood of the Son of Man, they have no Life in them,</hi> Joh. 6.53. And this necessity of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52843:98"/>
it is further manifested, from the <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Passover</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> which answered to it; for at every Return of it, they were to be <hi>cut off from Israel</hi> whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever presumed to omit it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.15. And if there were no express Command for it, yet are the <hi>things</hi> we are call'd to in it all of that <hi>obliging Nature,</hi> and such <hi>necessary Duties,</hi> that without Sin they cannot be declined. By all which, as we have seen, this Sacramental eating and drinking is evidently proved to be a <hi>plain Duty,</hi> and under a <hi>peremptory Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When therefore in this place the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> says of our drinking of the Cup, <hi>Do this, as often as ye drink it,</hi> he doth not intimate that we may do it as seldome as we please, or as if it were under no Law, or express Precept. He uses the words, <hi>as often,</hi> not because 'tis an <hi>Arbitrary Act</hi> and there is no Duty in it; but because, though it be a Duty, we have not <hi>always opportunity for it,</hi> and so cannot <hi>always</hi> be performing it. For, as has been shewn, there is a Command to Communicate, and that, as all other <hi>Affirmative Laws,</hi> binds us to it at all times when a <hi>fit occasion</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd. When we eat and drink in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, we must remember Christ; and when we have an opportunity to eat and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52843:98"/>
drink in it, we are obliged to it; as the <hi>Jews,</hi> we saw, were to the <hi>Passover</hi> which answered to it, who were to be cut off from <hi>Israel,</hi> when at any time they omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it: So that to Communicate is no <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary</hi> Act, but an <hi>indispensable Duty,</hi> and peremptory Command still.</p>
                     <p>And since it is thus necessary a Duty in every <hi>grown Christian</hi> to <hi>come</hi> to the Holy Sacrament; it must needs be a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>dangerous Sin</hi> in any of us, when we <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>abstain</hi> from it. We must not think it an <hi>indifferent</hi> thing, but make <hi>Conscience</hi> of <hi>keeping off from the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> as we do of <hi>keeping off from Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> of <hi>Swearing, doing Wrong,</hi> being <hi>Proud, Incontinent,</hi> or <hi>Drunken.</hi> For <hi>it</hi> is expresly and straitly forbidden by God, as well as <hi>they,</hi> and we incur his Anger, and, till we repent and do so no more, cannot regain his Favour, when we are guilty of any of them.</p>
                     <p>A neglect of the Lords Table there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a <hi>Sin,</hi> which, although <hi>God may excuse</hi> in those good Souls, who, <hi>because of their over-high Veneration for it,</hi> and <hi>Fear of their own Vnworthiness to partake in it,</hi> in the <hi>honesty of their Hearts</hi> think they ought not to come to it: Yet will he <hi>not excuse in them when they are better inform'd</hi>; and <hi>much less in others who neglect it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52843:99"/>
they are careless of it,</hi> or <hi>too Wicked and Impenitent to receive it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He may excuse it,</hi> I say, <hi>in those Good Souls, who in the honesty of their Hearts, through Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Error, were held back,</hi> and <hi>because of their over-high Veneration for it, and fear of their Vnworthiness to partake in it, thought they ought not to come to it.</hi> An <hi>innocent Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>mistake of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest mind,</hi> may plead our excuse before God in this, as well as in <hi>other</hi> Duties. For in all of them, <hi>Christ</hi> has <hi>such a Sense of our Infirmities,</hi> as that <hi>he can have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on the Ignorant, and those</hi> that err, or <hi>are out of the way,</hi> Heb. 5.2. So that if after an upright indeavour to be rightly inform'd in it, some Good Minds shall happen to mistake, their Error will not be imputed. It may be through the <hi>loose Discourses of some,</hi> or the <hi>general Practice</hi> of the World, who, by being so seldom at it, seem to set lightly by it; they think themselves <hi>not obliged</hi> to it. Or again, through the <hi>extream Rigidness</hi> of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of <hi>others,</hi> who require such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary things to it as very few have attain'd, they think themselves always <hi>unworthy</hi> and <hi>unprepared</hi> for it, and that they should sin, and eat their <hi>own Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in it. But if they fall into these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes about it which make them abstain
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52843:99"/>
from it, after an honest indeavour to be rightly inform'd about it; their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may plead their Excuse, and make their Neglect to be connived at. God will not account it to them as a sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they knew it not, but were mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For in this, as well as in all other Cases, <hi>to him that knows to do Good, and doth it not, to him 'tis Sin,</hi> Jam. 4.17.</p>
                     <p>But though God may bear with this <hi>neglect of the Sacrament</hi> in <hi>Good men,</hi> whilst they are thus <hi>innocently misled</hi>: Yet <hi>will he not excuse it in them when they are better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi>; and much less in <hi>others, who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it because they are careless of it,</hi> or <hi>too Impenitent to receive it.</hi>

                        <hi>He will not excuse it even in them when they are better informed.</hi> Their only plea for their not doing of this Duty, is, that after the best search they could make, they did not know they were bound to it, or that with safety they could perform it: and when once their Understanding is inlightned, this plea is removed, so that afterwards they can find no relief at all from it. They abstain then, when they know, if they are truly Penitent, they <hi>might,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to come; and that abstinence is <hi>wilful,</hi> and, unless they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it and amend it, will end in their Condemnation. For <hi>to him that knoweth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52843:100"/>
to do Good, and doth it not, to him 'tis Sin,</hi> Jam. 5.17.</p>
                     <p>And much less <hi>will he excuse it in others, who are careless of it,</hi> and <hi>too Impenitent to receive it.</hi> If they are hindred from the Lords Table out of <hi>Slothfulness,</hi> or are unworthy of it by Reason of their <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>; those are not their <hi>Excuse,</hi> but their own <hi>Damning Fault,</hi> and they must expect to bear the punishment of it. To tell God I did not come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment because I would not Repent, is to tell him I would not come and promise to be Good, because I was resolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Wicked: and that is a very odd way of excusing it. <hi>Impenitence</hi> is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, but a most damning Sin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we have no other cause to give why we did not come, we must needs be liable to Condemnation.</p>
                     <p>If any of you therefore who shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use <hi>this Treatise,</hi> have refused Gods invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation formerly, and have kept back from this Feast: by what I have here said you may see your Fault, and how nearly you are concerned, as you tender your <hi>dear Saviours Honour,</hi> or the <hi>safety of your own most precious Souls,</hi> to amend it. You have offended God in <hi>not coming to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> as you would offend him in <hi>not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church,</hi> in <hi>not saying your Prayers,</hi>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:52843:100"/>
in <hi>not giving Thanks for Mercies,</hi> in <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humble, honest,</hi> and <hi>upright in your dealings,</hi> or in omitting any <hi>other Duties.</hi> So that you must not think all is well with you when you keep away, as if you had done nothing. If the true Cause why you abstain'd was your <hi>well meant mistake</hi> about it, and your not knowing, after all the search you had opportunity to make, that every Good man, who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents of all his Sins, is worthy and fit for it: God will wink at your <hi>Ignorance</hi> whilst it lasted; but that will be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse to you now you are <hi>better informed,</hi> so that now you will be Guilty of a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Offence, if you still neglect it after you are told of it. But if you have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented hitherto out of a <hi>careless Spirit,</hi> which would not attend the times, or be at the pains to come to it; or because you have an <hi>Impenitent Heart,</hi> which will not promise that Amendment and New Life, that is to be undertaken for and ingaged in it: Then has your Absenting been your Damning Sin, which has provoked God against you, as all other Acts of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and Irreligion. If this is your Case, you must look upon your selves all this while to have been in a great Fault, which God will not forgive till you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amend it. For God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52843:101"/>
you this Sin of neglecting the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the same condition whereon he will forgive all others, namely, when you <hi>forsake</hi> it, and <hi>turn away</hi> from it, and, instead of absenting, learn to frequent it. So that if you would keep a <hi>Good Conscience towards God,</hi> and <hi>dye in Peace,</hi> and have no <hi>unrepented sins</hi> to answer for at the last Judgment: Every one of you, that has sinfully sleighted this Sacrament hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, must come to it henceforward, and, according to your Saviour Christs Commandment, readily partake in it, when you are called thereto.</p>

                        <p>The Sacrament is full of Blessings, which make it not only our Duty, but our Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. In the <hi>General,</hi> it is the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means in all Religion to recommend our Prayers, and make them powerful; and so is the likeliest way to attain all Mercies. <hi>In particular, 1.</hi> It Seals to us the Pardon of our Sins for the Peace of our Consciences. <hi>2.</hi> It encreases and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in us all Graces.

It confers Grace, <hi>1.</hi> By the Natural Virtue and Tendency of those Duties, which it both exercises and excites in us. <hi>2.</hi> By those inward Assistances, which it conveys to us. Since on all these accounts it is so excellent a means of Grace and New Life, 'tis the best Rule any Person can observe who would go on in the Work of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Holy Sacrament has Blessings enow within it self to recommend it to our choice, if God had not interposed his Authority, and laid that weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it which he has. It is fully stored with Benefits, which make it, not only a <hi>strict Duty,</hi> but an <hi>high Priviledge</hi> to come to it, as the <hi>Christian Church</hi> has always thought, whose <hi>great Penalty</hi> lay in a <hi>Separation,</hi> or <hi>Exclusion</hi> from it. It is not only a matter of Honour to God, but also of highest Advantage to our selves; so that in all Reason we ought to seek it, and heartily thank God that we may be admitted to it, out of a care of our own Happiness and pure Self-interest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:52843:102"/>Of these <hi>Benefits</hi> I have mentioned some already, such as its being a <hi>vouchsafement of highest Honour</hi> to us, and a <hi>token of Gods greatest Love</hi> for us, and a <hi>certain pledge of our Future Glories,</hi> of all which I have Discoursed in the last Chapter. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides them, it is full of many other <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Blessings</hi> and <hi>present Graces,</hi> which I shall now treat of in <hi>this.</hi> And those, which I shall take notice of, are these.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> In the General, <hi>It is the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means in all Religion to recommend our Prayers, and make them Powerful with God</hi>; so that 'tis <hi>the likeliest way to obtain all Mercies.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> In the General, <hi>It is the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means in all Religion to recommend our Prayers, and make them Powerful with God</hi>; so that 'tis <hi>the likeliest way to obtain all Mercies.</hi> And this it doth, by being a <hi>Commemoration unto him</hi> of <hi>the death of Christ,</hi> which is the only Argument that prevails with him to bestow them on us.</p>
                     <p>It is the common way of all men when they sue for kindnesses from others, and think they have not Interest enough them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52843:103"/>
to use such Intercessions, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest such things, as have most Power with them, and are likeliest to incline them to grant their Desires. And as it is thus in our Requests to <hi>men,</hi> so is it in our Prayers to <hi>God</hi> too. We set those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations before his Eyes, and suggest those things to his Remembrance, which are fittest to move his Pity, and to make him favourable towards us. Thus the Holy men in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> in their Prayers are frequently putting God in mind of his <note n="†" place="margin">Psal. 119.49.2 Chron. 6.42.</note> 
                        <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and <hi>Promise</hi>; and making mention of his Servant <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 132.1.10.</note>

                        <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Isaac,</hi> or <hi>Israel,</hi> for whom they knew he had an especial kindness: and with their <hi>Prayers</hi> they used to joyn <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> hoping to be the easier heard when they came with their Atonement in their Hands, and that the Life of the Beast being offer'd up in Commutation, and accepted instead of theirs, God would be the easier appeased, and more inclined to hear their Supplications. Upon which account, that their Prayers might have a Powerful Argument to recommend them going along with them, they were careful to offer them up at the <hi>hour of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:52843:103"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now that which Powerfully <hi>intercedes</hi> with God for us, and which was shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by all the <hi>Jewish Sacrifices,</hi> is our <hi>Saviours Death.</hi> For it was his <hi>Blood</hi> that <hi>merited</hi> so highly at Gods hands, as to make him think of shewing Favour, and being kind to us. <hi>It is the Blood of Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> Rom. 3.25; that <hi>makes peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Men,</hi> Col.1.20, and <hi>speaks better things than the Blood of</hi> Abel, calling for Life and Salvation, as that did for Destruction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. And 'tis the <hi>Representation of that Blood</hi> now in <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places,</hi> that <hi>gives Christ himself such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power with God,</hi> and makes him sure to prevail whensoever he <hi>intercedes</hi> for us. For <hi>by it he entered into the Holy Place, where the Mercy-seat or Propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was,</hi> Heb. 9.3, 5.12.24; and where <hi>he ever lives to make intercession for us.</hi> Heb. 7.25. So that the great Argument, which either <hi>Christ our high Priest</hi> now in <hi>Heaven</hi> offers for us, or which in our Prayers we can plead for our selves, is his <hi>own Death</hi> and <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this is set before God in every <hi>Prayer,</hi> and in <hi>all Acts of Religion</hi>; in all
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52843:104"/>
which we use <hi>Christs Name,</hi> and desire to be heard, and hope to prevail through <hi>his Mediation.</hi> But in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> it is done <hi>more perfectly,</hi> and with <hi>greater So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,</hi> and that too by <hi>Gods own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For one chief end of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is to <hi>Commemorate the Death of Christ; i. e.</hi> to set it out in solemn shew, and make mention of it, not only before <hi>men,</hi> but also to <hi>Almighty God.

                     <p>Thus do we no where so livelily and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously set out this great Argument of being heard, as in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which we may justly hope will be the more observed, and have the more effect, because it is not done of our own heads, but by Gods own special Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Appointment. And where the Argument is most advantageously set out, we may expect the better effect, and greater force from it. And this the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Christians</hi> thought, accounting their Prayers were not like to be so Powerful at any time, as when this Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52843:104"/>
of Christs Death, the only Plea for being heard, accompanied them. And therefore at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Thus 'tis in the form prescribed</hi> Constit. Apostol. l. 8. c. 13. &amp; 15. p. 484, 485. tom. prim. Concil. ed.

                     <p>Thus in the General, is the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament a most <hi>likely means to obtain for us all Mercies,</hi> because it is the most <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al course in all Religion</hi> to <hi>recommend our Prayers,</hi> which must procure them for us.</p>

                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> It <hi>seals and confirms to us the Pardon of our Sins for the peace of our Consciences.</hi> In the Holy Sacrament God calls us to give us a <hi>full Pardon,</hi> by giving us that Blood which was <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 26.28.</note> 
                        <hi>shed for the remission of Sins,</hi> and which is the <hi>Blood of Expiation</hi>: and

having received that at his hand, if we are true Penitents, we need not doubt but that our sins are expiated, and he is reconciled. The Sacrament it self, as we have seen, is nothing less than a <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>emn Confirmation of the New Covenant,</hi> which promises Remission of Sin to all that truly repent of it. So that when with Penitent Hearts we come to joyn in it, we come to stipulate and secure a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all our Offences, which will give us all the security of it that Covenants and Promises can make us. Whensoever we Repent, indeed, we have Gods promise of Forgiveness, which may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our hearts after any Sin, not only in the <hi>Communion,</hi> but in <hi>every Penitential Prayer and Confession.</hi> But in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this Promise is again repeated, and in most solemn manner Sealed and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; to shew us that God is still of the same mind, and to give us a <hi>renewed</hi> and a <hi>sensible</hi> assurance of it. And when God has thus set his Seal to it, and a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Soul has just received his Word and Bond for it; it need not question but he is reconciled, and, unless it starts back from these penitential engagements, and falls afresh into new Provocations, will always continue so to be.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Sacrament is the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52843:105"/>
means, to calm the Fears, and quiet the Consciences of all true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. If once they make sure of their own Repentance after any Fault, it doth that in an <hi>ordinary</hi> way, which an <hi>Angel from Heaven,</hi> and a <hi>special Revelation</hi> would do in <hi>extraordinary,</hi> i. e. <hi>it lets them know their Sins are Pardoned, and that God is their Friend.</hi> For therein they receive from him the <hi>Blood of Expiation,</hi> a plain proof their Sins are atoned for and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and therein there is an express a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and <hi>solemn Covenant of Peace and Reconciliation</hi> between God and them, which is confirmed by this Feast of his own prescribing: and having this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own appointment, which they may look upon as his Hand and Seal to it, they may chearfully depend upon it, and rest satisfied in their own mind.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52843:106"/>
not a Sacrament intended to give strength in Grace, to those that have nothing of it; for it is our <hi>Spiritual Meat</hi> and <hi>Bread,</hi> as our Saviour calls it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51, 55. the use whereof is not to give <hi>Life to a Dead Person,</hi> but <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Nourishment to a Living.</hi> It is not designed to turn an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Man into a true Penitent, or to make an Ill man Good; for every impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently ill man is an Unworthy Receiver, and eats his <hi>own Damnation,</hi> which is a <hi>Curse</hi> and not a <hi>Blessing</hi>; so that he is not the better, but the worse by it. But it is intended to make a <hi>Good</hi> Man <hi>Better,</hi> to carry on Repentance in those that have begun it, and to confirm and enlarge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Virtue in those who are already possessed of it. If we come to it with <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Belief of the Scriptures,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of Gods promises to <hi>pardon</hi> our Sins for Christs sake upon our <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to <hi>help us to any Graces</hi> upon our <hi>indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi> and to make us <hi>Eternally happy</hi> upon our <hi>entire Obedience</hi>; it <hi>strengthens</hi> and <hi>assures</hi> it: if with <hi>Love of our dear Lord,</hi> who dyed for us; it <hi>increases</hi> it: if with <hi>Thankfulness</hi> for his kindnesses, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of giving his own Life for ours; it makes us <hi>more sensible</hi> of it: if with <hi>hearty Repentance,</hi> and full purpose of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending all our Sins; it makes us more
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52843:106"/>
                        <hi>unmoveable</hi> and <hi>settled</hi> in it: if with <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Charity towards all our Neighbours</hi>; it fills us with a <hi>greater abundance</hi> of it. It augments all the Virtues of a Good man which he brings to it, making him more perfect in them, and strong in Spirit to persevere and go through with them. But these Effects it has not upon an ill man, nor produces this increase of Virtue in those, who bring nothing of it along with them: So that 'tis no disparagement to the Virtue of this Sacrament, if wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men find themselves wicked still, and not at all amended by their Receipt of it, since it was not ordained for their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. It was not meant to give <hi>Grace</hi> to those that are <hi>Graceless,</hi> or to give <hi>Repentance</hi> to <hi>Impenitent</hi> Persons: but to carry them through in their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance who have fully set upon it, and to enable them to lead a New Life who are resolved to do it, and to strengthen them to amend a Fault who are wholly bent to strive against it, and to confer Grace on those that have it, and make them more Gracious still.</p>
                     <p>And this the Holy Sacrament is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very worthy Communicant. It conveys Grace into his Soul, and makes him stand more firm, and increase in every Virtue of a Christian. It is an excellent means
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52843:107"/>
to make him a better man, and to carry him on to improve in Duty and Holy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: So that every one who comes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, will gain a great increase of Grace and Strength, and be much set on in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual growth by Receiving.</p>
                     <p>Now this it doth two ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> By the <hi>Natural Virtue and Tendency of those Duties, which it exercises and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites in us.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> By those <hi>inward Assistances, which it conveys to us.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> A worthy Receiving conveys Grace into our Souls, and confirms and increases us in all Virtues, by the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Efficacy and Tendency of those Duties, which it exercises, and excites in us.</hi> For <hi>it excites,</hi> and <hi>therein we exercise</hi> several Duties, which help on a good Life, and set it forward; and therein <hi>we bind our selves by solemn Vows and Engagements</hi> to go on in it: <hi>both</hi> which are most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to effect and improve it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1st, <hi>It excites,</hi> and <hi>therein we exercise several Duties, that help on a good Life, and set it forward:</hi> All the Duties of worthy Receiving are instances of an Holy Life, as we have seen, and parts of a Good man: but several of them are not only <hi>particular Duties</hi> in <hi>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of all others</hi>: So that in performing and improving them, we do not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and grow in <hi>some</hi> Virtues; but make a way for our easier Discharge and fuller growth in <hi>all others</hi> also. And these are a <hi>fixt Remembrance</hi> and <hi>firm Faith of Christs wonderful kindness</hi> to us, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Dying</hi> for us; an <hi>intense Love,</hi> and <hi>hearty Thankfulness,</hi> and <hi>intire Resignation</hi> of our selves to his Service, and <hi>true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of all our Sins; all which, as they are much <hi>improved in a worthy Communion,</hi> so are they most <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in helping us to become Obedient</hi> and <hi>Good men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> I say these Duties are <hi>improved in us by the Holy Communion.</hi> And this they are by being both <hi>exercised,</hi> and <hi>excited</hi> in us at that time.</p>
                     <p>They are <hi>all exercised</hi> in every Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicant at that time, because in <hi>them,</hi> as we have seen, consists the <hi>worthiness of Receiving.</hi> And the more still they are exercised, the more they are improved. For all <hi>Habits</hi> come by usage, and Custome makes those things, which at first seemed strange, to become, not only <hi>Easie,</hi> but <hi>Natural</hi> to us. So that in exercising them at the Sacrament, we shall improve and add to them, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a greater measure of them,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52843:108"/>
than we brought when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we came.</p>
                     <p>And this we shall more especially do, because therein they are not only <hi>exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> but mightily <hi>excited</hi> in us also. The Holy Sacrament suggests such <hi>Powerful Motives</hi> to them, and presents us with such <hi>obliging Reasons</hi> for them, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have any where else; so that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take a better way, than by coming to it, to improve them. For therein we most <hi>solemnly</hi> and <hi>attently remember,</hi> how, <hi>when our sins had made us utter Enemies of God, and Heirs of Destruction, Christ laid down his own Life in our stead, and by that Ransome redeemed us from it.</hi> And this is not only the <hi>highest,</hi> but, in a manner, the <hi>sum total</hi> of all those inducements which can ingage us to these Virtues, or possess us with them. For what can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly raise so <hi>warm a Love of Christ</hi> in an <hi>ingenuous</hi> Spirit, that is sensible of what is done to it, as to see how infinitely he has Loved us, and, when we were his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Enemies, gave his own Life in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for ours? What can ever ingage us to so great. <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> as to think that a Person so far above us, and that stood in no need of us, and that was not sought to by us, and that was even th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

most frankly give his own self to do us a kindness? What can so powerfully move us to <hi>resign up our selves</hi> to any one, as to see that he has bestowed himself on us first to buy us off from our implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that for no Self-Interests or By-Ends of his own, but purely for our Eternal Happiness? What can work in us so <hi>hearty a Repentance,</hi> and provoke us into so <hi>utter an Indignation</hi> and <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of all our Sins, as to behold in our dear Lords Agonies what they deserv'd, and how unmeasurably mischievous they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and what inexpressible Tortures they brought on him, when he would put himself in our place, and undertake to answer for us? These things are most livelily set out, and powerfully suggested to us in this Blessed Sacrament, one chief business whereof is solemnly to Commemorate and make mention of them: and they are the most effectual means to raise in us a constant mindful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a zealous and intense Love of him that dyed for us, and an hearty Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for all his kindnesses, and a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance and utter abhorrence of all our Sins, and an intire Resignation of our selves to his Use an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52843:109"/>
perswasive Motives, and thus vividly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting to us the most Powerful Reasons for all these Virtues; it must needs be the best Course to improve in them, and we cannot lay out our time upon them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to more effect, in any other way.</p>
                     <p>Thus are the Duties of a fixt Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and firm Faith of Christs dying for us, of an intense Love, and hearty Thankfulness, and Resignation of our selves to his Service, and true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Abhorrence of all our Sins; very much set on and improved in all worthy Receivers by the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. They will be heightned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by receiving, because they are both <hi>exercised,</hi> and, by an <hi>objective Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation</hi> of most <hi>forcible inducements</hi> to them, powerfully <hi>excited</hi> in them at that time.</p>
                     <p>And as these Duties are all improved by the Holy Communion; so are they,</p>

For if, when we are temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52843:109"/>
to it, would at that instant readily <hi>suggest</hi> to us that <hi>Christ dyed</hi> for it, and that it put him to all the pain and anguish he suffered; we should not <hi>endure to come near it</hi>: If we have any <hi>true Love</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for him, we shall shew no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Favour</hi> or <hi>Compliance with it</hi>; if we are really <hi>Thankful</hi> for what he has done, for <hi>his sake we shall withstand</hi> it; if we are <hi>resign'd</hi> up to his use, we shall have <hi>nothing to do with it,</hi> because <hi>he</hi> is <hi>against</hi> it; and if we <hi>abhor</hi> it for the pains it put him to when he answer'd for it, and will at last put us to also if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it, we shall <hi>disdainfully reject</hi> and <hi>turn away</hi> from it. If we <hi>Believe</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member always, as we have need, that Christ died for our Sins, and procured us Pardon for them upon our Repentance, and Grace to get quit of them upon our best indeavours; that <hi>Faith</hi> will make us <hi>Obedient,</hi> and carry us on to amend them. If we truly <hi>Love</hi> Christ, that Love will make us <hi>do something for him,</hi> and cast to please and <note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 14.15.</note> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him. If we are <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for what is done, we shall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite him by any Sin, which for all his <hi>Benefits</hi> were to return the greatest <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> again. If we are <hi>resign'd</hi> up to his use, we shall <hi>Faithfully serve</hi> him. If we
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52843:110"/>
are <hi>heartily Penitent,</hi> and <hi>abhor</hi> our Sins, we shall <hi>forsake</hi> them. If we have this lively Faith and Remembrance of Christs dying for us, and this intense Love, and hearty Thankfulness, and entire Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our selves to his Service, and sincere Repentance, and utter Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all our Sins; If we have <hi>these Virtues,</hi> I say, and in these <hi>prevailing measures,</hi> they will carry us on to an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, and make us Obedient to all Gods Commandments. And therefore since this Holy Sacrament, when 'tis wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily received, doth so much improve these Virtues in us; it must needs help us on, and improve us in all others, and in the whole course of a good Life too.</p>
                     <p>Thus doth a worthy receiving by its own <hi>Natural tendency</hi> confirm and increase us in all good Living, by our <hi>exercising,</hi> and its <hi>exciting</hi> in us such Duties, as help it on and set it forward: and so doth it,</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> By our <hi>binding our selves thereat in solemn Vows, and Ingagements to go on in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One <hi>chief end</hi> of our meeting at this Feast, and <hi>prime part</hi> of our Worthiness in partaking of it, is to <hi>confirm the New Covenant,</hi> as we have seen, and to make God our Faithful promises, that from that day we will amend all our Faults, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> so we may attain that Pardon and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52843:110"/>
Happiness, which, upon our true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he comes to offer and assure to us. And these <hi>solemn Vows</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> are a fast hank upon us to make us leave our Sins, and do all that he requires of us. For every man <hi>ought,</hi> and thinks himself <hi>concerned</hi> to be as good as his word, and to perform what he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; especially when 'tis to one, who is too <hi>Wise</hi> to be <hi>deluded,</hi> and too <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Powerful</hi> to suffer any abuses of him to pass <hi>unrevenged,</hi> which all men, that understand any thing, believe of <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God.</hi> When we Promise and Vow to him, we know that he <hi>cannot be deceived,</hi> and that he <hi>will not be mocked</hi>; so that we must needs see it stands us in stead, and is our highest concern to perform with him. And therefore, since in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament we do in the most solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Vow to amend our ways, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise an Holy Life to Almighty God; in Regard none that are <hi>honest will,</hi> and none that are <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>serious dare</hi> be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of such sacred and solemn Compacts, <hi>it</hi> must needs be an excellent way to bind it fast upon our Souls, and fix it in our minds, and so help very much to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish and imprint it in us.</p>
                     <p>And thus we see how a worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conveys Grace, and confirms and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52843:111"/>
increases in us all Virtues by the <hi>Natural tendency</hi> of those Duties, which it <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,</hi> and <hi>excites</hi> in us. For <hi>it powerfully excites,</hi> and therein <hi>we exercise several Duties,</hi> which <hi>help on a Good Life,</hi> and <hi>set it forward</hi>; and <hi>bind our selves by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vows and Ingagements to go on in it, both</hi> which are most Powerful to improve and effect it.</p>
                     <p>And as it thus confirms and increases in us all Graces, by the <hi>Natural</hi> Virtue and <hi>Tendency</hi> of those Duties, which it <hi>excites</hi> in us; so does it,</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> By <hi>those inward Assistances, which it ministers and conveys to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Sacrament doth not only confer Grace by its <hi>Natural Tendency,</hi> as other means; but moreover, by virtue of <hi>Gods Promise</hi> and <hi>especial Bounty</hi> to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receivers of it, as it is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his hands. He tells us that he will do great things at the presence of it, and be liberal in Spiritual Blessings to all that duly partake in it: So that besides what they do from the Virtues themselves, which are exercised thereat, they may promise themselves much Spiritual Grace and Strength from his Free Gift, and immediate concurrence with it. For in the Sacrament he offers them all that outward Grace and Spiritual strength,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52843:111"/>
which Christs Death procured; and therefore, if they come to it worthily, so as their own unworthiness is no bar against it, that offer will be sure to take effect, and they shall undoubtedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And this is plainly intimated to us, when our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us of <hi>his Flesh</hi> that it is <hi>Bread,</hi> the true use and end whereof is for <note n="†" place="margin">Psal. 104.15.</note>

And therefore when any Persons turn <hi>Penitents,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to lead new Lives; <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>best Rules</hi> that can be given them is to frequent it. For it will carry them forward in their work, and, what by the Natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Duties themselves that are exercised in it, what by the Assistances
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52843:113"/>
that are conveyed by it, increase their Strength, and give them Power to go through with it. It will perfect them in Obedience by <hi>exercising,</hi> and <hi>exciting,</hi> and by both <hi>improving</hi> in them that <hi>Faith, Love, Thankfulness, Resignation,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> which are the most Genuine <hi>Principle</hi> and Effectual cause of it. It will bind it upon their Souls and ingage them to it, by their <hi>repeating</hi> every time they are at it, their <hi>solemn Vows</hi> and <hi>sacred Promises</hi> to go on in it. And it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to succeed in it, by bringing down from God those <hi>inward Helps</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Assistances,</hi> which shall bear them through it. So that if any man begins to look towards God, and longs to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the work of Reformation and Amendment: He ought in all Reason to seek out, and press in to be admitted to the Holy Sacrament. For it is one of the best Rules that can be prescribed in his Case, and serves his end above any thing: and therefore <hi>he</hi> must not in any wise shun it, but lay out for it above all men living. A man that will not Repent, indeed, whilst he continues in that mind, must not come to it; for he would not receive Good, but hurt by it. But if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to amend his ways, and seeks out for help, and would make use of any
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52843:113"/>
means which would do him most Service in effecting it: let him be constant at the Lords Table, and frequently Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. It will quicken him when once he is in the way to become Good, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his pace where he has need to be set forward, and strengthen him in those Parts where he is weak and most lyable to be assaulted, as St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> told the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> when he advised them to be fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And thus at last it appears what those Blessings are which come by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which are sufficient to ingage all good Souls to press to it of themselves, though it had no where been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. For it is a <hi>most effectual means to prevail with God in all their Prayers and thereby to obtain all Mercies,</hi> it <hi>Seals to them the pardon of their sins for the Peace of their Consciences,</hi> and <hi>Confirms</hi> and <hi>Augments in them all their Graces.</hi> So that

                     <p>To conclude this point then, the sum of what I have said to ingage mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence at <hi>this Feast,</hi> and to <hi>Communicate as often as an opportunity is offered,</hi> amounts to this: It is their <hi>Duty to come to the Communion,</hi> as much as it is to <hi>come to Church,</hi> to be <hi>Temperate, Humble, Just,</hi> or to perform any other <hi>Precepts</hi> of their <hi>Religion.</hi> For they have <hi>Christs express Command for it</hi>; who by injoyning it, has <hi>required Obedience in such an Instance, as best shows their peculiar Reverence and Love to him</hi>; and to ingage them to it, has <hi>freed them from all the load of</hi> Jewish <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and imposed no heavier Burden, than it, and Baptism, instead of them</hi>; and to make it take the more effect, <hi>left it among the last Words which he sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>One most General Hindrance, that keeps men from the Sacrament, is a Fear of their being Vnworthy and Vnfit to receive it. This Answer'd by shewing, <hi>1.</hi> The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of it, because they are not so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous about Neglecting, as about Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Receiving, though there be the same cause for it. <hi>2.</hi> That every true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is worthy of it: Yea, he that has only fully purposed Amendment, though he has not had time to perform it. <hi>3.</hi> Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52843:117"/>
which unfits them for it, is no Excuse for the Neglect of it. <hi>4.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent men, who alone are unfit, if they understand the danger of their State, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continue in it but amend it, and then they may worthily Communicate. <hi>2.</hi> A <hi>Second</hi> Hindrance is, because an Vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiver eats his own Damnation, <hi>1 Cor. 11.29.</hi> which makes not Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> seem the safer side. By Damnation is meant, <hi>1.</hi> A Damning Sin, which is deadly till we Repent of it; and such are both unworthy eating and sinful abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so that they are equal as to that point. <hi>2.</hi> Temporal Penalties, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for their Intemperance at this Feast, and other Disorders peculiar to those Times, and are not now usual in ours, so that the fear of them need not discourage us from it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SInce a worthy receiving of the Holy Sacrament is a <hi>Duty</hi> which our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so, 'tis like, all that pretend to serious Religion would, were it not that they
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52843:117"/>
have some Exceptions in their own minds against it, which, till they are removed, make all Discourses of the <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Vseful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of it fall without effect, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them, that, however <hi>necessary</hi> or <hi>adviseable</hi> it may be to <hi>others,</hi> yet it is not so to <hi>them,</hi> who have so <hi>just</hi> an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to excuse or discourage them from being present at it.</p>
                     <p>To give this Duty as fast hold as I can therefore on the <hi>Consciences</hi> of all those, who shall peruse this <hi>Treatise</hi>; having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready set forth the <hi>indispensable Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we have to it,</hi> I shall now proceed to <hi>remove those Hindrances, and to take off those Pleas, which are offer'd to excuse, and keep men back from complying with it.</hi> And as for <hi>them,</hi> the most weighty and considerable, which I have been able to learn, or have had opportunity to meet with, are such as follow.</p>
                     <p>Men are most ordinarily hindred from the Sacrament, notwithstanding it is so much both their <hi>Duty</hi> and their <hi>Interest</hi> to frequent it, by <hi>one,</hi> or other of these things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> Because <hi>they think themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, and unfit to receive it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> Because of <hi>the great danger of Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Communicating, Damnation being said to be eaten in it, which seems to make abstaining the safer side.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> I say, <hi>They shew great Partiality in this Plea,</hi> because <hi>they are not so Scrupulous about Neglecting, as about the unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, though there be the same cause to scruple it.</hi> They shew all their niceness in <hi>doing</hi> what God bids them, but none in <hi>letting of it alone</hi>; they are afraid of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending in coming to the Sacrament, but have no Fear of giving Offence in staying away from it: as if God had only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to receive unworthily, but had no where forbid them to absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and not receive at all.</p>
                     <p>But this, as I have already shewn, is a very wrong Judgment. For God doth as straitly <hi>injoyn</hi> a <hi>Worthy,</hi> as he <hi>forbids</hi> an <hi>Vnworthy</hi> Communicating. He has given us his Command for it, and that too with such Notes and Circumstances above-mentioned, as shew he lays a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular weight upon it, and highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to be obeyed in it. So that if we would not bring Guilt upon our selves by sinning against him, we must make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of <hi>not coming</hi> to the Sacrament, as well as of <hi>irreverent Treating</hi> and <hi>Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of it when we come.</p>

                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:52843:119"/>This then is very <hi>Partial</hi> and <hi>Vnfair</hi> dealing, to be scrupulous only about the <hi>manner of Performing</hi> this Duty, but to have no scruple at all about the <hi>Omission</hi> of it: as if, when God Commands us to <hi>do a thing, not to do it at all,</hi> were not as much a Fault as <hi>to do it wrong</hi>; and it were not equally transgressed when we <hi>Neglect,</hi> as when we <hi>Prophane</hi> it. And if all those, who are full of Fear about <hi>Vnworthy Receiving,</hi> would be but as Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>Sinful abstaining</hi>; this equal Fear on both sides would make them diligent in seeking satisfaction, and in carrying on the Work of Preparation: so that they might neither offend by <hi>coming,</hi> nor by <hi>staying away,</hi> but worthily approach the Lords Table, and be heartily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to it when they do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Every Penitent, who is Resolv'd to leave his Sins, and has begun the Change, is really worthy; so that the thoughts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness ought not to put him by it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is a <hi>true Penitent, who considers of all Gods Laws, and is resolved to keep them; and of all his own Sins, and is resolved to leave them: and so, changing his former evil Course and Practice, becomes a New Man.</hi> And whosoever doth this, he is a fit Person, and worthy to come to the Holy Communion. For all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52843:120"/>
of worthy Receiving, are Instances of Duty, as has been observ'd, and parts of a Good Man; so that every man, who turns Penitent and becomes Good, will be endowed with all of them. Nay, if any man were to learn them, there would be no difficulty in any thing else, if <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> would go down with him: So that any Person who Repents, may do every thing else which God Requires of him. The great things expected of us at this Feast, as has been said, are these; namely, That we <hi>give thanks for Christs Death,</hi> and <hi>resign our selves up to his Service,</hi> and <hi>Repent of all our Sins,</hi> and be in <hi>Love and Charity with all Persons,</hi> and <hi>have Faith in Christ and his Merits:</hi> And all these are easie, and create no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to a Penitent Person. For is it not an easie thing for him to <hi>thank Christ,</hi> who verily believes he <hi>dyed</hi> for him? And cannot he readily <hi>resign</hi> himself up to his use, who has already given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up to an <hi>Holy Life,</hi> which is all the use that he would make of him? And is not he in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> with all men, who has <hi>Repented</hi> of all his Sins, and then surely of <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Vnpeaceableness</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them? And doth not he <hi>believe in Christ, i. e.</hi> doth not he <hi>believe those things which his Saviour Christ has declared to

him,</hi> viz. That <hi>he dyed for us to purchase Terms of Grace</hi>; and that now, for his sake, God will <hi>forgive us any Sins,</hi> when we <hi>Repent</hi> of them, and <hi>help us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to any <hi>Graces</hi> when we <hi>indeavour</hi> after them, and <hi>give us Eternal Life in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> when we <hi>intirely obey</hi> him, but that <hi>otherwise,</hi> than upon <hi>these Terms,</hi> he will not give us any of them; which are those Declarations he makes to us in the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and wherein he expects to be <hi>trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>believed</hi> by us: doth not every <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi> man, I say, <hi>believe</hi> all this, who is at the pains to <hi>live</hi> according to it, and <hi>Repents</hi> that he may be <hi>pardoned,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi> that he may be <hi>assisted,</hi> and <hi>obeys</hi> that he may be <hi>graciously rewarded</hi> for it?

And all this <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> and <hi>Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards all men, which are likewise required, are not only <hi>easie after</hi> it, but are <hi>parts of</hi> it: for if we are <hi>unthankful</hi> for Christs Benefits, or <hi>unresigned</hi> to his use, or out
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52843:121"/>
of <hi>Charity</hi> with any Persons, we have not yet <hi>Repented</hi> of <hi>all</hi> our sins, but, as to <hi>these</hi> at least, are still <hi>Impenitent.</hi> So that where once Repentance of all our sins is, there is or <hi>may be</hi> in us, every thing else, which God requires at this Feast to fit us worthily to partake of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus is every true Penitent sit to eat at the Table of his Lord, and to be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicant. And therefore when any Persons do from their Hearts Repent them of all their sins, and are fully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to lead new Lives thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; let them not be afraid to come to the Sacrament, for they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as God accounts worthy of it. If they have not shaken hands with their sins, indeed, but live still in them, and are ready to repeat them on the next oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; they will come unworthily whilst they are in that state, and not be made the better, but the worse for it. But if they have broke loose from them, and have been acted by Gods Fear, and led new Lives for some time; and are still putting out more indeavours, and praying for more Grace to do this yet more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly: they are the Persons whom God calls to this Feast, and may justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to receive an hearty welcome at it.</p>

                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:52843:121"/>Nay, if their Return to God has been so late, as that they have not yet had time sufficient for <hi>well-doing,</hi> but only for <hi>holy purposing</hi> that they will do well as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they shall have occasion: yet, if out of a <hi>serious Conviction</hi> of the <hi>detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of every sinful Course,</hi> they are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to leave it</hi>; and after a <hi>due Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of every part of their Duty,</hi> they are <hi>fully,</hi> and <hi>without all reserve resolved to practise it</hi>; I doubt not, but that this <hi>will</hi> and <hi>purpose,</hi> before the time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for <hi>Practice</hi> come, will render them welcome Guests, and worthy to Communicate.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52843:122"/>
to this Feast, they are <hi>worthy</hi> to come to it, and will be sure to meet with a kind and hearty entertainment. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are fully agreed in their own Thoughts, and the Terms of Reconciliation betwixt them are consented to on <hi>both</hi> sides: for he proclaims <hi>Mercy</hi> upon <hi>Repentance,</hi> and they thankfully accept it; he offers to return into Favour with every Sinner that will amend his Faults, and they are glad of the joyful News, and fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to do it. And since they are both agreed upon the thing, what should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from coming to the Sacrament, which he has appointed for this very end, that therein they may give their express consent to this Agreement, and mutually make this Declaration.</p>
                     <p>Thus is every man, who has left his sins, and begun to lead a New Life; or, who is fully purposed in his own mind, and absolutely intends so to do; a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Guest at this Feast, and worthy to Communicate: so that no apprehensions of unworthiness ought to put him by it.</p>
                     <p>And as for those who neither have left all their sins, nor are determined in their own hearts, and wholly bent upon it; they are plainly <hi>Impenitent,</hi> and thereupon most unworthy to Communicate. But then,</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>ly, That Impenitence, which unfits them
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52843:123"/>
for it, is no excuse at all for the neglect of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Impenitence</hi> will excuse a man in no act, but is it self a very great aggravation of it. It is no <hi>extenuating Plea,</hi> but a <hi>Damning Fault</hi>; so that no man must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope to escape the easier after he has omitted any Duty, by giving it as the Reason for it. When God calls us to the Sacrament, to promise him that we will amend our Faults, and lead new Lives thenceforward; if we return An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that we <hi>come not</hi> because we are <hi>Impenitent,</hi> that is as much as to say, we <hi>come not</hi> as he bids because we <hi>will</hi> not, which is certainly the worst plea that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was made for any offence, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver render his Case better, but much worse that uses it.</p>
                     <p>As for those then, who keep away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>Impenitent</hi>; they are left without all Plea, and have no excuse at all to make for their not coming to the Holy Sacrament. The only thing that can stand them in stead, either as to it or as to any thing else, is their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Amendment; which they will not delay, if they consider in how great need they stand of it. For, as I said,</p>
                     <p n="4">4<hi>ly, Impenitent men, who are unworthy of it, if they understand the danger and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52843:123"/>
of their state, can by no means continue in it, but must forthwith Repent and Amend, and then this hindrance is gone, and they may worthily approach to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If they understand the danger and misery of their state,</hi> I say, <hi>they cannot continue in it.</hi> For so long as they remain Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in <hi>many,</hi> or in any <hi>one known</hi> sin, they are not only unfit to <hi>receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as I have shewn, but also to <hi>say their Prayers,</hi> to <hi>give Thanks,</hi> to <hi>make Vows,</hi> or to have any thing to do with God in any other part of <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> and Service. They are shut out from all benefits of Religion, they have no Salvation by <hi>Christ,</hi> nor any hopes of Heaven: if they happen to dye suddenly whilst they are in this state, or are call'd away before the work of Reformation is finished, (as 'tis greatly to be feared they may, if they put it off for the <hi>present,</hi> and as in all likelihood they will if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it till their <hi>Death-Bed,</hi> at which time 'tis a very rare thing for any man to go through with it) they will go to <hi>Hell,</hi> there to be tormented with the insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Anguish of a <hi>wounded Conscience,</hi> and <hi>unsatisfied Appetites,</hi> and a <hi>Raging Fire,</hi> and all the <hi>Terrors</hi> and <hi>Disconsolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Darkness,</hi> and the utmost malice of <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Damn'd Spirits,</hi> and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52843:124"/>
                        <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Confusion of Face</hi>; all which they must undergo without any <hi>Eye to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or <hi>Friend to Comfort</hi> them, or any <hi>one to refresh</hi> them, or any <hi>Abatement,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission,</hi> for <hi>evermore</hi>: And this is a state of such Horrour and Astonishment, as no man, that looks upon it, can abide in: it is a condition of such extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as no one in his Wits can willingly indure. So that if any of those, who are <hi>Impenitent,</hi> will but be at the pains to lay to heart, and consider of the sadness of their state; they can by no means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in it, but will run with haste to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and instantly set about the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ways, that so they may be delivered from it.</p>
                     <p>And as soon as ever they do so, this hindrance is gone, and they are <hi>worthy</hi> to come to the Holy Communion. For that which <hi>fits</hi> us for it, is not an <hi>high Pitch</hi> and <hi>Perfection in saving Virtues,</hi> or <hi>Ecstatick Degrees</hi> and <hi>Transports in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> as I have shewn; but such <hi>true Repentance</hi> and change of Life, either in <hi>Deed,</hi> or at least in <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Purpose,</hi> as makes us <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>honest Christians</hi>; so that whatever we were before, whilst we continued impenitently wicked, we are meet Partakers of this Holy Feast, now we have Repented, and are fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52843:124"/>
to become Obedient, and need not scrupulously draw back, but come to it gladly when we are call'd, and expect a Friendly welcome when we do.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have consider'd this great, and most common plea, whereby so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are kept back from the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz. their thinking themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, and unfit to</hi> receive it; and shewn plainly that no <hi>ill</hi> man <hi>can be excused,</hi> and that no <hi>good</hi> man <hi>ought to be hindred</hi> by it. And the Result of it is this. If any Person tells me he cannot come to this Feast, because he is <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to join in it</hi>: I must tell him again, That he <hi>must not only be afraid of unworthy coming to it, but also of unworthy abstaining from it</hi>; and that <hi>unless he is impenitent, and still unresolv'd to leave all his Sins, he is worthy of it</hi>; and that if <hi>such Impenitence is the cause of his not coming, it is no excuse for it</hi>; and that <hi>he must consider of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and misery of that state, and so Repent and get out of it</hi>; and when once that is done he will be worthy, since <hi>every Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is welcome</hi> to it. If he is <hi>truly Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> he <hi>is worthy</hi>; and if he has not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented yet, he must <hi>instantly Repent</hi> that he <hi>may be worthy</hi>; and then let him not hold off from this Heavenly Banquet, but chearfully approach to it when he is invited.</p>

He that eats and drinks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, eats and drinks Damnation to himself,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29.</p>
                     <p>Now in <hi>Answer</hi> to this, I shall observe, that by <hi>Damnation</hi> is meant,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A <hi>Damning sin, which is deadly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man till he Repent of it</hi>; and such are both <hi>unworthy eating,</hi> and <hi>sinful abstaining, so that they are equal as to that Point.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Temporal Death and Punishments,</hi> which were inflicted on the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their <hi>Intemperance at this Feast,</hi> and <hi>other Disorders which were peculiar to those times, and are not usual now in ours; so that the Fear of them need not discourage us from it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> I say, By <hi>eating his own Damnation,</hi> the Apostle means not <hi>that he shall inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably be damn'd for it</hi>; but only that <hi>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a Damning Sin, which will prove dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him unless he Repent of it:</hi> and this is true, not only of <hi>unworthy eating,</hi> but also of <hi>sinful abstaining, so that they are equal as to that Point.</hi>

be Damn'd for it.</hi> And this is plain, because for Christs sake, God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>to forgive us all our sins upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and therefore this of <hi>unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> among the rest. Nay, as for this their <hi>unworthy eating,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in that very place, that <hi>when they are Judg'd</hi> or Condemned for it, it is not to consign them to, but to deliver them from Eternal Torment. <hi>When we are Judg'd,</hi> says he, or Condemn'd for this Fault, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> which God inflicted because of it; <hi>we are</hi> not in Anger Punish'd, but in Mercy <hi>Chastned of the Lord</hi> by present Sufferings, <hi>that we should not</hi> at the last day <hi>be Condemn'd with the World</hi> to Eternal. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30, 31.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A Third</hi> Hindrance is, because therein they are to promise concerning every sin, that they will no more commit it; which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise some dare not make, because they fear they shall not keep it. If this be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to hinder any man from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, it ought also to hinder him from Prayers, and being Baptized a Christian. But it must not hinder men from any of them. <hi>1.</hi> Let them Promise this Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and keep it, and then the Doubt is answered. They ought to make it. And by Gods Grace they may perform it, if they have a mind to it. <hi>2.</hi> If after some time they happen to break it in any Instance, they have the Benefit of Repentance afterwards. <hi>A Fourth</hi> Hindrance is the great difficulty supposed to be in it, and want of time and leisure to prepare for it. This lies not more
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52843:130"/>
against the Communion, than against an Holy Life and all Religion. But it must not put us by from any of them. For, <hi>1.</hi> If it required all that time and pains which is supposed, that would be no excuse for any of us to neglect it. To true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, the time and pains is not so great as is imagined. It requires more of ill men, but less of Good, who may prepare for it in a less time, yea, if used to Self-examinations, upon a few minutes warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>3.</hi> The poorest and most imployed have time sufficient if they would use it to that end: and where they have fewer helps, and less time, the less preparation is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of them. <hi>A Fifth</hi> Hindrance is, because they see others, or have found themselves to be no better by it; so that 'tis not worth their while to fit themselves for it. If this have any Force, it is not to be restrained to the Sacrament, but holds stronger against Prayers, and other parts of Worship. But it ought not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Persons. For, <hi>1.</hi> Where it is true there is no excuse from it. <hi>2.</hi> In all good mens case 'tis false, for they are really better by it; many by improving in their goodness, all by continuing in it, for which it is richly worth their pains to come to it. <hi>3.</hi> Where they are not bettered at all, or not so much as might be expected; that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52843:130"/>
is purely through their own Fault, in not using the means of improving by it: so let them amend that, and this Hindrance is removed.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Third</hi> thing that keeps back several from the Sacrament, though both in Duty to their Saviour, and in tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to their own Souls, they are most straitly bound to frequent it, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>therein they are to promise concerning every sin they find themselves guilty of, that they will no more commit it; and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise they dare not make, because they fear they shall not keep it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as for these Persons, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them to consider, that if this be a sufficient hindrance to keep them from this Ordinance, it is equally so to keep them from their <hi>Prayers,</hi> nay, from their very <hi>Baptism,</hi> and being inroll'd <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> For God will not hear their <hi>Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Pardon of any Sin</hi> till they <hi>Repent</hi> of it, and resolve within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and make him Faithful promises that they will never more commit it. Nor did he admit them to <hi>Baptism,</hi> to be list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Members of his Church,</hi> till they had <hi>Renounced the Devil and all his works,</hi> with <hi>all the sinful Lusts of the Flesh,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to keep his Holy Will and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52843:131"/>
and walk in the same all the days of of their Lives.</hi> If we stick at these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises then, we must scruple saying our Prayers, and boggle at all Religion, and, if we were yet <hi>unbaptized,</hi> upon this account refuse our Baptism, since therein we <hi>did,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to make as large and express promises of leaving all our sins, as we <hi>can,</hi> or are <hi>required</hi> to make in the <hi>Holy Communion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to those, who are afraid of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament upon this account, I have these <hi>two</hi> things to add.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Promise this Amendment, and keep it, and then the Doubt is answer'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though <hi>after some time they should forget themselves, and break it in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, yet still have they the benefit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance afterwards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> I would advise them to <hi>promise this amendment, and keep it, and then the Doubt is answered.</hi> When the Objection against <hi>promising,</hi> is only the danger of <hi>performing,</hi> when they both <hi>can</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to perform: it is an objection that lies only against <hi>themselves,</hi> in a suspicion that they will be wanting to their own bounden Duty and Service; and that is better removed by their care faithfully to discharge it, than by any thing that I can say to it. They <hi>ought to perform it,</hi>
                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:52843:131"/>
and <hi>if they will they may do it</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them be careful to do that, and this difficulty is ended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They ought,</hi> I say, <hi>to perform this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment which they promise to Almighty God,</hi> and leave every sin which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have committed. God will not forgive us any <hi>Fault,</hi> whilst we persist <hi>Impenitent,</hi> and continue to repeat it; but requires first, on <hi>our</hi> part, that we <hi>forsake</hi> and amend it. <hi>Sin no more,</hi> says our Saviour to the <hi>Woman taken in Adultery,</hi> and then <hi>will not I condemn thee,</hi> Joh. 8.4.11. And <hi>let the Wicked</hi> man <hi>forsake his ways,</hi> says God by <hi>Isaiah, and return unto the Lord, and</hi> then <hi>he will have mercy upon him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly pardon.</hi> Is. 5.7. It is no indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent matter that is left to our own choice, whether we will leave our sins, or no; but the thing must of necessity be done, if ever we hope to appease God, or go to Heaven: so that we must not be less forward to promise, for that is our Duty, but more careful to perform.</p>
                     <p>And as they <hi>ought</hi> to perform this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, which they promise to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; so by <hi>his Grace</hi> they <hi>may</hi> perform it, if they <hi>will</hi> and have a mind to it. When at this Feast they say they <hi>will</hi> never commit <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> sin any more, as God has required; they say not that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52843:132"/>
they will never be <hi>surprized</hi> into it, but that they will never act it <hi>willfully, i. e.</hi> when they see and are aware of it; or, if at any time they do, that they will not <hi>persist</hi> in it, but <hi>amend</hi> it, <hi>Repentance</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways going along from the <hi>beginning</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Gospel Covenant.</hi> And this by <hi>Gods help</hi> they all may do, if they make it their serious business, and lay out their utmost care and pains upon it. For when a mans <hi>Conscience</hi> tells him that the thing is sinful which he is about to act, or at least he could readily see it, if he would direct his Eye to it: he need not go on unless he will, but, if he please, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly turn away from it. This, I say, he may do; for if he will not be wanting to himself, God will not be wanting to him in it, but inable him effectually to abstain from it when he duly indeavours it. If once we are careful to <hi>work out our own Salvation</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us that <hi>he will work in us both to will, and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. <hi>To him that hath, i. e.</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys what he hath, our Saviour promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that <hi>more shall still be given,</hi> Mat. 25.29: and elsewhere again, <hi>God will give the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to those that ask him.</hi> Luc. 11.13.</p>

but be careful so to do, and then this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance will give them no more trouble, but be quite removed. They will have no cause to be slow to promise, what they will be thus honestly careful to perform.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though <hi>afterwards they should forget themselves, and break this promise in some instance; yet is not their case desperate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, but they have still the benefit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance afterwards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed, if they break it as soon as ever they have made it, and run <hi>constant changes</hi> in <hi>sinning</hi> and <hi>repenting,</hi> perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time, and transgressing it the next: that Repentance will be of no avail with God, because it rests only in <hi>fair Words</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> or at best in some <hi>faint attempts,</hi> without any <hi>real Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Amendment.</hi> Nay, if they fall a Second time into some sins, which <hi>lay waste the Conscience,</hi> such as <hi>Murder, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, willful Perjury,</hi> and the like, which <hi>few</hi> good men can ever incur at <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>fewer</hi> can afterwards <hi>Repeat,</hi> when once they have smarted for it: it may still give cause why the sufficiency of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance should be questioned. But if in sins which are more <hi>ordinarily incurred,</hi> as <hi>Discontent, Pride, Revenge, Backbiting, Passion,</hi> &amp;c. which are generally meant by those who are kept back by this Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52843:133"/>
If after they have promised to leave <hi>these</hi> sins, I say, they go on for some due time to make good their word, and avoid the fault in several opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that lead them to it, but at last hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to forget themselves, and break it in some Instance: yet doth not that <hi>null</hi> their former Repentance, or make their Case desperate thereupon; but they have still the <hi>benefit of Repentance afterwards,</hi> and by amending what they have done amiss, may be perfectly r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For God will <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> us upon our <hi>Repentance,</hi> not only <hi>Once,</hi> or a <hi>Second</hi> time, but as <hi>often</hi> as there is occasion. So that if after we have promised in the Sacrament, that we will never more be guilty of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sin, we yield to it at length, and are a-new overcome: let us but Repent of that Breach, and fully resolve against it a second time, and then we are made whole as we were in our former station.</p>
                     <p>As for this Hindrance then, whereby some are kept back from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> Their <hi>promising therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning every Fault that they will no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, which promise they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52843:133"/>
For let them <hi>promise this Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>keep it,</hi> and then the <hi>Doubt is answered.</hi> Or, if after they have kept it for some time, they happen to <hi>fail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some occasion</hi>; let them <hi>Repent of that Breach,</hi> and make <hi>new Promises and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,</hi> and then they are <hi>whole again.</hi> And all this has nothing in it that <hi>can be avoided,</hi> or <hi>ought to be feared,</hi> but is all <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>desirable</hi> to be done: for it is their <hi>Duty thus to promise,</hi> and <hi>their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to perform,</hi> and their <hi>great Priviledge,</hi> that, if they fail in any instance after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon repeating their <hi>Repentance</hi> they shall receive a <hi>Pardon.</hi> It is what every man must do, not only to be a <hi>worthy Communicant,</hi> but to be a <hi>Christian.</hi> For the same things are promised in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and in <hi>Holy Baptism</hi>: so that if any man draw back from <hi>them,</hi> and sticks to <hi>promise them</hi>; he must not <hi>pray</hi> to God, nor pretend to <hi>Religion,</hi> nor, were he to chuse again, be <hi>baptized</hi> into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Profession.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A <hi>Fourth</hi> thing which keeps back several from the Sacrament, Is <hi>the great difficulty they apprehend to be in a worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it, and their want of time and leisure to prepare for it.</hi> They fancy it is a very <hi>hard</hi> thing for any man worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Communicate; and since 'tis <hi>hard,</hi>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:52843:134"/>
in must needs require much <hi>time</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> to prepare themselves for it: and as for their parts, they have little <hi>leisure</hi> from their <hi>business,</hi> and are not made to <hi>master Difficulties</hi>; so that they must be content, and hope they shall be excused, if they abstain from it.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>objection</hi> many are ready to make against coming to the Communion. But every Christian will be much ashamed of it, and slow to urge it a <hi>second</hi> time, when once he considers, that it lies not more against <hi>it,</hi> than against an <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God has required no more <hi>Virtues</hi> in us at the <hi>time of Receiving,</hi> than he requires at <hi>all other times</hi> to render us <hi>acceptable Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to fit us to say our <hi>Prayers,</hi> or to give us any <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>Eternal Happiness.</hi> So that if any man says the work of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is <hi>over-hard,</hi> and therefore he is <hi>not willing,</hi> or <hi>wants time</hi> to fit himself for Receiving: he may as well say he is not <hi>willing,</hi> or <hi>wants time</hi> to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> or to go to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and upon that Plea may with equal Reason bid adieu to <hi>all Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to answer this more particularly, I must observe to them,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:52843:134"/>1. That <hi>if it did really require all this time and pains to prepare for it, yet would that be no sufficient Reason or Excuse for any of us to Neglect it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>to all true Penitents it is not so difficult, nor requires so much time as is imagined; so that they have not so much as this Discouragement to make them backward in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That <hi>all, even the poorest and most em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, have time sufficient, if they will use it to that end; and that of those, who have less lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and abilities, so as that they cannot fit themselves in great Degrees, God expects the less preparation, and accepts it at their hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. I say, <hi>If it did really require all this time and pains to prepare for it which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, yet would that be no sufficient Reason or Excuse for any of us to negl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ct it.</hi> For when God bids us do a thing, can any man think it a good excuse to say, <hi>I would if it were not troublesome, or long a doing</hi>? Must we perform those things only at his Command, which are easie, and soon over; but neglect all others, which imploy more care and pains, and require to be attended longer? How we may like such <hi>Masters,</hi> I will not say, but I am sure God will entertain no such <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> as will pick and chuse with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and obey them no further than
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52843:135"/>
their <hi>own ease</hi> and <hi>occasions</hi> will suffer them. No, he expects we should do him Service, though it be with difficulty and loss to our own selves. And this in all Reason <hi>he</hi> may very well require of <hi>us,</hi> because <hi>we</hi> our selves, who can plead no such <hi>Deserts,</hi> nor make any such <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences</hi> as he propose, do all look for it from <hi>our Servants,</hi> in any business they are to do for <hi>us.</hi> For if we set them to any work, we shall think it a very odd Answer, if they tell us they would do it for us, but that they are unwilling to be at <hi>so much pains,</hi> or to spare <hi>so much time</hi> as it requires.</p>
                     <p>Although a worthy Communicating then would require much time and pains to prepare for it, yet would not that be a just excuse for any Person to Neglect it. For since God <hi>Commands it,</hi> nay, <hi>Commands it urgently,</hi> and lays a great weight upon it; we are bound in all Duty to perform it, though it cost us both <hi>time</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> so to do.</p>
                     <p>But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To all true Penitents it is not so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, nor requires so much time as is imagined; so that they have not so much as this Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to make them backward in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Difficulty</hi> of <hi>worthy Receiving</hi> lies not in <hi>giving Christ Thanks,</hi> or <hi>believing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52843:135"/>
the Scripture</hi> and all its Promises, as I have shewn; but only in <hi>Repenting of all our Sins.</hi> And this, indeed, has <hi>more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in it, and requires more time to ill men, who are held Captives by them; but not very much to good, who are already set free, and have broke off from them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. I say, <hi>Repentance of all their Sins, and amendment of their Lives, has more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, and requires more time to ill men.</hi> For they have many Lusts to pare off which are very dear to them, and many things to set straight, which cannot all be done upon the sudden. When they come to enter upon a good Life, who as yet are strangers to it; they must <hi>consider particularly</hi> of <hi>all Gods Laws</hi> which are the <hi>Rule</hi> of it, and <hi>examine</hi> their own Hearts at <hi>every one,</hi> to see against which of them they have <hi>offended,</hi> and there make their <hi>particular purposes,</hi> and <hi>full resolutions of Amendment.</hi> They must spend <hi>time</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> upon this <hi>examination,</hi> to bring them to a <hi>Penitent purpose,</hi> and a <hi>deliberate well-weighed Resolution</hi>: and when that is done, it will cost them more time and pains still in <hi>frequent Tryals,</hi> as in the course of Life and Business they meet with oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to <hi>practise</hi> and <hi>perform</hi> what they have resolv'd upon. For, when upon a strict Review of their whole Lives
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52843:136"/>
they find they have several sins to amend, they must not think, after they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved against them, to get perfectly quit of them on the <hi>sudden.</hi> But they must withstand the Temptations to them <hi>once</hi> and <hi>again,</hi> and pass through frequent Tryals, and exercise themselves in many Conflicts, before they will have got the Conquest, and be indeed reformed from them.</p>
                     <p>Thus will it require both much time and pains for an <hi>ill man</hi> to become good, and not only to <hi>Resolve</hi> that he will amend all his ways, but to put in <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>'Tis true, indeed, I cannot say the <hi>actual amendment</hi> of every Fault, and the <hi>performance</hi> as well as <hi>purpose</hi> of obeying in every Commandment, is necessary to a <hi>worthy Communicant.</hi> For a <hi>full Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of amendment, without staying for time and opportunities to fulfill it, is sufficient to fit us for this Feast; as I have observ'd it did in the <hi>Apostles Days,</hi> when, upon their first Conversion and becoming Penitent, before they had time to perform what they had promised, men were admitted to the Sacrament, as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Worship.

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It doth not require very much to good, who are set free, and have broke off from them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great thing which they have to do, is to <hi>examine what are their Faults,</hi> and to find out their own miscarriages: for if once they <hi>discover</hi> them, they are so <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually</hi> set to amend every thing that is amiss, that they will quickly <hi>resolve</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. And this discovery they will make much <hi>easier,</hi> and <hi>sooner,</hi> than ill men can. For their Faults being few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, are sooner run over; and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences being tender, and used to observe them, they do better remember them, and are the readier, when they are ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to give in an Information of them, than the others are. Indeed, if they do not accustome themselves to <hi>Self-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> they will find the more to do, and need a longer time, when they come to them: But if they are much vers'd in them, especially if they take an account of the <hi>Day past every Evening</hi>; having daily discovered and acknowledged all their Faults, they will bear them still in mind, and have an habitual sense of them; and so be able at any time, to tell what acts they are to promise and resolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at a few minutes warning; as we
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52843:137"/>
may well suppose they did in the first times, when they Communicated <hi>every day,</hi> and, under the <hi>pressing wants</hi> and <hi>distractions</hi> they conflicted with, could not set apart <hi>whole hours</hi> for <hi>preparation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus is the work of <hi>Preparation for the Communion,</hi> not so <hi>difficult to true Penitents,</hi> nor requiring so much time as some have imagined. It may cost them some time whilst they imploy their Thoughts in actuating their <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> and <hi>other Graces,</hi> before they come; but if they have little leisure for it, this need not be long a doing; for most <hi>good</hi> minds are so <hi>inclined</hi> and <hi>habituated</hi> to these Tempers, that they can express them, and that too, answerable to the Degree of Warmth their Complexion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> allows in other things, with <hi>Fervor</hi> and <hi>Intension,</hi> upon any warning. But the great Work, which may seem to have <hi>length</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> in it, is <hi>Repentance of all their Sins</hi>; and this will not be either <hi>long,</hi> or <hi>troublesome</hi> to <hi>them.</hi> For the only thing that will give them trouble in it, is the Work of <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> to find out what their sins have been; their Hearts being so good, that they can quickly resolve against them, when once they have discovered them: and this they will not find tedious, but may dispatch in convenient time. If
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52843:138"/>
they were yet to begin the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, indeed, they must spend more <hi>hours,</hi> or <hi>days</hi> upon it, and be held to it so long, till they could run over <hi>all Gods Laws,</hi> and <hi>all their own actions,</hi> and work themselves up into <hi>firm purposes</hi> of amendment at every thing they find was done amiss through their whole Lives, which would be a more <hi>tedious</hi> and <hi>painful</hi> business: So that when <hi>ill men</hi> come to prepare themselves for the Sacrament, they must set out more time for it, and expect to pass through greater hardship. But then they must remember not to charge this upon the <hi>Communion,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>New Life</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi>; it not being for the work of worthy Receiving, but of Repentance and Reformation, which they must go through with whether they receive or no, that all this time is spent, and hard pains taken. But if they have begun to Repent long ago, and have indeavoured carefully to become <hi>good</hi> men; a much less time will serve their turn: for they will be able presently to <hi>resolve</hi> against a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they have not been used to <hi>frequent Examinations,</hi> so as to have all their sins at hand before them; it may

hold them a longer time: but if they have examined <hi>often,</hi> especially if they have reviewed and acknowledged <hi>every Night</hi> their <hi>every Days</hi> Transgressions, they will be able to do it at a <hi>few minutes</hi> warning. So that if they should happen at any time to be <hi>surprized</hi> with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which it is not <hi>decent</hi> for any good Christian to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But besides that <hi>it would be no sufficient excuse to any Person to neglect the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, though it required all that time and pains which is supposed</hi>; and that <hi>to all true Penitents it is not so tedious, or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as some have imagined, so that they have not so much as this discouragement in make them backward in it:</hi> I proceed now,</p>

                     <p>That which makes them apprehend they have no time for it, is a perswasion, that <hi>all preparation must be carried on in the Closet,</hi> when they are sequestred from all <hi>worldly Affairs,</hi> and have set themselves apart for <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Religious Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> And for doing this, they who are <hi>full of business,</hi> who must <hi>labour</hi> all the day long, till they have quite tired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for <hi>maintenance,</hi> or whose time is not at their <hi>own disposal,</hi> but at the <hi>will of others,</hi> complain they have no leisure, or vacant time to spare.</p>
                     <p>But now, besides that no persons must pretend they can find no time for <hi>set De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</hi> and <hi>separate Thoughts,</hi> since the most imployed of all can find it sometimes to throw away on <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Diversions:</hi> this conceit, <hi>that all preparation ought to be carried on in the Closet,</hi> is a mistake; for, when any Persons are so minded, it may go on whilst they are <hi>held at work,</hi> and <hi>inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> in the <hi>course of their imployment.</hi> For the great business of preparation, as has been shewn, lies in <hi>examining our own hearts,</hi> to find out what our sins have been, and in <hi>resolving</hi> particularly against them. And this a man may carry on in any place,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52843:139"/>
where he has Liberty for thought and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection.

                     <p>And as for <hi>for those, who have less lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and opportunities, so as that they cannot fit themselves in great Degrees, God expects the less preparation,</hi> I say, <hi>and accepts it at their hands.</hi>

                     <p>Thus much he expects of every man, and that all <hi>may</hi> and <hi>must</hi> perform, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>they examine themselves about all those things which they know are sinful, and, wheresoever they find themselves Guilty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve stedfastly to do so no more, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ask his Pardon</hi>; and that they <hi>have an affectionate thankful sense of Christs Death, and of all that he has done for them.</hi> But as for the <hi>Degrees</hi> of these Duties, how <hi>high</hi> they shall be in their <hi>Detestation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sin,</hi> how <hi>ardent</hi> in their Acts of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,</hi> how <hi>Passionate</hi> in their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Thankful Affection</hi>; though he is well pleased with it where he finds it, yet he exacts not the <hi>utmost height,</hi> as I have

that is <hi>no sufficient ground for any person to neglect it</hi>; because when God <hi>commands</hi> us to do a thing, as he has done most strictly in this Case, we must be willing to spend both <hi>time</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> upon it. But in reality, it is neither <hi>so pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> nor <hi>tedious to good men,</hi> as is <hi>ordinarily imagined.</hi> It costs more, indeed, to <hi>ill men,</hi> because they have <hi>more faults to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine</hi> after, and <hi>more backwardness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve</hi> against them; but this expence of time and pains they must not impute to the <hi>Communion,</hi> but to an <hi>Holy Life</hi> and <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which, whether they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate or no, if they Love their own Souls they must labour and manfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in. But as for <hi>Good men,</hi> their great work is <hi>Self-examination,</hi> it being an easie thing for them to resolve against any sins when they see them; and this will not be long or tedious to them: nay, if they have been used to examine <hi>often,</hi> and to call themselves to an account <hi>every evening,</hi> if necessity so requires, it may be dispatch'd at a <hi>few minutes</hi> warning. It is a thing which <hi>all men,</hi> even the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>most imployed, may find time for,</hi> yea, when there is need of it, without <hi>hindring</hi> or <hi>neglecting any other affair, if they are careful to use it to that end</hi>; and when they have <hi>less leisure</hi> and <hi>abilities,</hi> so as that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52843:141"/>
they cannot <hi>fit themselves</hi> in <hi>great Degrees,</hi> there God expects the <hi>less preparation,</hi> and <hi>accepts it</hi> at their hands. To Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, is a most <hi>necessary Duty,</hi> which <hi>will not be excused</hi>; and a most <hi>equitable</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> one, which <hi>need not be declined</hi>; so that no pretence of <hi>hardship,</hi> or of <hi>want of time</hi> ought ever to be urged, or can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be allowed to put us by it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A <hi>Fifth</hi> thing, which hinders seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral from the Sacrament, and makes them carelesly to neglect it, is because <hi>they see others, or have found themselves to be no whit bettered or improved by it; so that 'tis not worth their while to fit themselves for it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a plea, which some, who are pretty constant in <hi>other Ordinances,</hi> are wont to make for their great neglect of <hi>this.</hi> But if there be any weight in it, they are much to blame in restraining it to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> since it would hold much stronger for their <hi>not coming to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> or the <hi>publick Assemblies,</hi> or <hi>other parts of Worship.</hi> For these same persons that make this Complaint, of being lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better'd or improved by <hi>it,</hi> could say the same of <hi>them</hi> too if they had a mind to it. For they are much more frequent in <hi>reading the Scriptures,</hi> in <hi>saying their Prayers,</hi> in <hi>hearing Sermons,</hi> and in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52843:141"/>
in all <hi>other</hi> parts of Worship at the <hi>Publick Assemblies,</hi> than they are at this Ordinance: so that if they are no ways better'd under the <hi>means of Grace,</hi> that <hi>unfruitfulness</hi> ought least of all to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for alas! it is but very seldome they are seen at it, but much more upon <hi>praying to God,</hi> and <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word,</hi> and <hi>other parts of Worship.</hi> And therefore if unfruitfulness under any Ordinance be a Reason, not of using <hi>greater care</hi> in it that they may get profit by it, but of a <hi>negligent abstaining</hi> from it; they are to blame in confining it to the <hi>Communion,</hi> since it would serve much more to excuse them from <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Sermons,</hi> and all <hi>other</hi> parts of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that none may be hindred by it from coming to this Feast, I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Where 'tis true that they are no better by the Sacrament, that is no excuse for their

neglect of it.</hi> And this is plain, because we are not bound to Communicate only in <hi>Interest,</hi> so as when that ceases we might be free from it; but in <hi>Duty</hi> too, our Lord having most expresly required and injoin'd it. Had we nothing but our <hi>own benefit</hi> to ingage us to it, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it would be a good Reason not to trouble our selves with it, when we found we were no better by it. But God has made it our <hi>Duty</hi> to come, as we have seen, by an <hi>express</hi> and <hi>indispensable Commandment</hi>: And when there is Gods <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Precept</hi> in the Case, it is an ill excuse for any man who neglects it, to say he did so, because he could not hope to be a <hi>gainer</hi> by it. If we refuse to do what he bids us, when it brings in no Advantage to our selves, we cast off his Service, and begin to be acted by other Principles; we do as good as tell him that we will do all things out of <hi>Interest,</hi> and with an eye to our <hi>own profit,</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for <hi>his Pleasure,</hi> and in obedience to his Commandment; which is as much as to say, we will only <hi>serve our selves,</hi> but not <hi>serve him</hi> at all.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>They are not better perhaps in what they <hi>expect,</hi> because their expectations

are not right, but they look for such benefits from the Sacrament, as God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended by it; nay, such, it may be, as in this world he never means to convey to them, either by <hi>it,</hi> or by any <hi>other</hi> Instrument. And thus it is when men hope, after they have Communicated, to be <hi>fill'd with sensible joys and transports,</hi> to be <hi>absolutely assured of Gods special Love and Kindness,</hi> to be <hi>freed thenceforward from all further Fears and Doubtings,</hi> to have a <hi>removal of some troublesome tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to <hi>get quit of all Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and the very first motions to ill things,</hi> of all <hi>dulness</hi> and <hi>distraction in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> of all <hi>sinful surprises and involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry escapes,</hi> and such like. These are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, which although God out of his <hi>abundant Grace</hi> and <hi>Indulgence may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times allow to us,</hi> yet he has no where <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised us,</hi> nor sees always <hi>fit for us</hi>; nay, some of them in this Estate do <hi>not agreee to us,</hi> being Exemptions from such <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> as are <hi>inseparable from our Natures:</hi> and therefore, when we come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, they are not to be expected in it. They are not of the number of those blessings which are inseparably made over to it, or of those effects which are always wrought by it; so that we have no Reason to complain of its being a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52843:143"/>
and unfruitful Ordinance, because they are with-held from us.</p>
                     <p>But although they are not benefited in <hi>these</hi> Respects, yet are they in <hi>others,</hi> which make it richly worth their while to fit themselves for this Feast, and are an abundant Recompence for all the pains they take in it. For, besides the <hi>quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Consciences,</hi> though not with an <hi>absolute Assurance,</hi> (a pitch of hope that is very <hi>rarely</hi> found in any, even of the <hi>best</hi> Persons) yet with a <hi>very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table sense of Gods Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship</hi>; which is an effect it will have in those good minds, who consider that therein they confirm'd the New Covenant with God, wherein he promised them pardon if they would Repent, and they profess'd to do it: Besides this effect, I say, of <hi>quieting their Consciences,</hi> it benefits them further in their <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Virtuous indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For, though some of them fear they are not, yet in reality <hi>all Good men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are bettered by the Sacrament, some by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, and all by continuing in their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which they are to ascribe to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Some Good men,</hi> I say, (and those, I hope, the greatest Part) <hi>are better'd in the Sacrament, by an Improvement of those Graces which they bring along to it:</hi> They <hi>thank Christ more freely,</hi> and <hi>Love him more
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52843:143"/>
affectionately,</hi> and are <hi>resign'd to him more intirely,</hi> and <hi>watch against</hi> those <hi>Temptations</hi> which were wont to win most upon them <hi>more carefully</hi> after every receiving, than they did before. It <hi>spurs</hi> them on, where their pace was <hi>slackned</hi>; and makes them <hi>more mindful</hi> of any Duty, when they had <hi>forgot</hi> it; and <hi>brings them back</hi> to it, when they had <hi>strayed</hi> from it; and makes them <hi>Circumspect</hi> to discharge it, when they had been more <hi>remiss</hi> and <hi>careless</hi> of it: it helps <hi>Husbands,</hi> to be more <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>affectionate; Wives,</hi> to be more <hi>dutiful</hi> and <hi>observant; Children,</hi> to be more <hi>respectful, towardly,</hi> and <hi>obedient; Servants,</hi> to be more <hi>Faithful,</hi> and <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>; and <hi>all men</hi> to be more concerned to <hi>Honour God,</hi> to be more <hi>Humble</hi> and <hi>Temperate, True</hi> and <hi>Faithful, Just</hi> and <hi>Charitable, Meck</hi> and <hi>Peaceable,</hi> than they were before they partook of it. All these Virtues, Tempers and Dispositions, as there is <hi>need</hi> of them, and they can <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> and <hi>apply their minds</hi> to them, are quickned and set on by it. And though this Holy Flame, which was kindled in their minds at the Altar, will burn dim, and grow cool again; and this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bent of Heart will slacken and be more remiss in time: yet being a fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened and intended by a new approach
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52843:144"/>
to this Feast, the former <hi>Ardors</hi> will be revived, and the same bent establish'd, and so they will be always advancing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a continual improvement.</p>
                     <p>This increase of their Graces, and Augmentation of all virtuous Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, especially of those wherein they are most defective, the Sacrament works in <hi>many</hi> good persons, and 'tis very fit it should do it in <hi>all.</hi> And although I dare not say they are <hi>unworthy</hi> of it, or <hi>unbetter'd</hi> and <hi>unfruitful</hi> under it; yet I will say they are very much <hi>wanting to their own Souls,</hi> who are not careful to carry on, and attain this improvement by it. And if they examine their Growth in Grace and Goodness, by a growth in these points; I believe the greatest part of careful and devout Receivers, will find they are really made more perfect, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Virtue by frequenting it.</p>
                     <p>Yea, I add further, they may be thus improved by it, though upon <hi>Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> they themselves should not be able to point out Determinately in <hi>what,</hi> or make a <hi>clear Discovery</hi> of it. For very few Persons do so strictly <hi>observe the Degrees</hi> of their own Attainments in any Virtues, with what <hi>ease</hi> they do them, and how <hi>seldome</hi> they sin against them; as may ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to <hi>compare</hi> exactly the pitch of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52843:144"/>
their <hi>present</hi> Graces, with the pitch of the <hi>same</hi> Graces sometime <hi>afterwards.</hi> And if they should very narrowly observe them, yet would they not be able nicely to judge of every <hi>small increase</hi>; for <hi>little</hi> things are no more discernable in <hi>Grace,</hi> than they are in <hi>Nature,</hi> nor can be easier seen in <hi>growing Virtues,</hi> than in a <hi>growing man,</hi> or <hi>Tree,</hi> or other <hi>Natural</hi> improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And besides, since the Grace which the Sacrament is to improve in us, is so <hi>diffused,</hi> and extends to so <hi>many</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; when really we have gain'd and advanced <hi>in</hi> it, yet may it be hard for us to recollect, and shew determinately in <hi>what,</hi> and specifie it in the <hi>Particulars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is so I am sure in <hi>knowledge,</hi> which is another thing wherein the instances are so <hi>infinitely numerous.</hi> For although it be very plain, that the longer any man lives, the more <hi>ordinarily</hi> he understands and improves in Knowledge; yet if most of us were asked how much we are wiser <hi>now</hi> than we were a <hi>Month</hi> or <hi>two Months</hi> since, it might often puzzle us to answer it, and, though it be plain <hi>we are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> to <hi>particularize in what,</hi> as well as it is to <hi>particularize our improvements by the Sacrament.</hi> So that not only those good men, whose growth is apparent; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so several others, who have not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52843:145"/>
discovered it, are bettered in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, by an <hi>improvement of those Graces which they brought along to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if any Good men are not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in the Sacrament, by <hi>improving</hi>; yet are they all,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By <hi>continuing in their Goodness, which they must ascribe to it, and for which it is most richly worth their pains to frequent it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is one great Grace and Benefit to all Good men, that they can maintain their present station in Goodness, and not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse and fall back into their former sins again. Their <hi>Natural Lusts</hi> are only <hi>kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> not <hi>quite extinguish'd</hi> in them, and will grow bold, and strive for Mastery upon any fair occasion. And they are daily in the way of <hi>manifold Temptations,</hi> which awaken them, and give more strength and advantage to them. And they are many times either <hi>wearied</hi> out with <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> or <hi>lull'd asleep</hi> in <hi>secure carelesness,</hi> which makes them lyable to become a prey to them. They are closely beset with Powerful Enemies, and much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd by continual Temptations, and oft-times unguarded and fit to make but a very weak Defence; which are things that would hinder them from <hi>standing</hi> where they are, as well as from <hi>improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and going further. So that it is a
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52843:145"/>
very great benefit, and they are much the better by it, if any thing can help them to keep what Grace they have got already, as well as inable them to gain more. This <hi>continuance</hi> in Goodness, is less indeed than <hi>Improvement</hi>; but yet it is a most valuable thing, and of so great account, that, were there nothing more to be had by it, for its sake alone it were most richly worth any mans while to come to the Holy Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>And this Benefit, which all good men hold, since they would cease to be good, should they fall from it, all <hi>worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers</hi> ought to ascribe as much to the <hi>Communion,</hi> as to any <hi>other</hi> thing. They owe it not to it <hi>alone,</hi> indeed, but to <hi>other</hi> means also, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>reading the Word,</hi> and <hi>meditating</hi> upon it, which puts them in mind of their Duty, and of the great motives to it; to <hi>Self-examination,</hi> which shews them their Falls and Deviations from it; to <hi>solemn Vows</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> which bind them to be careful in it; and to <hi>fervent faithful Prayers,</hi> which bring down Gods Grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and Spirit that inables them to perform it. All <hi>these,</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> are great means of securing their standing in an Holy Course, amidst all their Temptations to depart from it; and therefore to every one of them they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52843:146"/>
they must in part ascribe it. But the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament contributes to it as much, at least, if not more than any thing besides; so that in accounting whence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this great benefit, it ought not in any wise to be excluded. For therein they <hi>remember</hi> and <hi>fix in mind the Death of Christ,</hi> which is the highest <hi>motive</hi> to it; and exercise that <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> and <hi>Resignation,</hi> and <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> which are the best <hi>means</hi> to set it forward; and make God <hi>solemn Vows</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> which are the straitest <hi>bond</hi> to ingage them to it; and put up many <hi>fervent Prayers,</hi> which are the best course to <hi>make way</hi> for it; and receive those <hi>inward Graces</hi> and <hi>Assistances,</hi> as I have shewn, which <hi>inable</hi> them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it. So that when worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants continue after the Sacrament to hold their present pitch of Goodness, and do not slide back again into their former sins; they must not say they are no better by it, for this benefit <hi>of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a good state,</hi> they receive from it. Though it doth not improve and bring them <hi>forward,</hi> yet it helps mightily to continue and keep them where they <hi>are.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus are all good People really bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Sacrament. For, besides the <hi>Peace of Conscience,</hi> which is thereby
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52843:146"/>
much settled in those Penitents, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and consider, that therein they have seal'd the Covenant of Pardon with Almighty God: Besides this effect, I say, in those who rightly understand it; the <hi>Graces of some are much improved,</hi> and the <hi>standing of all is greatly maintain'd</hi> by it, which last, were there no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation from it, is a most valuable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and such, wherefore it is highly worth any mans labour to frequent it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Where they are not bettered at all by the Sacrament, or not so much as might be expected, that is purely through their own Fault, and they must amend it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Where they are not bettered at all by the Sacrament,</hi> I say, <hi>or not so much as might be expected, that is purely through their own Fault.</hi> If they examine their own hearts about it, they will find that they have been wanting in those things, which should have made it a lively means and help to their improvement. It may be, after they have felt in their own Souls that they have <hi>renounced all evil ways,</hi> which might fit them for it; they do not yet perceive any <hi>affecting peace of mind,</hi> and comfortable sense of the Love of God to be wrought by it: but then that is because they do not <hi>consider,</hi> how there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they confirmed a <hi>League of Love,</hi> and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52843:147"/>
received assurance of his Favour to the Penitent. Perhaps they are not <hi>improved</hi> in an <hi>Holy Life,</hi> nor prevail more against their sins after they have joyn'd in it; but then that is because they are <hi>wanting</hi> in those things, which are necessary to such Improvement. They did not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what their particular sins</hi> were, and <hi>deliberately resolve</hi> against them <hi>before</hi> they came to it: nor are careful to <hi>bear in mind</hi> what they have promised, and to <hi>watch the opportunities of performing</hi> it, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> they have been at it. Had these things been done, and this care been shewn, both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> it; they may be assured, as I have shewn, both from the <hi>virtue of Gods Promise,</hi> and the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing,</hi> that they would have been the better by it. But when these means are not used, but omitted, they cannot expect it should have its effect in making them obedient. For the Sacrament helps us to grow in Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as a <hi>moral means,</hi> which works on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>concurrence with our own care,</hi> but not <hi>without</hi> it. It makes us <hi>leave our sins,</hi> by ingaging us to <hi>examine</hi> after them, and <hi>particularly to resolve</hi> against them, and to <hi>strive</hi> as the opportunities come to get quit of them; and by bringing down such <hi>gracious Assistances</hi> to us, as will serve
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52843:147"/>
our turn when we <hi>indeavour</hi> with them. But if we will be wanting to our selves in these <hi>Self-Examinations,</hi> and <hi>particular Resolutions,</hi> and <hi>after-care</hi> and <hi>good indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>; then can it do us no good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we will not suffer it: and therefore, as we were before, so we shall continue, the same unreform'd, and unimproved persons still.</p>
                     <p>Thus is the want of being bettered by the Sacrament, either <hi>at all,</hi> or <hi>so much</hi> as might be expected, altogether our <hi>own</hi> Fault; namely, because we come not to it with that <hi>particular sight</hi> and <hi>considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>all our sins,</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> against them, nor are afterwards so <hi>mindful</hi> of it, and shew that <hi>care</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> what we have <hi>resolv'd,</hi> which is necessary to our <hi>amendment</hi>: nor have that <hi>consideration</hi> of its being a <hi>sealing of the Covenant of Peace</hi> and Reconciliation, which is as necessary to our <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Peace of mind from</hi> it. So that whensoever we fail of that benefit, which should accrue by it, it is purely through our own Neglect, and we must thank our selves for it.</p>
                     <p>And since this want of being bettered, is wholly our <hi>own Fault</hi>; let all those who are kept back by it, take care to <hi>amend</hi> that, and then this objection is answer'd. When they receive no benefit from it,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52843:148"/>
they themselves are to be blamed for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting those things which are necessary to it; and if they will take care to use them the next time, they will be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by it: So that this hindrance lasts no longer than they are pleas'd it should, and when they will, need be no hindrance to them at all.</p>
                     <p>As for those then, that urge this for their not coming to the Sacrament, <hi>viz. Their not being better'd or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>proved by it</hi>: My Answer to them in <hi>sum</hi> is this. If there be any force in it, it will hold much stronger for their not coming to <hi>Prayers,</hi> or the <hi>Publick Assemblies,</hi> and ought not so much to hinder them from <hi>this Feast,</hi> as from all <hi>other</hi> parts of <hi>Worship.</hi> But, indeed, it is no just hindrance, nor is there any sufficient excuse at all from it. Where 'tis <hi>true,</hi> there is no <hi>fair excuse</hi> in it; because we are not only bound in <hi>Interest,</hi> but in <hi>strict Duty</hi> also to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. But in the case of all <hi>good</hi> men 'tis <hi>false,</hi> for they are really the <hi>better</hi> by it, tho' perhaps they do not <hi>think</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it.</hi> For it either <hi>improves them in their Goodness,</hi> as 'tis highly fit it should and will do all, who are not wanting to themselves: or at least it <hi>continues</hi> them in it, which, where there is nothing more, is of it self most richly worth all
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52843:148"/>
the pains they bestow upon it. And where they are not better'd at all, or not so much as might be expected; that is purely their <hi>own Fault,</hi> and will hinder them no longer than they have a mind to it; for when they please they may amend it. If they are <hi>good</hi> men, they are <hi>better</hi> by it; and if they are <hi>ill,</hi> their being no better doth not <hi>excuse their Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> of it; and they may be bettered the <hi>next</hi> time, if they will take that <hi>care</hi> which is necessary to it: so that this ought not in any wise to be an Hindrance, and keep them from it.</p>

qualified for them. When they sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew Repentance of their Fault, they are to be re-admitted to the same state of Favour and Friendship. We must be Candid in Judging when their Repentance is sufficiently evidenced. An humble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is ordinarily a sufficient Proof of it for the first Fault; but not when it has been oft repeated. <hi>Luc. 17.4,</hi> which seems to affirm it, answer'd. Several Cases clear'd, which are sometimes thought by Pious Souls to be a breach of Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Enemies, but in reality are not. As, not forgetting Injuries or Vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, but still retaining a Remembrance of them. Thinking the worse of those who offered them. Being troubled at the sight of them, as that puts them in mind of the great Losses they have sustain'd by them. Shewing more reserve, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a greater distance in Conversing with them, than with other men. These are no breach of Charity towards them, nor can be a just Hindrance from the Communion.</p>

                     <p>This is a great cause of <hi>Scruple</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honest minds, who are really troubled with it: and particularly it is a most common <hi>hindrance</hi> from the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; there being no Duty, I think, which the generality of men believe more indispensably required, than <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> in every worthy Communicant. And therefore that they who <hi>want</hi> this Love of Enemies, which unfits them for this Feast, may quickly set about the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of it; and that they who <hi>have</hi> it, may not be troubled, or held back from receiving as if they had it not; I shall here indeavour to give a plain state of it, and shew, both <hi>what is,</hi> and <hi>what

is not</hi> imply'd in it. And this I shall do in these <hi>two</hi> particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>We are bound to shew our Enemies,</hi> and any others who have <hi>provoked us, all the Offices of general Charity, or all that Love which is due to our Neighbour at large, and to all other Persons.</hi> So that whilst we allow ous selves in the <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> we are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> for this Feast, and must instantly <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi> that we may be fitted for it.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>We are not bound to shew them all the Offices of special Esteem, Trust, and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which are not fit to be placed on all men, but on such only as are qualified for them.</hi> So that when we fail only in <hi>these,</hi> we are in no <hi>Fault,</hi> nor have any need to be <hi>troubled,</hi> or <hi>kept back</hi> by it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

For it takes off all that <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>spiteful Resentment,</hi> which would exclude them from all good Offices; and sets them in the Rank of <hi>Neighbours,</hi> whom God commands us to treat with all those instances of Kindness, wherein consists the <hi>loving our Neighbour as our selves.</hi> This is plain, from its not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting us <hi>to hate,</hi> as the <hi>Jewish Law did,</hi> but strictly injoyning us <hi>to Love them, Mat.</hi> 5.44, 45; for where <hi>Love</hi> is, it naturally issues out in all of them as there is occasion, upon which account it is call'd <hi>the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> i. e. of that part of it which concerns us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, because <hi>working no ill,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>to our Neighbour,</hi> it leads us into all of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9, 10. Besides, that our Enemies are to share in all that Love which is due to our Neighbours, our Saviour plainly declares, when he singles out a most <hi>bitter Enemy,</hi> and sets him forth as the <hi>Neighbour</hi> whom the Law mentions, making the <hi>Samaritane</hi> a Neighbour even to a <hi>Jewish</hi> man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52843:152"/>
whom there was the most invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and inbred Enmity and Opposition. For when the <hi>Lawyer</hi> asked him, <hi>who is my Neighbour</hi>; he tells him by the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of a <hi>Jewish man,</hi> who being <hi>left wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Thieves,</hi> found a <hi>Neighbour</hi> of the <hi>good Samaritane,</hi> that 'tis any one he meets with, though a <hi>Stranger,</hi> though an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> yea, though of a <hi>Party</hi> and <hi>Profession in Religion</hi> most <hi>odious</hi> unto his, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily causes the highest and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enmities, as it did between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> who stood at so great a distance, as that they would not <hi>give</hi> or <hi>ask</hi> so much as <hi>a</hi>

                     <p>Thus are all we Christians bound to hold our Enemies, and those who have provoked us, in the same promiscuous Rank with all others, and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their unkindness, or injurious Carriage, to look upon them as our Neighbours, whom we are to Love as we do our selves.</p>
                     <p>And that Love contains in it all the <hi>particular</hi> Offices of <hi>Justice, Charity,</hi> and

                     <p>And thus it appears when really we are out of Charity with any persons who have provoked us, and fall short of that Love of Enemies, which Gods Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us: For then we Love them not as we ought, when we are any ways <hi>unjust</hi> to them, or apt upon every little occasion to <hi>strive</hi> and <hi>contend</hi> with them, or deal <hi>uncharitably</hi> by them in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, particularly in <hi>malicious Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes</hi> and <hi>Suspicions,</hi> and <hi>uncandid Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> which are so general in <hi>all,</hi> but more abundant in <hi>our</hi> times, when the <hi>Nation</hi> is divided into <hi>Parties,</hi> and men

seem to have forgot that there is <hi>any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion towards Enemies,</hi> or any Love due to them who have given them personal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, or side with a Party oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to what they espouse.</p>
                     <p>And if upon a survey of our Carriage in these particulars, we find this to be our Case, and that we are thus out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and have not forgiven any who have provoked us: 'tis very true, whilst that lasts we are <hi>unfit for the Sacrament,</hi> since he that worthily joyns in it, must come in <hi>Love,</hi> and have freely forgiven all the World. But then we are also equally unfit to <hi>pray,</hi> or ask the <hi>forgiveness of our own sins</hi> at Gods hands; since, if we pray in <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Enmity,</hi> he will not hear us. Nay, this <hi>not forgiving others</hi> turns all our own Prayers into a <hi>Curse,</hi> and makes them a dreadful and down-right <hi>Imprecation</hi> against our selves.

                     <p>We are not bound to make an Enemy a <hi>familiar Companion,</hi> or a <hi>particular Friend,</hi> a <hi>Partner</hi> of our <hi>Secrets,</hi> a <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> of our <hi>Trust,</hi> or an <hi>Officer</hi> in our <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi>: but may be more afraid of him, and keep more at a distance from him, and use more Caution and Reserve in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with him, than with other men. As for all the instances of <hi>general</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, indeed, they are due upon a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which is <hi>common</hi> to our Enemies with others, <hi>i. e.</hi> their being <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>: so that they ought to share in them, and we fail of our Duty to them, when at any time we with-hold <hi>them</hi> from them. But as for these marks of <hi>special</hi> esteem and confidence; they are founded on <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> reasons and fitness of Persons, as <hi>likeness of humour, Fidelity of Affection, aptness for our affairs,</hi> or the like; so that in them we are not bound to our <hi>Enemies,</hi> who are plainly unfit through their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

Enmity,</hi> or <hi>treacherous falseness</hi>; nay, nor to any <hi>one</hi> among <hi>others</hi>; but are left at Liberty to make such choice as shall seem best to our <hi>Prudence.</hi> This Liberty must in all <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> be allowed us, because upon a right choice of these Persons the <hi>innocence, ease,</hi> and <hi>safety</hi> of our Lives, most nearly depends; and without being left to discretion in it, we must unavoidably throw our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inextricable Snares, and numberless Calamities. And that it is allowed, our Saviour clearly intimates, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to us the <hi>wisdom of Serpents,</hi> bidding us shew all the prudence we can devise, so long as no unrighteousness mixes with it, but it is wholly guided by the <hi>Doves innocence, Mat.</hi> 10.16.

                     <p>Indeed, if afterwards they <hi>Repent</hi> of their Offence which makes the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and amend that Fault which unfits them for our <hi>Business</hi> or <hi>Converse,</hi> when only we <hi>our selves</hi> are concern'd, and the thing is not of that weight as that we may be <hi>jealous</hi> over it, and we have no other cause but that offence to exclude them from it; 'tis a Christian Part, not only to retain them in a general Charity in common with all other Persons, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to re-admit them to the <hi>same</hi> State, which formerly they held with us.</p>
                     <p>When the concern is not purely <hi>our own,</hi> but we are set to secure <hi>higher</hi> and more <hi>publick ends</hi>; there, 'tis true, we are not bound presently to re-admit to the same state upon Repentance. And thus it is in the point of <hi>Discipline,</hi> wherein the Sin is not presently pardoned so soon as the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal has Repented of it: but the punishment is oft-times continued, (as it was in the <hi>lasting Excommunications</hi> of the <hi>Primitive
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52843:159"/>
Christians</hi>) that the durableness of the smart may both more <hi>terrifie others</hi> from it, and <hi>amend themselves</hi> by begetting a more lasting memory and abhorrence of it. And thus 'tis too in point of <hi>Publick Trust,</hi> when we act not for our selves, but pursuant to our care of others: for there we may lay aside <hi>Penitents,</hi> because they have once sinn'd, thinking there is more safety in those who have still stood firm, and been always innocent. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> did with <hi>Mark,</hi> who had <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 13.13.</note> once declined the toil and peril of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Gentile World</hi>; for after he had freely forgiven it, yet, says St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in the dispute betwixt <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>him, he thought not good to take him</hi> for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, because he once deserted them, and <hi>went not with them to the work</hi>; but prefer'd <hi>Silas,</hi> who had never slinch'd from it, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.37, 38, 40.</p>
                     <p>But when only <hi>we</hi> our <hi>selves</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and the thing is not of that weight as that we may be <hi>jealous</hi> over it, (in which case, indeed, a greater Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is requisite;) and we have <hi>no other Cause</hi> but <hi>that Offence</hi> to exclude them from it: (for if upon other accounts the choice at first was ill made, and either already <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> be altered to our Benefit, since
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52843:160"/>
the fixing on any man for a Friend or Dependant is not a necessary Duty, but a discretionary free thing, we are not blame-worthy in correcting it:) when the Case, I say, is thus, 'tis a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> act to admit returning <hi>Penitents</hi> to the <hi>same</hi> state they held before they offended us. For when once they have Repented of a Fault, they are as fit for our <hi>Affairs</hi> or <hi>Friendship,</hi> as they were before they committed it. So that if any marks of our displeasure remain still after that, which in the present state of things might conveniently enough be alter'd, it is not <hi>their unfitness,</hi> but <hi>our Resentment</hi> which is the cause of it. And when we go so to <hi>ease</hi> our offended minds by their <hi>loss,</hi> this looks not like <hi>forgiving a Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,</hi> but <hi>Revenging</hi> it. And this Re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to their former state, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Direction, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13. <hi>to forgive others, even as Christ forgives us</hi>; for he admits Penitents to the state of innocent Persons, pardoning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out upbraiding, and quite <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 8.12.</note> 
                        <hi>forgetting,</hi> as if the sin had never been done: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he prescribes, 1 Cor. 14.20. when he bids us <hi>in malice to be Children</hi>; for after once they are made Friends, they forget all, and return to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52843:160"/>
the same degree of Love and Confidence again. The <hi>wise Son</hi> of <hi>Sirach</hi> says, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that for <hi>four things,</hi> viz. <hi>upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Pride, and disclosing of Secrets, and a Treacherous wound, every Friend will depart,</hi> and never more be reconciled, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 22.22. But he speaks only of what <hi>ordinarily is done,</hi> or of what <hi>might have been done among the Jews</hi>; not of what <hi>may now be done</hi> among us, of whom God expects an higher forgiveness, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of <hi>Children,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> So that when once they have sufficiently Repented, 'tis fit that we forgive them to as full purpose, as if they had never sinn'd at all.</p>
                     <p>And in judging of this Repentance, we ought not to be <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> in stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon exact proofs; but to be <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,</hi> and apt to interpret all signs of it to the best Sence, leaning to the side of Love and easie Admittance. If they take shame to themselves, and are so far humbled as <hi>penitently to confess</hi> it: 'tis a great Argument of their being set against it, and, in the case of the <hi>first</hi> offence especially, a strong Presumption that they will no more commit it. Although, when once these Confessions become <hi>Customary,</hi> and are still made and broke
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:52843:161"/>
anew upon every fresh occasion: it is a sign only that they mean well, and <hi>would</hi> amend if they could; but no Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they <hi>will</hi> do it, since their peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Resolution plainly is too weak, and their Lusts prove still too strong for it. And since these Confessions are manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an incompetent proof of their having thorowly R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pented; we cannot be bound to believe them, or obliged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to a return of Friendship.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour indeed tells us, That <hi>if our Brother Trespass against us seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, saying, I repent; we must forgive him,</hi> Luc. 17.4. And here, if by <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> were meant <hi>restoring to the same state of Favour</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi>; this would infer his Profession of Repentance, tho' never so often broke, to be a sufficient Demonstration of it, and a just Ground of his return to Friendship. But this, I suppose, speaks only of such Forgiveness, as admits him, not to the <hi>same</hi> state which before he held with us, but only to the state of a <hi>Neighbour at large,</hi> or of all other Persons. And albeit this is due to him, whether he say, <hi>I Repent,</hi> or no; yet doth our Saviour here injoin it upon his Rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ntance, not because the <hi>thing</hi> required it, but that he might more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52843:161"/>
oppose the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctrine in this point, which was too scanty in forgiving even a <hi>returning Penitent.</hi> For this they limited to a small number of times, it being a received Rule among the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Dr. Lightf.</hi> Hor. Heb. <hi>in</hi> loc. è Jom.</note> 
                        <hi>after he has forgiven any Person thrice, he has gone as far as he needs, and that no man is bound to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the fourth offence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To forgive an injury then so far as not to return it, nor to be wanting in any Neighbourly office towards him that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it, is a plain Duty, upon his saying he Repents of it: yea, as has been shewn, whether he Repents or not. But to the evidencing of such Repentance as would oblige us to confide in him again, and leaves <hi>no imputation of unfitness in him,</hi> but only <hi>our Resentment</hi> for a Reason of our distance from him: we may require more than his <hi>saying he Repents,</hi> and giving us his bare word and promise, after they have several times deceived us. For no <hi>wise</hi> man would trust to that which is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wrong than right, as every such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons word is, who hitherto has always failed in it: and Christianity in no case forbids us to be <hi>wise</hi> in our own Concerns, but directs us to <hi>be</hi> as <hi>subtle as Serpents,</hi> so long as we are careful withal to keep
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52843:162"/>
as <hi>innocent as Doves, Mat.</hi> 10.16. It commends us for being <hi>prudent</hi> in business, and seeing before-hand to prevent <hi>other mens sins,</hi> by cutting off from them all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities; and it may be <hi>our own</hi> too, by putting by those Temptations, which would <hi>always</hi> trouble and molest our <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>often-times</hi> indanger our <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</hi> So that although we are to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>favourable</hi> in construing the sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Enemies Repentance; yet may we be <hi>discreet</hi> withall, and are not to be <hi>foolishly blind</hi> and unreasonably easie in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it. We must only lean to the side of Favour, when there are such signs, as to a Wise man look towards it; but not rashly conclude it, when there are no likely signs at all of it. But the fault of men seldom lies on this side, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>over-easie to be fully reconciled</hi>; so that the other, of being <hi>over-rigid,</hi> is that which the generality of men ought to guard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against. And therefore in judging of the sufficiency of their Repentance, this is the great Rule we are to take along with us, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>as</hi> it is <hi>one</hi> part of Charity <hi>fully to forgive our offending Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and re-admit him to our <hi>former</hi> favour on his <hi>Repentance</hi>: So 'tis <hi>another</hi> to be <hi>favourable</hi> in judging whether he has <hi>sufficiently Repented,</hi> and given such
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:52843:162"/>
proofs of it as ought to be believed, or no.</p>
                     <p>As for these further effects of Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Enemies, and those who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked us then, <hi>viz. our not barely retaining them in a general Charity and Affection,</hi> as we do <hi>all other men,</hi> but <hi>re-admitting them to special Trust, Familiarity</hi> and <hi>Friendship,</hi> which they had in their <hi>former Station</hi>; they are not always <hi>due</hi> to them, nor are at all <hi>proper</hi> to be placed on them, but only when they <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Amend</hi> those Faults which made them <hi>unfit</hi> for them. So that whilst their <hi>Impenitence</hi> lasts, or that change doth not <hi>sufficiently appear</hi> to us, we are not obliged to express our Love in these at all.</p>
                     <p>And since we are not bound to them, nor are guilty of any sin in omitting them; that omission can never unfit us for the <hi>Holy Communion.</hi> So that whilst we shew them all the Offices of <hi>general kindness,</hi> and are wanting in nothing but <hi>special Favours,</hi> which belong not to them in their present Circumstances; we have all the Charity for them which our Lord requires, and therefore, if we have nothing else to hinder us, may readily join in this Feast of Love when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to it.</p>
                     <p>And this might serve for a sufficient Answer, to those <hi>supposed</hi> instances of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness</hi>
                        <pb n="290" facs="tcp:52843:163"/>
mentioned above, which hinder several <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> Persons from partaking in this Ordinance. But for their <hi>fuller</hi> satisfaction in these points, I will add something concerning each of the <hi>Particulars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. They fear they have not that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>offensive Persons,</hi> which Gods Law requires, because <hi>they cannot forget as well as forgive,</hi> but still <hi>remember their injuries or unkindnesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But did not our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, that perfect pattern of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, remember <note n="†" place="margin">Jo. 21.15, 16, 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Denial</hi> of him after he had <hi>bitterly Repented</hi> of it? Did he not sufficiently hint it to him, by questioning him <hi>three times</hi> about his <hi>Love of him,</hi> answerable to his having <hi>three times denied him</hi>; that by calling it over upon his Remembrance, he might increase his care and watchfulness against it afterwards? So that 'tis not the <hi>bare</hi> Remembrance, but remembring them to <hi>evil purposes,</hi> which is to be blamed in us. When they bear in mind the ill they have received then, let them consider whether they do it to any ill effect. Do they think of it to <hi>upbraid them with it,</hi> or to <hi>do</hi> them a <hi>shame for it,</hi> and sit as <hi>Spyes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Actions only that they may <hi>find
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:52843:163"/>
Faults,</hi> and <hi>aggravate Miscarriages,</hi> or to return the ill to them again in trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing any of those instances of <hi>common Justice</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> above recited? If their Remembrance of it doth not provoke them, into any of these sinful expressions of <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>ill will</hi> against them, they need not be troubled at it, for there is no hurt done by it. It is not in <hi>their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> it may be, perfectly to forget it; for when the knowledge of things is once fix'd in our minds, though we can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to <hi>reflect</hi> on it, wherein lies the great danger of it, yet can we not <hi>lose</hi> it when we have a mind to it. So that after we have received an Injury, we are not to be blamed barely for remembring it; since we are no more <hi>able</hi> always wholly to <hi>forget</hi> what has <hi>past,</hi> than we were at <hi>first</hi> to be wholly <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi> of it. Nay, in many Cases, if we <hi>could,</hi> it is not <hi>advisable</hi> that we <hi>should</hi> do it: for whilst the injurious Person is <hi>Impenitent,</hi> and ready to repeat the same again, the Remembrance of it will do us good, in <hi>quickning our care,</hi> and making us more <hi>wary</hi> and <hi>watchful</hi> to prevent it. But if once he has <hi>Repented</hi> of what he did, so as that he ought to be admitted to his <hi>former state</hi>; then, indeed, it may seem very desirable, that as much as in us lies,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52843:164"/>
we should <hi>forget</hi> it, by giving no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment or incouragement to the Thoughts of it. For the Remembrance then can serve no good ends, but may prove a very great snare to us, in making us <hi>backward in kindness,</hi> or <hi>fit to catch fire on small Provocations,</hi> or <hi>uncandid</hi> in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting</hi> his <hi>words,</hi> or <hi>actions</hi> afterwards. It will not be our <hi>sin</hi> till these, or some other ill effects are wrought by it; but it will be our <hi>Temptation,</hi> whereby 'tis very like, we shall sometimes be much indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd; so that then it may be very fit to lay it aside, for fear of receiving hurt by it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They fear that, after an <hi>unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or <hi>injury</hi> received, they are not so <hi>Charitable</hi> as they ought, because <hi>they think the worse of him that offered it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if they are <hi>uncandid</hi> in <hi>judging of the injurious action, i. e.</hi> if they impute it to the worst cause, and make not those Allowances of <hi>forgetfulness, over-sight,</hi> and the like, which it would well admit, and which Love would fix upon it were it to construe it: 'tis true, they are so far wanting in it. This, indeed, is hard for us always to avoid, and therefore we must be sure to take the more care, and keep the stricter watch against it. And if after all, through <hi>unwariness,</hi> through
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52843:164"/>
                        <hi>an Accusers laying out only the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ill side,</hi> or <hi>our own suspicious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per insensibly leaning towards it,</hi> we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in an uncandid Construction e're we can discover it; there our <hi>inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>unadvisedness</hi> will be our excuse for it. But so soon as ever we can <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi> it, or are shewn how the action is equally capable of a <hi>favourable Sense,</hi> we must strike in with <hi>it,</hi> and correct our <hi>hasty</hi> Judgment. So that if by <hi>thinking worse,</hi> they mean that they think worse than needs of the <hi>Action,</hi> and incur an <hi>uncandid interpretation</hi>; this is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they are to pass upon it. Either it was an <hi>innocently inconsiderate escape,</hi> and then their <hi>haste</hi> and <hi>unadvisedness</hi> must <hi>excuse</hi> it: or it was a <hi>known sin, i. e.</hi> it either was, or, had they not been grosly partial and evidently bent to think ill, would have been committed with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; and then their <hi>Repentance</hi> and Amendment must <hi>atone</hi> for it.</p>
                     <p>But if by <hi>thinking worse,</hi> they mean, that, when the Fact is evidently ill, they have a <hi>worse opinion of the Person</hi>; there is no want of Charity in that, because they have just cause for it, and cannot in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son think better of him. They judge only according to the plain <hi>Truth</hi> of things, and that the best Souls may
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52843:165"/>
safely do, and it is no uncharitable part in any of them. For thus our <hi>Lord</hi> thought of <hi>Judas,</hi> when he most affectingly <note n="†" place="margin">Luc. 22.48.</note> suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him the baseness of <hi>

                           </gap>ying him,</hi> and that too <hi>with a Kiss,</hi> the sign of Friendship and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus the <hi>Apostles</hi> thought of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom they looked upon as <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 2.23. <hi>and</hi> 7.52.</note> 
                        <hi>wicked Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> for our Saviours Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought of <hi>Peter,</hi> when he blamed him for his <note n="†" place="margin">Gal. 2.11, 12, 13, 14.</note> 
                        <hi>sinful complyance</hi> and <hi>dissimulation.</hi> And thus <hi>God</hi> himself thinks of <hi>us</hi> upon our miscarriages, for he sees them, and dislikes us for them, and thereby <note n="†" place="margin">Luc. 6.35.</note> magnifies the Honour of his <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>loving Kindness,</hi> in that he is <hi>good</hi> even to <hi>the unthankful and the evil,</hi> and shews us Favour notwithstanding them. And thus also may we very <hi>innocently,</hi> and <hi>charitably</hi> too think ill of any others, when they have evidently deserv'd it, and given us just occasion for it. For the work of <hi>Charity,</hi> or Love to others, is not to make us blind in a plain Case, and see no Faults in them when they are clear before us. For this is <hi>Love without
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52843:165"/>
Eyes,</hi> which is by no means the <hi>Love of wise men,</hi> or the <hi>Charity of Christians.</hi> It is not always <hi>possible in Nature,</hi> nor could be shewn if we should attempt it; for, when others Faults are evident, there is no way of being dark against the Sun, or shutting out the Light whilst our Eyes are opened. But if it always could be done, yet is it not in any wise proper to be <hi>advised</hi>: for if we must see no hurt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Persons, it unavoidably destroys all wise <hi>choice</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Companions, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Dependants</hi>; all seasonable <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi> and <hi>Instruction, Reproof</hi> and <hi>Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; and so produces most sad effects, both in <hi>Conversation</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> The work of Charity to others then, is not to wink against a Fault when 'tis <hi>apparent</hi>; but not to be <hi>quick in discerning,</hi> and <hi>forward in presuming</hi> it, when there is <hi>no just Cause</hi> for it. So that if we would be Charitable to our Enemies, we must not believe ill of them, till it is sufficiently made out to us; nor conclude them faulty in a doubtful case, when there are Reasons on both sides, and they are as likely to be otherwise; nor presume they had an ill design in that which lies as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to a good, and might have no hurt at all in it. In these Cases, where their offence is not clearly proved, it is uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52843:166"/>
in us to be hasty in believing it. But when their <hi>Enmity</hi> is <hi>profest,</hi> and their <hi>Vnkindness,</hi> or <hi>Injurious dealing</hi> is <hi>evident</hi>; 'tis no Duty in any man to shut his Eyes against the Light, nor any Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at all to esteem them the less for it. We may think him a <hi>Dishonest man,</hi> that has <hi>injured</hi> us; and him a <hi>False Friend,</hi> that has <hi>betrayed our Secrets</hi> to our Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, as our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> did <hi>Judas</hi>; and that he is not so <hi>kind</hi> as he <hi>professes,</hi> who, when he might, refuses to <hi>do good</hi> to us. When we judge of Persons, not from <hi>rash Surmises,</hi> but from <hi>clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> we may judge as we find cause, and, if we judge ill of them, it is not because we are inclined to it, but because they have deserved it; so that our ill Opinion is owing purely to their Faults, and not to any want of Charity in our selves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some Persons of <hi>Passionate Natures</hi> fear they have not that Charity for Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which is required of all Good men, because, when some have been most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to them, <hi>their hearts are troubled,</hi> and <hi>they are inwardly moved as often as they see them</hi>; not with any <hi>Angry</hi> or <hi>Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Passion,</hi> which would do hurt to them; but only with a <hi>sad Remembrance of their own Losses,</hi> which they have sustained by them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="297" facs="tcp:52843:166"/>Now where this is really the Case, (and they who are concerned must be faithful to their own Souls in judging whether it be or no) if there be any Fault in it, it is not <hi>want of Charity towards them,</hi> but <hi>want of Patience towards God,</hi> and <hi>Contentment in their own Condition.</hi> They shew no uncharitableness towards them in it, since they have no wrathful intent to seek their hurt, nor have the least desire to return the Injuries which they have suffer'd. They are troubled at the <hi>sight of them,</hi> indeed; but that is only as they put them in mind of their own Miseries, which they have occasion'd. They are grieved to see <hi>them,</hi> as they would be to see the <hi>Picture of a Departed Friend,</hi> whose Death went very near to them; <hi>i. e.</hi> only as it calls into their Thoughts that loss which is very afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And this <hi>Grief,</hi> whatever it may be with <hi>Impatience,</hi> is not chargeable with any <hi>Vncharitableness</hi> towards our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For it is no part of the Charity. we owe them, to be insensible of what befalls our selves; so that they cannot complain of us for lamenting our own miseries. Nor can they complain of us for doing it at their presence; because they being the cause of all, the sight of them may well bring it to our Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52843:167"/>
and if we may be sorry at all for our own unhappiness, we may be allowed to grieve then especially, when we have those things before us, which are most apt to represent and suggest it to us.</p>
                     <p>So long then as they are careful so to <hi>moderate</hi> their Grief for what is lost, (and they must be watchful in this point) as that it doth not make them <hi>distrust God,</hi> nor <hi>repine</hi> at what he has order'd, nor settle into an <hi>habitual Discontent,</hi> nor is otherwise <hi>sinful</hi> or <hi>intemperate</hi>; it need be no scruple to their minds, nor hinder them from the Holy Sacrament. They may indeavour to prevent it, both for their own <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>safety,</hi> that they may neither be <hi>pain'd</hi> nor <hi>tempted</hi> with it: and to this end it may be very adviseable to avoid the <hi>Presence of the injurious Person,</hi> till they have so well digested their Loss, as that they can look on him without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled. But if at any time they meet, and their Hearts are sorrowful at the sight: so long as this Grief is not in it self sinful or intemperate, nor has any angry motions and expressions of Revenge accompanying it; they need not be put into doubts and scruples with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, since their state is not disturb'd, nor their Souls at all endanger'd by it.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:52843:167"/>4. They are afraid they have not such Charity for their Enemies as they ought, because <hi>they are not so free with them,</hi> nor <hi>repose the same Trust in them,</hi> but carry themselves with more <hi>Reserve</hi> and at a <hi>greater distance</hi> from them, than they used to do before the breach betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>But so long as their Enemies are <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent,</hi> all this has no hurt in it: So that they ought not to be hindred from the Sacrament, or affrighted by it. For this wariness in Conversing with our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, is no more than <hi>Christ</hi> himself shew'd in Conversing with the <hi>Jews</hi>: who <hi>would not walk openly among them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they sought to kill him,</hi> Jo. 7 1. <hi>and</hi> c. 11.53, 54. It is no more than he taught his <hi>Disciples</hi> to use, when he <hi>sent them forth as Sheep in the midst of Wolves</hi>; for then he bid them take to themselves all the <hi>many Wisdom</hi> and prudent Care <hi>of Serpents,</hi> Mat. 10.16. Indeed, if any one that injures or of sends us, expresses himself sorry for it, and <hi>sufficiently Repents</hi> of it; we ought, as I have shewn, to admit him to his former state, and to treat him, now he is a <hi>Penitent,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>us,</hi> or as <hi>Children</hi> do their <hi>Play-Fellows, i. e.</hi> as if he had never sinn'd, but had kept
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52843:168"/>
always innocent. But till we see that, we may very <hi>lawfully,</hi> and very <hi>wisely</hi> too, withdraw from him our <hi>particular Familiarity, Trust,</hi> or <hi>Friendship.</hi> If we find a Person <hi>Dishonest once,</hi> till we see him a New man, we are not bound to trust him a <hi>second</hi> time; for that were to give <hi>him</hi> an opportunity of <hi>committing,</hi> and put <hi>us</hi> into the danger of <hi>suffering</hi> the <hi>same</hi> again from him. If 'tis his Temper to <hi>fall foul</hi> upon us in <hi>Discourse,</hi> or to be <hi>passionate</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful</hi> upon light occasions; till it appears that he has learned to act o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, we are not bound to use his Company and Acquaintance: for that were not only to throw away our own <hi>ease,</hi> but to indanger our own <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Peace,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Virtues, by <hi>cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves upon Temptations</hi>; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we ought to be so far from seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them our selves, that we are <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 6.13.</note> taught to <hi>pray daily</hi> against those, which <hi>Gods Providence</hi> might allot for us. If he lays wait to <hi>over-reach,</hi> or is industrious to <hi>vex,</hi> or is any ways <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,</hi> or <hi>prejudicial</hi> to us in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, we may lawfully carry our selves at a distance from him, till he has reformed those <hi>Vices,</hi> or corrected
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52843:168"/>
those <hi>ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tempers</hi> which harm or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy us, and shew'd us that now with safety to our selves we may come nearer to him. This distance we may use towards any Persons that offend against us, out of a <hi>Natural Love</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> for our <hi>own selves</hi>; but if they are our <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Servants,</hi> or any ways <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Dependant</hi> on us, there is still a more obliging Reason for it, and that is <hi>their Amendment</hi> and <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> likewise. For when the Fault is great enough to bear it, these marks of our Displeasure are a necessary part of <hi>Discipline,</hi> and altogether fit to be used, to make them duly sensible of it, and afraid ever after to repeat it. Which is so far from being an <hi>unkind</hi> part towards them, that in reality it is the <hi>truest</hi> way of <hi>shewing kindness,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most proper course to amend them, and to bring them back at once to <hi>their former state of innocence,</hi> and all expressions of <hi>our Favour</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>And thus it appears, that so long as we are careful to shew our Enemies all that <hi>Justice, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which is due to our <hi>Neighbour at large,</hi> and to all other Persons; we have as much Love for them as God requires, though we <hi>still remember their Injuries,</hi>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:52843:169"/>
and <hi>Vnkindnesses,</hi> or <hi>think the worse of their Persons</hi> as we have just cause, or <hi>use more Reserve,</hi> and <hi>keep a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance towards them</hi> in our Carriage, and the like, than we did before they had provoked us. We shew all the Love which is expected, when we are not wanting to them in any Offices of <hi>common Charity</hi> and <hi>Neighbourhood</hi>: this makes us accepted with Almighty God, and so fits us for the <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; so that although we do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to our <hi>particular Esteem</hi> and <hi>Friendship,</hi> whilst they have not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evidenc'd that <hi>Repentance</hi> which should qualifie them for it; that ought not to put us back, and hinder us from partaking in it.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>these</hi> Hindrances then, which detain some good People from this <hi>Feast, viz.</hi> their <hi>remembring injuries,</hi> or <hi>thinking the worse of their Enemies,</hi> or <hi>carrying themselves towards them at a distance,</hi> or excluding them from all <hi>particular Trust</hi> and <hi>Confidence,</hi> and the like; so long as they shew them all that Love which is due to <hi>all</hi> men out of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Charity</hi> and <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> and are ready to shew them <hi>more</hi> when their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> fits them for it; they ought not in any wise to put them by it. They are

                        <p>They are an Hindrance from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when there is sin in them.

in any others. And <hi>1 Cor. 6.7.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, which makes them not a Damning sin, but only, when some Virtuous ends do not require them, a Defect and Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution. But they are sinful, <hi>1.</hi> When they are begun upon an unjustifiable Ground. Such they always are, <hi>1.</hi> When they are Vindictive, not Reparative; as when we sue insolvent Persons; or others upon such Words or Actions, for which, besides costs, no Dammages that are valuable are like to be allotted us. <hi>2.</hi> When they are for Reparation of small things, which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail not the evil and hazard of a Suit, but ought to be a matter of Patience and Forgiveness, and so be quietly put up without recourse to it. In judging of this smallness, we must not estimate by our own Pride and Passions; but by the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of things, and the Judgment of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, humble, and dispassionate Persons. This is true, not only in case of Injuries to our own selves, but also in case of Trust, when we have the charge of others. <hi>2.</hi> Suits are sinful when they are carried on by a sinful management: As they are, when they make us Transgress any of those Duties towards our Adversaries, which oblige us towards all Persons. To avoid all these in suing is an hard point: So we must be slow in coming to it, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52843:171"/>
very circumspect when we are forced upon it. The Answer to this Hindrance summ'd up.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEsides those Particulars, which I have considered in the <hi>last Chapter,</hi> there is <hi>another want of Charity,</hi> which may seem of greater weight, and which is most commonly pleaded in Excuse of mens abstaining from the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that is the point of <hi>Law-Suits.</hi> For this is very frequently given as a Reason why men dare not receive the Communion, because they have a <hi>Legal Controversie with their Neighbours, and a Suit depending.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as to <hi>Law-Suits,</hi> when they have <hi>no sin</hi> in them, they are like all other <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> things, and <hi>need not hinder</hi> men: but when they are <hi>sinful,</hi> they are like <hi>all other sins, i. e.</hi> they unfit us till we shew <hi>Repentance,</hi> and ought to hinder us so long as we continue in them. But as then they are an hindrance to a <hi>worthy Receiving</hi>; so are they equally to a <hi>worthy Prayer,</hi> and to all <hi>just hopes of Heaven.</hi> Whilst we go on with them, we cannot pray to God, or think to have our sins pardon'd, or, should we be snatched away to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this state, expect to be happy in another World. And this is a state,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:52843:171"/>
wherein no considerate man will persist for one moment; but when he sees his Suit is so offensive to God, and brings his Eternal welfare into so great hazard, he will either manage it more innocently, so as that there shall be no offence in it; or break it off without delay, and instantly put an end to it. And when once he has done this, or is fully purposed in his own mind so to do; he is again a Friend of God, and fit to joyn in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as in Prayers, or in any other part of Worship.</p>
                     <p>Thus doth the <hi>weight of this Hindrance</hi> from the Communion, lye in the <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> or <hi>unlawfulness of the Suit</hi> which is depending. And therefore that Persons <hi>at Law</hi> may know when they are unfit to Communicate till they have put a stop to it, and when they may do it notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; I shall here state the case of <hi>Law-Suits,</hi> and shew when a <hi>Tryal</hi> is our <hi>Fault,</hi> and when 'tis <hi>innocent,</hi> that so we may know when we <hi>need not,</hi> and when we <hi>ought to be hindred</hi> by it.</p>
                     <p>In pursuit of this, I shall endeavour to clear up these <hi>two</hi> Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A Suit at Law is not a thing unlawful in it self, but may be innocent, if nothing else comes in to make a sin of it.</hi> But then,</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:52843:172"/>2. <hi>It is our sin and a matter of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when it is either upon an unjustifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ground, or carried on by a sinful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. I say, <hi>a Suit at Law is not a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in it self, but may be innocent if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else comes in to make a sin of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is no unlawful thing barely to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a Title, or to bring an Action; it is in some Cases allowed, as well as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it is prohibited: so that a man may be Faultless that has a Suit, unless some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more comes in to make him a Transgressour in it. The offence lies not in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, so as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from the <hi>Thing</hi>; but only in the <hi>Cause,</hi> or in the <hi>manner of Suing</hi>: for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> said of the <hi>Law of God</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> so may we of the <hi>Laws</hi> of our <hi>several Countries, the Law is</hi> a <hi>good</hi> thing <hi>if a man use it lawfully,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.8; it is no sin to use it or take the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it, but only to transgress some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Precept, or join some other sin with it when we do.</p>
                     <p>Now this may appear,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From <hi>the necessity of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. From <hi>the Magistrates Office being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. From <hi>Gods taking a Legal Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon himself, as if he were the Author of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:52843:172"/>4. From <hi>Courts being Erected by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Apostles Days, to minister to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. From <hi>the Practice of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and St.</hi> Paul <hi>who claimed the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it,</hi> and thereby <hi>plainly warranted and authorized it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. It appears, I say, from <hi>the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of it.</hi> A Tryal at Law must needs be innocent in it self when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else corrupts it, because it is a thing we cannot want, and there is no living in the World without it. For take away <hi>Law,</hi> which should secure <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent mens Properties,</hi> and bridle all <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, Angry, Spiteful, Covetous, Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> and <hi>Ambitious</hi> mens <hi>rapacious</hi> and <hi>encroaching humours</hi>: and, since all places are fully stored with these injurious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, the Wicked being by far the greatest numbers, the <hi>Quiet</hi> and <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious</hi> must flee into <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Desarts,</hi> or, if they stay to Associate with others, become every where a <hi>Prey</hi> to their <hi>gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>usurping Neighbours.</hi> If there were no Laws to protect them, there were no living in this World for good men; and in effect there would be none, if it were a sin in them to try a Title, or Right themselves by them. For no man that had a mind to it, would be aw'd
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52843:173"/>
from doing wrong by a Law that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be a Sword in a Scabbard, and must never be pleaded against him, or executed upon him when he transgresses it. The use of Law then in this World is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to <hi>all Society,</hi> to <hi>keep Peace</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> in all Converse, and to <hi>protect</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> all such as desire to <hi>serve God</hi> and to be <hi>Conscientious.</hi> And since there is that necessity of it for Gods Service, and all Virtuous Ends; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in its own Nature be a thing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and unlawful to us. It cannot be it self a Sin, which God has made so absolutely necessary to keep all others out: it must needs be allowed by him, since without it his own ends of Peace and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice cannot be attain'd; it is at least sure an <hi>innocent,</hi> if not a <hi>good</hi> thing, which gives the only protection to all Goodness, and without which there is no living for Good men in Societies, where they may do God publick Service, and draw in others, nor indeed any safe abode for them upon the Earth at all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That a <hi>Suit at Law</hi> is not <hi>sinful in it self,</hi> but may sometimes be <hi>innocent,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>the Magistrates Office being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>One part</hi> of the <hi>Magistrates Office</hi> lies, indeed, in <hi>protecting</hi> his Subjects against
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:52843:173"/>
all <hi>Foreign Force</hi> and <hi>Invasions.</hi> But his most <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> work, is to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Justice,</hi> and <hi>maintain Peace</hi> among <hi>themselves</hi>; which is done by <hi>hearing Causes,</hi> and <hi>judging in all Controversies and Arraignments,</hi> giving Sentence on the side which the Law favours, and where the Right Lies. Thus is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Office to <hi>hear</hi> Causes or Suits at Law, and to <hi>decide</hi> them. And this work he doth not assume to himself, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>without,</hi> or <hi>against</hi> Gods liking; but <hi>according</hi> to <hi>his appointment,</hi> and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>with his approbation.</hi> For <hi>by me,</hi> says <hi>Wisdom, Kings Reign, and Princes Decree Justice,</hi> Prov. 8.15. And <hi>the Powers that be,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, are appointed of God, they are Gods Ordinance,</hi> Rom. 13.1, 2. And since God himself appoints them to hear our Causes, we may well presume he will not look upon it as our sin to bring them to their hearing. For God would never appoint an Ordinance to minister only to Mens sins, and to put them in a way of multiplying Offences; so that since he has appointed Officers to hear it, a Suit at Law in it self must needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and capable to be carried on without any sin at all.</p>
                     <p>Nay, God has not only appointed the Magistaates Office for it: But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:52843:174"/>3. When <hi>a Legal Determination is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he takes it upon himself, as if he were the Author of it</hi>; which is still a further Evidence that we do not sin barely in seeking to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He takes a Legal Determination,</hi> I say, <hi>upon himself, as if he were the Author of it.</hi> In the <hi>Jewish State, God</hi> was their <hi>Political Prince</hi> and <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> among them were as much <hi>his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,</hi> and did <hi>represent his Person,</hi> as now the <hi>Judges</hi> do the <hi>Person</hi> of their <hi>several Princes</hi> in all other <hi>Nations.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moses</hi> told them when he appointed <hi>them,</hi> that the <hi>Judgment was God's,</hi> and that they gave Sentence only as his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, and judged not for <hi>themselves,</hi> but for the <hi>Lord,</hi> Deut. 1.17.</p>
                     <p>Now, tho' <hi>other</hi> Nations cannot look upon God as their <hi>Secular King,</hi> and <hi>State-Head</hi> in <hi>all</hi> those Points which the <hi>Jews</hi> could, for he gave them <hi>Laws in Civil Affairs,</hi> and issued out <hi>Directions in State Exigencies,</hi> and the like: yet as to <hi>this</hi> they can, that <hi>all their Governours</hi> are but <hi>Substitutes under him,</hi> and that he owns what is legally and justly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by them. For the <hi>Magistrate</hi> he looks upon as his <hi>Minister</hi> and <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent,</hi> who doth all things in his Name and Stead; <hi>the Power,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:52843:174"/>
the Minister of God,</hi> Rom. 13.4. And since he acts as <hi>his Servant,</hi> he takes his judicial Determination upon himself, as if it were his own, and he were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. For this he doth plainly in <hi>Criminal</hi> Causes, and the Case is the same in all other <hi>Judicial</hi> that are not <hi>Criminal.</hi> When any man is wrong'd, saith he, let him not <hi>avenge himself, for Vengeance is mine, I will repay</hi> it; <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Magistrate who is my <hi>avenger to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Wrath,</hi> so that when he punishes, you may look upon it as if I had done it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. and 13.4.</p>
                     <p>And since a Legal Determination is owned by God himself as if he were the Author of it, we may be sure, whilst all things else are right, that there is no hurt barely in our seeking of it. It can be no sin to ask what God grants, for <hi>he hears not Sinners</hi> in their Sins, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31; nor can it give any Offence in a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Case, to appeal to his own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. So that since in all Legal Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations it is God himself, who by his Ministers passes Judgment; we may be assured that we do not displease him in applying our selves thereto, when there is just cause for it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That a <hi>Suit at Law</hi> and all <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

                        <hi>The thing it self,</hi> I say, <hi>seems so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</hi> For in these Assemblies St. <hi>James condemns all Respect of Persons,</hi> and <hi>discrimination of Rich and Poor,</hi> by giving <hi>Honour</hi> according to Peoples <hi>Qualities</hi>: which was unlawful only in <hi>Judicatures,</hi> but is a <hi>Duty in Conversation</hi> and <hi>Common Carriage.</hi> For it is an <hi>Apostolical</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, to <hi>give Honour to whom Honour is due,</hi> Rom. 13.7. And those <hi>Servants,</hi> who have <hi>believing Masters,</hi> are forbid to with-draw any thing of their Respect, presuming upon their Spiritual Kindred, or to <hi>Honour them the less,</hi> because they are become their <hi>Brethren</hi> in being <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.2. So that although in Judgment-Seats, not mens <hi>Qualities,</hi> but <hi>Causes</hi> only ought to be respected; yet in other Assemblies a regard may be given to their Persons, and 'tis commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable so to do.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>several Particulars here spoken of these Assemblies seem so to determine it.</hi> For the <hi>Offenders</hi> here taxed with Respecting Persons in them, are said <hi>to have a Foot-stool,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>They are said <hi>to give Evil Judgment, i. e.</hi> to pass Sentence on the wrong side, as he is like to do who tries not <hi>Things</hi> but <hi>Persons,</hi> and determines from <hi>By-respects,</hi>

                     <p>They are said <hi>to transgress the Law in this regarding Persons,</hi> and treating them differently according to the difference of their outward State and Condition; when in this different carriage towards <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor, ye have respect of Persons,</hi> says he, <hi>ye commit sin, and are convinced of the Law,</hi> which plainly forbids such pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, <hi>as Transgressours,</hi> v. 3.9. And this seems clearly to restrain it to their <hi>Court-Assemblies.</hi> For in <hi>Judgment</hi> there is a Law forbidding all respect of Persons, <hi>Ye shall not respect Persons in Judgment, but you shall hear the small as well as the great,</hi> Deut. 1.17. and Levit. 19.15. But there is no Law that forbids it, yea, rather, since St. <hi>Paul</hi> injoins us to <hi>give Honour</hi> where <hi>Honour is due,</hi> and directs <hi>Servants</hi> to pay never the <hi>less,</hi> but rather <hi>more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to their Masters, because they are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> and would not have <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.33.</note>

Besides, what is still a further Evidence of this point, they are said particularly to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52843:178"/>
the Law in bidding <hi>the Rich to sit,</hi> and <hi>the Poor to stand,</hi> v. 3, 9; which, as a <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Ham. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. <hi>in</hi> loc.</note> great man observes, was a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly forbid by a <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> to all that sate in Judgment. For that required in all <hi>Suits</hi> and <hi>Judicial Tryals</hi> betwixt <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor,</hi> that either <hi>both should stand,</hi> or <hi>both should sit</hi>; which is a thing, as he adds, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve at this day in hearing Causes; for then, if one presuming upon his quality <hi>take a Seat,</hi> the <hi>Judge</hi> presently says to the other, <hi>sit thou down also.</hi>

                     <p>And thus I think it appears, that the <hi>Assemblies,</hi> which in this intricate place St. <hi>James</hi> mentions, are <hi>Court-Assemblies</hi> and Judicial Consistories; both because <hi>the Nature of the thing seems to require it,</hi> since in them he forbids all respect of Persons, which elsewhere is not prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and also because <hi>several particulars here spoken of them seem so to determine it.</hi> For they are said to be <hi>such Assemblies,</hi> wherein <hi>is a Foot-stool,</hi> the usual Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to <hi>Chairs of State</hi> and <hi>Seats of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; wherein <hi>men were Judges of Evil Thoughts,</hi> i. e. <hi>judged wrong,</hi> and <hi>gave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse See<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Persons,</hi> was <hi>against a plain Law forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it,</hi> as we find there is a very express one in <hi>Judicial Proceedings,</hi> but none at all, nay, rather the contrary in all <hi>other Cases</hi>; and, lastly, such wherein to <hi>bid a Rich man sit, and a Poor man stand, was a transgression of a Precept,</hi> as in <hi>Court As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies</hi> it plainly is, being against an <hi>express Canon of the Jews in Judgment.</hi> By all which I suppose it may appear, that <hi>Judicial Consistories</hi> are the <hi>Assemblies</hi> here intended.</p>
                     <p>Thus were Judicatures <hi>prescribed,</hi> and <hi>ordinarily used</hi> in the Apostles Days. St. <hi>Paul</hi> appoints the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to ere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t them; and St. <hi>James</hi> makes mention of them as of an ordinary thing among them; and that too without passing any mark of dislike upon the Courts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when he blames that partiality and respect of Persons which they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them. These <hi>Judicatures,</hi> indeed, were erected by their <hi>own consent</hi> among themselves; and were not imposed on them by <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> as other <hi>Legal Tribunals</hi> are: but they serv'd for the same end of <hi>hearing Causes,</hi> and <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such Sentence as should take effect</hi> and <hi>put an end to Controversies,</hi> as other <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seats</hi>; so that the same thing was done by them in suing in <hi>their</hi> Courts,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52843:179"/>
which is done by us in <hi>ours.</hi> In our <hi>Judgment-Halls,</hi> 'tis true, where things are managed by <hi>Advocates,</hi> that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times seek <hi>Conquest</hi> and not <hi>Justice,</hi> and ransack all Reserves of Law to support, as long as <hi>Craft</hi> can do it, an unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cause; there is more room for ill Arts, which bring more sin into our <hi>Pleadings.</hi> But that is not a Fault inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from <hi>Suits,</hi> but is the sin of <hi>Managers</hi>; it lies not <hi>naturally upon the thing,</hi> but only upon the <hi>Contingent circumstances</hi> and <hi>manner of doing</hi>; so that if we are careful to keep it free from them, a Suit in it self may still be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and carried on as lawfully in our Courts, as it was in those of the Apostles Days.</p>
                     <p>And as this Lawfulness of Judicial Process appears from these <hi>Legal Courts</hi> erected in the <hi>Apostles</hi> Days to <hi>minister to it</hi>: so doth it yet further,</p>
                     <p n="5">5. From <hi>the Practice of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and St.</hi> Paul, <hi>who claimed the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it, and thereby plainly warranted and authorized it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Blessed Lord himself,</hi> I say, <hi>claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Benefit of it.</hi> For when the Officer in the <hi>High-Priests</hi> presence <hi>struck him with the Palm of his Hand,</hi> he openly complains of the illegality of the Act,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52843:179"/>
and expostulates before him for a redress of it. <hi>If I have spoken Evil,</hi> says he, testify against me, and <hi>bear witness of the Evil: but if well, why smitest thou me</hi>? Joh. 18.22, 23.</p>
                     <p>And after him St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not afraid to plead his own Cause, and serve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of Law, when others went about to use him with Violence contrary to it. For when the Chief Captain ordered him to be <hi>scourged uncondemned,</hi> he pleads the <hi>Legal Priviledge</hi> of a <hi>Roman,</hi> who ought not to be so treated, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.24, 25. And when the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of <hi>Philippi,</hi> contrary to all Law and Priviledge, had <hi>scourged him</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> without any hearing of their Cause; he threatens them for it, and would not put it up, unless in Compensation they would <hi>come themselves</hi> in Person to <hi>release them out of Prison,</hi> and do them Honour before all the Multitude: <hi>Act.</hi> 16.36, 37, 38, 39. Nay, he uses all <hi>wise Arts of Law</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Righteous Cause,</hi> and when he was not like to have <hi>Justice</hi> done him in one <hi>Court, protests</hi> against <hi>it,</hi> and claims the Benefit of <hi>appeal</hi> to <hi>another.</hi> For <hi>when</hi> Festus <hi>willing to do the</hi> Jews <hi>a Pleasure,</hi> would have had him <hi>go up</hi> to be <hi>judg'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>in the way</hi> whereto the <hi>Jews design'd to murder him</hi>; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52843:180"/>
                        <hi>I stand at</hi> Caesars <hi>Judgment-Seat, where I ought to be judged; if I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any thing worthy of Death, I refuse not to die; but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, as thou very well knowest,</hi> the Law of the Empire is my Protection, and <hi>no Man may deliver me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, I appeal unto</hi> Caesar, Acts 25.3, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>And thus from all these Considerations it appears, that a <hi>Suit at Law</hi> is not a thing unalterably evil, and <hi>unlawful in it self</hi>; but may very innocently be carried on, if no Sin mixes with it to turn it into a Transgression. It is a thing which God has allowed when we have <hi>just cause</hi> for it, and are guilty of <hi>no Vice</hi> in the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of it.

And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, when the <hi>Chief Captain</hi> would have scourged him uncondemned; he pleads the priviledge of a <hi>Roman,</hi> which ought to secure him from being so hardly treated, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.25.

them; but stood upon their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and Legally withstood them. So that these Precepts are not to be taken in the Literal Compass, (in which sence St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yea, and <hi>Christ</hi> himself too, would have been Transgressors,) nor so as to forbid us at any time to serve our selves of Law when we are brought before Tribunals: since St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who very well understood them, nay, our Blessed <hi>Lord,</hi> who to the height fulfilled them, have <hi>taught</hi> and <hi>authoriz'd</hi> us by their Example so to do.</p>
                     <p>Nay, they <hi>do not forbid us in all Cases to bring others before Magistrates, and seek unto Judicatories to Right our selves.</hi> For St. <hi>Paul</hi> did something towards this in his Contest with the <hi>Philippian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>; where, though he was an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender against the Laws, yet in regard they had treated him illegally, in scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>him</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> uncondemned, against the Priviledge of <hi>Romans</hi>; he terrifies them with it, and would not put it up, till they Compounded with him upon his own Terms, and brought him honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably out of Prison in the Eyes of all the Citizens, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.36, 37, 38, 39.

Days,</hi> which were prescribed by the Apostles themselves for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

                     <p>As for these places then, which seem to forbid Suits either on <hi>Losses</hi> or <hi>Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> they do not forbid them <hi>absolutely,</hi> and in <hi>all</hi> Cases. They only forbid us to fly to them in <hi>smaller</hi> matters, such as our Saviour mentions; or to make them a <hi>means of Revenge</hi> in <hi>Great</hi> ones; or say of Suits in General, where a <hi>publick</hi> end or some <hi>other Virtue</hi> doth not require them, that they are, although not our <hi>sin,</hi> yet our <hi>Defect</hi> and <hi>Diminution</hi>: So that whensoever they are <hi>sued</hi> at Law, the <hi>best</hi> men may <hi>serve themselves</hi> of it; and when they are <hi>greatly injured,</hi> though 'twere <hi>better</hi> to let it alone, yet may they <hi>safely seek to it,</hi> and, without any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to God or wrong to a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>implead others</hi> still.</p>
                     <p>And thus it appears that Suits at Law are not <hi>sinful in themselves,</hi> but may lawfully be used, if there is no unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the <hi>Ground,</hi> and <hi>way of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The thing it self has no sin in it, and so may be innocent if we take care that no other sin adhere to it. So that barely to try a Title is no matter of any
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52843:186"/>
mans account, nor has any offence at all in it.</p>
                     <p>But although Suits at Law are not thus unlawful in themselves, but may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be innocent; yet as I said,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They <hi>are our sin and a matter of our account, when they are either enter'd upon an unjustifiable Ground, or are carried on by a sinful Management.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. I say <hi>Suits at Law are our sin,</hi> and <hi>a matter of our account, when they are begun upon an unjustifiable Ground.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not every cause that usually <hi>begets</hi> it, which can <hi>warrant</hi> before God, and <hi>Justify a Law-Suit.</hi> For sometimes men are led on to it only by <hi>Revenge,</hi> when they have no lasting Dammage to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, but seek only their Brothers smart, and to be even with him who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it: and then the Suit must needs be unlawful, having a <hi>sin</hi> at the bottom of it. And at other times, when there is a <hi>real Dammage,</hi> yet is it so <hi>trivial</hi> as that the making of it up will not countervail the Evils and Temptations of a Suit; and then it will be sinful still, as wanting a Ground of so much weight, as can bear the burden of it. For a Tryal at Law, besides its being a <hi>costly</hi> and <hi>painful</hi> thing, is also a very <hi>perillous State,</hi> and a <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Temptation.</hi> It will be sure to put
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:52843:186"/>
                        <hi>him we sue</hi> to much <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> in <hi>Collecting</hi> and <hi>Examining Evidences, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Witnesses, informing Advocates,</hi> and <hi>attending Courts,</hi> which is toyl in it self, and an hindrance to better business: and in the whole Course and Conduct of it, it will put him to <hi>constant Charges</hi> and <hi>Expence.</hi> And it will be a <hi>State of great Temptation,</hi> both to <hi>him</hi> and to <hi>our selves,</hi> insnaring us, unless we are very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to prevent it, into <hi>covetous Wishes,</hi> or <hi>delays of Justice,</hi> or <hi>vexatious Arts,</hi> or <hi>uncharitable Surmizes,</hi> and <hi>revengeful Thoughts,</hi> or <hi>deceitful Suggestions</hi> and <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifications, Hypocritically disguising</hi> the <hi>weakness</hi> of our <hi>own</hi> Cause, or <hi>unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aggravating</hi> those of <hi>our Adversaries</hi> to our own profit and his prejudice, and the like. These sins are ever before men whilst a Suit is depending, they have constant opportunities for them, and are perpetually provoked into them; and it must be a <hi>great Conduct,</hi> as well as a <hi>great Care</hi> that must preserve them from being ingaged in them. And since there is so <hi>much Toil attending it,</hi> so <hi>great Charge occasioned by it,</hi> and so <hi>many Temptations</hi> and <hi>great Dangers,</hi> both to our <hi>own Souls</hi> and our <hi>Brothers, laid in the way</hi> of it: it must not be a <hi>light</hi> thing, but a <hi>weighty</hi> Cause indeed, which can over-balance
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52843:187"/>
all these Considerations, and justly draw us to commence it.</p>
                     <p>But in this point to be more Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Suits are <hi>unlawfully</hi> entred when they are begun, either,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>For Revenge, and not for Reparation of Damages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When for <hi>Reparation</hi> only of <hi>small things, which cannot countervail the evil and hazard of a Suit, but ought to exercise our Patience and Forgiveness,</hi> and so <hi>be put up without Recourse to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1st. I say, Suits are <hi>unlawfully entred,</hi> when they are <hi>Vindictive</hi> not <hi>Reparative,</hi> and are <hi>begun only for Revenge, not for Repair of Damages.</hi> And this they always are, when they are commenced either against <hi>insolvent Persons</hi>; or <hi>upon such words and actions against others, for which,</hi> besides <hi>Costs, no Damages</hi> that are <hi>valuable are like to be allowed us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are not <hi>Reparative,</hi> but <hi>Vindictive,</hi> when they are commenced against <hi>insol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Persons.</hi> When we sue a <hi>poor</hi> man, who cannot pay what he ows, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence what he has wrongfully done to us, it is not that our own Sore may be heal'd, but only that his Smart may be wrought by it. For the Law doth not make him Coin Money that has it not, but only
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52843:187"/>
forces him to pay it, who has it, but will not part with it. To put a <hi>Beggar</hi> in Prison, and run him out at Law to the utmost, is not the way to put Money in his Pocket; so that when we have to do with such, it is only Revenge upon him, and not the Compensation of our own Loss, which can be sought by it. If we go to right our selves by Law then upon an insolvent man, we go only to return the hurt which he has done, and to be even with him. And this is a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of an <hi>hard Heart,</hi> and a <hi>spiteful Spirit</hi>; and is quite contrary to that <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly-kindness, Compassion,</hi> and <hi>Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which, how <hi>unworthy</hi> soever <hi>he</hi> may be of it, yet so long as the <hi>misery</hi> of <hi>his case</hi> requires it, God has injoyn'd us to use towards him. It is exactly to deal with <hi>him,</hi> as the <hi>wicked man</hi> did with his <hi>insolvent Brother</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> which provoked God to return the same Rigour upon his own head again. For when <hi>he ought his Lord ten thousand Talents, he freely forgave him</hi> that great <hi>Debt,</hi> because he was <hi>not able to pay it</hi>: But when his <hi>Fellow-Servant, who ought him</hi> only <hi>an hundred Pence,</hi> could not tender down that small s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mm when he demanded it, he shew'd nothing of that Compassion towards this poor man which God had shewn to him,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52843:188"/>
but <hi>laid hands on him,</hi> and <hi>cast him into Prison till payment</hi> should be made. But when <hi>the Fellow-Servants told</hi> this <hi>to their Lord,</hi> he resolves to deal with him in his own way, and strictly <hi>exacts</hi> that Debt, which otherwise he intended freely to have <hi>acquitted, delivering him,</hi> as he had done <hi>his Brother, to the Tormentors,</hi> till all should be discharged. And <hi>so likewise shall my Heavenly Father do to you,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>if ye from your Hearts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not every one his Brother their Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,</hi> Mat. 18. v. 24. to c. 19.</p>
                     <p>But if they are commenced against <hi>responsible</hi> Persons, they are not <hi>Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> but <hi>Vindictive</hi> still, if they are <hi>upon such Words or Actions, for which,</hi> besides <hi>Costs,</hi> no <hi>Damages</hi> that are <hi>valuable are like to be allowed us.</hi> A great number of Suits are for <hi>abusive Words,</hi> or a <hi>Box on the Ear,</hi> or some other <hi>trivial</hi> matters, which leave no <hi>Permanent ill effects,</hi> but if our <hi>Passions</hi> may be with-held from esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating them, pass off without making. us the <hi>worse,</hi> or doing us <hi>any Prejudice.</hi> And in all these, since there is no Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage sticks to us, there is no <hi>need</hi> of any Reparations: so that if we begin Suits, it is not to <hi>indemni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this is most strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden to all us <hi>Christians</hi> in the <hi>New.</hi> For we are taught <hi>to recompence to no man Evil for Evil, but to overcome Evil with Good,</hi> Rom. 12.17, 20, 21: to <hi>forgive those that Trespass against us, i. e.</hi> not to return their injurious, or hard usage, as ever we expect <hi>forgiveness of our own Trespasses</hi> at <hi>Gods hands,</hi> Mat. 6.12, 14, 15. And particularly in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this <hi>going to Law for Revenge,</hi> our Saviour forbids us <hi>Judicially</hi> to <hi>resist the Evil man,</hi> as has been shewn, <hi>i. e.</hi> in course of Law to return the Evil on him, as by Virtue of that Rule <hi>An Eye for an Eye,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Jews</hi> did; but in stead of that, by the Phrase of <hi>turning one Cheek to him who has struck the other,</hi> requires that we patiently submit and sit down under it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.38, 39, 40.</p>

God requires to the Lawfulness of all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Tryals; they must never be <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive,</hi> but <hi>Reparative,</hi> and we must not Sue another in order to <hi>his Smart</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi> but only to <hi>heal</hi> or <hi>secure our own selves,</hi> either by <hi>holding</hi> the <hi>Goods</hi> which he <hi>cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2.

Upon these, or such like <hi>secular Maxims,</hi> when nothing but the interest of this World guides them, they many times conclude the sleightest wrongs are not to be put up, and therefore, when in any trivial thing their Right is inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, betake themselves to course of Law for Maintenance and Vindication of it.</p>
                     <p>But in <hi>Religion</hi> the Case is altered. For that seeks not only what is fit to <hi>secure our selves,</hi> and maintain our <hi>worldly Rights</hi>; but what is fit to maintain an <hi>Vniversal innocence,</hi> and to shew <hi>Charity</hi> towards <hi>others.</hi> Its main work lies in lessening the Love of this World, and making us easie to part with any injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Life, when it is inconsistent with any Duty, and indangers our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to a better. And therefore although <hi>secular wisdom</hi> would perhaps sometimes advise us, yet will <hi>true Religion</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forbid us to go to <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>trivial Losses.</hi> For a Suit at Law, as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will put our <hi>Adversary</hi> to great <hi>Cost</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi>; and since in Christianity he is our <hi>Neighbour</hi> and our <hi>Brother,</hi> this we
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52843:190"/>
ought not to do for little things, whereby we shall not gain near so much as he loses, for this is not according to the <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 22.39.</note> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>to Love him as our selves.</hi> Nay, it will be a <hi>great snare,</hi> both to <hi>his</hi> Virtue and <hi>ours</hi>; for although it be no state of <hi>direct sin,</hi> yet is it a state of very <hi>dangerous Temptation,</hi> there being so many ways to offend whilst a Suit is carrying on, and it being so very hard to avoid them without great Conduct and Circumspection. And this also we <hi>ought</hi> not lightly to cast, either in the way of our <hi>own</hi> Souls, or of our <hi>Brothers</hi>; yea, we <hi>shall</hi> not do it, if we have any of that <hi>tender Love</hi> and <hi>Care for Souls</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> has shew'd, and which he requires <hi>us</hi> to shew, when, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a prospect of saving them, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us, not only to <hi>bear a Reproach,</hi> or to <hi>part with our Substance</hi>; but even <hi>to lay down our own Lives for others,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.16.</p>
                     <p>Thus, when the Damages to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired are but of <hi>small</hi> account, and the trouble and charges of the Suit will take much more from him, than we are like to get by it: out of our <hi>tender care</hi> of <hi>all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> whom God commands us to <hi>Love as we do our selves</hi>; and out of our <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>each others Souls,</hi> and desire to keep,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:52843:190"/>
both <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>them</hi> from <hi>dangerous Temptations,</hi> which would rob us of our <hi>Innocence,</hi> a thing that ought not to be hazarded for <hi>trifling</hi> Regards; we ought <hi>patiently to bear</hi> the Loss, and not seek out by Law to redress it. And this, as I have intimated, is what our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly commanded <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>If one smite thee on thy right Cheek,</hi> which is a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affront, <hi>turn to him the other also,</hi> or expose thy self to be smitten again, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than judicially resist it. <hi>And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man sue thee at the Law, to take away thy Coat,</hi> or inner Garment, a thing that may easily be spared, hazard an higher Loss, and <hi>let him take thy Cloak also,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than sue to regain it. <hi>v.</hi> 38, 39, 40. So that rather than sue to recover little matters, and enter Actions for small Reparations, we must be content to want them, and sit down without any Repairs at all.</p>
                     <p>And in rating when things are thus <hi>little</hi> and <hi>frivolous,</hi> we must not judge by our own <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> which count nothing little, but aggrandize every affront or injury that is done to our own selves: but by the <hi>reality of things,</hi> and according as we <hi>our selves</hi> should judge were we <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>dispassionate,</hi> or as they would be judg'd of by <hi>other Holy</hi>

and <hi>Indifferent Persons.</hi> Our own <hi>Pride,</hi> and the <hi>Opinions of the World</hi> would whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to us, that <hi>every Trespass against us</hi> is <hi>intolerable,</hi> and <hi>deserves a Process</hi>; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>imputation of a Lye,</hi> a <hi>Stab</hi>; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>actionable Affront,</hi> a <hi>Suit</hi> at least, if not a <hi>Challenge.</hi> But <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> and the <hi>Opinions of the World,</hi> must not be our Councellors: for we <hi>renounced</hi> them at our <hi>Baptism,</hi> when we were first made Christians; and if we would please God, they must not sway, but ought daily to be <hi>mortified</hi> and <hi>subdued</hi> in us. And since they are so much our <hi>Sin,</hi> and so directly against our <hi>Baptismal Vow</hi> and <hi>Profession</hi>: it will be no excuse for going to Law on <hi>little Losses</hi> and <hi>Indignities,</hi> to say we <hi>thought</hi> them <hi>Great</hi> through <hi>their</hi> being our <hi>Advisers.</hi> In judging then what are <hi>little</hi> things, we must not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by our own <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> but by the <hi>reality of things,</hi> and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>dispassionate, humble</hi> Persons.

                     <p>And thus it appears when a Suit is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful upon this <hi>first</hi> account, <hi>viz. its entring upon an unjustifiable Ground.</hi> For such it is in all Cases, when we bring an Action only for <hi>Revenge,</hi> and not for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Damages</hi>; or when for the Reparation of such <hi>small</hi> things, as ought not to expose us to all the <hi>Evils</hi> and <hi>Temptations</hi> of a <hi>judicial Process,</hi> but to Exercise our <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Forgiveness</hi>: which <hi>smallness</hi> of things is to be rated, not by mens <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem

no ill small that is done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but by the <hi>reality of things,</hi> and the <hi>Judgment of Humble</hi> and <hi>Dispassionate</hi> persons.</p>
                     <p>And this holds true, not only in Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Indignities offered to <hi>our selves</hi>; but also in the Case of <hi>Trust,</hi> when they are offered to <hi>others</hi> who are committed to us. For when Suits are <hi>Sinful,</hi> as we have seen they are in the Case of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> and of <hi>lighter affronts</hi> and <hi>injuries,</hi> which Christ Commands us not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress by Law, but to bear with Patience: I see no difference, but an <hi>equal unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> whether we Sue upon our <hi>own,</hi> or upon <hi>their</hi> Accounts. For surely our taking of a <hi>Trust</hi> doth not ingage us to <hi>Disobey</hi> our Lord, or do any <hi>evil</hi> thing; but only to do all that which we can, for those committed to us, as <hi>Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> and <hi>Honest Men.</hi> And therefore in <hi>lighter</hi> matters when Suits are <hi>sinful,</hi> we may no more <hi>Sue</hi> for them, than we can tell a <hi>Lie,</hi> or <hi>Swear</hi> an <hi>Oath,</hi> or <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reach</hi> in their Cause, or be guilty of any <hi>other Transgression.</hi> If they were come up to Act in <hi>their own Name,</hi> in these cases a <hi>Judicial Tryal</hi> would not be <hi>lawful,</hi> but a <hi>sin</hi> in them: And where <hi>they themselves</hi> could not Sue, we must not think that <hi>we,</hi> who Act only as their
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52843:192"/>
                        <hi>Proxies</hi> and <hi>Representatives,</hi> may do it for them. If these Losses and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are shewed to them were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to <hi>our selves,</hi> we ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence an Action, but to be patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: And they have no Reason in the World to think us wanting either in our <hi>Trust,</hi> or <hi>Friendship,</hi> when we do all that to the utmost in <hi>their</hi> Case, which we durst do in <hi>our own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So far then as Suits are <hi>Sinful,</hi> and to put up injuries without entring Actions for repairs is a <hi>strict Duty,</hi> as it plainly is in case of <hi>lighter Losses</hi> and <hi>Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; it equally obliges us in <hi>Trust for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> as in our <hi>own Business.</hi> Where 'tis no <hi>Duty,</hi> indeed, and a Suit is not a <hi>Sin,</hi> but only a <hi>Defect</hi> and <hi>Diminution,</hi> as it is in the Case of <hi>greater injuries,</hi> there is a Difference, and tho it were commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble still to refrain in our <hi>own</hi> Case, yet 'tis not in <hi>theirs.</hi> In the former Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to forbear is a <hi>necessary</hi> point, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an express Precept for it; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary things may be done for them by those that represent them, without their <hi>own</hi> consent and approbation. But in these Cases where 'tis no sin, to forbear is no <hi>necessary Duty,</hi> but a <hi>voluntary Act</hi>: And it is no part of our Trust to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form voluntary heights, and unrequired
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52843:193"/>
Generosities at their cost: but if ever these be done, they must be left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when, by making it a matter of their <hi>own choice,</hi> they themselves may have the <hi>Virtue</hi> and the <hi>Reward</hi> of it. So far then as the putting up an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without a Suit is no <hi>Strict Duty,</hi> but only a <hi>Free-will Offering,</hi> and a <hi>Voluntary Act,</hi> it must not be done in <hi>their</hi> Case, tho in <hi>our own</hi> it were much to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. But when Patience is a Duty, and Suits are <hi>sinful,</hi> whether it be <hi>their</hi> concern or <hi>ours</hi> it matters not, for <hi>both</hi> are <hi>equal.</hi> We must be <hi>faithful to our Lord,</hi> and observe the Duties of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Peace, Forgiveness,</hi> and all other Laws of God, in acting for <hi>others</hi> as well as for <hi>our selves</hi>; so that when there is no justifiable Ground of Suit, we must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from it, whether it be for <hi>Publick</hi> or for <hi>Private</hi> ends, whether our <hi>Charge</hi> or <hi>we</hi> that are concerned in it. And this I have noted for the use of those, who, I think, are greatly out in this point: For there are several, that <hi>would,</hi> or at least <hi>pretend thy would</hi> bear much in their <hi>own Business,</hi> who will bear nothing at all, and yet think they are not <hi>litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> in commencing Suits for every trifle, when they are in <hi>Trust for others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as some Suits are thus <hi>unlawful,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:52843:193"/>
                        <hi>they are upon an unjustifiable Ground</hi>; so, when the <hi>Grounds</hi> are <hi>good,</hi> are others <hi>unlawful,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>A Suit at Law is a very <hi>dangerous state,</hi> and has <hi>strong Temptations</hi> to several sins accompanying it: And if, when there is <hi>just</hi> Cause for it, any of <hi>these</hi> are incurr'd in the <hi>management,</hi> it is our <hi>Sin</hi> still, and we shall be put to answer for it.</p>
                     <p>To shew what <hi>these</hi> are, and when Suits are unlawful upon this account, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that when we have an Action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Man, we must for all that look upon him as our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and <hi>love him as our selves,</hi> paying him all that <hi>Justice, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which is due to all Persons. And this is hard to do when Men persue any <hi>controversies</hi> wherein their Interest is concerned, especially when they are <hi>Publick,</hi> and if they do not succeed, the Eyes of the World look on to see them worsted, as it is in <hi>Law-Suits.</hi> For then <hi>Conquest</hi> is the end that is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily sought, and in prosecution of that Mens <hi>Passions</hi> generally are ingaged; and <hi>both</hi> these are opposite to the <hi>Love of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and seek only to <hi>please our selves,</hi> and so push us on to transgress this great <hi>Law of Charity</hi> in several instances.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:52843:194"/>

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:52843:196"/>
delays of Justice,</hi> these <hi>Covetous Desires</hi> and <hi>Acts of Impatience,</hi> these <hi>Arts of Circumvention</hi> and <hi>going beyond our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,</hi> these <hi>deceitful Suggestions</hi> and <hi>Falsifications in Pleadings,</hi> these <hi>mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> and <hi>vexatious ways,</hi> this <hi>Hatred, Envy, Evil-speakings</hi> and <hi>Surmises, Anger, Bitterness, Strife, Clamour, Revenge,</hi> &amp;c. which are so ordinarily the Concomitants of Judicial Causes, most unlawful and forbidden things; so that whensoever we have any Suits depending, we sin in them, if any of these intrude and mix with them. A Judicial Controversie that is begun upon a Justifiable Ground, will not be innocent if 'tis carried on by so unjustifiable a management. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to clear our Consciences in all Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Tryals, we must take care not only that, after all other means of righting our selves have fail'd, the Suit be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced for a <hi>thing of weight,</hi> which is a <hi>justifiable Ground</hi>; but also that it be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued in all this <hi>Justice, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which makes a <hi>justifiable manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: For 'tis not enough that the Cause be good, unless the manner of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it be good too.</p>
                     <p>This, I must confess, is an hard Point, because in managing a Suit we are in the way of so many sins, and meet at every
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:52843:196"/>
turn with strong Temptations, which must needs very much indanger us. For all the way these sins lye before us; so that unless we have a constant care, we shall step into them. They generally serve our ends, and set on the cause; so that we are still under a Temptation to them. And, what through our own Interest and the desire of Conquest; what through the opposition that is made; unless we are very Circumspect, our Passions will be ingaged; and then, more or less, we shall be hurried into the Commission of them. So that if no Suit be innocent where the Ground is good, except all these sins be avoided in the management; it will be a very hard thing, may some say, to sue innocently, and appeal to Courts at all.</p>
                     <p>This, indeed, is very true, and I am ready to confess so too. For though some <hi>even-temper'd</hi> men, who are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only with great <hi>goodness,</hi> but also with great <hi>Discretion</hi> and <hi>Government of themselves,</hi> may do it with some ease, and not find it <hi>very difficult</hi>: yet are those men very few in Number, who are so well set out and qualified for it. But ordinarily it is a very difficult task, and there is great danger of offending God attending it. For I think there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:52843:197"/>
any thing that shews more the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of a man, than to be able to keep innocent whilst he is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contending, and so to manage a <hi>Suit,</hi> or <hi>other Contest,</hi> as that, when he has done, his own Conscience shall have no cause to <hi>accuse</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> him for it. But then the effect of this can be nothing else, but that men be very <hi>slow</hi> in coming to it, and very <hi>Circumspect</hi> in all they do, when in a thing of weight, after other means have been tryed in vain, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid it. It must make them <hi>slow</hi> in coming to it, I say; and this, besides its quitting them of the <hi>hazzard,</hi> will, I believe, make also for their <hi>ease</hi>; for they will generally find less difficulty in <hi>bearing Loss,</hi> than in <hi>keeping innocent,</hi> whilst they seek <hi>Judicially to repair</hi> it. But when the thing is of so great weight, that a Suit cannot well be avoided; it must make them very Circumspect and Watchful over themselves all the time it is going on, lest they incur any of these sins in pursuit of it. The greatness of their Care must answer to the greatness of the Danger, so that they must resolve to set a strict Guard upon themselves in suing, or else not venture to begin any Suit at all.</p>
                     <p>And thus it appears, that although in
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:52843:197"/>
                        <hi>it self</hi> a Suit at Law be an innocent thing, yet when 'tis either begun upon an <hi>unjustifiable Ground,</hi> or carried on by a <hi>sinful management,</hi> it is not innocent, but defiles the Conscience of a Christian. It is our <hi>sin,</hi> and we must account for it, when we seek <hi>Revenge</hi> by it, or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> of a thing so <hi>small</hi> as cannot bear it, or of a <hi>weighty</hi> matter by <hi>delays of Justice, Falsifications, Vexatious Arts,</hi> or any other Instances of <hi>Injustice,</hi> or <hi>Vncharitableness,</hi> which is a <hi>sinful way of managing it.</hi> When this is the state of it, there is a great offence in it; and whilst that lasts, it deprives us of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God,</hi> and ought to exclude us from the Holy Sacrament: whereas, were it free of <hi>these,</hi> there would be no hurt in it, nor any Cause at all why a good Soul should be hindred by it.</p>
                     <p>As for this Hindrance then, whereby Devout minds are oft-times with-held from coming to this Feast, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ingaged in a Law-Suit</hi>; we see now at length what weight is to be laid upon it, and when indeed they ought to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by it. For if there are <hi>no Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> to be expected in the Cause, but we sue only for <hi>Revenge</hi>; or if, when there are, they are so <hi>small</hi> as will not bear a Suit, but ought to be a matter of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness</hi>;

or if, when the Loss is of that moment which would justifie a Suit, we transgress any instances of <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> in managing the Process: our Suit is our sin, which will not be forgiven us till we shew <hi>Repentance.</hi> When 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful upon the <hi>unjustifiableness of the Ground,</hi> we sin in it till we <hi>put an end</hi> to it; and when upon some particular <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> or <hi>Vncharitablness</hi> in the <hi>way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,</hi> we sin in it till <hi>that particular</hi> is <hi>Corrected</hi> and <hi>Amended.</hi> And so long as we are Impenitent in <hi>either</hi> of <hi>these,</hi> we are <hi>unfit</hi> for the Holy Sacrament, since no man, who allows himself in any sin, is worthy to partake of it. But then we are equally unfit to <hi>Pray,</hi> or perform any other <hi>Religious Service,</hi> or <hi>hope for the Forgiveness</hi> of <hi>our Sins</hi> and <hi>Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>; because, as I have formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, <hi>Justice, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and other Virtues, are equally necessary in all these Cases. If our Suit then is either upon an <hi>unwarrantable Ground,</hi> or sinful in the <hi>way of management</hi>; so long as this sin <hi>lasts</hi> and is unamended, we are <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to Communicate.</hi> But then that is not all, for so we are also to <hi>Dye,</hi> to <hi>Pray,</hi> or to have any <hi>Spiritual Peace</hi> or <hi>Comfort.</hi> And this is a state which no wise man will persist in for one moment, but, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:52843:198"/>
he lays it to Heart, forthwith Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and get out of it; and when once that is done, this Hindrance is removed, and he may be welcome to it. But if it is innocent in <hi>both</hi> these Respects, and none of <hi>these sins</hi> adhere to it; if there is a <hi>weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Loss</hi> to be repaired, or a <hi>weighty Right</hi> to be got by it; and we are in all Points <hi>Just, Charitable,</hi> and <hi>Peaceable</hi> in looking after it, or, when we fall in any instance, do in that, as in all other slips of our <hi>dayly Converse,</hi> watch better the next time, and <hi>immediately Repent</hi> of it: then has a Suit <hi>no offence to God,</hi> nor any hurt at all in it; and so unfits us not for <hi>any good</hi> thing, and then surely not for the <hi>Blessed Sacrament.</hi> When this is our Case, a Tryal at Law depending need no more hinder us from Communicating, than from any other business; so that if there is nothing else to discourage us, we may safely come to the Lords Table, and expect to be kindly entertain'd by him when we do.</p>

                        <p>A <hi>Seventh</hi> Hindrance, is because others are not in Charity with them, so that they are afraid they want that Peace which is required to it. As for other mens uncharitableness, it is their sin, and so unfits them; but not being ours, it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits not us for Receiving. If that ought to exclude any from the Sacrament, it had excluded Christ and his Apostles, and the Primitive Christians, since none had ever such implacable Enemies as they had. Care to be taken that their Enmity be not continued through our Fault; so that if we have given just occasion, we must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Reconciliation; and if we gave none, be careful not to hate them again. An <hi>Eighth</hi> Hindrance is, because 'tis a Presumption in us to come to it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Humble man ought in all modesty to abstain from it. But, <hi>1.</hi> 'Tis no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption to come when we are call'd, and to do what we are bidden. <hi>2.</hi> 'Tis a very
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:52843:199"/>
great Presumption to stay away, and leave it undone. <hi>3.</hi> If the height of Priviledge and Honour in it be sufficient to make an humble man refuse the Communion; it will also carry him to renounce the whole Christian Profession. A <hi>Ninth</hi> Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance is, because many good People are seldom or never seen at it, so that they have good Company, and may be good too, if they abstain from it. But, <hi>1.</hi> In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after our own Duty, we are not to ask whether others practise it, but whether Christ has any where enjoyn'd it. <hi>2.</hi> If any Good People keep from the Sacrament, that is no part of their Goodness, so that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are not to be imitated. <hi>3.</hi> Though they might be acceptably Good, whilst through innocent Scruples and honest Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they were afraid to come to it: yet will it be a very great Fault even in them to Neglect it after they are better informed, which will not be forgiven, but upon their Amendment of it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A <hi>Seventh</hi> Hindrance, which keeps back several Persons from the Holy Sacrament, is, because, <hi>although they be with others,</hi> yet <hi>others are not in Charity with them</hi>; and therefore <hi>they are afraid they want that Peace which is required to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:52843:200"/>Now if this ought to hinder them from the <hi>Communion,</hi> it ought equally to be their hindrance from <hi>Prayers,</hi> and all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>; since there is the same necessity, as I have noted, of <hi>Peace</hi> and <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 5.23.24.</note> 
                        <hi>Reconcilation</hi> with our Brethren, in <hi>all</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>But if this be really their Case, it need not hinder them. For if <hi>other</hi> men will hate us, do what we can, that is our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness</hi> indeed, whilst we suffer under it; but it is not our <hi>Fault,</hi> nor renders us ever the worse in the Eyes of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, since we have done nothing to <hi>deserve,</hi> nor is it in our Power to <hi>help</hi> it. God commands us to <hi>Love our Enemies,</hi> so that if we hate them we sin, and are justly kept back by our <hi>own uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>: but he no where Commands us to <hi>make our Enemies Love us,</hi> so that if after all they will still bear Enmity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, that is only <hi>their own</hi> Sin, and therefore whatever it do with <hi>them,</hi> ought not in any Reason to be <hi>our</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance.</p>
                     <p>And indeed if it ought, it would much more have hindred our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> from Communicating, than now it can any <hi>other</hi> Persons; because none of those, who stick at this Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have any Enemies so bitter and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:52843:200"/>
as <hi>they</hi> found <hi>theirs.</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> hated <hi>him</hi> so far as to seek his <hi>Life,</hi> and at last in most barbarous sort obtain'd their Purpose. And he tells his <hi>Disciples,</hi> that the time was coming, when <hi>everyone that kill'd them would think</hi> that therein he approved himself a Friend of Religion, and <hi>did God good Service,</hi> Joh. 16.2. And this they all found by sad Experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>the very filth of the World, and the off-scouring of all things, i. e.</hi> Nuisances as necessary to be swept away, as Dirt out of the Streets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13; and accordingly being Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted in every place, till they had laid down their Lives for Christs sake and the Gospels. Thus were they reputed as <hi>Publick Enemies</hi> of all Countries, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all men as the vilest Miscreants, that breath'd Infection wheresoever they came, and were the common Pest of all Places. And therefore if this be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Hindrance from the Communion, that <hi>others hate us,</hi> it should always have hindred, and utterly Excommunicated our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and all the <hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>first Times,</hi> who, being always implacably hated, and most spitefully Persecuted, upon this account ought always to have abstain'd, and not to have receiv'd at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="366" facs="tcp:52843:201"/>As for <hi>others</hi> being <hi>out of Charity with us</hi> therefore, that ought not to be <hi>our</hi> hindrance. But then we must take care that <hi>we be in Charity with them,</hi> and that their Hatred to us be not continued through any <hi>Offence</hi> or <hi>Fault</hi> of ours, else shall we be kept back through our <hi>own Vncharitableness.</hi> So that if we gave <hi>just</hi> Cause for their Wrathful Indignation, by <hi>confessing our Fault,</hi> and <hi>repairing the Wrong,</hi> we must indeavour a <hi>Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>: or if we gave <hi>none,</hi> we must still be careful to <hi>love them,</hi> though they will not be perswaded to <hi>love us,</hi> and not harbour any <hi>Enmity</hi> or <hi>Hatred</hi> towards them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If we have given just Cause,</hi> I say, <hi>for their wrathful Indignation,</hi> through any <hi>Injuries,</hi> or <hi>Offences</hi> we have offered them; by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing our Fault,</hi> and <hi>repairing the wrong, we must indeavour a Reconciliation.</hi> When we have done any thing whereat they are displeased, if they have <hi>no</hi> Reason for it, we must seek to inform them better, and rectifie their mistakes about it: but if they <hi>have,</hi> we must give them all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per satisfaction, and make a just amends for it. If we have given them <hi>just</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, by <hi>Affronts,</hi> or <hi>contumelious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi>; we must <hi>acknowledge our Fault,</hi> and <hi>promise</hi> to do so no more, and <hi>ask Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness</hi>:
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:52843:201"/>
and if we have <hi>injuriously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced</hi> them in their <hi>Estates, Good Names,</hi> or <hi>Business</hi>; we must, as far as in us lies, <hi>repair the loss</hi> which they have sustain'd by us. And this God expects from us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will accept our <hi>Offerings,</hi> or be pleas'd with us in <hi>any</hi> Ordinance. <hi>When thou bringest thy Gift to the Altar,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>and there remembrest that thy Brother hath ought against thee, go thy way, first be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift.</hi> Mat. 5.23, 24.</p>
                     <p>But if <hi>they hate us</hi> when <hi>we gave no Cause for it,</hi> nor have in any wise <hi>deserv'd</hi> it of them; yet must we still <hi>be careful to Love them, though they will not be perswaded to Love us,</hi> and not <hi>harbour any Enmity, or Hatred towards them again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We must Love them,</hi> I say; not with that <hi>Degree</hi> of Love, indeed, wherewith we embrace our <hi>particular Friends,</hi> and those who have <hi>better deserved of us</hi>; but with that which we owe in <hi>common to all Persons.</hi> We must have so much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, as will restrain us both from <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>speaking Evil</hi> of them, and make us exercise all that <hi>Justice,</hi> and shew that <hi>kindness</hi> towards them in all Conversation, which is due to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous multitude of other men. For all these Instances of <hi>general Charity,</hi> are
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52843:202"/>
due to our very <hi>Enemies,</hi> as I have already sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wn: so that when they are unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their Hatred, and persist in their malicious ways; yet must not that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us into any spiteful Returns, or chase us into any hard Speeches, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious or unkind Carriage towards them again.</p>
                     <p>And thus it appears what is to be thought of this Hindrance, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placableness of some ill Neighbours, and their unconquerable Enmity against us.</hi> For when 'tis our hard hap to fall among such Persons, we must still <hi>Love them,</hi> and be at <hi>Peace with them</hi> in our own minds, though we <hi>never gave</hi> them any <hi>just Cause</hi> to be angred; and if <hi>we did,</hi> by <hi>confessing of our Fault,</hi> and <hi>repairing of the Wrong</hi> which makes the Breach, we must indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after a <hi>Reconcilement.</hi> But if after all, they are <hi>obstinate,</hi> and <hi>unmoveable in their hatred</hi>; that is <hi>their own Fault,</hi> which may justly hinder <hi>them,</hi> but ought not to detain us from the Holy Sacrament. For although God requires a worthy Receiver to <hi>Love his Enemies,</hi> yet he no where requires him to <hi>make his Enemies Love him</hi>; and if <hi>no</hi> Person could Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate worthily, whilst he has an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciled Enemy,</hi> our Blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52843:202"/>
                        <hi>his Apostles,</hi> and all the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> had been most unworthy, and could never have received at all.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Eighth</hi> hindrance, which holds back several Persons from coming to this Feast, notwithstanding it is so much both their <hi>Duty</hi> and their <hi>Priviledge,</hi> as I have shewn, to join in it; is because <hi>it lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ks like an high Presumption in us to Feast on the Body</hi> and <hi>Blood of our Sovereign Lord,</hi> and to eat <hi>at the same Table with Almighty God</hi>; and therefore an <hi>humble man ought in all modesty to abstain from it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have already considered that <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness</hi> which respects the <hi>manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,</hi> and answered those who urge that they are <hi>unworthy to Communicate,</hi> meaning thereby that they want that <hi>height of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> and <hi>Devout Tempers,</hi> which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God has required to it. But this unworthiness is not from the want of such <hi>due Dispositions,</hi> or from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency</hi> in the <hi>unsuitable Receiving</hi>; but from the <hi>inaccessible height</hi> and <hi>greatness of the thing,</hi> which they think is so far above us, that <hi>fit,</hi> or <hi>unfit, no</hi> Person is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it, but that 'tis boldness and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in any one to touch things so surpassing high and excellent. But to satisfie these Persons, who think it a piece of <hi>Arrogance</hi> and <hi>Presumption</hi> to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:52843:203"/>
come to this Holy Sacrament, when their Lord not only <hi>Requests,</hi> but <hi>Commands</hi> it, I shall suggest to them these <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It <hi>is no Presumption to come when we are call'd, and to do what we are bidden.</hi> But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It <hi>is a very great boldness and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to stay away, and leave it undone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If <hi>the height of Priviledge and Honour in it, be sufficient to make an humble modest man refuse the Communion; it will not rest in that alone, but carry him on equally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the whole Christian Profession.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. I say, It <hi>is no Presumption to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e to this Feast when we are call'd, and to do what we are bidden.</hi> If we should intrude of our <hi>own</hi> accord, and come uninvited, we might be too <hi>bold,</hi> indeed, and very <hi>rudely Arrogant.</hi> But when we are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly sent to, and call'd to come, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if there be, as in this Case there is, great earnestness and importunity in the Invitation; it is the part of an <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> man to comply with it, and he is not Guilty of the least shew of <hi>Arrogance</hi> and <hi>Ill-breeding</hi> in so doing. There is <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility</hi> shewn sometimes in <hi>accepting,</hi> as well as in <hi>offering</hi> kindnesses, and it is <hi>Good manners</hi> to <hi>receive what God would have us,</hi> yea, indeed, to accept any thing from the hands of our <hi>Betters.</hi> So that in all <hi>Civility</hi>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:52843:203"/>
and <hi>inoffensive Carriage</hi> we were bound to come, had we nothing more than a <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Invitation.</hi> But besides that, God has expresly injoyn'd, as I have observ'd, and peremptorily required it of us: So that now we must approach to it, not only out of <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Respect,</hi> but also out of <hi>Obedience</hi> to his Commandment. And <hi>true Humility</hi> is no hindrance, but the greatest furtherance in the World to such a Service, it being not the part of a <hi>Presumptuous,</hi> but of a <hi>truly humble</hi> man to do what he is bidden, and to please those whom he is bound in Duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.</p>
                     <p>It is no Presumption then to come to the Sacrament when we are call'd, and to do what we are bidden: but,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It <hi>is a very great Boldness and Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to stay away, and leave it undone.</hi> He is no <hi>proud</hi> man who <hi>accepts</hi> a kindness when 'tis <hi>offer'd,</hi> and he is <hi>earnestly invited</hi> to it: but he may shew <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haughtiness</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, who <hi>slights</hi> and <hi>despises</hi> it. And he is no <hi>bold</hi> man, that <hi>doth</hi> what he is <hi>Commanded</hi>; but he shews <hi>Boldness</hi> and <hi>presumes</hi> indeed, that dare venture to <hi>Transgress</hi> it. There are no men so bold and Presumptions with God, as they who will act what he forbids, and refuse to do what he injoyns them: So that it is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:52843:204"/>
an high Presumption to stay away, when he has expresly charged us, both upon our <hi>Duty</hi> and our <hi>Love</hi> for him, to joyn in the Communion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If <hi>the height of Priviledge and Honour in it, be sufficient to make an humble modest man refuse the Communion</hi>; since his <hi>whole Religion</hi> is made up of <hi>high Characters</hi> and <hi>honourable Priviledges, it will not rest in that alone, but carry him on equally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the whole Christian Profession.</hi> What thinks he of <hi>Holy Baptism,</hi> wherein he was made not only a <hi>Servant,</hi> but a <hi>Child of God</hi>; not only a <hi>Friend,</hi> but a <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Joint-heir with Christ</hi>; and an <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> not of a <hi>small Estate,</hi> but of a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and that no <hi>cheap</hi> or <hi>fading</hi> one nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi>? What thinks he of the <hi>happiness of another Life,</hi> wherein God will fill us with <hi>unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Joys,</hi> and adorn us with <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Scepters,</hi> and take us, as our Saviour <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 3.21.</note> says, into the <hi>same Throne with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</hi> What thinks he of his <hi>Redemption</hi> being purchased at so dear a rate, which could not be obtain'd, unless <hi>Jesus Christ, Gods only Son,</hi> would <hi>come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and be <hi>made man,</hi> and pay down his <hi>own Life</hi> for it? Are not <hi>all these</hi> as super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively high things, and as much above
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:52843:204"/>
us, as <hi>Feasting with God in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is? Is it not as great a <hi>Presumption</hi> in us to become <hi>Gods Sons,</hi> and to <hi>inherit Kingdoms,</hi> and to hope for <hi>Crowns,</hi> and <hi>Thrones,</hi> and <hi>Scepters</hi>; as it is to <hi>sit down with him as his Guests,</hi> and to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink in his own Presence?</hi> Is it not as high <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance</hi> to <hi>admit</hi> that <hi>Christ should dye for us,</hi> as it is to come and <hi>remember his Death,</hi> and to <hi>accept those Benefits</hi> which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>convey'd</hi> to us? All these things are infinitely above us, and we could not have had the Face to have asked any of them, if God had referr'd it to our own choice, and bid us name what we would for our own selves. But yet, since in his unbounded Love and Kindness he has <hi>freely offered</hi> them, we must have the good manners in all <hi>forward Thankfulness</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> to <hi>accept,</hi> and not out of a sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When God calls us then to Feast with him in the Holy Sacrament, and to feed upon the Body and Blood of our dear Lord; we must not hold back because there is so eminent a Priviledge, and high an Honour in it. For we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no greater Favour or higher Honour <hi>therein,</hi> than in being made <hi>Gods Children,</hi> as we were in <hi>Holy Baptism</hi>; than in <hi>Christs Incarnation, Death</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>;

                     </p>
                     <p>As for those then who are hindred from the Sacrament, by the fear of being too <hi>Bold</hi> and <hi>Presumptuous</hi> with God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>Feast,</hi> which has such <hi>height of Priviledge</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> in it: they are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred without any just Ground, and kept back by what they ought not. For it is no <hi>Presumption,</hi> but the part of <hi>humble</hi> men, to <hi>come when they are call'd,</hi> and to <hi>do what they are bidden</hi>; but it is a very <hi>great Boldness and Presumption to stay away,</hi> and <hi>leave it undone</hi>; and if the <hi>height of Priviledge</hi> and <hi>Honour in it,</hi> be <hi>sufficient to keep back humble Souls from this Feast,</hi> it must also keep them back from <hi>Baptism,</hi> wherein the same Honours are conferr'd which are in it, and carry them in the <hi>same guise of Modesty</hi> to refuse <hi>Christs dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them,</hi> and all the <hi>hopes of Heaven,</hi> and, in a word, their <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>whole Religion</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Ninth</hi> Plea, whereby several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are wont to excuse their not coming to the Sacrament, is because <hi>many Good
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:52843:205"/>
People are seldom or never seen at it, and therefore they may be good too, and have good Company, if they keep away from it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, as for those who urg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> this in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, I would desire them to consider, that when they are inquiring after their <hi>own Duty</hi> in any matter, it is no right way to ask whether <hi>others Practise it,</hi> but whether their <hi>Lord</hi> has any where <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> it. For mens Practice is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fully answerable to their <hi>own</hi> Duty, and so is a very false Rule whereby to judge of <hi>ours.</hi> All Persons have their Faults, and though no Good man can continue in any <hi>willful</hi> ones, yet will even they be subject to several <hi>Ignorant slips,</hi> and <hi>unadvised miscarriages.</hi> But when at any time they either <hi>willfully</hi> break any Commandment, or <hi>ignorantly</hi> mistake it; that is no warranty for us to do so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. So that if we would truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand whether we are bound to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, our way is not to inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther others do it, but whether our Lord has any where injoyn'd it; for if he has, we are certainly obliged to it whether others observe it or no.</p>
                     <p>But in more Particular Answer to this Plea, I must tell them,</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> That <hi>if any good People keep away from the Sacrament, that is no part of their

goodness, but their blemish, so that therein they are not to be imitated.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. I say, <hi>If any Good People keep away from the Sacrament, that is no part of their Goodness but their Blemish, so that therein they are not to be imitated.</hi> For we have Gods <hi>express Command</hi> to come, and that we cannot slight without being disob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:52843:206"/>
                        <hi>Law</hi> peremptorily <hi>injoyns,</hi> and the things therein imply'd straitly oblige us to partake of the Sacrament when an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is offer'd; so that every man, who makes <hi>Conscience of his Duty,</hi> and regards Obedience to his Lord, must be careful to join in it. And it is the <hi>Greatest means</hi> of a good Life, and Obligation to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment that can be prescribed; so that every one who has a <hi>just care of his own Soul,</hi> and is earnestly desirous of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Improvements, will seek to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it. A Good mans <hi>Duty</hi> binds him, and the <hi>care of his own Soul</hi> ingages him to Communicate; so that there is neither <hi>Virtue</hi> nor <hi>Prudence</hi> shewn in staying away, nor is it any part of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Neglect it. And therefore if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Persons otherwise Good are seldom seen at the Blessed Sacrament, that is no part of their Goodness but their Fault, so that therein they are not to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Though they might be acceptably Good,</hi> whilst <hi>through innocent Scruples,</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest Ignorance, they were afraid to receive it; yet will it be a very great Fault even in them to Neglect it after they are better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, which will not be forgiven, but upon their Amendment of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Good Man cannot indulge himself
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:52843:207"/>
in <hi>any known Sin</hi>; for he ceases to be good and acceptable to God, if he persists in any of them, after he is plainly told of them, and his Duty is evidently set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all unrighteousness,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1.18. And <hi>he that breaks one</hi> Law, saith St. <hi>James, is guilty of all, i. e.</hi> of that Eternal Punishment which is denounced, not barely to some one, but to all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. So that when once this Great Duty of coming to the Sacrament is clearly laid out, and his Conscience is inlighten'd and possessed with a Sense of it; he can be no Good man who willfully holds off still, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frains to come to it. Whilst he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd with <hi>Doubts</hi> about it, indeed, and either through the <hi>loose</hi> Discourses of some, thought himself <hi>not obliged</hi>; or, through the <hi>unreasonable Rigour</hi> and <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of others, after all his Repentance and full purposes of Amendment, thought himself still <hi>unprepared</hi> to come to it: for the pitiableness of his <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will'd mistake,</hi> so long as they lasted, his Neglect of it may be excused and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at. But if after all his <hi>Doubts</hi> have been <hi>solv'd,</hi> and things have been set in a <hi>clearer Light,</hi> he continue still to slight it; then he is Guilty of a very <hi>great
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:52843:207"/>
Fault,</hi> which will not be <hi>forgiven</hi> till he <hi>Repents</hi> and <hi>Amends</hi> it. <hi>To him that knows to do Good, and doth it not,</hi> says St. <hi>James, to him 'tis Sin, Jam.</hi> 4.17. And when any willfull sin stands charg'd on our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it will not be struck off till we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake and turn away from it. For to all such Sinners, Gods Declaration is this, <hi>Except you Repent, you shall all perish,</hi> Luc. 13.3.</p>
                     <p>As for those then who urge this in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for their not coming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because <hi>several Good People are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or never seen at it:</hi> My Answer to them in <hi>sum</hi> is this. In <hi>judging what is our Duty,</hi> we must not take our measures from <hi>other mens Practice,</hi> but from our <hi>Blessed Lords Commandments</hi>; since, if they disobey any Precept, that is no excuse to us, nor gives us any warranty for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies sake to disobey likewise. And as for the Sacrament in particular, if any <hi>Good</hi> People <hi>keep away</hi> from it, that is <hi>no part of their Goodness</hi>; so that therein they are not to be imitated. Nay, if they <hi>continue</hi> in this <hi>Neglect,</hi> after their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> are <hi>rightly instructed</hi> and informed about it; they <hi>cease to be Good</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a <hi>Damning Fault,</hi> an <hi>Impenitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> in any <hi>one known sin</hi> putting any Person out of a <hi>gracious State.</hi> Whilst
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:52843:208"/>
they were held back purely by <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Scruples,</hi> and <hi>wart of Knowledge</hi> without their own Fault; their Omission was fit to be <hi>connived</hi> at, and they might continue acceptably Good notwithstanding it. But if still they persist in it, after they know more, and are better instructed; they are Guilty of a very criminal Neglect, which will not be passed over, but upon the same Terms as all other known sins are, <hi>i. e.</hi> their <hi>Repentance</hi> of it. If they stay away out of Ignorance and Mistake, all they can expect is to be pittied, but not to be commended for it; and if out of willfulness after their Conscience has been set right, they will be severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd unless they are reclaim'd from it: So that no man must ever hope to justify himself in refraining the Lords Table because he has good Company, and knows of several others, whom he takes to be very Holy Persons, that are wont to refrain it too.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. Of two more Hindrances.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <head>The Contents.</head>
                        <p>A <hi>Tenth</hi> Hindrance is, because others who are unworthy of it, are admitted to join in it. But, <hi>1.</hi> They ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in judging others unworthy, lest they be mistaken in it. <hi>2.</hi> When some, who, as they have great cause to think, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, do receive, yet ought not that to hinder them from joining in it. For if it be a sufficient Hindrance, it had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hindred our Saviour Christ, and the Primitive Christians. It ought not only to hinder us from the Communion, but also from being Members of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church and Profession; but 'tis plainly of no Force for either of them, since one man shall not bear anothers, but every man his own burden. <hi>3.</hi> If still any are really offended at the Communion of the Wicked, upon complaint made in the Congregation they are to be suspended from the Holy Table, and denied the Sacrament. An <hi>Eleventh</hi> Hindrance is the Gesture
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:52843:209"/>
of Kneeling, which is required to it. When any are absent upon this account, there is no excuse from it. Three things insisted on to prevent their being hindred by it. <hi>1.</hi> Kneeling is no unsuitable Posture in receiving, so that if we were lest at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, we might have enough to justifie our selves in making use of it. <hi>2.</hi> It is appointed by our Governours, whom God Commands us to obey in all lawful Things; so that every Good man ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it. But if it neither had Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to injoyn, nor Reason to recommend it, but another Posture might be better used: Yet, <hi>3.</hi> Since it may lawfully, though not so well, be used too, for the Sacraments sake, which is not otherwise to be had, we should at least comply with it. No Hindrance to this Complyance, because the Gesture of Kneeling is different from what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour used. For so is sitting too, and therefore they and we are equally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to answer it. The Posture he used was no part of the Institution, so that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution is not broken when the Posture is altered. Neither it, nor any other, has any Command of God for it; so that none is necessary, but all are still indifferent. When a Posture, different from that at the first Institution, was introduced in Sacraments, our Saviour himself, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:52843:209"/>
they too have submitted to it. Again, no hindrance to it from the fear of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bread, or its being a Popish Rite. A conclusion of this point.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A <hi>Tenth</hi> Cause which many Persons are wont to Assign for their absent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this Feast, is, because <hi>others, who are unworthy of it, are admited to joyn in it.</hi> Tho this be a very good thing, yet they fear they should give offence in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with all Partners, and how worthy soever they may be in themselves, would be defiled by the unworthiness of others; so that unless they can receive in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt Company, and only with the pure and true Believers, they think best to stay away, and not receive at all.</p>
                     <p>But that they may not be kept back by this hindrance, I shall observe to them these <hi>three things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That they ought not to be forward in judging any others unworthy, lest they be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>When some, who, as they have great cause to think, are unworthy, do receive, yet ought not that to hinder them from it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>If it happen that any are really Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd at the sight of such as are notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wicked, or have done any wrong to their Neighbours, either in word or deed; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:52843:210"/>
complaint made in the Congregation, they are to be suspended from the Holy Table, and denyed the Sacrament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. I say, <hi>they ought not to be forward in judging any others unworthy to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, lest they be mistaken in it.</hi> For every <hi>Penitent</hi> Man, who is fully <hi>Resolved</hi> to leave all his Sins, is really worthy to receive the Sacrament: and whether the Person they think unworthy be so resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or no, is very hard for them to judge, since no Man can see into anothers Heart, and only God and his own Soul are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to it. When he comes to the Lords Table, every Communicant professes to Repent, and promises to lead a New Life thenceforward: and when he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declares he is thus resolved, 'tis hard for another Person, who cannot see into his Soul, to say he is not, but is still impenitent. Tho all Good Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be free in judging of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet ought they to be very wary how they pass a Judgment on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness of others: They must not be forward to pronounce of it, because 'tis hard for them to know it; so that when they give Sentence against their Brethren in this point, 'tis venturously done, and they are liable to be deceived in it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>When some others, who, as they have
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:52843:210"/>
great cause to think, are unworthy, do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament; yet ought not that to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from joyning in it.</hi> Our Business should not be to move Questions and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the preparedness of others, but to be careful duly to prepare our selves; and when once we are sitly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for it, we ought to come whether they be so or no. Their unworthiness will have all its effect upon themselves, but will not hinder our acceptance, nor ought to put us by from doing both our Saviour, and our own Souls this Service.</p>
                     <p>To shew this, I shall observe these <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>If the company of ill and unworthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons be a sufficient hindrance, it would equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have hindred our Saviour Christ, and the Primitive Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It ought not only to hinder us from the Communion, but also from being Members of the Christian Church and Profession.</hi> But,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>One shall not bear anothers, but every Man his own Burden; so that if not we, but only they we unworthy, we are safe, and may freely come, and they alone are to be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Receiving.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>If the Company of ill and unworthy Persons be a sufficient hindrance, it is not so barely unto us, but would equally have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred our Saviour Christ, and the Primitive

The Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Communicants</hi> in those Days, was the same with the number of <hi>Christians</hi> or <hi>Baptized</hi> Persons; for all Men then met in the Communion, who were made Members of Christs Mystical Body the Church by <hi>Baptism,</hi> and were not cut off again by <hi>Excommunication</hi>: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly intimates, when he says of all those <hi>many,</hi> who make up <hi>the one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>

So that <hi>their</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, as well as <hi>ours,</hi> were mixt As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, which were made up of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and unworthy Receivers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if other Mens unworthiness ought to be our hindrance, it should also have hindred our Blessed Saviour Christ, and his Apostles, and the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who, if this be a good Reason for it, should all have forborn the Sacrament, because <hi>Judas,</hi> a lost man, and other unprepared, and unworthy Persons, met also with them at the same time to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in it.</p>

was, and such as their Religion requires they should be: and therefore if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to share in any <hi>holy thing</hi> whilst some unworthy Persons pretend to it, and will not joyn in any <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>State</hi> wherein ill men participate; we must not only shun the <hi>Communion,</hi> but cease also to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Church,</hi> or Profess the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion.</hi> Nay, I might add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, since <hi>all Communities</hi> have <hi>some</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Members, and in every Body of Men there are some Vicious as well as Godly Persons; if we decline all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fellowship which has ill Men to partake in it, we must not stop in avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Communion, and leaping out of the Christian Church and Profession, but, if we run on so far as this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will lead us, become Out-Laws to <hi>Families, Townships, Kingdoms,</hi> yea to all Mankind.</p>

So that if we take care to come worthily our selves, we shall be kindly treated and accepted by him, and not any ways prejudiced or frown'd upon, for the unworthiness and undue Preparation of other men.</p>
                     <p>Thus ought not the sight of some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Persons joyning in it, to strike any Terror into us, or drive us from the Holy Sacrament. There is a great <hi>Sin,</hi> and a great <hi>Danger</hi> in unworthy Receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is enough to discourage all impenitent unworthy men from <hi>offering</hi> at it; and where the <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> are held in any esteem, and are likely to gain their end through the Awe and Reverence men have for them, the <hi>Governours of the Church,</hi> both out of Compassion for their Souls, and concern for the honour of this Ordinance, may see cause to <hi>remove</hi> them from it. But if neither the <hi>Danger of the thing,</hi> nor any <hi>Affectionate</hi> and <hi>fair Warning,</hi> nor the <hi>enfeebled Hand of Discipline,</hi> when it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impotent, and of small account, through the <hi>Number of Offenders,</hi> who are too strong for it, or through the <hi>multitude of Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> one party en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining what another excludes, which
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:52843:213"/>
cuts off all the Force of it: If notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all these, I say, unworthy men will still press in, and presume to Communicate; yet is their unworthiness only to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>: but as for <hi>others,</hi> who are truly worthy, they have no hurt at all by it; they shall not suffer for their Brethrens sins, nor are incapacitated by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitnesses; so that whilst they have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness in their own Souls, they may approach the Holy Table, and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive still.</p>
                     <p>But yet further.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>If any should be really scandalised at the Presence of those who are notoriously wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or who have done any wrong to their Neighbours, either in word, or deed; upon Complaint made in the Congregation, they are to be suspended from the Holy Table, and denied the Sacrament.</hi> For this Care our Church has taken in this Case, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all those, whose wickedness gives publick Scandal and Offence, from sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in these Holy Mysteries. <hi>If any</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, says the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the <hi>Communion-Service, be an open and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evil liver, or have done any wrong to his Neighbour by Word or Deed, so that the Congregation be thereby offended; the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate having knowledge thereof, shall call him, and advertise him, that in any wise he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume

not to come to the Lords Table, until he hath openly declared himself to have truly Repented and Amended his former naughty Life, that the Congregation may thereby be satisfied, which before were offended; and that he hath recompenced the Parties to whom he hath done wrong, or at least declare himself to be in full purpose so to do as soon as conveniently he may.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for those then who are kept back from this Feast, because they see <hi>some unworthy Persons are admitted to it,</hi> my Answer to them in brief is this: That they ought not to be forward in <hi>judging any others unworthy,</hi> because 'tis hard for them to <hi>know</hi> it, and they are liable to be <hi>mistaken</hi> in it. And that when they have <hi>great</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> cause to conclude <hi>others unworthy,</hi> yet ought not that in any wise to <hi>hinder</hi> them, who are <hi>truly worthy,</hi> from coming to it. For if the Company of unworthy Receivers were a just Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, it would have hindred our <hi>Blessed Lord</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> since it lay in <hi>their</hi> way as well as now it doth in <hi>ours</hi>; it would not rest in with-holding us from the <hi>Communion,</hi> but serve equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put us by from being <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or professing the <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; but it is plainly of no force for either of them, since <hi>one</hi> man shall not
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:52843:214"/>
bear <hi>anothers,</hi> but <hi>every one</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But if still any are really scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lised by the Company of such as are notoriously wicked, that offen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e may be removed when they have a mind to it; for upon <hi>complaint</hi> made, those unworthy Persons are to be <hi>suspended</hi> from the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Table,</hi> and denied the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Eleventh</hi> Hindrance, whereby se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral persons are kept back from joyning in this Feast, is the <hi>Gesture which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it.</hi> For though right-gladly they <hi>would be admitted to the Sacrament,</hi> yet they <hi>dare not Kneel, as the Church appoints all men to do, when they receive it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now when any Persons refuse the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament upon this account, they have no sufficient Plea, or just Excuse from it. When our Lord shall ask them at the last Day, <hi>why they did not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate according to his appointment</hi>? It will be but a bad Answer in them to say, it was because <hi>they could not sit,</hi> or use some <hi>other Posture which they thought convenient</hi>: For since he has only required the <hi>Thing,</hi> but has no where injoyn'd the <hi>Gesture</hi> we are to receive in; he will have just Reason to reply to such Men, That then it seems they would not do what <hi>he bid</hi> them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less at the same time they could do that also which he had <hi>not bidden,</hi> nor perform
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:52843:214"/>
                        <hi>his</hi> will, unless withall they should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have their <hi>own</hi>; which justly merits a severe Reproof, but is far from being a matter of Commendation.</p>
                     <p>But that they may not inexcusably Neglect so great a Commandment, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so weak a Reason for it, I would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to their Consideration these three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Kneeling is no unsuitable Posture in receiving the Holy Sacrament; so that if we were left at Liberty, we might have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to justifie our selves in making use of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It is appointed by our Governours, whom God Commands us to obey in all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things; so that every Good man, who is under Authority, ought to observe it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if it were not our Duty when Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority has thus required the use of it, and it had no Reasons from it self to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it, but it were much better that some other Posture should be used: yet,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Since it lawfully may be used too, tho' not so well as another, if men have any due value for, and desire of the Sacrament, for its sake, and rather than miss of it, they should at least comply with it.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Kneeling is no unsuitable Posture in receiving the Holy Sacrament, so that if
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:52843:215"/>
we were left at Liberty, we might have enough to justifie our selves in making use of it.</hi> For the Sacrament, as I have already shew'd, is a <hi>Religious Feast,</hi> wherein we are set in the <hi>Presence of,</hi> and are <hi>concerned with Almighty God</hi>: and when we have to do with him, 'tis no ways unfit sure to use such Posture as is <hi>Humble</hi> and <hi>Reverent.</hi> It is a Feast wherein we <hi>receive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Benefits,</hi> no less than our Saviour <hi>Christs</hi> Blessed <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood, i. e.</hi> those Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which his Bloody Death procured: and when we <hi>receive Gifts,</hi> especially of that <hi>infinite Price,</hi> and from our <hi>Betters</hi> and <hi>Supream Governours,</hi> it cannot mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become us to use such Carriage as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses most <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness.</hi> It is a Feast whereat we <hi>confirm the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and solemnly <hi>give Thanks</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> to Christ, and pour out many <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> to our Heavenly Lord: and when we are <hi>exercising Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and <hi>uttering Praise,</hi> and <hi>making so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayers</hi> and <hi>Oblations,</hi> it is not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improper to use such Gestures as best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Devotions.</hi> In the Sacrament we have to <hi>do with Almighty God,</hi> and <hi>receive most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gifts,</hi> and <hi>act most humble Repentance</hi> in <hi>shamefully confessing</hi> and <hi>renouncing</hi> of <hi>our sins,</hi> and <hi>give most hearty Thanks,</hi> and <hi>put up most ardent Prayers</hi>: and therefore that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:52843:215"/>
must needs suit well with <hi>it,</hi> which becomes <hi>these</hi> Services; and that <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> will be allowed to do by all Persons, since it has been ordinarily well liked in all times, nay, preferr'd before others for the <hi>Posture of Devotions.</hi> As it is a <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and a <hi>Feast,</hi> some are apt to think <hi>sitting,</hi> which with us at least is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Table-Posture,</hi> to be most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. But as this is not a <hi>common,</hi> but a <hi>Religious</hi> Feast, wherein we have to do with God, and perform so many things whereto all <hi>inward Reverence</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> is required, there are Reasons enow that most justly Authorize <hi>Kneeling</hi> too; so that if we direct our Eyes to them, we shall soon see that it may very reasonably be used, and is in no wise unsuitable or improper for it. And therefore if we were left at <hi>Liberty</hi> to receive it as we <hi>pleas'd,</hi> we might have enough to <hi>justify our selves</hi> in making use of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Kneeling is appointed by our Governours, whom God commands us to obey in all lawful things; so that every good man who is under Authority, ought to observe it:</hi> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us <hi>to be subject to Principalities and Powers, and to obey Magistrates,</hi> Tit. 3.1. and <hi>to obey them that have the Rule over us, and to submit our selves; for they watch for our Souls, as they that must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
                        <pb n="396" facs="tcp:52843:216"/>
of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. Now to <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,</hi> is to <hi>do what we are bidden</hi>; so that when they command this Posture, we are bound in all Duty and Submission to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them. Before they injoyn'd it, we were at Liberty to use either <hi>it,</hi> or <hi>another,</hi> according to our own Discretion. But when once they have interposed their Authority, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all <hi>Lawful</hi> things, such as <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is, is our Duty; so that although we think another might be <hi>better</hi> used, and, were we left to our selves, would make use of it; yet when once they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd this, must we deny our selves, and submit to it.</p>
                     <p>But if Kneeling had neither any <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> effectually to injoyn, nor any <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> from it self sufficient to recommend it; but that <hi>sitting,</hi> or some <hi>other</hi> Posture were much fitter to be used: yet,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Since it may at least lawfully be used too, though not so well, if men have any due value for, or desire of the Sacrament; for its sake, and rather than miss of it, they should at least comply with it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When we are hindred from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by <hi>little</hi> things, and refuse to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unless we can have it ordered according to our own liking in all Points, 'tis a sign we do not think we greatly <hi>need</hi>
                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:52843:216"/>
it, nor are very <hi>desirous</hi> of it; for if we were, 'tis certain small matters would not put us by it. Were we fully sensible how much it is both our <hi>Duty,</hi> and our <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> to partake in it, and thereupon did earnestly covet and long after it, we should be glad to be admitted to it in any Posture, and, so we might joyn in the thing, submit to any Gesture to receive in. If a man refuse a <hi>Present of a thousand Pound,</hi> because it is brought to him in an homely Purse, that is course and much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd; or if he will throw back the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of a fair Estate,</hi> because 'tis seal'd with a <hi>common Stamp,</hi> that wants a <hi>Coat of Armes</hi> to it; all the World would say he would not be so <hi>curious,</hi> if he stood in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great <hi>need</hi> of it. And if any Person should turn away from the most <hi>savoury</hi> and <hi>choicest meat,</hi> because it is dish'd up on <hi>Pewter,</hi> not on <hi>Plate</hi>; the By-standers would all conclude he is full enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and has no great <hi>edge of Appetite.</hi> And the case is just the same, when any of us shew niceness about the <hi>Posture</hi> of the Holy Sacrament. For did we really think we were in very great <hi>need</hi> of it, and had such an <hi>ardent desire,</hi> as that we might be said to <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> after it; we should be glad to have it in any Posture, as we could be allow'd it. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:52843:217"/>
                        <hi>Kneeling</hi> were a Gesture whereto we were no ways obliged, nay, though it were justly to be disliked, not as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> indeed, but as <hi>inconvenient</hi>; yet when the Sacrament is not otherwise to be had, there is no man, who is duly desirous to receive, but will <hi>comply</hi> with it. He had <hi>rather,</hi> it may be, Communicate <hi>sitting,</hi> or <hi>standing,</hi> or after some other manner which he fancies better, were it left to his own liking; but yet, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires it in such measure as he ought, he will <hi>submit</hi> to receive Kneeling, rather than miss the opportunity, and not receive at all.</p>
                     <p>And this is the great thing, which I would urge upon all those who are kept back by this Hindrance; namely, that although for its <hi>own sake</hi> they would not <hi>chuse</hi> it, yet for the <hi>Sacraments sake,</hi> which is not otherwise to be had, they would at least <hi>comply</hi> with it. In my Judgment it is their <hi>Duty</hi> to Kneel, since their Governours require it; and the Posture is so <hi>suitable</hi> to the Feast, that were it not required, they might have enough to justifie themselves in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of it: and if, upon the Reasons I have here given, they are convinced of these things, that clears the Case without more ado, and is the best Solution of it.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:52843:217"/>
But if their prejudices stick still after all, and in those Points they happen not to be of my mind, but think themselves <hi>free</hi> from it, and that <hi>sitting</hi> is much <hi>better</hi> used: yet at least, since Kneeling may be used too, for the <hi>Sacraments sake,</hi> which, if they value as they ought, they would gladly accept, though in a Posture less convenient, let them <hi>condescend</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> to it. Though they had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive sitting when they may be allowed, yet they may receive kneeling when there is need of it; and they must needs think it better to kneel to it, than, by stopping at a thing so <hi>innocent,</hi> though <hi>less signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,</hi> to be quite put by, and go without it.</p>
                     <p>But against this Compliance they may, perhaps, <hi>object,</hi> and it is the fairest thing which I know said against it, That they cannot comply with this <hi>Injunction of Kneeling,</hi> because it is cross to our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Institution</hi>; for as he instituted the Holy Sacrament, so they think we ought to adhere to it.</p>
                     <p>But to clear this point, which I shall do as plainly as I can, because it seems to have some weight in it, I shall observe,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>if using a Posture different from what our Saviour did, be a breaking his Institution, sitting no less than kneeling
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:52843:218"/>
is a breach of it, so that they and we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually concerned to answer it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Posture he used was no part of the Institution, so that the Institution is not broken when the Posture is alter'd: yea, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, nor any other has any Command at all for it; so that no Posture is necessary, but all, both theirs and ours, are still indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>When a Posture different from that at the first Institution, was introduced in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, our Saviour himself, and they themselves too, have submitted to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. I say, <hi>If using a Posture different from what our Saviour did, be a breaking his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, sitting no less than kneeling is a breach of it; so that they and we are equally concerned to answer it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Posture which our Saviour used, was neither <hi>sitting</hi> nor <hi>kneeling,</hi> but <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> different from both of them. In the <hi>Passover</hi> 'tis plain he used <hi>lying</hi> or <hi>leaning down,</hi> which was the <hi>Banquetting Gesture</hi> of that time, when they used to eat at their Feasts <hi>lying</hi> upon <hi>Couches.</hi> And thus the <hi>Evangelist</hi> expresses it; <hi>When Even was come,</hi> says St. <hi>Matthew, he sate down,</hi> so according to the custom of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries we render it, but the word is, <hi>he</hi>

So that the Gesture our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our used was as different from sitting, as it is from kneeling; and therefore if the use of one different from his be a breach of his Institution, it is equally broken on all sides, and one cannot urge it against another, but both are alike in Fault, and equally obliged to answer it.</p>

whereas he <hi>lay along,</hi> they <hi>sit upright,</hi> and only stick to such a Gesture as agrees to the <hi>Nature of the Feast,</hi> and the Notion of the Communion being a <hi>Supper</hi> and a <hi>Banquet.</hi> So that their sitting is not Authorized by our Lords having used it at first, for that he never did, but by its being a Table-Gesture, which becomes a Feast, and is thereby suited to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament. And when once this Ground is admitted, it will make way for kneeling too, since there is much also in the Nature of the thing to render it very suitable and convenient. For, as upon the account of its being a <hi>Feast,</hi> whilst they direct their Eye to that, they may be embolden'd to <hi>sit</hi> down at it: so also upon account of its being a most <hi>Venerable</hi> and <hi>Religious Feast,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at all inward <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>profound Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> is required, they may see just Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to use another more lowly mode, and <hi>kneel</hi> when they receive it. But if still they should think sitting the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mode, and that, it being a Table-Gesture, a Supper is best suited by it: yet would this be no Reason why they cannot <hi>comply</hi> with kneeling, but only why, if they were left to their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they would not make <hi>choice</hi> of it. For though they would not chuse it, yet
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:52843:219"/>
are they at Liberty for all that to forbear sitting, and either to <hi>stand,</hi> or <hi>lye,</hi> or <hi>kneel</hi> at a Feast when <hi>need</hi> so requires it; so that whatever it may be to their own <hi>free choice</hi> of it, this can be no hindrance to their <hi>submission</hi> and <hi>compliance</hi> with it.</p>
                     <p>But since both in <hi>their</hi> way and <hi>ours,</hi> the Gesture of our Lord, being now out of date thro' the different usage of the World, is quite reilnquish'd; for a full Vindication of them as well as of our selves in this Point, I observe,</p>

                     <p>And to shew this more fully, it really <hi>has</hi> been done, and that too in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lord himself without any wrong to the Institution; and that was in the <hi>Jewish Passover.</hi> For the Posture wherein it was first Celebrated, was in

that of <hi>Travellers,</hi> with their <hi>Loins girt,</hi> and their <hi>Staves in their hand,</hi> and their <hi>Shoes on their Feet</hi>; yea, and what makes this Circumstance more considerable in their Case, it was by <hi>Gods own Order</hi> and <hi>Appointment.</hi> For <hi>thus shall you eat it,</hi> saith God, <hi>with your Loins girded, and your Shoes on your Feet, and your Staff in your Hand; and you shall eat it in haste, it is the Lords Passover,</hi> Exod. 12.11.

                     <p>Thus is the Posture which our Blessed Lord used in the Sacrament, no <hi>part</hi> of the Institution; so that the Institution is not broken, when it is alter'd.

it is another <hi>Table-Posture,</hi> than the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> into any <hi>other Food</hi> or <hi>Liquour,</hi> because they are a <hi>Table-Furniture</hi>; for the <hi>parts</hi> of the Sacrament must be kept the same as our Saviour left them, and we must not go about to alter and put in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers instead of them, lest we be thought to cancel his, and institute a <hi>New Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our own.</p>
                     <p>Yea, <hi>neither it, nor any other, has any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at all for it; so that no Posture is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but all, both theirs and ours, are still Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</hi> It is not at all injoyn'd by our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> for he only Commands the <hi>Thing,</hi> bidding them <hi>take Bread and eat it, and Wine and drink it,</hi> Mat. 26.26, 27; and to <hi>do this in Remembrance of him,</hi> Luc. 22.19; but says not a word prescribing the <hi>Gesture, Time,</hi> or <hi>other Circumstances</hi> which they are to use in so doing. Neither is it at all mentioned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who, as our Lord had done before, commands only after the mention of the <hi>Bread,</hi> that we should <hi>do that in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him</hi>; and after the mention of the <hi>Cup,</hi> that we should <hi>drink that in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him</hi>; but gives no Command at all concerning <hi>Posture,</hi> or any other such inconsiderable and outward thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. And yet he delivered all that to them, which he had received in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:52843:221"/>
from Christ relating to the Holy Communion: <hi>I have received of the Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>that which I also have delivered unto you,</hi> v. 23. So that altho' God has most strictly commanded the <hi>receiving of the Sacrament,</hi> yet has he no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>any Posture</hi> to be used in it; and therefore <hi>none</hi> of them is <hi>necessary,</hi> but <hi>all,</hi> both <hi>theirs</hi> and <hi>ours,</hi> are still indifferent.</p>
                     <p>Thus then is our <hi>Kneeling</hi> Posture at the Communion, as also others <hi>Standing,</hi> or <hi>Sitting</hi> where that is the Fashion, no <hi>unlawful</hi> thing, nor any <hi>Breach</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> tho' our Saviour used a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> one. The Posture he Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, was <hi>no part</hi> of the Appointment; so that there is no Breach of it when that is altered: and neither <hi>it,</hi> nor <hi>any other,</hi> has any <hi>Command</hi> for it; so that none of them are either <hi>necessary</hi> or <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> upon this account, but all may still be used, as <hi>Publick Authority</hi> or <hi>Private Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> shall determine it.</p>
                     <p>And as the Posture used at <hi>first,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Breach</hi> of the <hi>Institution,</hi> or of any <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> may be altered, and a New one lawfully brought in, in stead of it; so,</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly, <hi>When a Posture different from that at the first Institution was introduced in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, our Blessed Lord himself, and they themselves too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have submitted to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="408" facs="tcp:52843:222"/>As for our <hi>Blessed Lord,</hi> the matter is plain of him in the Case of the <hi>Passover</hi> already mentioned. He found the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture different from that which was at first used in <hi>Egypt</hi>; for then, as I have noted, they <hi>stood,</hi> like <hi>Travellers</hi>; but now they <hi>lay down,</hi> like Men at <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>ease.</hi> But since <hi>Common Vsage</hi> and <hi>Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> had altered the former Mode, and setled this later in stead of it, he would not go to dispute, but readily conformed himself to it. For when he <hi>came to eat the Passover,</hi> says St. <hi>Matthew, he sate,</hi> or rather <hi>lay down with the twelve,</hi> Mat. 26.20.</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>themselves,</hi> they do the same thing too, in Sitting where that is the Posture Law or Custom has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced among them. For <hi>Sitting</hi> is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture very different from what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our used, who did not <hi>sit,</hi> but <hi>lie down</hi> at the Sacrament. But when the <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi> had brought in this Mode amongst us, notwithstanding its being a Deviation from what was done at first, they did then comply with it, and would still adhere to it.</p>
                     <p>If they will be guided therefore either by their <hi>Saviour's Practice,</hi> or <hi>their own,</hi> in this Point, when <hi>Vse</hi> and <hi>Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> have setled any Posture of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they must submit to it. The
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:52843:222"/>
Gesture which they find among <hi>us,</hi> is not more different from what our <hi>Saviour</hi> used, than the Gesture <hi>he</hi> found in the <hi>Passover,</hi> was from what the <hi>Jews</hi> first used in <hi>Egypt</hi>: But yet he made no scruple of this Posture, so plainly novel and of a later date, but readily complied with it. In conformity to which <hi>Example,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> teaches us in <hi>lesser</hi> things to make Common Usages our Rule, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of all <hi>Disputes</hi> and <hi>Variance;— If any man seem to be contentious,</hi> in the case of <hi>Womens</hi> being <hi>unvail'd</hi> in the Publick Assemblies, <hi>we have no such custom, nor the Church of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.16. And the <hi>Sitting</hi> which they think well of, is as different from our <hi>Saviour's Posture,</hi> as <hi>Kneeling</hi> is; but yet they readily embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, when once the <hi>Assembly</hi> had dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it. So that if they are but free to follow our <hi>Saviour's Practice,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul's Rule</hi> in this Case; or if they will go as far with the <hi>Churches Order,</hi> as formerly they did with the <hi>Assemblies</hi>; since <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vsage</hi> and <hi>Publick Authority</hi> have set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Kneeling at the Sacrament among us, they ought not to stick out, but to submit to it.</p>
                     <p>And thus it appears that their <hi>Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> with our Use of <hi>Kneeling</hi> in the Communion, is not at all against our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:52843:223"/>
Institution</hi>; so that the fear of wronging that, ought not to hinder any of them from it. It is, indeed, a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> Posture from what our Lord first used; but if that be a Breach of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, <hi>Sitting</hi> no less than <hi>Kneeling</hi> is a Breach of it: so that <hi>they</hi> and <hi>we</hi> are <hi>equally</hi> concerned to answer it. But in behalf of <hi>both</hi> 'tis easily answered, That the <hi>Posture he used</hi> was <hi>no Part</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of the Sacrament; so that the Institution is not broken, when the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture is altered: That neither <hi>it,</hi> nor <hi>any other,</hi> has any <hi>Precept</hi> for it; so that none of them is <hi>necessary,</hi> but all <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> to be used, according as Mens own <hi>private Judgment</hi> and <hi>Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> where they are left to it, shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, or <hi>Publick Authority</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi> shall any where prescribe it: and that when <hi>these</hi> have in any Place introduced a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture <hi>different</hi> from what <hi>he</hi> used, <hi>he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> by his own Practice in this very Case, and <hi>they</hi> too who make this Objection, by <hi>theirs,</hi> have taught us to comply with it.</p>
                     <p>But against this Compliance it is by some still further urged, That <hi>Kneeling</hi> in the Sacrament is <hi>Worshipping the Bread,</hi> and a <hi>Popish Rite,</hi> and therefore they dare not <hi>yield</hi> and <hi>conform</hi> to it.</p>
                     <p>Now in Answer to its being a <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:52843:223"/>
the Bread</hi>; I would observe to them, that there is <hi>no fear</hi> of that, because <hi>we do not kneel to the Bread,</hi> nor <hi>have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to worship it:</hi> and if really we <hi>did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> it, <hi>without which there is no Adoration paid to it, we should worship it whether we kneel or sit</hi>; so that <hi>their mode</hi> and <hi>ours</hi> are <hi>equally concern'd,</hi> and it must be own'd on all sides, that not the <hi>Posture</hi> but the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> is to be blamed for it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In <hi>kneeling at the Sacrament,</hi> I say, <hi>there is no fear of worshipping the Bread,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>we do not kneel to it, nor have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to worship it.</hi> If we should <hi>kneel down to the Bread,</hi> indeed, and, submitting our selves before it, pay <hi>Divine Honour</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> to it; this were really to <hi>worship</hi> it. And this the <hi>Papists</hi> plainly do in that <hi>Reverence</hi> which they shew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. For they verily believe it to be <hi>Transubstantiated, i. e.</hi> that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Bread after the words of Consecration is passed into the Natural Body and Blood of Christ: and upon this Belief they fall down to it with a design to Reverence it, and to give as much Adoration to it, as they would to Christ himself were he visibly present.

                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, <hi>—the Nations,</hi> says he, <hi>worship their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges sitting</hi>: And thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>Jews</hi> sometimes worshipped in their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Feasts,</hi> when they fed upon their <hi>Sacrifices</hi>: for so it was plainly in the worship of the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calf,</hi> where, after they had offer'd their <hi>Burnt-offerings</hi> and their <hi>Peace-Offerings, they sate down to eat and to drink upon what they had offer'd,</hi> Exod. 32.6. So that if any of those that <hi>kneel</hi> are Guilty of worshipping the Bread, their <hi>kneeling</hi> must not be accused for it, since, when giving worship is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:52843:225"/>
they would be Guilty of the same thing if they <hi>sate</hi>; and therefore it is not the Posture, which were very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable were it directed unto <hi>God,</hi> but the mis-applying it to the <hi>Bread,</hi> and using it with that <hi>irreligious intent,</hi> which is to bear the blame of it.</p>
                     <p>As for those then who are afraid to <hi>kneel at the Sacrament,</hi> for fear lest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with the <hi>Papists</hi> they should <hi>worship the Bread</hi>; my Answer in brief is this. To <hi>worship the bread</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> do, is to <hi>kneel down to it,</hi> and to pay Divine <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> to it, because they <hi>believe Christ bodily present</hi> in it; and <hi>this may be done in any Posture,</hi> either <hi>sitting</hi> or <hi>kneeling,</hi> when any Persons so <hi>intend</hi> it; and <hi>without such intent, 'tis not done by kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the Holy Sacrament; and <hi>they are best able to tell themselves</hi> whether in Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving they <hi>intend</hi> any such thing or no, and, if <hi>they say they do not,</hi> 'tis <hi>great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance</hi> as well as <hi>Vncharitableness</hi> in <hi>others to charge them with it</hi>; and if <hi>they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such design,</hi> they must not say it is to <hi>comply with our Church,</hi> because it <hi>expresly declares against it,</hi> and <hi>warns them of the danger of it:</hi> If they <hi>worship the Bread,</hi> their <hi>kneeling</hi> is <hi>no cause</hi> of it; and they may <hi>use that Posture</hi> only to <hi>confess their Sins,</hi> and <hi>give Thanks,</hi> and <hi>make Prayers,</hi>
                        <pb n="416" facs="tcp:52843:226"/>
by all which they <hi>worship God,</hi> if they are so minded; and if still they <hi>will worship the Bread by it,</hi> they <hi>go off from the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church, which would de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And then as for this Kneeling in the Sacrament being a <hi>Popish Rite,</hi> if they mean that <hi>the Papists use it,</hi> they may call their <hi>own Sitting</hi> a <hi>Popish Rite</hi> too, upon the same ground, because that also is sometimes used by them in receiving.

For the <hi>Papists</hi> have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>harmless</hi> things, and many <hi>very good,</hi> as well as many <hi>bad</hi> among them. They have the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the less the <hi>Word of God</hi> because they <hi>read</hi> them; and the <hi>Creed,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> which none of us will cast aside because they <hi>use</hi> them; and <hi>kneel at their Prayers,</hi> which yet we ought not to disclaim for fear of <hi>symbolizing</hi> with them: So that both <hi>Sitting</hi> and <hi>Kneeling</hi>
                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:52843:227"/>
may be <hi>good</hi> things among <hi>us,</hi> tho' both are used by <hi>them</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>But if by a <hi>Popish Rite,</hi> they mean that it is one of the <hi>Corruptions of Popery,</hi> whereby they have depraved <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; that is a great Mistake, which has no colour of Reason or Ground at all for it. For Kneeling is not onely a very <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> but a very <hi>decent</hi> Posture wherein to <hi>receive Gifts,</hi> and <hi>make humble Confession of our Sins,</hi> and <hi>put up Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Almighty God</hi>; all which we are to do in the <hi>Holy Sacrament.</hi> It is probably a much more <hi>Ancient Rite,</hi> and either <hi>it,</hi> or some <hi>other Posture of Reverence</hi> and <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> which is of the same account with it, was used in the <hi>Communion</hi> long before <hi>Popery, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Popish Errours</hi> and <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which are a novel and upstart Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, had any Footing.</p>
                     <p>As for this <hi>Objection</hi> then against <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying</hi> with the Injunction of <hi>Kneeling</hi> in the Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> its being a <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Bread,</hi> and a <hi>Popish Rite</hi>; there is really no weight in it. For they cannot <hi>worship the Bread</hi> in <hi>complying</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> since it <hi>forbids</hi> it; nor do any thing that is <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>culpably Popish,</hi> tho' the <hi>Papists</hi> use it, as indeed they do Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too, which yet is never the worse for it, because it is no <hi>Corruption of Popery,</hi>
                        <pb n="419" facs="tcp:52843:227"/>
but either <hi>it,</hi> or some <hi>other</hi> Posture of <hi>Adoration</hi> which is of equal Danger with it, was in use in <hi>Christianity</hi> before the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Errours</hi> were introduced. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they cannot see Reason enough to desire it, nor would receive Kneeling were another Posture allowed; yet since the Sacrament is not otherwise to be had, they may very safely and wisely comply with, and submit to it still.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have considered this <hi>Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whereby many good Minds, who are sensible of the Duty of it, and are otherwise very well prepared for it, are yet unhappily kept back from the <hi>Holy Sacrament.</hi> And the Result of all is this, That when they stay away upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, because <hi>they will not kneel in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it,</hi> they refrain upon a most unjustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ground, which will afford them no <hi>Excuse,</hi> nor ought in any reason to be their <hi>Hindrance.</hi> For <hi>Kneeling</hi> is really no <hi>unsuitable,</hi> but a very <hi>decent Posture</hi>; so that if we were left at <hi>liberty</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how we would, we might have enough to <hi>justifie our selves</hi> in making <hi>use</hi> of it. And it is <hi>appointed us by our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> whom God commands us to obey in all <hi>lawful</hi> things; so that in regard to <hi>their</hi> having <hi>prescribed</hi> it, every <hi>good Man</hi> among us <hi>ought to observe it.</hi> And if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:52843:228"/>
                        <hi>Authority</hi> could impose, nor it had any <hi>Reason</hi> from it self to recommend it, but that <hi>Sitting</hi> were on all accounts much <hi>fitter</hi> to be used; yet since in their own ccount <hi>it</hi> may <hi>lawfully</hi> be used too, and is onely a <hi>less decent</hi> Mode, but has no Sin or Offence in it, if they have any earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire for the Sacrament, which is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be had, for <hi>its sake</hi> they will at least <hi>comply</hi> with it. If they rate things truly, since <hi>Authority</hi> has <hi>injoyned</hi> it, they will see themselves <hi>obliged</hi> to use it; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, since their Saviour has laid no weight upon it, but accepts a Devout Mind in any Posture, tho' they had rather use another, yet is there nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Compliance and Submission to it: So that there is no just pretence for any, upon this account, to refrain coming to the Sacrament.</p>

                        <p>An Account of some other Hindrances. One abstains because the day before he was at a Feast. Another, because his Child is sick, or he himself is lighty indisposed. A third, because his Wife or Husband cannot come along with him to joyn in it. A fourth, because he has a Visit to make, or a Friend come in, who in all civility must be attended. A fifth, because of a Showr of Rain, or a sharp Air abroad, so that he must endure a piercing Blast, or wet his Foot, to go out to it. These are no Excuse from it, but still Men are bound to Communicate. Some Devout Meditations and Prayers to help them in a Worthy Discharge of it. After they have received, they must be careful to make good those holy Vows and Promises which they made to God in the Holy Sacrament.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving hitherto consider'd those <hi>Pleas</hi> which seem to be of most weight in hindring Men from the Sacrament,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:52843:229"/>
and possess them either with a <hi>Scruple</hi> that they dare not, or with an <hi>important Reason</hi> why they should not chuse to come to it; before I dismiss this Head, I shall take notice of some <hi>others,</hi> which, tho' of less moment, may yet seem fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
                     <p>Men oft-times give such Reasons for their Neglect of the Sacrament, as are Reasons to themselves for neglecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else that is of half that moment. <hi>The Vnseasonableness of the Weather,</hi> the <hi>Sickness of a Child,</hi> the <hi>paying a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to a Friend,</hi> or the like, is thought a sufficient Hindrance from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: Whereas it would not hinder them from any Business which either <hi>Friendship,</hi> their <hi>own Pleasure,</hi> or their <hi>Profit</hi> requires of them. For how cogent soever they may account them in keeping them back from <hi>it,</hi> they would not be with-h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ld by them from pursuing any <hi>Sport,</hi> or from driving an <hi>advantageous Bargain,</hi> or carrying on any <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Interest,</hi> or <hi>serving their Friend</hi> in any <hi>Business</hi> or <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of moment.</hi> And can any Man now have the Face to give that for a Reason to Almighty God, which he would be ashamed to offer as a Reason to any one else? Can he expect to excuse the <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of a weighty Duty</hi> unto <hi>him,</hi> by such
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:52843:229"/>
trifling Apologies as would not excuse the <hi>Neglect of a Bargain,</hi> nay of a <hi>Pastime</hi> to <hi>himself</hi>; nor of a <hi>Concern of weight,</hi> or, perhaps, of a <hi>Complement</hi> to his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions?</hi> Those Men are surely in a sad Case, who are forced to seek shelter under such thin Pretences; and rather than make such trifling Pleas for any Act of Disobedience, it were by much their wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser course to be wholly silent, and not seek to defend themselves at all.</p>
                     <p>When these Pleas are made then, there is no Excuse in them. And indeed they would not be made by any Men, if once they were convinced how much it is both their <hi>Duty</hi> and their <hi>Interest</hi> to come to the Communion. For when they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by such frivolous Reasons as would not either be urged or admitted in excuse for any other Business; they shew onely their great Indifference to it, and how they esteem it less than any other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and this they could not do, if they held it either as a valuable Privilege, or as a Point of Conscience. The best way therefore to remove these Hindrances from the Sacrament, is to possess Men with a Belief that God has peremptorily injoyn'd it, and that 'tis infinitely their own Interest and high Privilege to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it. And having shew'd these
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:52843:230"/>
very largely in the <hi>Second</hi> Part, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Reader</hi> unto that, as a very likely way, not onely to answer <hi>these,</hi> but also to prevent all <hi>other</hi> such like Pleas against it.</p>
                     <p>But that such Persons as are serious in these Hindrances, may not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves slighted, besides this <hi>general</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, I shall say something to the <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>One</hi> keeps away from the Sacrament because <hi>the day before</hi> either <hi>he himself has made a Feast,</hi> or <hi>has been treated by his Neighbour at a Noble Entertainment.</hi> But why, I pray, must this excuse it? For if at the Feast he was guilty of any <hi>incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Fault,</hi> or any ways <hi>intemperate</hi>; 'tis not the <hi>Feast,</hi> but such <hi>Offence</hi> or <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> which is to be alledg'd for it. But if the Entertainment was <hi>Friendly</hi> in the <hi>Design, Temperate</hi> at the <hi>Table,</hi> and every way <hi>harmless</hi> and <hi>charitable,</hi> hurting no Man's <hi>Fame,</hi> nor disturbing any Man's <hi>Quiet</hi> in the Conversation; wherein was his Lord offended, or his Soul unfitted by it? The <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> received it as a Friendly Treat, for in those days their <hi>Love-Feasts</hi> always went along with it; so that an Hospitable Entertainment the day <hi>before,</hi> yea or the <hi>same</hi> day, doth not unfit Men to Communicate; but if
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:52843:230"/>
in all things else they are duely qualified, they may worthily receive still.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Another</hi> abstains from this Holy Feast because <hi>his Child is sick,</hi> or because <hi>he has taken Cold himself,</hi> or <hi>has some aking in his Head,</hi> or <hi>is otherwise lightly indisposed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what if his <hi>Child is sick?</hi> Doth he attend it? Or is it advisable for him to be so far disturbed at it, till his Mind is unfit for those Religious Tempers which he is to exercise at the Holy Sacrament? Perhaps his Child fares the worse because of some Sin that he has committed; and will he not then instantly repent of it, and come to the Lord's Table, there to have his Pardon seal'd, that so this Load being taken off, it might be eased by it? But whether that be so or no, if he has any sense of Religion either in his <hi>Childs</hi> Case or his own, he will be earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to make God his <hi>Physician,</hi> and call out to him for help; and that he cannot do so effectually, or prevail in it so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly at any other time, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in the Holy Sacrament. For God is never more inclined to hear us, nor are we ever more likely to have our Prayers granted for any thing that he sees fit for us, than when we send them up along with this Solemn Commemoration of our Saviours Death, which is the only Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:52843:231"/>
that has Authority and Power with him, to obtain any thing on our behalf. So that if a wise man longs to have his Child recovered, he cannot do a more unwise thing, than either to grieve so far till he is <hi>unfitted</hi> for this Feast, or, when he might be fit for it, to <hi>neglect</hi> it; since his Prayers there would a be most <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> course to obtain it.</p>
                     <p>And then as for his <hi>own indisposition,</hi> if indeed it has brought upon him such <hi>heaviness</hi> as unfits him for any Spiritual Act, or if it is in that Degree, that 'tis not <hi>safe</hi> for him to stir abroad with it; God prefers <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Essential Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> before <hi>Positive Institutions,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> before <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> so that it will be a just excuse for it. But if it cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from looking after business, and going among his Neighbours, or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing out upon any appearance of doing either himself or his Friend a kindness; why must it excuse him from attending upon God, and doing him this Service; except that be thought sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse our attendance upon him which excuses nothing else, which is a thing, I presume, they would be loth to own, who stay away by reason of this hindrance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Some</hi> again refrain the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because <hi>their Wife,</hi> or <hi>Husband
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:52843:231"/>
cannot bear them Company, and join in it.</hi> One of them is either <hi>accidentally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> that they <hi>cannot,</hi> or <hi>sinfully negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> and <hi>unprepared</hi> that they <hi>will</hi> not come to it; and therefore in Complyance and for Companies sake the other also keeps away at present, and defers it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time when both together can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it.</p>
                     <p>This I think is a <hi>popular,</hi> but it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>weak</hi> excuse. For the receiving the Communion is an indispensable Duty, concerning which every Person must give account of <hi>themselves</hi> unto Almighty God; so that one near Relation can no more talk of neglecting <hi>it</hi> for the others sake, than of neglecting to say their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>serve God</hi> because the other doth it not, or of being <hi>irreligious</hi> to sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize with some dear Friends, and <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting away</hi> their <hi>precious Souls</hi> out of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.</hi> Nay, if he had not thus <hi>injoyn'd,</hi> but only <hi>Friendly invited</hi> us to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; yet would it be a very <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging</hi> thing to refuse his Invitation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, because some others, who are very dear to us, have not either the <hi>opportunity,</hi> or <hi>good manners</hi> to accept it. For if an <hi>Husband</hi> or a <hi>Wife</hi> will not receive, unless the <hi>other</hi> also will consent to joyn it; it is a sign they come not
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:52843:232"/>
so much for their <hi>Lords,</hi> as for <hi>each others</hi> sake, so that <hi>they</hi> and not their <hi>Saviour</hi> have the Service and the Honour of it: and this is an odd account for any man to give to Christ of his neglecting this Feast, when he is most affectionately and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly invited to it.</p>
                     <p>When any Persons stay away from the Sacrament then, because they cannot have their Bosom-Friend to joyn in it: they are Guilty of a <hi>great sin,</hi> since they are bound to it whether the other come or not, and pass a <hi>great affront</hi> and <hi>dishonour</hi> upon their Lord; so that this is far from having any excuse in it. Nay, instead of being a Reason why they should abstain from it, the neglect of one dear Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lays a greater <hi>obligation</hi> on the other to Communicate. For when one cannot come, so that there must be a defect on that part, that is <hi>too much</hi> already since neither ought to be wanting in it; and therefore there is the <hi>more need</hi> the other should receive, not only to shew their <hi>own Duty</hi> in it, but also to <hi>supply their Friends defect</hi> as well as they can, and make amends for it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A <hi>Fourth</hi> absents himself from this Holy Feast, because <hi>that day he is to visit a Friend abroad,</hi> or <hi>has a Friend acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally come in to dine with him, who must in all Civility be attended.</hi>

How comes it, that of all the days in the month we fix upon that for visiting or entertaining of our Friends, when our Blessed Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to his Table there to entertain us? Or if by accident a Friend then breaks in upon us, why must that detain us when Christ calls us? Is it any part of his Friendship to make us disobey our Lord, or to put us by embracing this high honour and most advantageous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity when 'tis offer'd? Or if he be Gods Friend too as well as ours, is it not very fit that he should go also and joyn with us? When to Communicate is a Duty in both of us, is it any wise Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that he should make us stay away, and not go himself along with us? But if it happen that a Friend who is <hi>unwilling to Communicate</hi> falls in to be entertained, or a visit at that time would be expected: Since our Saviour and they cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended too, which ought in Reason to be prefer'd?

there any who ought more highly to be valued by us, or have better deserv'd of us, or whom we should study more to make our Friend, than him who has gain'd us Eternal Life, and that by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his own Hearts Blood for the Purchase? When more <hi>Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> or <hi>better Friends</hi> invite us, let us turn our backs upon his Table, and pay <hi>them</hi> Attendance: but since he can have no Competitors in this Case, where is the <hi>Justice,</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Respect</hi> to him, when this is given as the Reason of our Absence?</p>

                     <p>And thus I have done with all those <hi>Pleas,</hi> which are wont, I think, most <hi>generally</hi> to <hi>keep men from the Communion,</hi> and would be most apt to hinder those things which I have said about the <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi> of it in the <hi>second</hi> part, from having their due effect upon them.

Or can we think our selves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier in any Hands than his, who is in all things studious of our Advantage? For our Blessed Lord seeks no other ends by us, but our own Eternal Happiness; he imposes no Duties on our Consciences, but what he has done himself before us, nay, what, had we the understanding to discern it, we should all have imposed upon our selves: So that in committing our selves to his Conduct, we do not give but seek a Benefit; and dispose of our selves in that way which is incomparably our highest Interest. We are absolutely his own Right, and 'tis infinitely our own Interest to be wholly given up to him, and govern'd according to his liking; and therefore every considerate man will freely resign his Heart to Christ, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer the World, or his own Lusts to pull it back again.</p>

                     <p>And when all this is done, and this solemn Feast is concluded, we must not think tho work of <hi>worthy Receiving</hi> is at an end; for <hi>one</hi> thing still remains that must employ us always <hi>afterwards,</hi> and that is a <hi>careful performance of all those Promises which we made to God in this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Sacrament, as has been shew'd, we seek not only a Pardon for what is <hi>past,</hi> but also vow and promise Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the <hi>Future,</hi> and these Promises must be made good afterwards, and it must be our care whilst we Live to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them.</p>
                     <p>This we are <hi>higly concerned to do,</hi> and it will greatly increase our Guilt and Condemnation if we fall short of it.

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:52843:249"/>
be trusted. We break our Faith with God, and go about to delude his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, had he been capable to be imposed upon and believed as we would have had him: which is as great an abúse as we can well put upon him. And this <hi>doubles</hi> the sin which we commit, and sets God further off from being intreated; for now we have not only the <hi>Fault it self</hi> to answer for, but also this <hi>Perfidiousness,</hi> and <hi>breach of Vows,</hi> which adds a new one to it, and makes it greater. So that after every Sacrament, if we still continue Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, our Guilt is aggravated, and our Souls more endanger'd, and we are greater sinners than we were before.</p>
                     <p>Thus highly are we concerned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Promises which we made at the Table of our Lord.</p>
                     <p>And this we shall be <hi>very like to do,</hi> if we <hi>think often of them every day,</hi> for some time especially, <hi>after we are gone from it.</hi> Indeed, if we forget all we did, and all the Vows we made there to Almighty God; we are like to be the same men still, and must not expect that it should amend us. For the Sacrament, as I have shewn, doth not better us without our own Care, but by helping and ingaging us to Good endeavours after it is over. It works not as a <hi>Natural,</hi> but as a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
                        <pb n="463" facs="tcp:52843:249"/>
means, and improves none but such as remember what they did thereat, and labour after their own Improvements. So that if we think all our work was done at Church, and fall into a careless and secure state of mind when we get home again; we shall be held still in the same sins, and the matter is not like to be much mended with us by such Receiving. But if afterwards we frequently remember what we promised there; if we set our own Vows every day before our Eyes, and call to mind our own ingagements: that remembrance will give them Force, and make them have their effect upon us. For the thought of our having <hi>promised</hi> and <hi>solemnly undertook</hi> for any Duties, is the readiest way to have them all <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To reap that Benefit then which God design'd, and which we expect by it; we must dwell much in our own Thoughts upon what passed there after the Feast is ended. We must maintain that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with our Blessed Lord which then we begun, and look upon it, not as a <hi>transient Act,</hi> but as an <hi>entrance on a lasting State,</hi> which ever after we are to continue in. We must bethink our selves daily, that when last we were with our Saviour, we cut out work for our
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:52843:250"/>
whole Lives, and in that hour made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Promises, which through all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of our days are most Religiously to be performed by us. This course will render it an Ordinance full of Grace and Heavenly Benefits, which will set us on mightily in our virtuous Attainments. And when we reap this profit by it, it will cure all our Indifferency and Aversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, and make us run to it the next time with edge of Appetite, as we would to a most delicious and enlivening enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. We shall no more account it a fruitless work, when once we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted these sweet and wholesome effects of it; but desire to share in it oftner as it can be had, and bless the time that ever we came thereto.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> Father of Mercies, who hast once given thy Son to die for me, and art now ready in the Holy Sacrament to offer him to me again; I humbly adore, but am utterly at a loss when I would duely prize so inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable a Mercy. What am I, poor wretched Creature, that I should sit down to eat with my Blessed Lord, when the Glorious Angels at a distance adore and pay him Homage? Why should I be call'd to feed upon his Sacred Body and Blood, when my Sins had a hand in all he suffered, so that I deserve to be ranked among his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, who were guilty of that horrid Fact, which nothing but the Blood they
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:52843:255"/>
shed could ever expiate? But since it is thy Glorious Excellency, O Blessed <hi>Jesu!</hi> to love those that hate thee, and to save their Lives who barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously took away thine, and accordingly to call to this Heavenly Feast so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a Wretch as I am; I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to come at thy Command, but would fain come Worthily, and leave all my Sins behind me, seeing it is no Feast for them. Oh! I loath them, and would never yield to commit them, were they to do again; and humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat my Heavenly Father, that for thy sake he would freely forgive me what is past, and rid me of them for the time to come. Slay them, Good Lord, for they have slain thee, and will slay mee too in time, if they are suffer'd to reign in me. Meet me in this Heavenly Banquet with a full Pardon of all mine Offences, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cure of all mine Infirmities, that I may be cleansed by thy Blood, and quickned by thy Spirit, and assured of that Eternal Life which for thy sake God has promised to all his Elect ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:52843:256"/>All this thou art ready to do for me, if I come worthily; and therefore my humble Request is, That thou wouldst assist me acceptably to perform the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Feast, that so I may enjoy all the Blessings of it, and feel it a Communion of thy very Body and Blood. I would gladly remember thy Dying Love with the most Devout Affections, with a Heart that is full of Thanks, and intirely devoted to thy Service, and quite weary of my Sins, and most desirous of thy Grace, and throughly prepared to seal a lasting Covenant of Repentance and Reconciliation with thee and all my Neighbours. All this I desire to do, and to do it fervently: But, alas! I cannot do it as I ought, unless thou wilt graciously come and help me. My Apprehnsions of this amazing Love are very low; O do thou exalt them. My Heart is still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible of what thou hast done for me, and my Affections dull and heavy; O do thou quicken and inflame them. Make me love thee as much as thou deservest, and desire thy Grace as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:52843:256"/>
as I need it, and be set against eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sin as irreconcileably as there is cause for it, and love all my Brethren as I am beloved, that I may be fit to receive the abundant Communications of thy Grace in the approaching Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I earnestly ask, and humbly hope for all this, O Good God, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I infinitely need it; and thy Grace is Infinite, which will not suffer thee to see the Necessities of thy poor Servant unsupplied; and unworthy as I am, I am still the Purchase of thy Sons Blood: O then do not despise me for thine own Mercies, and thy Sons sake; in whose Holy Name and Words I further pray as he hath taught me.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Thank thee most intirely, O! my God, for calling me this day to thy own Table, to shew me how thine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son freely dyed in my stead, and to assure me that now for his sake thou art fully Reconciled, and wilt live in me by thy Grace now at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and raise me up to be Eternally happy with thy Self at last; of all which thou hast given me the surest Pledges in his precious Body and Blood. What can I render to thee, Holy Father, or to thee my dearest Saviour, for so incomprehensible a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit? I admire thy marvellous Love, and magnify it above all things. Thy Praise shall ever be in my Mouth,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:52843:257"/>

            <p>Pardon, O! Good God, the unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedness of my dull Heart, in the receipt of so inestimable a Treasure; and fill me with Desires some way sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to my needs, and the richness of thy Mercies, that whenever this Cup of Blessings shall again over-flow, my Heart may run over with Joy and Thankfulness also. Let me never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Love I have received, and the Peace I have Seal'd, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of New Life I have made this Day; but as thy Grace has help'd me to them, so keep me in a lively sense of them, and inable me always to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the same to my Lives end. Now thou hast given me the Blood of Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to shew we are Friends; O! ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let me be guilty of any thing to

My sins, which I have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, will return again, except he chase them away; and my false Heart, which now seems fixt for God, will revolt, unless he establish it. O!

            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> God, who art the Giver of all good Gifts, and the Father of Mercies; We thine unworthy Servants intirely desire to praise thy Name for all the Expressions of thy Bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. Blessed be thy Love, that gave thy Son to die for our Sins, to put us in a way of being happy, if we would obey thee; and after all our wilful Refusals of thy Grace, still hast patience with us, and hast added this one Day more to all we have mis-spent already, to see if we will finish the Work thou hast set us to do, and fit our selves for Eternal Glory. Pardon, Good Lord, all our former Sins, and all our Abuses of thy Forbearance, for which now we are sorry at our Hearts;
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:52843:260"/>
and give us Grace to lead more holy Lives, and be more careful in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all future Opportunities. Make thy self present to our Minds, and let thy Love and Fear rule in our Souls, in all those Places and Companies where our Occasions shall lead us this Day. Keep us Chaste in all our Thoughts, Temperate in all our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Humble in all our Opinions of our selves, Charitable in all our Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of others, Meek and Peaceable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Provocations, Sincere and Faithful in all our Professions, and so Just and Vpright in all our Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that no Necessity may force, nor Opportunity in any kind allure us to defraud or go beyond our Neighbours. When thou bestowest Good on others, let not us envy but rejoyce in it; and when thou addest any to our selves, let us own thy Mercy, and humbly thank thee for it. Afford us convenient Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in all our reasonable Necessities, and protect us against the approach of all Dangers: make us diligent in all our Business, and give such Success to
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:52843:261"/>
our Endeavours as thou seest most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for us; and teach us content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to submit, and not to repine at any thing that happens by the Allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy Providence. In all our Passage thro' this World, and our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Concerns in it, suffer not our Hearts to be too much set upon it; but always fix our Eye upon the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Hope, that as we go along we may make all the Things of this World mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to it, and be careful above all things to fit our Souls for that pure and perfect Bliss, which thou hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all that love and fear thee, in the Glories of thy Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Extend thy Grace, we further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, to all Men, in all Places; especially to the Governours and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to all both High and Low, Rich and Poor, that pray for it, or need it, in these Kingdoms. Bless all our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations who are near us in the Flesh, and all our Friends and Benefactors who are endeared to us by their Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Forgive all our Enemies, give them Hearts to fear thee, and to be

Blessed be thy Goodness, which has this day supplied us with Food and Necessaries, and preserved us in Health, the chiefest of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Enjoyments, and prosper'd the Work of our Hands, and lent us our Friends to be still a Support and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us.

We desire to shew our selves duely sensible of these endearing Benefits, by learning to depend upon thy Providence, which has been so watchful over us; and to be contented with thy Orderings, which are so wisely fitted to our own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and applying all Opportunities to the increase of that Righteousness and Holy Living which thou requirest at our Hands. We fain would do it, and are here sincerely resolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it; and thou hast promised to aid all those who labour in so good a Work: Be it then, O Lord, unto thy Servants according to thy Word, and enable us by thy Grace and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit so to do.</p>
            <p>We are sensible, O God, how highly we have offended thee, altho' we stand thus indebted for all we have or hope

to enjoy, to thy Bounty. How many ways have we dishonour'd our Profession, and revolted from the Vows we made in Baptism, by Pride, and Envy, and Anger, and Discontent, and Evil-speaking, and serving divers Lusts, which then we utterly renounced, and promised never to live in again? We are heartily grieved and ashamed for these and all other our Misdoings, and are fully resolv'd by thy Grace hereafter to amend them: We unfeignedly repent of them, and for Christ's sake humbly beg to be forgiven, and that thy Grace and Holy Spirit may rid us of them for the time to come. Our full purpose is to endeavour it, and thy Promise is to help us in it: O let thine Arm be our Almighty Aid, and then we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them no more.</p>
            <p>Keep us in thy good Providence this Night, make our Sleep safe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing to us: Fit us for our great Change, that it may not surprize us unawares, but that having led holy Lives, we may be happy in our Deaths, and have Comfort and well-grounded Hope in thee.</p>
