            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97441:10"/>That the people made great conscience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of paying their Tythes &amp; all duties in those dayes, and so payed them truly and fully. Hence it was that in their Wils and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, something was alwaies bequeathed to the Priest, or to the High Altar, which came to his vse, in liew of Tythes preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or forgotten, as may be seene in all old Wils, whereas now so farre some be from restitution, that when they are to leave the world, even then they take order in their Wils to defeate their Ministers, as I have seene some Testaments, wherein to prevent the Parsons Tythe, the Testator hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed certaine houses to be yearely let out at some small yearely rent, and the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due to be reserved in yearely fines for ever, which for what end it was done, any man may easily Judge.</p>
               <p>That besides Tythes personall and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> praediall, there were many other duties, amounting to as much, and in some places to more then the Tythe doth at this day, all which are now taken away as <hi>Chantryes, Obits, Mortuaries,</hi> offerings to <hi>Shrines,</hi> vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary oblations, &amp;c. which Chantries were sometimes founded in perpetuity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with lands for ever, some others for certaine time as appeares by the <hi>Donnors</hi> Wils yet extant, and alwaies beneficiall to the Parson of the Church, who was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

solely endowed, and sometimes with the Wardens, more of which <hi>Chantries</hi> there were in <hi>London,</hi> then any where else, where scarce any Church but had one, and some three or foure.</p>
               <p>I could instance in some small Parish Churches in <hi>London,</hi> where the Tythe is not above 80. l. when as the Chantry lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing anciently thereto, taken away by the Statute of 1. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. are at this day worth 500 l. or 600 l. <hi>per annum.</hi> The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to the Jmage of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at St. <hi>Magnus</hi> by <hi>London</hi> Bridge was worth 4. markes <hi>per annum</hi> 9. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. as appeares by the <hi>Decimary</hi> aforesaid; How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly were Masses then sold to deliver soules out of Purgatory, besides the foure offering dayes, vsed all over the Kingdome, which are now come to 2. d. at Easter.</p>

sense of the last Decree of 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we must know first that there are some things cleare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without controversie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is granted by Counsell learned of all sides, that whatsoever some bold Ignaroes talke of old Rents: that if a greater rent be reserved at any time by the name of Rent upon any house, then the old Rent, that then Tythe ought to be payed according to two shillings 9 pence in the Pound, according to the improved rent, though the rent bee the full value of the House. This appeares by divers Orders, made by the Lords Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors themselves; wherein Tythe hath be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n decreed, according to the full improved rent, reserved by name of rent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is granted likewise by Counsell, That if an improved Rent bee reserved by the Owner or Inheritor of the House, that his Act shall charge the House with Tithe accordingly for ever, though lesse Rent bee reserved afterwards by fines or fraudes, or any other devices, unlesse the house come to be lesser worth in true yearlie value.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They grant likewise, That if a Lessee shall let out his house in part or in whole at a full Rent by the name
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97441:24"/>
of Rent, though afterwards he let the same out for lesse rent by reason of Fines, or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Leases, yet the Tithe shall be paid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the highest rent, during the time or tearme of yeares which the said chiefe Lessee hath in his house.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Cases controverted, are chiefly these; where the old Rent is still continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out encrease, by reason of Fynes really paid before hand; whither the Tythe shall bee paid according to the true value of the house or of the old Rent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the old rent is onely reserved by the name of Rent, and the improvement is and hath alwayes beene reserved by other names, as <hi>Fynes, Annuities, New-yeares gifts,</hi> &amp;c. to be yearly and quarterly paid, as the Rent is, and to begin and end with the Lease, done purposely to prevent their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Tythes, whither those payments bee Rents as to the payment of Tythes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true intent of the Decree.</p>
               <p>Whither the jurisdiction Ecclesiasticall be quite taken away by the Decree, and the Major be made sole Judge, or whither it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the same state it was before the said De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now though this were pretended by the city in that Bill, yet it appeares by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions their proofe came short herein, and therefore the makers of the Decree, doe not specifie this rate of two shillings in the pound, but doe onely in the generall say, that where lesse then

                  <p>The livings in <hi>London</hi> would be too great, Parsons would be all Bishops, some worth 2000. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> if tythes were paid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to improved Rents.</p>
                  <p>Jt is unjust to detaine any mans right, though it would make him never so rich: Would any rich man thinke it fitte that others should defraud

them of their right, because if it were paid they would be too rich, and because the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons would be little Bishops if they had all, must they therefore live like Beggers.</p>
                  <p>If any Living should swell to so great a proportion, the remedy should be to divide the Parish into more Parishes, and not to deprive the Church of its due.</p>
                  <p>But to answer this more particularly.</p>

                  </note>It is objected that the Major is the onely Judge named in the <hi>Decree,</hi> and the Tythes herein mentioned are not nor can be clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by any other Law then by this <hi>Decree,</hi> and therefore cannot be sued for before any other Judge, then such as the <hi>Decree</hi> directs vnto.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </note>This Argument takes that for granted, which is vtterly denyed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Tythes in <hi>London</hi> are grounded onely upon the Decree of 37. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. as if there were no other Law now in force which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly an error; for this Decree doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate nor nullifie any other Law former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inforce, further then where it was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:97441:36"/>Now it is certaine that 2. s. 9. d. in the pound, was due by lawes in force before this Decree, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Award and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. confirmed by Act of Parliament, 27. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. The force of which Award and Proclamation, and Act were no waies nullified by this Decree, but were onely confirmed and explained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in some things then doubtfull, so that they were then and are still in force; and therefore seeing that by them the Ordinaries power was not extinct as is cleare and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all; it is as cleere that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Act to exstinguish it, for the Major had power by the Statute of 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. as well as by this of 37. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and there are no negative words in this more then in that.</p>
               <p>Yea, not onely are the Award and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of 27. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of 27. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. still in force, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Constitution of <hi>Roger Niger</hi> and Archbishop <hi>Arundell,</hi> with the award made in 32. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. and other lawes then in vse, are all as may be probably concluded at this day in force, <hi>viz.</hi> so farre as they are not contrary to the Act and Decree of 37. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. for if they were abrogated, I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know when and by whom. In the 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. they were not nor by the Statute of 27. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. for then onely the quantity was

al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ered from 3. s. 6. d. to 2. s. 9. d. and in all other things the payment was left to the former Lawes and Constitutions and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes according to which the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies were determined arising after that time, as appeares by the sentences still remaining on Record, and in the 37. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. there is nothing abrogates any of them further then when they are contrary to what was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, and therefore it is probably thought by some that for non payment the <hi>Major Excom.</hi> is now incurred <hi>ipso facto</hi> according to <hi>Arundels</hi> Constitution, and that none ought to be absolved without payment <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si in articulo mortis,</hi> as is there set downe, and certaine it is, that if this last Decree were quite abrogate, the Clergie might have as good Law for their Tythes as they have now.</p>
               <p>Further I answer, that though the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary had no Jurisdiction formerly, yet the very nature of Tythes here decreed gives him jurisdiction, vnlesse negative words had beene added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is further said, that the nature of these payments is altered by this Decree, oblations are made Tythes, and though formerly the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary had power, whilest they had the name of Oblations, yet now another Iudge being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and the Oblations become Tythes the Case is altered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:97441:37"/>This is cleerely refuted by the precedent Historie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </note> whereby it is manifest that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the name, nor the nature was altered by this Decree. The Proclamation appoints 2. s. 9. d. to be paid for Tythes, and 2. d. at Easter for oblation or offering.</p>
               <p>So the Award 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and so most of the precedent Acts style them Tythes, and long before not onely this last Decree, but before 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. yea before the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. the payment on severall offering daies was disused, and the whole payed in one or 4. entire payments by the name of Tythes, and yet it is most certaine that then the <hi>Ordinary</hi> had this Jurisdiction, and that solely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it seemes these two Iurisdictions of the Ordinary and Lord Major cannot both stand by the Letter of the Decree, for by the Decree,</hi>

                     <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </note>J answer first, it may well be affirmed, that by the party grieved can be only meant the Minister; for wherein can the Citizen be grieved, if the Minister demand more then his due, the Citizen may with-hold payment, and so long J hope hee is not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Ministers demand.</p>
               <p>If it be said, hee is grieved when hee is sued in the <hi>Spirituall</hi> Court, J answer, that this grievance cannot bee heere meant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause first, the party must bee grieved with some thing mentioned in the <hi>Decree,</hi> which this is not; and secondly, the grievance must bee such as the Lord Major can helpe or remedy, but this hee cannot; for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, nor can stay the proceeding in any Spirituall Court, nor ever used any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive power against any Minister, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Atturney onely, according to the words of the <hi>Statute</hi> 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, J answer by propounding the like question. The <hi>Exchequer</hi> hath power to determine matters of Tythe in <hi>London</hi> where the Living is impropriate and held in Fee-farme of the King, as hath beene of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten adjudged, especially in <hi>Ivats</hi> Case, 16. <hi>Iacob.</hi> Now suppose that Court and the Major make contrary <hi>Decrees,</hi> which of
<pb facs="tcp:97441:38"/>
them must bee obeyed, or how can the words of the Statute bee made good for the Lord Majors power. Heere I know it will bee answered, that the <hi>Exchequer</hi> being the higher Court must take place, and the Lord Major may not meddle with causes there depending, but I say this is not mentioned in the <hi>Decree,</hi> but onely gathered by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; because that Court had juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction before the <hi>Decree,</hi> which Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not taken away by the Decree, and if so, then the very same answer doe J give for the Spirituall Court which is superiour to the Majors in matters of Tythes, and had power before him many hundred yeares in this Case, so that hee ought not to meddle with matters there depending.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Statutes and Acts of Parliament must bee expounded by Iudges at Common Law?</hi>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> for first the Lord Major is none of those Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and secondly, this proves onely that the Judges may prohibite the Spirituall Court if it proceed contrary to the true meaning of the Decree; but if it proceed according to the true sence of it, then it may proceed otherwise.</p>
               <p>No <hi>Ordinary</hi> could hold out plea for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97441:39"/>
Tythes in the Countrey, because there are Statutes made for all Tythes in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and <hi>Edward</hi> 6. which yet wee know they did, and may doe lawfully, and are never prohibited but upon suggestion, that they proceed contrary to the meaning of those Statutes and Customes, which the Iudges conceive they onely are to interpret.</p>
