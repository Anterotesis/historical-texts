            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>If you have any Exceptions, you ought to have

               <p>No, we did not allow it as of Right due to the
Prisoner; the Exceptions should have been made before the Plea.
You were indulg'd in being heard at first in the Cases of <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
Cranburne,</hi> and <hi>Lowick,</hi> but it was not the intent of the Act,
to alter the Method of the Proceeding; and so upon considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath it been determin'd. The Prisoner hath time given by the
Act to make any exception to the Indictment before he pleaded,
but you may move what you will afterwards in Arrest of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if it be material.</p>

               <p>There was one Man here that desir'd to be excus'd,
because he was on the Grand Jury; therefore it seems there are
some return'd upon this Jury that were on the Grand Jury, which
I think ought not to be.</p>

                  <hi>Whereas,</hi> That before and until the 8th. day of July in the 7th. Year
of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King <hi>William</hi> the Third, there was open
War between our said Lord the King, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King. And
that the said War continued on the said 8th Day of <hi>July,</hi> in the 7th.
Year aforesaid, and doth still continue. And that for all the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
the said <hi>Lewis</hi>the <hi>French</hi> King and his Subjects, were, and at
present are Enemies of our said Lord the King that now is: And that
at the time of the said War, and before the said 8th day of <hi>July</hi> in the
7th Year aforesaid, the said <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, set out, amongst
others, a certain small Ship of Warr called the <hi>Loyal Clencarty,</hi> of
which <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> a Subject of our said Lord the King that now
is, was Commander, with several <hi>French</hi> Subjects, Enemies of our said
Lord the King, to the Number of 15 Persons, in a Warlike manner to
take and destroy the Ships, Goods, and Moneys of our said Lord the King,
and his Subjects, and against our said Lord the King to wage War upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51627:4"/>
the High-Seas, within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty of <hi>England.</hi>
And that at the time of the said War between our said Lord the King and
the aforesaid <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Tho. Vaughan,</hi> late of <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Marriner, being a Subject of our said
now Lord the King, as a false Rebel against the said King, his Supreme
Lord, and not having the fear of God before his Eyes, nor considering the
Duty of his Allegiance, but being moved and seduced by the instigation
of the Devil, and altogether withdrawing the cordial Love, and true and
due Obedience which every true and faithful Subject of our said Lord the
King, ought, by Law, to have towards the said King; and the said War,
as much as in him lay, against our said Lord the King, designing and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prosecute and assist. The said <hi>Tho. Vaughan</hi> on the said 8th day of
<hi>July</hi> in the said 7th Year of the King, being a Souldier aboard the said
Ship of Warr called the <hi>Loyal Clencarty,</hi> in the Service of the said
<hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, And being then on the High-Seas, within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty of <hi>England,</hi> about Fourteen Leagues from
<hi>Deal,</hi> did then and there by force and Arms, falsly, maliciously, wickedly,
and Traiterously, aid, help, and assist the Enemies of our said Lord the
King, in the Ship of War called the <hi>Loyal Clencarty.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the said <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> in the Execution and Performance of
his said aiding helping and assisting, Maliciously Falsely and Traiterously
sailed a Cruising to several Maratime Places within the Jurisdiction afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, by Force and Arms to take the Ships, Goods, and Money of our said
Lord the King, and his Subjects, against the Duty of his Allegiance, the
Peace of our said Lord the King, and also against a Statute in that Case
made and Provided.</p>
               <p>And the said <hi>Jurors</hi> for our said Lord the King, upon their said
Oaths, farther represent, That the aforesaid <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> as a
false Traytor against our said Lord the King, further desinging practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and with his whole strength, intending the common Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
of this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to disturb. And War and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against the said King upon the High-Seas within the Jurisdiction
of the Admiralty of <hi>England,</hi> to move, stir up, and procure. And the
said Lord the King, from the Title, Honour, Royal Name, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown of his Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominions upon the
High-Seas, to depose and deprive, and miserable slaughter of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the said Lord the King, of this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> upon
the High-Seas, and within the Jurisdiction aforesaid, to cause and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
on the said 8th day of <hi>July,</hi> in the said 7th Year of the King, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the High-Seas, about Fourteen Leagues from <hi>Deal,</hi> and within
the Dominion of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and within the Jurisdiction of
the Admiralty of <hi>England</hi> aforesaid, falsly, maliciously, devilishly, and
treacherously by force and Arms, with divers others false Rebels and
Traytors, (to the <hi>Jurors</hi> unknown) War against our said now Lord the
King, prepared, promoted, levyed, and waged. And that the
said <hi>Thomas Vaughan</hi> in performance of his said War and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
then and there by Force and Arms, maliciously, wickedly,
and openly assembled and joined himself with several other false Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

of the Jury, The Prisoner at the Barr, <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> stands
Indicted for High Treason, That whereas on the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> there
was a War between his Majesty the King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> King; amongst other War-like Preparations, that the
<hi>French</hi> King did make, he did set forth a Ship called the <hi>Loyal Clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carty</hi>;
That the Prisoner at the Bar, as a false Traytor, did list him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
aboard this Ship; And on the High-Seas, about Eleven Leagues
from <hi>Deal,</hi> did Trayterously aid the Kings Enemies, to take the
King's Ships. This is said to be against the Duty of his Allegiance,
and the Peace of our Soveraign Lord the King, his Crown and
Dignity. He stands further Indicted, for that he, the said <hi>Thomas
Vaughan,</hi> with several other false Traytors, did levy War, and Arm
themselves with Arms, Offensive and Defensive, and was Cruising
on the High-Seas, off of <hi>Deal,</hi> with an intent to take the King's
Ships, and to kill and destroy the King's Subjects, against the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Allegiance, and the Peace of our Soveraign Lord the
King, his Crown and Dignity. To this Indictment he has plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not Guilty. We shall call our Witnesses, and prove the Fact,
and doubt not but you will do your Duty.</p>

               <speaker>Dr. Littleton.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, of the Jury, you have heard the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
opened, and also what sort of Crime the Prisoner at the
Bar stands charged with, <hi>viz.</hi> That he being a Subject of the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> has, together with his Accomplices, armed
himself in a Military way, to Murther and Destroy his fellow-Subjects,
and as much as in him lay, to Ruin his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
by ruining the Trade and Traffick, which is the great sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and Riches of the Nation. And that his Crime might be
Consummate, He, with his Accomplices, has done what in him
lay, to Dethrone, and dispossess his Sacred Majesty, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was in vain to expect to make the Nation unhappy, as
long as we enjoy so Great and Good a Prince. So that you are
to look on the Prisoner as an Enemy and Traytor to his own
Country; and not only so, but as one of the worst and most
dangerous Enemies: Since he being a Subject of these Islands,
was the better able to spy out our Weaknesses and Defects, and
thereby to do us the greater Mischief. It is not to be exprest,
what Ruin and Desolation it would have caused to this Nation,
had this Man and his Accomplices brought their wicked Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to effect; and all this was done to Aid and Assist the Grand
Enemy of Christendom; and of our own Country in particular,
the <hi>French</hi> King. Therefore as you are lovers of your King and
Country, and your Fellow-Subjects, whom the Prisoner and his
Accomplices would have destroy'd; I am sure you will take care
to do the Nation Justice, and that he be brought to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
Gentlemen, there is one thing further that I must not
omit, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Prisoner at the Bar being in Custody for
these very Crimes about a Twelve-month since, did not think fit
to trust to his Innocency, nor to his pretended <hi>French</hi> Extraction,
but the day before he was to be Try'd, he thought fit to break
Prison, withdraw from Justice, and run his Country: Which tho'
not a Confession and full Proof, yet is a great Evidence of his
Guilt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen
of the Jury, the Prisoner at the Bar, <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> stands In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
for two sorts of Treason. The one is for Levying War
against the King, the other is for Aiding and Abetting the King's
Enemies. And to prove the first, the levying of War, we shall
prove that he was a Captain of a <hi>French</hi> Ship, call'd the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado</hi>
of St. <hi>Maloes,</hi> and that with that Ship, he took and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
many of his Majesty's Subjects, and took several Merchant
Ships, and carried them to <hi>France.</hi> We shall likewise prove that he
was Captain of another <hi>French</hi> Ship, call'd the <hi>Loyal Clancarty,</hi>
with which he was Cruising off <hi>Deal,</hi> where we had several Ships
lying at the same time: And there he being on Board the said
Ship <hi>Clancarty,</hi> was taken Prisoner, with a Commission, by which
he was Constituted Captain of the <hi>Loyal Clancarty,</hi> under the Hand
of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51627:5"/>
And to prove him aiding and abetting to the King's Enemies,
we shall prove against him this particular Fact; that he and his
Accomplices did in the Year 1692. come to <hi>London,</hi> and went to
<hi>Tower-Wharf,</hi> to enquire what Vessels were ready to go down the
River; and there was one laden with Piece-Goods, and he put
himself, and several other of his Accomplices into this Vessel, to
go down the River; but they had contrived the matter, and
brought it so to pass, that they fell on those Men who had the
government of the Ship, and carried away this Vessel to <hi>France.</hi>
Now if this be true, the Prisoner is certainly guilty of aiding the
King's Enemies: And to prove he was guilty of this, we will prove
to you, that even in <hi>France,</hi> where he was at perfect Liberty, he
owned he was the Contriver of all this, and that he had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pound for his share of what was taken from our Merchants.
If we prove these two Facts against him, I doubt not but you will
find him guilty. We will call our Witnesses.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I think they ought not to examine to
that, because it is not laid in the Indictment. The carrying away
of the <hi>Custom-House</hi> Barge is not mentioned in the Indictment, and
by the New Act for Regulating Tryals in Cases of Treason, no
Evidence is to be admitted or given of any Overt-Act, that is not

               <p>Levying of War is the Treason; may they not

               <p>The business of Overt-Acts is, where the Compassing
and Imagining the King's Death is the Crime and Question, and this
must be discover'd by Overt-Acts. But if the Treason be falsifying
of the King's Money, this is Treason, but there can be no Overt-Act
of that, for that is an Overt-Act it self; but there must be an
Overt-Act to prove the Compassing and Imagining the Death of
the King, and in no other sort of Treason.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Levying of War that is an Overt-Act, so is
Adhering to the King's Enemies. Now Compassing and Imagining
the Death of the King is not an Overt-Act in it self, but is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
imagination in the Mind, and a purpose in the Heart; but there
must be external Acts to discover that imagination and purpose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>What is the meaning of the New Act then, that
there shall be no Evidence of any Overt-Act, but what is laid in
the Indictment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>What Overt-Acts are there in Clipping and Coyning?</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>That is not within the New Act of Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>That is most true, the one is excepted, the other is
not comprehended; but the Question is upon the Statute of 25. <hi>Edw.</hi>
3<hi>d.</hi> to which the late Act doth referr. Now proving the adherence
to the King's Enemy, is proving an Overt-Act. Suppose it be the
killing of the Chancellor, or Treasurer, or Judge in the Execution
of his Office, what Overt-Acts will you have then? Adhering to
the King's Enemies, is a Treason that consists in doing an Overt-Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, I take it that it is for the New Act, by
saying <hi>that no Evidence shall be admitted of any Overt-Act, that is not
expresly laid in the Indictment,</hi> must be intended of such Treasons, of
which by Law Overt-Acts ought to be laid. Now the killing the
Chancellor, or Treasurer, or Judge in the Execution of his Office,
are not such Treasons of which it was necessary to lay any Overt-Acts
in the Indictment, and so not within the meaning of this New
Law. But Levying War, and Adhering to the King's Enemies,
which are the Treasons in this Indictment must by the express pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. be proved by Overt-Acts, which are
to be alledged in the Indictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>The New Act does not alter the Law in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
what was Law before, is Law now, it leaves the Overt-Acts
as they were before; and it says not that an Overt-Act need to
be exprest, where it was not needful before. Now if a Man be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
for Compassing the Death of a private Person, there ought to
be some Overt-Act to prove his Design; but if there be an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Murther, there needs no other Overt-Act to prove it, but
the Murther it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51627:7"/>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>But the force of the Objection lies in this, <hi>viz.</hi> To
say a Man Levyed War, or Adhered to the King's Enemies,
is no good Indictment; but it is necessary to alledge in what
manner he Levyed VVar, or Adhered to the King's Enemies; as
that he appear'd in such a war-like manner, or did adhere to and
assist the King's Enemies, by joyning Forces with them, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
assisting them, or Confederating with them, that must be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
But if you Indict a Man generally for adhering to the
King's Enemies, and not say how and in what manner he did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to them, that is not a good Indictment; therefore if you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize
what Enemies, and how and in what manner he adher'd
to them, no Evidence can be given of any other kind of adherence,
but that which is so specified in the Indictment.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Then we must put all our Evidence into the Indictment.</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>So you must, as to the Overt-Acts.</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>That will be the same thing as to put in all our
Evidence, if we must give Evidence of no Overt-Act but what
is exprest in the Indictment. But I do not take it, that the Act
requires all Overt-Acts to be put in the Indictment.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>The Act says so. Suppose you had left out the Overt-Act,
would the Indictment have been good?</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>The Treason must be proved by Overt-Acts, and the
Overt-Acts that prove the Treason, must be mention'd in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>What the Overt-Acts of the Treasons before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Consider, if you can make that a good Indictment,
to say, that the Prisoner adhered to the King's Enemies, without
mentioning any Overt-Acts to manifest such an adherence, then your
Answer to Mr. <hi>Phipps</hi> is full; but if it be not a good Indictment,
without alledging particular Acts of adherence, then it necessarily
follows, that if Particulars are alledged, and you do not prove them
as is alledged, you have failed in the Indictment, and so his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
will lie hard upon you.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we framed our Indictment according to
the Letter of the Statute.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>In compassing the death of the King, you must
shew how that is manifested by the Overt-Acts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But compassing and imagining must be discovered
by some Overt-acts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>This is a doubt I have often thought of, I thought
it most natural that the Word <hi>Overt-act</hi> should relate to the first
Article, viz. <hi>compassing and imagining of the King's Death</hi>: For <hi>Overt-act</hi>
seems to be opposed to something of a contrary Nature: <hi>Act</hi>
is opposed properly to <hi>Thought, Overt</hi> is properly opposed to <hi>secret.</hi>
And that sort of Treason consisting in secret Thought and internal
Purpose, cannot be known, tryed, and judged of, without being
Disclosed and manifested by some external open act. VVherefore it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51627:7"/>
is pertinent and Reasonable, in order to Attaint a Man of <hi>such</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that the Indictment should Charge and set forth the <hi>Act,</hi> as well
as the <hi>Thought.</hi> And so it hath been used to be done.</p>
               <p>But, such Order or manner doth not seem so natural or necessary,
in framing Indictments for other Treasons, where the Treason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in visible or discernible Facts; as levying War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless I think an Overt-Act ought to be alledged in an
Indictment of Treason for adhering to the King's Enemies, giving
them. Aid and Comfort. And the Overt-Act, or Acts, in this Case,
ought to be the particular actions, means, or manner by which the
Aid and Comfort was given.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> declares his Opinion to this purpose. His words which
I read out of his Book here) are these. <hi>The Composition and Connection of
the words are to be observ'd,</hi> viz. [thereof be Attainted by Overt Deed]
<hi>This,</hi> says he, <hi>Relates to the several and distinct Treasons,</hi> before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
<hi>and especially to the compassing and imagination of the Death of the
King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for that it is secret in the heart,</hi> &amp;c. Now the Articles of
Treason, <hi>before exprest</hi> in the Statute of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. are four. 1. Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Violating the Queen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Levying War, and 4. This
of Adhering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (And yet it is hardly possible to set forth any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
Act concerning the 2<hi>d.</hi> otherwise than in the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute:
That Article expressing so particular a Fact.)</p>
               <p>I do observe also, that these words [<hi>Being thereof Attainted by Overt
Fact</hi>] do, in this Statute, immediately follow this Article of <hi>Adhering,</hi>
&amp;c. And it would be a great Violence to Construe them to refer to
the <hi>first</hi> Article only, and not to this <hi>last,</hi> to which they are thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected.
If they are to be Restrained to a <hi>single</hi> Article, it were more
agreeable to the strict Rules of Construing, to refer them to this of
<hi>Adhering</hi> only.</p>

               <p>That which I insist on is this, whether the Indictment
would be good, without expressing the special Overt-Act. If it be,
then this is a surplusage, and we are not confin'd to it; but if it be not
a good Indictment without expressing it, then we are confin'd to it.</p>

               <p>Can you prove the Facts laid in the Indictment? for
certainly the Indictment without mentioning particular Acts of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, would not be good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord; and as to the Evidence before you,
we would only offer this; whether in this Case, if the Indictment were
laid generally, for adhering to the King's Enemies in one place, and in
another place levying of War, and nothing more particular, it would
be good; I doubt it would not. But when there is laid a particular Act
of Adhering, we may give in Evidence matter to strengthen the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
proof of that particular Act of Adhering to the King's Enemies,
tho' that matter be not specially laid in the Indictment: For the Act
goes only to this, That the Prisoner shall not be Convicted, unless
you prove against him the Over-Acts specially laid in the Indictment;
But whether it shall not be heard, to make the other Overt-Act which
is laid, the more probable. Now we have laid a special Overt-Act in
the Indictment; and we have produced Evidence of it, and we would
produce likewise collateral Evidence, to induce a firmer Belief of that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51627:8"/>
special Overt-Act, by shewing you that he hath made it his practice,
during the War, to aid and assist the King's Enemies; But if the Jury
do not find him Guilty of the special Overt-Acts laid in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they cannot find him Guilty by the proof of any other O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert-Act
not laid in the Indictment. But if we prove he has made
this his practice, in other instances, during the War, whether that
proof shall not be received?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I desire the Act may be read. It expresly
contradicts what Mr. <hi>Cowper says,</hi> for it says, That no Evidence shall
be given of any Overt-Act, that is not expresly laid in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
(<hi>The Act was Read.</hi>)</p>

               <speaker>L. C. <hi>J.</hi> Holt.</speaker>
               <p>That is, you may give Evidence of an Overt-Act,
that is not in the Indictment, if it conduce to prove one that is in it.
As consulting to kill the King, or raise a Rebellion, is laid in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
you may give in Evidence an acting in pursuance of a
Consult, that is an Evidence that they agreed to do it, tho' that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the thing is, of it self, another Overt-Act, but it tends to
prove the Act laid in the Indictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>The Overt-Act laid in this Indictment, is his Cruising in
the <hi>Clancarty</hi>; and this Overt-Act you would prove, is no Evidence
of that, nor relates to it, but it is a distinct Overt-Act of it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>L.</hi> C. <hi>J.</hi> Holt.</speaker>
               <p>You cannot give Evidence of a distinct Act, that has
no relation to the Overt-Act mention'd in the Indictment, tho' it
should conduce to prove the same species of Treason.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>We would apply this proof to the Overt-Act laid in
the Indictment.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>We have laid the Overt-Act, that he did voluntarily
put himself on Board this Vessel of the <hi>French</hi> King, the <hi>Loyal Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carty,</hi>
and did go to Sea in her, and Cruise, with a design to take
the Ships of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and his Subjects. Now part of
the Overt-Act, is his Intention in the Act of Cruising, we do not
charge him with taking one Ship, so that his Intention is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Overt-Act, and it must be proved, to make his Cruising
Criminal, that he design'd to take the Ships of the King of <hi>England.</hi>
Now we think it a proper proof of his Intention, to shew, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this War, before and after the time of the Treason laid in the
Indictment, he was a Cruiser upon, and Taker of the King's Ships,
and this fortifies the direct proof given of his Intention.</p>

                  <hi>L. C. J.</hi> Holt.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot agree to that, because you go not about to
prove what he did in the Vessel call'd the <hi>Loyal Clancarty</hi>; but that
he had an intention to commit depredation on the King's Subjects:
So he might, but in another Ship. Now, because a Man has a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to commit depredation on the King's Subjects in one Ship, does
that prove he had an intention to do it in another?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>He was Cruising in the <hi>Clancarty,</hi> that is the Overt-Act
laid in the Indictment; and the Overt-Act you would produce, is his
being in another Vessel.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T. Noden.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, there were several <hi>French</hi>-Men aboard. I belong'd to
the <hi>Coventry.</hi> And as we were sailing by the <hi>Nore,</hi> and the <hi>Gunfleet,</hi> our
Captain spy'd a small Vessel sailing by the Sands, and he suppos'd her
to be a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, and he fir'd a Gun to make them bring to,
and they did not obey; and at last fir'd a Gun, Shot and all, and they
would not come to. Then the Captain order'd to Man the Boat, and
row after them: So the <hi>Barge,</hi> and <hi>Pinnace,</hi> and Long-Boat were
Mann'd; and they came pretty near them. This <hi>Barge</hi> we took, was
aground also, and they got her afloat, and she run aground again:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51627:9"/>
And as they were aground, most of them out of the Boat, our Long-Boat
struck aground; and waded after them near half a League, and
when we came to the <hi>Barge,</hi> there was this Captain <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and two
or three and Twenty more. And there was two <hi>Dutch</hi>-Men, and, as
I apprehended, some <hi>French</hi>-men; there was in her a Blunderbuss, and
small Arms, and a considerable quantity of Hand-Granadoes.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi>-man said they came from <hi>Calis.</hi> As near as I can
guess, we spy'd them about Eleven a Clock, and we weigh'd Anchor in
the Afternoon, on <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> and they took us to be a Light Collier,
and endeavour'd to board us, as the <hi>Dutch</hi>-man said; but when they

seeing the Barge run aground, we fir'd at her to bring her to; we
fir'd a second, and she would not come to, but ran aground again. When
she was aground, by the Captain's Order, we mann'd our Boats, and
out we went after her.</p>

               <p>It does not take away their Allegiance to their Lawful Prince.

Allegiance from their Lawful Prince to the <hi>French King,</hi> and make them his

               <p>Acting by Vertue of a Commission from the <hi>French King,</hi>
will excuse them from being Pyrates, tho not from being <hi>Traitors</hi> to their own
State, but to all other Princes and States against whom they do any Acts of
Hostility, they are Enemies; And their serving under the <hi>French</hi> Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
makes them his Subjects as to all other, but their own Prince or
State. And tho they be not <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> yet they are <hi>Gallici Subditi</hi>; for it's
the <hi>French</hi> Subjection that makes them to be <hi>Gallici Subditi.</hi>

               <p>We came aboard the <hi>Coventry,</hi> and were at the <hi>Nore</hi> at Anchor,
our Pennant was taken down to be mended. So in the Night Captain <hi>Vaug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi>
with his two and twenty Oar Barge, rounded us two or three times. In
the Morning we weigh'd Anchor, and fell down in order to go to the <hi>Downs</hi>;
and we came up with them, and fir'd at Captain <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and he would
not bring to. With that our Captain order'd to have the Barge, and Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
and Long-Boat, to be mann'd, to go after him. They follow'd him,
and at last came up with him, and came up pretty near; but could not come
so near with the Long-Boat, but were fain to wade up to the middle a Mile
and a half. We hoisted our Colours; in order to fight them, and bore
down still upon them; and they would not Fight our Men. And we took
them out, and when they came aboard, the <hi>Englishman</hi> that was a <hi>Pilot</hi> was
to have his Freedom, to Pilote them up the River. He confest to the
Captain, that Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> intended to burn the Ships in the Harbour.
And the next day after the <hi>Pilot</hi> had confessed it, Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> himself
confest it on the Deck, that he came over with that design.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Bullock.</speaker>
               <p>He came to <hi>Dover</hi> about the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1695. as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
I went with several others, who were brought by the Captain of the
<hi>Coventry,</hi> and the Lieutenant, and some others: And when we came thither,
he there owned himself an <hi>Irishman</hi>; but when he went the next day to be
examined, he said he was of <hi>Martenico.</hi> He told me he had that Barge from
the Duke of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and came on the Coast, and was chased into the <hi>Flatts,</hi>
where they took him.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of that; it was late, and we did not examine
him then; but the next day, when he came to be examined, he said he was
of <hi>Martenico.</hi>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Bullock.</speaker>
               <p>He said, that seeing the Boat at <hi>Bulloign,</hi> he bought it of the
Duke of <hi>Bulloign</hi>; and the Duke ask'd him what he would do with her?
and he said, he would fit her up, and go and take a Ship at Sea, that is upon
our Coasts.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>We are in your Lordship's Judgment, whether we need give
any Evidence; for we think they have not proved their <hi>Indictment:</hi> For the
<hi>Indictment</hi> sets forth, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>King fitted out the</hi> Loyal Clancarty,
<hi>of which</hi> Thomas Vaughan <hi>was Commander; and that very many</hi> Frenchmen,
<hi>Subjects of the</hi> French <hi>King, were put on aboard.</hi> Now the first Witness swears,
there were no <hi>Frenchmen</hi>; and another swears there was one or two; another,
that they were Forreigners, but does not believe they were <hi>Frenchmen:</hi> So
there is no proof of that part of the Indictment; nor is there any proof that
he was Captain of the <hi>Loyal Clancarty:</hi> So that none can say, it is the same
Vessel mentioned in the Indictment: Nor is any Act of Hostility proved; for
all the Witnesses say, that Vaughan <hi>never pretended to attack them, but run
from them.</hi> So that all they depend on, to support the Indictment, is to
prove that he had a <hi>design to burn the Ships at</hi> Sheerness: Which will not serve
their turn; for the words of the Indictment are, <hi>ad predandum super altum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi>
Now <hi>Sheerness</hi> is not <hi>super altum mare,</hi> but <hi>infra Corpre Comitatus,</hi> and
then not within the Indictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>The words, <hi>Ships at Sheerness,</hi> do not imply, that the Ships lay
within the Town of <hi>Sheerness,</hi> but off of <hi>Sheerness,</hi> which is <hi>altum mare.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>Then it is not in your Indictment; for that says at <hi>Sheerness.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>It is no contradiction, to say the <hi>Sea</hi> is within part of a

            <sp>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Soll. Gen.</speaker>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sheerness</hi> is not the <hi>Buoy</hi> in the <hi>Nore.</hi> Then you must prove
he was Captain at this time: For the Indictment says, <hi>Ad tunc fuit Capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus &amp; Miles.</hi>

               <p>You will make one part agree with another, that the <hi>French

               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>He might be a Captain in another Ship, but not in this Ship;

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oldish.</speaker>
               <p>This seems to me a very strange proof, to be built only upon
the sayings of these Persons, that they were <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and this to a man who
had no Authority to examine them, when it might have been easily proved
in a regular way, in case they had been so; they might have been examined
before a Magistrate, and thereby it would have appeared whether they were
<hi>French</hi> or no. And 'twas absolutely necessary in this case, because of the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trariety
of the Witnesses; for the first Witness said, there was no <hi>Frenchman</hi>
aboard; the next said there were two <hi>Frenchmen</hi> and a <hi>Dutchman</hi>; and <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenden</hi>
said, there were 13. Now how can these be reconciled, unless there
had been a Legal Examination of the Parties? But the thing we would
chiefly go on is this, I think they have sail'd in the Foundation of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51627:12"/>
that is, to prove the Prisoner a Subject of this Crown; neither is there
the least colour of proof thereof. At Night he came to Mr. <hi>Crittenden,</hi> and
is in drink, there he says he is an <hi>Irishman</hi>; the next morning, when he is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
before the Justices, then he comes in a kind of Judgment, and then such
a confession would be of moment; but then he confesses himself to be a
<hi>Frenchman</hi> of <hi>Martenico.</hi> Now, my Lord, what credit is to be given to these
confessions; when before the Marshal he shall say, <hi>I am an Irishman</hi>; and the
next day, when he is on examination, he declares himself a <hi>Frenchman</hi>; in
one confession he is in drink, in the other sober? Now, my Lord, I say,
what proof is here? Here then the Foundation of the <hi>Treason</hi> fails: For the
Indictment is, <hi>That he being a Subject of the King of</hi> England, <hi>levies War.</hi> Now
my Lord, it this Quality be not proved, all the rest of the Indictment falls to
the ground: for it is impossible for him to commit <hi>Treason,</hi> where he is not a
Subject, because there can be no Violation of Allegiance. So that if he be a
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> as he declared before the Justices, he cannot be guilty of <hi>Treason.</hi>
So that here they have fail'd in the Foundation of all; that is, to prove him a
Subject of <hi>England.</hi> And because they affirm him to be so, it lies on those
that affirm it, to prove it. But perhaps now they will say, that these little
confessions of his will throw the burthen of proof on him. By no means;
when here is a stronger presumption on the other side; a meer extrajudicial
saying to Seamen, <hi>that he is an Irishman,</hi> cannot ballance his confession exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
before the Justices, wherein he says he is a <hi>Frenchman</hi>; and so can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
throw the burden of proof on him. Therefore it lies on them that assert
this, to prove it. But, my Lord, tho it doth not lie on him, yet we will prove
him to be a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and born at <hi>Martenico,</hi> by those that were at the
christening of him, and have known him from time to time ever since. And
because they say he can speak <hi>English,</hi> if you please to examine him, you shall
hear him speak Natural <hi>French</hi>; so that that cannot prove him to be a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Irishman.</hi>

               <p>About 16 years ago I was at <hi>Mount-Surat,</hi> and I came to St.

and so they brought me to the <hi>French</hi> Ground; and coming there, I
was in company with several others that Night, and it happened I was told
there was one Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> there; and I coming acquainted with him, he
shewed me this Youth (he was a Youth then); He told me he was his Son,
and recommended him to me, because he look'd on me to be a man in trust
and business.</p>

time, being but fifteen years of Age.</p>

               <p>It is a strange thing, you have a most admirable memory,
and Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> has as good a memory as you; that you should never
have any intercourse for fourteen years, and yet should remember one an other
after so long a time; It is a vvonderful thing too, that vvhen he could not
knovv you vvere in Tovvn, and yet should call you a VVitness on his behalf,
sure he must have the Spirit of Prophesie.</p>

from <hi>Port-Royal.</hi> He told me, there was one Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> had a Plantation
there, and desired him to be Godfather. And about two days after, I went
from <hi>Port-Royal</hi> to St. <hi>Christophers</hi> again, and I came to <hi>Rhoan</hi> again in a Ship
called St. <hi>Joseph.</hi> So in 1677, I went to St. <hi>Christophers</hi> again, and from thence
to <hi>Martenico,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>; I asked him, what is become of that Young
man we were at the Christening, and so he shewed me him that is here (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

who was taken Prisoner in <hi>August</hi> the same year; and my Captain he had
the liberty to go upto <hi>Paris</hi> with a Guard, for his pleasure, and to learn the
Speech. And, as it happened, we came to lodge in a street, called, <hi>Dolphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi>
at the sign of the <hi>Crown.</hi> And there was some Gentlemen, that were
there to learn the Speech, that were my Countrymen; and there was a Young
man there, and he was acquainted over the way, where this Gentleman, Capt.
<hi>Vaughan</hi> lodged; He lodged at his Aunts, that sold Silks, her Name was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Wotton</hi>; I saw this Gentleman there; I am sure it is he; and with that
I came acquainted with him, as well as the rest<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I think we have given sufficient Evidence that he is an <hi>Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>
but now we shall shew you, that all your VVitnesses have given a very
extravagant Evidence to prove that he is a <hi>Frenchman.</hi> All he hoped for was,
that the Prosecutors for the King could not be able to prove him an <hi>Irishman</hi>;
He believed there were but 3 men could prove him so; that was <hi>David Creagh</hi>
and 2 more; and so he writes to <hi>David Creagh,</hi> and tells him, <hi>That his life was in
his power, and he hoped he and the other 2 would not discover it.</hi> This <hi>David Creagh</hi>
was his Neighbour in <hi>Ireland</hi>; VVe will call him to prove that <hi>Capt. Vaughan</hi>
was born at <hi>Galloway</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, but I cannot swear it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I have some assurance that Mr.</hi> Whitaker <hi>has no Witness to prove me a Subject
of</hi> England, <hi>but you, and Two more, which I am glad of with all my heart; I hope
I may have none against me that wish me worse than you and Capt.</hi> Etherington. <hi>If
Mr.</hi> Whitaker <hi>has not Sworn you yet, I hope you will not appear against me. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
if I had more than my Life, I would lay it in your hand. I am like to be sent
to</hi> Newgate <hi>this Day, and it is like you and some more will be sent here, that we may
not talk together. The</hi> Dutch Dogs <hi>took from me Eleven Hundred Dollars in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which certainly troubles me more than the thoughts of Death, which I value not
a Straw; but I hope in 4 or 5 days to be supplied. I fear they will keep me close. I
have all the liberty imaginable here to write, and my Friends suffered to see me. I can
say nothing that is comfortable, but that I am very well in health, and nothing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

               <p>Is that Letter proved? That is not to the purpose. Nor of any

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>No, that none could prove him a Subject, but he and two

               <p>We will produce only one Witness more, call Mr. <hi>Jo. Rivet.</hi>
The Court being informed by some Gentlemen then on the Bench, that there
was a Gentleman then in Court one Mr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> who being of <hi>Galloway</hi>; could
Probably give some Account of the Prisoner, he was immediately called, and
required to depose what he knows.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jo. Rivet.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord. I am sorry I am called, where Life is concerned,
when I came hither only out of curiosity; but the Service I owe to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, obliges me to speak vvhat I knovv, novv I am called to it. (Then
he vvas Svvorn.)</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar? vvhat Countryman
is he?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>J Rivet.</speaker>
               <p>I have knovvn him a great many years, vve vvere Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the same Tovvn, vve lived in <hi>Galloway</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> I knevv his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Mother, and Brothers, and Sisters; and I remember him a Child,
as long as I can remember any thing, I cannot determine to a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of years; and I remember him not only a School-boy, but also an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
to one Mr. <hi>Coleman.</hi> And I vvonder very much at vvhat Mr. <hi>French</hi>
says, for by the Name and Place of his Birth, he must have Svvorn vvhat he
knovvs to be othervvise: For the <hi>French's</hi> are a Family in <hi>Galloway</hi>; his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was an Honest Gentleman, and went over into <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Rebellion in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51627:16"/>
1641. and he there married a Woman, a Native of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and had seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
children, one of which, in the latter end of, K. <hi>Charles's</hi> Reign, turn'd
Papist, and I believe the grief for it hastened his Father's death. I own part of
the Evidence may be true, about his being in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> but his mother, I
believe, was never out of <hi>Ireland</hi> in her life.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Rivet.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot be positive, I think at the reduction of <hi>Galloway</hi> in
1691. I cannot say whether at or after; but I saw him about that time, and
knew him, and have known him from a Child; I knew him a School-Boy,
and knew his Brothers.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Rivet.</speaker>
               <p>I know him as well as any face I ever saw. I came accidentally
into Court out of Curiosity; and one that knew me, that was of <hi>Galloway,</hi>
gave Account to the Kings Counsel, and so I am called to give evidence.</p>

               <speaker>Jo. Rivet.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot say I know him, for I see him but in the Dark; if I
saw him in a better light, it may be I may. (Then <hi>Rob. French</hi> was set up

               <p>We can give an Answer to this, my Lord; we shall prove,
that there was one <hi>John Vaughan</hi> at <hi>Galloway,</hi> and he had a Son <hi>Thomas,</hi> that
dyed ten years ago. As for Mr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> he is a meer stranger to us, we know
nothing of him; and by what I can perceive, he comes in as a Volunteer, not
subpaena'd by either side. And for Mr. <hi>Creagh,</hi> we shall shew he is not to be
credited in any thing, for we shall prove him guilty of Felony, and that he

Swore, that if his Brother would not supply him with Money, he would
swear Treason against him, and shop him in <hi>Newgate</hi>; and that he should not
come out till he came upon a Sledge; and if so, there is no body surely can
believe he will stick at Perjury, or Forgery, or any thing else, which may be
for his advantage; Call Mr. <hi>Christopher Crey</hi> (vvho vvas Svvorn.)</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C. Creagh.</speaker>
               <p>His reputation has been but very slender, I am very sorry for it;
several in the Court can give Account of it, as well as I. He served a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his in <hi>New-Castle,</hi> he served there some time, and came to Town, and
came to me, and depended upon me, and I subsisted him; and he took an
opportunity one day, when I and my Wife were gone abroad, and no body
at home but the Maid, and went up stairs, where my Wives Room is, and
there being a Sash-Window, he opens it, and took out of my Wives Closet
several pieces of Gold.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C. Creagh.</speaker>
               <p>I found it out afterwards; he was my Brother, and therefore I
did not Prosecute him. I did not know he had it, till afterwards, that I
found to whom he had disposed of the Gold. I enquired who was in the
House, and thought the Maid had it; and she said none had been there, but
my Brother; and he at last owned the Fact, and I had it again.</p>

               <p>He has been confined in <hi>Newgate</hi> Eighteen Months, and I subsisted
him in Charity, I allowed him all along; and he has been sending to me by
several messages, that if I subsisted him not with more Money, than I did
allow him, he would swear me into a Plot.</p>

When I came to the Sessions-House, when the <hi>Pyrates</hi> were tryed the first time. I
was going through the <hi>Bail-Dock,</hi> where this <hi>David Creagh</hi> call'd to me; and I asked him
what he did here? he said he was to be evidence against Captain <hi>Vaughan.</hi> No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
said I, you do not know him; do you? Says he, here's the thing, it had been
better for me, that I had been an evidence against him before this; and I am forced to
be an evidence against him, to save my self: And he bid me tell his Brother, God
damn his Soul to all Eternity, if he did not send him supply that day, he would have
him in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and that he should not come out again, till he came out upon a Sledge.</p>

says he died at ten, and of the Small-pox.</p>

Officium Domini contra Thomam Vaughan Capuem'
Navicule, the Loyal Clencarty.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Examination of <hi>Thomas Vaughan</hi> late Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Ship, the <hi>Loyal Clencarty,</hi> aged about
Twenty Six Years, taken before the Right Worshipful
Sir <hi>Charles Hedges,</hi> Kt. Judge of the High Court
of Admiralty of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THis Examinate saith, That he was born at <hi>Martinico</hi> within
the Dominons of the <hi>French</hi> King, and is his Subject, but
refuses to answer of what Parents he was born; That he came
last from thence about four Years ago as Commander of a ship
called the <hi>Hare,</hi> which had been before taken from the English,
and came in her to <hi>Nants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and hath ever since been in
<hi>France</hi> or cruizing in <hi>French</hi> Ships; That he hath been a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
ever since he was sixteen years of age, and hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
several <hi>French</hi> Privateers, and was Commander
of a Privateer of St. <hi>Malo,</hi> called, the <hi>Granada</hi> of 36 Guns, which
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Years ago took the <hi>Diamond,</hi> and the Examinate
 was never till now taken. Being asked, Whether he ever lived in
<hi>England,</hi> or in <hi>Ireland?</hi> he refuses to answer. Being asked, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he knew any thing of the taking and earrying of a Custom-House
Boat from the <hi>Downs</hi> to <hi>Bulloigne?</hi> or, Whether he was
then in <hi>London,</hi> or did give directions to any Persons, or knew
of her being carried off? he answered nothing, but said, That if
any Person would prove it against him he was present to answer
it: but saith, That in <hi>France</hi> he heard of her being brought to
<hi>Bulloigne</hi>; and he the Examinate bought her at <hi>Bulloigne</hi> of the
Men that carried her away, and that she cost him 900 and odd
Livres, and was then called the <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Ann,</hi> or <hi>Michael</hi>
and <hi>Ann,</hi> but which, doth not remember; That he the Examinate
still hath the said Vessel at <hi>Bulloigne</hi>; That he cannot tell the
names of the Persons he bought her of, and that took her away,
but believes they had a Commission; That something above
three Weeks ago the Examinate went with a Commission from
the <hi>French</hi> King on board a two and twenty Oar-Barge, called
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51627:19"/>
the <hi>Loyal Clencarty</hi> then at <hi>Bulloigne</hi> as Commander thereof, and
on Munday last was a fortnight was taken by the <hi>Coventry</hi> Man
of War at the <hi>Buoy in the Gunfleet</hi>; And that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the <hi>Coventry</hi> took away this Examinate's Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being asked upon what design he came out with the Barge,
replied that it was not to take the Air; That the Barge formerly
belonged to the Lord <hi>Danby,</hi> and was taken by a <hi>French</hi> Privateer
about a Year ago; That before he came out, he met with two
<hi>English</hi> Seamen upon the Court of Guards at <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> who
told the Examinate, That they had been taken Prisoners,
and the Examinate took them in upon Charity; and afterwards
met another <hi>English</hi> Man, who told the Examinate that he had
been taken in Land Service, and believes it was before Fort
<hi>Renoque</hi>; and the said Person sitting upon a Stone at <hi>Bulloigne,</hi>
and not knowing what to do with himself, the Examinate took
him on Board for Charity, and designed to put the said three
Persons ashore in <hi>England.</hi> Being asked whether he did not put
in a Claim for the said Custom-House Boat by reason of her
Captain? or, Whether the Persons that took her had any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from him? he the Examinate answered, That they that
took her must answer for what they did, and he must answer
for his Actions only.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, The Prisoner at the Bar, <hi>Thomas
Vaughan,</hi> stands Indicted for High-Treason, for adhering to the King's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
<hi>viz</hi>: That he put himself as a Soldier in the Service of the <hi>French</hi> King,
in a Vessel called the <hi>Loyal Clencarty,</hi> with diverse other Persons on Board her,
that were Subjects to the <hi>French</hi> King, and Enemies to the King of <hi>England,</hi>
with a design to burn the King's, and his Subjects Ships; and for that purpose
went in that Ship. That the Prisoner was on Board the Ship, and with such
a design, is proved, without all Contradiction, by several Witnesses that have
been produced; that is, that the Two and twenty Oar-barge, which is the
same called the <hi>Loyal Clencarty,</hi> lay hovering about the <hi>Buoy in the Nore</hi>;
those Men in the <hi>Coventry</hi> imagined they had some design of Mischief to the
Ships, and they made after him with the <hi>Coventry.</hi> It was apprehended by
Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> and his Crew, that the <hi>Coventry</hi> would be too hard for them,
and so they did submit, and were taken. And being Examined on what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he came on our Coasts, it is confest by him, That he came with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to burn our Ships. You may observe what sort of Men were a Board.
You have heard it proved to you, that <hi>Crittenden,</hi> the Marshal of <hi>Dover,</hi> entered
those Persons taken a Board the <hi>French</hi> Vessel, of what Nation, and what
Quality they were; and there were about a Dozen of these <hi>French</hi> Men, for
they were entered as such. Now if a Subject of <hi>England</hi> to join with the
King's Enemies, in pursuit of a design to burn or take any of the King's, or
his Subjects Ships; that is, an adherance to the King's Enemies. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
not only that Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> was in their Company, but that he was
their Commander; which Commanding the Vessel on Board, which were
<hi>French</hi> Subjects Enemies of the King and the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> is High-Treason,
and the particular Fact of Treason for which he is Indicted. And it
appears that he had a Commission from the <hi>French</hi> King to command this Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
the <hi>Loyal Clencarty.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Now the Prisoner having this Commission to be Commander of this Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
though they who served under him were not Native <hi>French</hi> Men but other
Foreigners, yet their subjecting themselves to him, acting by Virtue or Colour
of that Commission, makes them to be the <hi>French</hi> King's Subjects, during
their continuance in that Service; for otherwise all Prizes, which they should
take, would make them to be Pirates; which none will pretend to maintain,
when they acted by a Commission from a Sovereign Prince, that was an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
And if they shall cruize upon our Coasts with a design to take, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
any of the King's, or his Subjects Ships, they are Enemies, though they
were the Subjects of a Prince, or State in Amity with the King of <hi>England.</hi>
But at this time there is no necessity of entring upon this Question, because it is
proved that diverse, who were on Board this Vessel were <hi>French</hi> Men, the
joyning with whom, in Prosecution of such a Design, is that kind of High-Treason
of adhering to the King's Enemies. So that if Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> was
a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> he is proved Guilty of High-Treason, if you believe
the Evidence.</p>
            <p>But now it is insisted on by <hi>Mr. Vaughan</hi> and his Council, That though he
was exercising Hostility against the King of <hi>England,</hi> and designing Mischief to
his Subjects; yet, says he, I was not a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> I was born a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51627:20"/>
to the <hi>French</hi> King. If that be true, then is he not Guilty of High-Treason;
he is an Enemy, but not a Traytor: And that is the Point you are
now to consider of, Whether he be a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>France?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to that, he being taken under such Circumstances, and speaking
<hi>English,</hi> it is reasonable to be presumed that he is a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> unless
he proves the contrary. But then you have heard by several of the Witnesses,
That when he was at first taken, he acknowledged himself to be an <hi>Irish</hi> Man;
and he did not only acknowledge it to them that assisted in apprehending him,
but being carried to <hi>Dover,</hi> when the Marshal entered him in his Book as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
he entered him not as a <hi>French</hi> Man, but declared at that time he was an
<hi>Irish</hi> Man. It may be he did not consider the Consequence of it, for the next
Day he was carried before the Mayor of <hi>Dover,</hi> and then having considered
better of it, that it was not for his Interest to acknowledge himself an <hi>Irish,</hi>
Man he said he was born a Subject to the <hi>French</hi> King, and at <hi>Martinico.</hi>
There were <hi>Scotch</hi> Men and <hi>Irish</hi> Men taken at the same time, and they
were entered as of the Nation they belonged to, and so were diverse entered as
<hi>French</hi> Men. So that unless he hath given sufficient Evidence to the contrary,
this is sufficient to induce you to belive him an <hi>Irish</hi> Man born.</p>
            <p>But he has endeavoured to take off this Evidence that has been given. First, he
says, It was when he was in Drink that he did confess himself to be an <hi>Irish</hi>
Man; but when he was Sober, he said he was a <hi>French</hi> Man. And besides
that he calls a Witness, whose Name is <hi>Robert French,</hi> to give an account of
him. And <hi>French</hi> says, That about fourteen Years ago he was at St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophers,</hi> on <hi>French</hi> Ground, and he did then see this <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> he did
take him then to be about the Age of fifteen. He says he stay'd there about four
and twenty Hours, and that he was in the Company of this <hi>Vaughan</hi> and his
Father about five or six Hours. He says his Father told him at that time, that
this young Man, who was then about fifteen Years of Age, was born at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinico.</hi>
He says further, That his Father did recommend this Son to him to be
a Sea-faring Man, being the Imployment he intended him for; and he is sure
this is the Man. This <hi>Robert French</hi> was ask'd, Whether he ever saw this
<hi>Vaughan</hi> from the time he first saw him at St. <hi>Christophers</hi> until this time? He
says he never saw him since that time, till about two Months ago. He gives
you this account how he came to meet with him; he says he came to Town,
and being a Charitable man, he used to visit the Prisons; and he came to
<hi>Newgate</hi> to one <hi>Knowler,</hi> and there he saw Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi>; and though he
had not seen him for fourteen Years before, yet he knew him again, and is
positive that he is the same Person.</p>
            <p>Another Swears he knew the Prisoner about five years, and he was reputed
a French man.</p>
            <p>There has been another Witness produced which is that <hi>Dascine,</hi> who came
up as a French man, and talked French, pretending he could not speak English;
but on Examination it was discovered that he had an Imployment in <hi>England,</hi>
and was a Bayliffs-Follower, and it appears he can speak English very well;
and notwithstanding his pretence has given his Evidence in English. And he
tells you, That he about the year 1669 did go to St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Martinico,</hi> and there he went to one <hi>Williams,</hi> who had a Friend
whose name was <hi>Vaughan,</hi> at whose House there was a Christning to be of his
Son, to whom <hi>Williams</hi> was to be Godfather; and this Witness was carried
thither, and the Child was Christned <hi>Thomas.</hi> He tells you he went over
again to St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> and to <hi>Martinico</hi> in the year 1677, and that then he
enquired for this Child, and did see him. Then he says, after that, he went
over again to <hi>St. Christophers</hi> and to <hi>Martinico</hi> about thirteen years ago, and then
saw him again, and, I think, never saw him since until very lately; and this
Prisoner he undertakes to tell you is the very Person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51627:21"/>
But then one <hi>Harvey</hi> tells you he saw him in <hi>France</hi> in the year 1693, and
there he was taken to be a French man, and he lived with a Woman that sold
Silk that said he was her Nephew, her Sister's Son, and that he was born at
<hi>Martinico</hi>: This is the Evidence he gives you to induce you to believe he is a
French man.</p>
            <p>Now in the first place, before I open the Evidence in answer to it, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to observe the Weight and Import of this Evidence that hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the Prisoner. First, for this <hi>French</hi> that says he saw Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi>
fourteen years ago, when he was about fifteen years of Age; he had no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Acquaintance with him, stayed in his Company but six Hours, and came
away within four and twenty Hours after his first arrival, and never saw him again
in fourteen years; it is a strange thing that he should know him again so well
as to be so positive that he is the same Person, for in fourteen years there is a
great alteration in a man: For a man that has known one at the Age of fifteen,
and not seen him in fourten years after, though before he was very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with him, cannot so easily know him again. But however he is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
upon his Oath, that he is the same Person that he saw at <hi>Martinico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then as for <hi>Dascine,</hi> you may consider him that he should take notice of a
little Child that he saw Christned several years before, and that he should now
remember him when he had not seen him in thirteen years; sure he had a great
liking to this Child, that when he went to <hi>Martinico</hi> many years after he should
be so inquisitive after him; I must leave these things to you to consider of:
That he might have an Aunt in <hi>France</hi> that is very possible too.</p>
            <p>But now consider how this Evidence hath been endeavoured to be answered;
two Witnesses have been produced to contradict that which they have Sworn.
The first is <hi>David Cray,</hi> who tells you he has known the Prisoner for two
years, and says he was always reputed to be an <hi>Irish</hi> man, and born in <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>;
he has often discoursed with him about his Country, and he told him that
he was an <hi>Irish</hi> man, and born at <hi>Galloway.</hi> Then you hear what a Letter is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
writ to <hi>Cray</hi> when he was to come upon his Tryal, he mentions what his
Defence was, and that it was impossible that any could do him any harm but he
and two more. <hi>Cray</hi> Swears it is his Hand; that he hath seen him write, and he
belives it is his Hand.</p>
            <p>Then there is a Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> that came here by chance, who is a
<hi>Galloway</hi> man, he saith he knew the Prisoner's Father, who was reputed to
come thither about the time of the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in 1641. and lived at
<hi>Galloway,</hi> and that this Prisoner, Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> was his Son, and he knew him
of a Child, was well acquainted with him, lived hard by him, remembers
him an Apprentice in <hi>Galloway,</hi> and tells you to whom, and says he is sure this
is the very man; and that he saw the Prisoner in 1691, about the time of the
Reduction of <hi>Galloway</hi>; and he is confident that the Prisoner is the Son of <hi>John
Vaughan</hi> at <hi>Galloway</hi>; and he gives you a particular account of him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; <hi>viz.</hi> of the Reputation and Manner of living of his Father, and what
other Brothers he had; so that there is no Objection against his Credit, and it
is hard to believe, since he is so positive and circumstantial, that he can be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.</p>
            <p>But the Prisoner and his Council have endeavoured to answer all this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and first they have called <hi>Cray's</hi> Brother to prove that he is an ill man,
for that he came into this Town where his Brother lives, who subsisted him
and took him to his House, and one day when he and his Wife went abroad,
he made bold with some of his Money; but they thought the Maid had
it, and he charged her with it, but to his Satisfaction it did afterwards appear
that <hi>David</hi> had it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:51627:21"/>
Then there is another, <hi>Christopher Hyden, Christopher Cray's</hi> Servant, who
says he, heard <hi>D. Cray</hi> say he was forc'd to be an Evidence against <hi>Vaughan</hi> to save
himself; and that he used to threaten his Brother, that if he would not give
him more Money he would swear against him. <hi>Bryan</hi> saith much to the same
purpose. These are produced to take off the Credit of <hi>D. Cray's</hi> Testimony.</p>
            <p>But then Gentlemen, as to the place of the Prisoner's birth, two other Witnesses
are produc'd to give you Satisfaction that this Capt. <hi>Vaughan</hi> was not the Son of
that Mr. <hi>Vvughan</hi> of <hi>Galloway,</hi> whose Evidence I will open to you, and then you
will see how coherent they are in their Testimony. The first is <hi>Creighton,</hi> a
<hi>Shoemaker,</hi> he says he knew <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> the Son of <hi>John Vaughan</hi> of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi>
about ten years since; he was a <hi>Galloway</hi> man bred, and lived the next
door to <hi>John Vaughan</hi> that had a Son <hi>Thomas.</hi> He says he has been here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ten years in <hi>England.</hi> He says he thinks that <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> the Son
of <hi>John Vaughan,</hi> was about the Age of fifteen years, but that this Prisoner
is not he, for that <hi>Thomas Vaughan</hi> was disfigured with the Small-pox; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred him well, he had reason for it, for he once basted him soundly, and
that he went away from <hi>Galloway</hi> when he was about fifteen years of Age, and
was reported to be dead; and if it were so this Prisoner cannot be the Person.</p>
            <p>The other Witness is as positive as <hi>Creighton,</hi> for he saith, He
knew this <hi>John Vaughan</hi> of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and his Son <hi>Thomas</hi>; and that <hi>Thomas
Vaughan,</hi> Son of <hi>John Vaughan,</hi> died about ten years since of the Small-pox.
So that they have found two <hi>Thomas Vaughans</hi>; one tells you of one that was
fifteen years old, and was disfigured with the Small-pox; and the other tells
you of <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> who died of the Small-pox when he was ten years
of Age.</p>
            <p>You are therefore to consider the Evidence on both sides. The Question
principally is, Whether the Prisoner be a Subject of the King of <hi>England</hi>? If
you are satisfied that he is not an English Subject, but a French man, then he
is not Guilty of this High-Treason; but if you are satisfied, by the series of the
whole Evidence, that he is an Irish man, and that he had a Commission from
the French King, and that he cruized upon our English Coasts, in Company
with the King's Enemies, with a design to take, burn, or destroy any of the
King's or his Subjects Ships, you are to find him Guilty of High-Treason
whereof he stands Indicted, otherwise you are to acquit him.</p>

standest Convicted of High-Treason against our Sovereign Lord the King:
What hast thou to say for thy self why Judgment should not pass against thee
to dye according to the Law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tho. Vaughan.</speaker>
               <p>I am altogether a Stranger to the Law, my Lord, I refer my

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Well, then you refer your self to your Council. You have
had a fair Tryal, and have no reason to complain of it: If your Council have
any thing to say in arrest of Judgment they shall be heard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the Indictment has two sorts of Treason laid in it;
the one for adhering to the King's Enemies, the other levying of War; and,
with submission, I take it that the first is not well laid, for it says that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
did adhere to the King's Enemies, but says not against the King. Now
every body knows that the French King is in War, not only with <hi>England</hi> but
<hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Emperour: But if a Man joyn with the French
against any of them, he adheres to the King's Enemies, and yet it cannot be
said to be against the King; therefore they ought to have laid it that he did
adhere to the King's Enemies <hi>contra Dominum Regem</hi>; it must be aiding and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
them against the King that makes the Treason.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>It does say so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, it only says that Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> did adhere
to the King's Enemies, and does not say it was against the King; and if that
be Treason, is what we desire to know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>If he adhere to the King's Enemies, it must be against the
King, though he assist them only against the <hi>King's</hi> Allies, for thereby the King's
Enemies may be more encouraged and enabled to do Mischief or Damage to
the King: Suppose you assist the <hi>French King</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> that
is now in Allyance and League with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> in
actual Enmity, that is to adhere to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies against the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>Would that be Treason my Lord?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt</speaker>
               <p>Yes certainly, though that is not a point in this Case, and
so not necessary to be determined now; for the Act of Parliament of 25 of <hi>E.</hi>3.
defines Treason in adhering to the King's Enemies, and expresses the Overt-Act
in giving them aid or comfort; it is sufficient to alledge the Treason in the
Words of the Statute, adhering to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies. An Overt-Act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
shews it to be against the <hi>King</hi>; and in pursuance of that adherence he
did so and so; he was a Captain and Soldier in the Ship, did join with the
<hi>King's</hi> Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a design to destroy the <hi>King's</hi> and his <hi>Subjects</hi> Ships;
surely that is most manifest an adherence to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies against the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>The Overt-Act, if it were alledged sufficiently, would not help
it; for if there can be an adhering to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies that is not Treason,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51627:22"/>
they ought to alledge such adhering as is Treason; and if the Treason it self is
not well alledged, the Overt-Act will not help it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>There is an Overt-Act to shew it to be against the <hi>King.</hi> It
is said all along, he being in this Vessel <hi>Clancarty, cum diversis Subditis.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps</speaker>
               <p>But then that Overt-Act is not well alledged, for 'tis said only
he went a cruizing; whereas they ought to have alledged that he did commit
some Acts of Hostility, and attempted to take some of the <hi>King's</hi> Ships; for
cruizing alone cannot be an Overt-Act, for he might be cruizing to secure the
<hi>French</hi> Merchant Ships from being taken, or for many other purposes, which
will not be an Over-Act of Treason.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>I beg your Pardon. Suppose the <hi>French King,</hi> with Forces,
should come to <hi>Dunkirk</hi> with a design to invade <hi>England,</hi> if any one should
send him Victuals, or give him Intelligence, or by any other way contribute
to their Assistance, it would be High-Treason in adhering to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>If the <hi>French King</hi> had designed an Invasion upon <hi>England,</hi> and
Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> had assisted in his Vessel in forwarding the Invasion, it would
have been Treason; but here is nothing mentioned but cruizing.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>That design ought to be made appear by some Act of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility,
for in the Case of <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> and others, which my Lord
<hi>Coke</hi> cites, the agreeing to rise and pull down inclo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>res, and meeting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
Arms for that purpose, is agreed not to be levying of War; and they
were indicted for Conspiring to levy War upon the Statute of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> And
in this Case, here being only a Conspiring, and nothing attempted, it can be
no more Treason than it was in that Case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>When Men form themselves into a Body, and march Rank
and File with Weapons offensive and defensive, this is levying of War with
open Force, if the design be Publick. Do you think when a Ship is armed with
Guns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth appear on the Coast, watching an opportunity to burn the
<hi>King's</hi> Ships in the Harbour, and their design be known, and one goes to
them, and aids and assists them; That this is not an adhering to the <hi>King's</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
Here are two Indictments, one for levying War, and the other for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies; but the adhering to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ncipally
insisted on, and there must be an actual War proved upon the Person
Indicted in the one, yet need not be proved in the other Case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>The same certainly is necessary in one as well as the other;
for barely adhering to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies is not Treason, but there must be
an actual Aiding and Comforting them; and a meer intention to assist the
<hi>King's</hi> Enemies, is not an adherence within the Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>If there be not High-Treason in the Act alledged, that is, if
it do not make out an adherence to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies, than your Objection
would hold good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>The going to cruize, my Lord, does not make out an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies; for his cruizing may be for other purposes as well
as to take the King's Ships, and your Lordship will intend the best in favour
of Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Whitaker.</speaker>
               <p>To burn the King's Ships.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>The Indictment is laid for Adhering to, and Comforting
and Aiding the King's Enemies. You would take that to be capable to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
adhereing to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies in <hi>other</hi> respects; but I take it to be a
reasonable Construction of the Indictment, to be adhering to the <hi>King's</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in their <hi>Enmity.</hi> What is the Duty of every Subject? It is to sight with,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51627:23"/>
and subdue, and weaken the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies: And contrary to this, if he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
with, and Strengthen the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies, he expresly contradicts this
Duty of his Allegiance, and is Guilty of this Treason of adhering to them.
But then you say here is no aiding, unless there were something done, some
Act of Hostility. Now here is going a Board with an intention to do such Acts;
And is not that Comforting and Aiding? Certainly it is: Is not the <hi>French
King</hi> comforted and aided, when he has got so many <hi>English Subjects</hi> to go a
cruizing upon our Ships? Suppose they Man his whole Fleet, or a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of it; Is not that aiding? If they go and enter themselves into a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
List themselves and March, though they do not come to a Battel, this is
helping and encouraging; such things give the Enemy Heart and Courage to
go on with the War; or else, it may be, the <hi>French King</hi> would come to good
Terms of Peace. It is certainly Aiding and Comforting of them, to go and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a Commission, and enter into their Ships of War, and List themselves, and
go out in order to destroy their Fellow-Subjects, and ruine the <hi>King's</hi> Ships;
these are Actings of an Hostile nature. And it this be not <hi>adhering, &amp;c.</hi> it
may as well be said, That if the same Persons had made an attack upon our
Ships and miscarried in it, that had not been so neither, because that in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosperous
attempt there is nothing <hi>done</hi> that gives aid or comfort to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
And after this kind of Reasoning they will not be Guilty, till they have
Success; and if they have Success enough, it will be too late to question
them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>Intending to levy War is not Treason, unless a War be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
levied.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not actual levying of War, if they actually provide
Arms, and levy Men, and in a Warlike manner set out and cruize, and come
with a design to destroy our Ships?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>It would not be an actual levying of War, unless they commit
some Act of Hostility.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, indeed, the going on Board, and being in a posture to
attack the King's Ships. As to the fault you find with the Indictment, there
is a fault, but not in point of Law; they might have laid it more generally,
so as to have given more Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bar. Powis.</speaker>
               <p>However it is well enough.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>But for you to say, because they did not actually fight, it is not a levying of
War; Is it not plain what they did intend? That they came with that inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they came in that Posture, that they came Armed, and had Guns,
and Blunderbusies, and surrounded the Ship twice, they came with an armed
Force; that is a strong Evidence of the design.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>You would make no Act to be aiding and assisting but
fighting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>Then next I am in your Lordships Judgment, whether the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 28 of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> by which Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> is tried, is in force, and
be not repealed by the first and second of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> which saith, that
all Tryals, in Cases of Treason, shall be at the Common-Law. Now by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law
before the Statute 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Treason done upon the Sea, was tried
before the Admiral, or his Lieutenant, and my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in the 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> in the
Case of the Admiralty, saith the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty is by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law.
By the Statute 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Treason confessed before three of the
Privy-Council might be tried in a foreign County, but that Statute is repealed
by the Statute 1 and 2 of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>; for by the Statute 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi>4.
Treason committed <hi>in trales,</hi> might be tried in what County the King would
assign; but since the Statute of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> it must be in the proper
County; so that we are in your Lordship's Judgment, whether the Statute of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51627:23"/>
28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. be in force; and whether, since the Statute of 1 and 2 <hi>Philip</hi> and
<hi>Mary,</hi> Treasons done upon the Sea, ought not to be tried before the Admirals, or
anciently at the Common-Law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>This is Treason by the Common Law, and the Trial is by
the Method of the Common-Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true that my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> and other Authorities say, That
the Statute 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. for trying Treasons committed beyond Sea, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
by the Statute of 1 and 2 <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> but they do not say that this
Statute is not repealed by the Statute of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>; and the Books being
silent in this, is the reason why I propose this Question for your Lordship's judgment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>It is no more a Question than the Tryals of foreign Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and then the Determination of the Tryals upon the 35<hi>th.</hi> determines the
Question upon this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oldys.</speaker>
               <p>We must have two Witnesses by the Rules of the Civil-Law,
an extrajudicial saying of a Party may be retracted by them at any time, that
is the Civil-Law, and so there can be out one Witness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>That is not the Law of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oldys.</speaker>
               <p>I do humbly conceive that the Civil-Law is not taken away in
this Case; for though the Statute prescribes the form of Proceedings accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rules of the Common-Law, yet as to the Crimes and Proofs the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-Law
is still in force, and then the Party may retract his Confession in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
much more any extrajudicial saying.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Whitaker.</speaker>
               <p>You are arraigning the Verdict.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>That you should have taken notice of before the Verdict was
given. But we think there is no danger in hearing this Objection, because it
is so easily answered. How many Witnesses were to the Confession?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Ch. Hedges.</speaker>
               <p>We are not in a Court that proceeds according to the strict
Rules of the Civil-Law; but if we were, that Law is not so absurd as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that a Party may retract his Confession at any time, so as to make it have
no effect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oldys.</speaker>
               <p>There must be two Witnesses at any time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Ch. Hedges.</speaker>
               <p>So there are here to the Confession; but you mistake if
you think that every particular is to be proved strictly as the Civil Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
for the end of the Statute which directs the Proceedings of this Court
was to facilitate the Method of making Proofs, that being sound difficult by the
course of the Civil-Law; and therefore was that Statute made, as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
by the Preamble thereof.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oldys.</speaker>
               <p>There is a new Statute that revives that Statute again, and that
requires two Witnesses; whereby 'tis reduced to the Rules of the Civil-Law
again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Two Witnesses there must be; but then consider it is not
necessary to have two to every individual Overt-Act: For suppose there be
two Overt-Act laid in the Indictments, for one species of Treason, Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and Imagining the Death of the <hi>King</hi>; if there be one Witness that
he bought a Dagger, and said he would kill the <hi>King,</hi> and he is seen, it may
be, going to the <hi>King's</hi> Bedchamber with the Dagger; another Witness says, he
said he would kill the <hi>King</hi> with a Pistol, and bought a Pistol, and he stood wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to kill the <hi>King</hi> as he came by; that is another Overt-Act of the same
Treason. If one Witness prove one, and another Witness prove the other,
this is sufficient Proof with us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:51627:24"/>
               <speaker>Dr. Oldys.</speaker>
               <p>It is another Question, Whether he be a Subject?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>That is not an Overt-Act; if there be one Witness to that,
it is enough, there needs not two Witnesses to prove him a Subject; but upon
the Tryal there were above two Witnesses to prove it: There was <hi>Crittenden,</hi>
the Marshal of <hi>Dover, Cray</hi> and <hi>Rivet.</hi> I must tell you, as to the Doctrine
of the Civil-Law, it is not universally received in all Countries; it is received in
several Countries as they find it Convenient, and not as Obligatory in it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oldys.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, in all places, as to Proof; for 'tis the Law of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Ex ore duorum, vel trium,</hi> &amp;c. And one Witness is no Witness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Ch. Hedges.</speaker>
               <p>Two Witnesses may be necessary to convict a Man of any
capital Crime, but then it doth not follow that there must be two Witnesses to
prove every particular Fact and Circumstance. In this point, touching the
Place of the Nativity of <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> Was there not sufficient in his own
Confession, together with the other Proofs on the King's behalf, to throw the
burden of Proof upon the Prisoner? You your selves seem to have been of
that Opinion; you undertook to prove it, and 'tis you that have failed in that
particular.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Our Tryals by Juries are of such Consideration in our Law,
that we allow their Determination to be the best, and most advantagious to the
Subject, and therefore less Evidence is required than by the Civil-Law. So
said <hi>Fortescue</hi> in his Commendation of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oldys.</speaker>
               <p>Because the Jury are the Witnesses in reality, according to the
Laws of <hi>England,</hi> being presumed to be <hi>ex vicineto</hi>; but when it is on the
High and Open Seas, they are not then presumed to be <hi>ex vicineto,</hi> and so
must be instructed according to the Rules of the Civil-Law by Witnesses.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bar. Powis.</speaker>
               <p>This is not a Tryal by the Civil-Law; for that Statute was
made to avoid the Niceties of your Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Eyers.</speaker>
               <p>He is tryed with like Evidence, as in other Cases of High-Treason.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oldys.</speaker>
               <p>No, the late Act requires two Witnesses:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cl. of Arr.</speaker>

               <p>All manner of Persons are Commanded to keep silence, while Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            </list>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> one of the King's Councel, opened
the Indictment; after which Dr. <hi>Nuton,</hi> one of the
King's Advocates, spoke as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>JOhn Murphey</hi> of <hi>Cork,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> born a
Subject of this Kingdom, and therefore owing Allegiance
and Service to his King and Country, stands Indicted for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to, Aiding and Comforting His Majesties Enemies;
and likewise for levying of War, in Assisting the <hi>French</hi>
King, the Greatest, the most Inveterate, and the most Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Enemy of our King, our Nation, our Religion, and
the common Liberty of <hi>Europe,</hi> in an Unjust, Cruel, and long
War, against his King and Country; that King who Heads
the League against the common Oppressor of Christendom,
and the Country whose Forces and Reputation support that
League; and this with a design only to rob and spoil, which
is the Meanest part of the War, but withal the most Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
to the Innocent and Trading Subjects; being on
Board a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, called, <hi>The Nostre Dame de bon No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle,</hi>
and Fighting in her; for though the coming with such
a design, and the being in a Vessel, under a <hi>French</hi> Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
was Criminal, and must have met with, since it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the same Punishment; yet this was put in Execution
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51627:25"/>
too, by the the Taking the <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> on
the Twentieth of <hi>March</hi> last, to the Terrour and the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verishment
of many of his Fellow-Subjects; which justifies their
Complaint, and this publick Prosecution of the State, for the
bringing him to Justice.</p>
            <p>And then the Witnesses for the King were called, and
being Examined, together with several others, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Prisoner, it appeared to the Jury that the said <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phey,</hi>
being an <hi>Irish</hi> Man, and his Majesties Subject, did Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously
