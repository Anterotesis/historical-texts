         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe end of Controverſie with good men, is the Advancement of the Truth; with ill men, of themſelves and their baſe Intereſts; in all which God is Judge, who judgeth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and will reward every one according to their works, nor doth his Judgment ſlumber.</p>
            <p>Moſt Parties in <hi>Europe</hi> boaſt themſelves of being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> an excellent Character indeed; but the worſt is, there is little more then a Boaſt in it. I am not incharitable; I have firſt judged my ſelf. Let none deceive themſelves. To be like Chriſt, is to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and not elſe; and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; for Chriſt is not divided, neither is that Body, of which he is truly Head, at Variance; how much Diſcord, ſo much Degeneracy from God; for he is one, and ſo are thoſe that are born of him; the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are not divided, becauſe one and the ſame holy Spirit leads them.</p>
            <p>That which is the Guide of one, is the Guide of all; and by this ſhall it be known who are Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if they bring forth the Fruits of his divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which, ſaith the Apoſtle, are theſe, Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance, againſt ſuch there is no Law. And they, ſayes he, that are Chriſts have crucified the Fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts; this only will avail in the great Judgment of the Lord. Therefore I beſeech all vain Contenders to conſider of their own Standing, what their Work is, who Employes them, and what their Wages will be.</p>
            <p>Tell me thou vain Diſputer and Vitious Liver, what is Religion without Holy Love? what is Faith without Good Works? what is Worſhip without
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43652:3"/>
Godly Fear and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> without true Self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al? it is not he that cryes, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but <hi>he that does the Will of my Father,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be accepted.</hi> There is a great talk of mans Laps in <hi>Adam,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration in Chriſt, but they ſerve only for a ſound with too many: For did people ſincerely believe that they are fallen from true Love, Meekneſs, Patience, Humility, Mercy, Juſtice, Purity, &amp;c. and did they but conſider, that they are not reſtored to thoſe Heavenly Qualifications, but that they live in fleſhly luſts of one ſort or other, ſome in Voluptuouſneſs, others in Envy; and therefore not really reſtored or redeemed by Chriſt, nor truly in a ſtate of Salvation, but in peril of eternal Miſery, certainly they would not paſs away their little ſpan of precious time in ſo much worldly Pleaſure, neglect of God, and Careleſneſs of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, if they have any the leaſt hope of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> the Petulancy of ſome Adverſary or other has given occaſion for this little Treatiſe: The deſign of which is both to reprove him, and to hinder others from being abuſed by him, that ſo the Innocency of a People, whom God hath raiſed by his own Power and Wiſdom to glorify him in their Bodies Souls and Spirits (which are his) may be delivered from the miſtakes of his Ignorance, and the reflections of his Malice.</p>
            <p>And truly, my ſervent Prayers to Almighty God are, that he would yet more and more ſend forth his Light and his Truth to inform the Underſtandings, and overcome the Hearts of all People, that they may experimentally know the Redemption of their Sou's from the prevalency of Sin, and the power of the God of this World's Luſts by the Blood of Jeſus, who is the Lamb of God that takes away the Sin of the World; then ſhall Love, Faith and Holineſs encreaſe, and all Unrighteouſneſs come to an End,</p>

                  <hi>THe</hi> Quakers <hi>deny the Authority of holy Scriptures, as the Rule of Faith and Practice unto</hi> Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This we flatly deny, and charge our Adverſary to make it good <hi>in terminis,</hi> in ſo many words, or retract his Charge. For the Authority of the Scripture is the <hi>Spirit</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">This was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Calvin, Oecolampadius, Beza</hi> and <hi>Marlorat</hi> abroad; and of <hi>W.

See my <hi>Quakeriſm a New Nick-Name for Old Chriſtianity,</hi> and my <hi>Rejoynder</hi> in defence of the ſame, from pag. 24. to pag. 101. and from pag. 31. to pag. 186.</note> 
                  <hi>and Power of God,</hi> which we ſay is our <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide,</hi> as it was the <hi>Rule</hi> of the holy Men of God both before the Scriptures were written, and when they ſpoke and writ them. And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43652:4"/>
to ſay we deny it to be our Rule, is to ſay we deny our own Principle, for owning of which you are angry with us. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is taken on all hands to have been the firſt Penman of Sacred Story, and that we cannot riſe higher then his time for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſequently then the Scripture muſt take date; but who will deny that <hi>Abel</hi> had a Rule to worſhip God by, <hi>Enoch</hi> to walk with God by, <hi>Noah</hi> to preach by, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to believe by? if they had none, ſay ſo; if they had, what was it, if not the <hi>Spirit of Truth and Holineſs,</hi> that <hi>ſtrove</hi> with the old World, but was <hi>reſiſted?</hi> And if the Spirit of God was the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> then, have we got another <hi>Rule</hi> in the room of it now? No ſuch matter; thoſe that loved &amp; feared God in all Ages were ruled and guided by the Spirit of God; &amp; though many Helpers have been afforded men by the Father of Mercies and Lights, yet ſtill the Spirit of Truth is the great Rule in and through them all. This is the Rule of all Rules, as God is the Light of all Lights; yea, this is that Rule of the New Creature; for the walking of the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is in and after the Spirit; yea, 'tis the Mark of being a Child of God to be led and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 15. Rom. 1. 14.</note> by the Spirit of God, this is the Scripture's Teſtimony. There is no Condemnation to thoſe that walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit; and as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God. The Argument is plain, and altogether as unanſwerable; <hi>That which is to</hi> lead <hi>Chriſtians, is to</hi> rule <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but <hi>the</hi> Spirit of Truth <hi>is to</hi> LEAD CHRISTIANS, <hi>conſequently the</hi> SPIRIT OF TRUTH <hi>is to</hi> RULE CHRISTIANS. So that to deny that the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> is the <hi>Guide and Rule</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is to gainſay the Teſtimony of Scripture, and the very Tenure and Nature of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> new and everlaſting <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Life</hi> and Salvation; for in that ſtate the <note place="margin">Jer. 35. 33, 34. Hebr. 8. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Law is writ in the Heart, and the Fear and</hi> Spirit <hi>put in the</hi> inward Part; and what for, if not to <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> the Soul in the Path of Life?</p>
               <p>To conclude, As the Spirit of Truth revealed to the Prophets things to come, and was a Rule to them in diſcerning, receiving,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43652:4"/>
declaring and writing thoſe things, ſo is the ſame Spirit of Truth the Rule and guide to all God's People in their reading and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them now written? and bleſſed are they that read with a good Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>And that the Simplicity of none may be abuſed, we declare, as we have frequently done, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> were <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth by the holy men of God, as they were moved by the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> God; and that they are a <hi>Rule,</hi> yea, an Excellent <hi>Rule</hi> for <hi>Inſtruction, Reproof</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17.</note> all true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to embrace and practice the holy <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will of God</hi> thereby declared.

<q>
                     <l>To the <hi>Quotations</hi> I ſhall make a brief Return.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Quotation; G. Whitehead <hi>ſaith, That the Light within muſt be God, becauſe to deny it ſo to be, is to deny the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To what is here alledged, this brought to diſrepute our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion, I anſwer, That this Adverſary has not told us whether they were words ſpoken or written: if ſpoken, where be the Witneſſes? if written, where is the Book or Paper? However, the words are not <note place="margin">1 John 1. 5. Acts 17. 27, 28.</note> indefenſible; <hi>For God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all;</hi> and he is Omnipreſent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in man: and in him we live, move and have our being, yea, more eſpecially; for it is he that <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 23, 24. Iob 25. 3.</note> ſearcheth the Heart, and tryeth the Reins, and that telleth unto man his Thoughts. Upon whom, ſaid one of old, doth not his Light ariſe?</p>
               <p>To the <hi>ſecond</hi> Quotation, viz. <hi>It is damnable Hereſie to deny the worſhipping the Meaſure of Light in every man. And that the Spirit which God breathed in</hi> Adam, <hi>was not Man's Spirit, but another; the Breath of our Noſtrils, the Anointed Lord; this is that true Light which lighteth every man that comes into the World:</hi> ſee <hi>Rob. Weſt</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>Damnable Hereſies diſcovered,</hi> p. 6.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, <hi>1ſt,</hi> That I have not the Book cited, or cannot find, <hi>2dly,</hi> That the Man is not entirely in Society with us, but there has been ſome Diſſatisfaction in the Minds of our Friends about him in ſeveral reſpects, and particularly this Book was not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or printed by us. Yet <hi>laſtly,</hi> I know not but many good
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43652:8"/>
things may be in it; but if in any thing it be unſound, it will not lie at our Door: nor do I believe that the Paſſage it ſelf may not be vindicated, and that by Authority of Reaſon, Scripture and the Conſent of Ancient and Modern Authors. I will only ſay, that every Appearance of God is God; the Light that comes from God is God; for God is Light, and God cannot be divided from himſelf, and the word Meaſure of Light relates to our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, that receive and know only by Meaſure, and not to God, who, properly ſpeaking, is immeaſurable. And true it is, that the Breath God breathed into <note place="margin">Geneſis 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was Divine, if the learned Rabbies Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators on that Scripture be of any credit, as may be ſeen in my <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to <hi>Iohn Faldo;</hi> for a meer humane Soul could not make <hi>Adam</hi> live to God, much leſs make him the Image of his Creator. And if it was the Divine Life, I hope none will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion if that Life be Chriſt, who ſays expreſly of himſelf, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; who alſo ſays, I am the Light of the World; and this is <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Teſtimony, In the Word (that made all things) was Life, and that Life is the Light of men; and his (ſays he) is that true Light which enlightens every man that comes into the World. So much to that Paſſage.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>third</hi> Quotation, out of <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>R. Hubberthorn</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>Truth's Defence,</hi> pag. 101. I anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt,</hi> That the Quoter has wrong'd the Paſſage, and falſified the Book; for there is that quoted which is not there. The words are theſe, as given by our Adverſary in the Name of <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>R. H. We do deny the Scriptures to be the word of God, and alſo to be a Standing Rule; and that it is dangerous for ignorant People to read them:</hi> ſee <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Hubberthorn,</hi> in <hi>Truth's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> pag. 101.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, All theſe words <hi>[We do deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and alſo to be a ſtanding Rule]</hi> are not to be found there, they are added; which is a great piece of injuſtice; for the laſt part, which lies as if we would deny that ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould read the Scriptures, hear the words themſelves:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Query. The Prieſt asks, <hi>Whether the Scripture being carnal,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43652:8"/>
and the Letter killing, as you</hi> (Quakers) <hi>ſay, we may read them without Danger?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>R. Hubberthorn</hi> anſwer:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Letter which killeth is dangerous; for thou takeſt it her to <hi>war with againſt the Saints with thy carnal Mind and Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>—Again thus, Here you read with Da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nger, who ſpeak of them, and <hi>ſpeak a Lye;</hi> and its dangerous to read that and make a <hi>Trade</hi> of that which the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpoke forth freely; and you wreſt the Scriptures to your Deſtruction; <hi>and to you 'tis dangerous to read, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now let all people of Cander, yea, common Senſe judge, if this ſort of reading and uſing the Scripture be not dangerous: thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Iews</hi> uſed the Scripture againſt Chriſt. But does this give ground to our Adverſary to ſay, We hold it dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for ignorant people to read the Scripture, becauſe we ſay that a Covetous, Perſecuting or Malicious End or Uſe of Scripture is dangerous? O the perverſion that is made of the words and ſenſe of this paſſage! the Lord forgive him or them that deal thus with us. Hear what the ſame page ſays, But I ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that doth read and doth underſtand.</hi> This I have elſe where obſerved more at large.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>fourth</hi> Paſſage, <hi>viz.</hi> That J. N. in anſwer to the <hi>Iews</hi> ſays, <hi>It is the Devil that contends for the Scriptures to be the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can ſay the leſs becauſe I have not the Book out of which it is pretended to be quoted. But certain it is, that the Devil, that loves not the very Form of Godlineſs, but to exalt it againſt the Power, and ſhelter himſelf for a Saint, has more then once on the ſame ſcore pleaded for the <hi>ſcripture</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>letter</hi> againſt the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> not that he loveth the Scripture, or that the Scripture oppoſeth either Chriſt or the Spirit, but that he hath ſubtilly uſed the very Scripture, as little as he loves it, both to tempt and oppoſe even Chriſt himſelf. This is plain in his tempting Chriſt in Scripture-Language, and in the Perſecutions of the <hi>Iews</hi> both againſt Chriſt <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 6, 12.</note> and his Diſciples, for which they urged Scripture;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43652:9"/>
they relyed upon them for Life eternal, and not upon Chriſt; him they ſet at nought then, as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 9. and 19. 7. &amp; 5. 39, 40.</note> much as the falſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſleight his Light now. And it was Chriſt's Complaint then, <hi>In them you think</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to have eternal Life, but you will not come unto me that you may have Life.</hi> Thus the outward <hi>Iew</hi> ſet up the <hi>ſcripture</hi> againſt Chriſt in the fleſh, and thus the outward <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſets up the <hi>ſcripture</hi> againſt Chriſt in the ſpirit, or in his ſpiritual appearance in the ſoul, inſomuch that a man runs the hazard of being proclamed a Blaſphemer that ſpeaks but of Chriſt within, yet it is expreſs Scripture; and of being ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for an Heretick that calls Chriſt only that Word of God, to whom only that Name is given in the Evangelical Writings, though at the ſame time a man confeſs the holy Scriptures to be given forth by Divine Inſpiration, and that they are the Words of God. That the Word is his Name <hi>John</hi> will be our Warrant in the beginning of his Hiſtory; <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 1. Revel. 19. 13.</note> and that his Name is called the Word of God <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo affirms in his <hi>Revelation.</hi> I will end with this, that <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangeliſt in his Dedication of his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> chap. 1.</note> Hiſtory to his excellent <hi>Theophilus,</hi> now part of the ſacred Scripture, calls it, <hi>A Declaration of thoſe things that were moſt ſurely believed among them,</hi> and not the Word of God. We take him for our Pattern; when he is confuted, it will be time enough for us to confeſs our Miſtake.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>fifth</hi> Quotation, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſays, <hi>The Soul is part of God, of his Being, without Beginning, and Infinite,</hi> Gr. Myſtery, p. 68, 9<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I anſwer in G.

               </p>
               <p>Now I appeal to the juſt Witneſs of God in every Conſcience, if this Adverſary was not very diſingenuous to take no notice of this Diſtinction: for, in ſhort, two things are in our Friend's words; <hi>firſt,</hi> That what comes from the ſame Spirit of Truth, is of the ſame Authority; and who denies that? no body that is in his ſenſes. <hi>Next,</hi> That what is ſpoken by the immediate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Life and Power of the Spirit, is of more Authority (that is, Force and Efficacy to move, quicken, enliven or operate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hearers) then the bare reading of a Chapter in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially by ſuch as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, as a Letter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give that Impreſſion which we may juſtly ſuppoſe the lively Preſence, Mind and Voice of the Perſon that writ it might.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43652:10"/>
But the End of our Adverſary plainly is this, to make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the Truth of the Scripture, and to debaſe the Authority of the Scripture with relation to its Verity; as if what was ſaid now by the Spirit of Truth in any godly Man, were more true then that which was ſpoken by the ſame Spirit in former ages, which is a groſs ſuggeſtion. The difference lying in theſe two things; <hi>

               <p>I anſwer, There was never any ſuch man a <hi>Quaker</hi> that I know of, nor did ever any owned by us utter ſo horrid a Blaſphemy; we deteſt allſuch Impiety: beſides, the ſtory I ſuppoſe came out of an idle Pamphlet, printed about ſeven years ſince by a fooliſh Perſon in <hi>London,</hi> to get Money; a Fiction like to that of the <hi>Iſland of Pines,</hi> &amp;c.

Paſſage; for either there is no ſuch thing as a Chriſt within, or if there be, there muſt be two Chriſts; or laſtly, it is the ſame Chriſt that ſuffered without, which is alſo crucified by ſin within. Now I leave our Adverſary to chuſe which of theſe three he will accept of. Is there no Chriſt within? or is there two Chriſts, one within, and another without? or is there but one Chriſt both without and within? chuſe him whether. But I would tell our Adverſary, that a Chriſt was revealed in <hi>Paul,</hi> and forming in the Hearts of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and was in <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 19.</note> the holy Antients the Hope of Glory, and ſo he is in his People in this day, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.

It was both Chriſt's Promiſe and Prayer; for ſayes he to his Diſciples, Let not your Hearts be <note place="margin">John 14. 1, 3, 18, 19, 20.</note> troubled; ye believe in God, believe alſo in me. I will not leave you comfortleſs, I will come to you, I will come again. Yet a little while and the World ſeeth me no more, but ye ſee me: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo: At that day ye ſhall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. That Chriſt prayed for this Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is as clear; Neither pray I for theſe alone, <note place="margin">Chap. 16. 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26.</note> but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us, that the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me: and the Glory which thou gaveſt me I have given them, that they may be one even as we are one. I IN THEM, and they in me, that they may be made perfect in one: And that the World may know, that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me.

thee, but I have known thee, and theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me; and I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it, that the Love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, and I IN THEM.</p>
               <p>This is the Bleſſedneſs of the Righteous, even in this World, the true Diſciples of Jeſus, that forſake all for his Name, that take up his Croſs daily to their <note place="margin">Matthew 10. 38. <hi>Chap</hi> 16. 24.

that the Writings of the Prophets (becauſe <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>that the Prophets have anounced and declared the Goſpel)</hi> are the Goſpel in our Adverſaries account, if he receives <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that lived ſoon after.

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, That this Adverſary miſgives his words, and ſuggeſts by thoſe he cites another thing then is plainly and honeſtly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by G. F. in his own words; they are theſe, <hi>And to you that tempt God and ſay, The Lord give us a ſight of our Sins;</hi> mark, he ſpeaks to thoſe that tempt God, and let me add, mock God too; for to ſuch he ſpeaks, as what follows declares, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Prieſts and People (ſayes G. F.) does not the Light which Chriſt hath enlightned you with, let you ſee your Sin? that Lying and Swearing, Curſed Speaking, Theft, Murder, Whoredom, Covetouſneſs, Pride, Luſt and Pleaſures, all theſe things to be the Works of the Fleſh and Fruits of Darkneſs? Mark now, this Light within you lets you ſee it, ſo you need not tempt God to give you a Sight of your Sins; for ye know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and waiting in the Light, Power and Strength will be given to you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, let the Impartial judge if the Conſequence of theſe words be, <hi>That we muſt not pray to God to give us a ſight of our Sins that we don't ſee,</hi> which muſt be our Enemies ſuggeſtion or nothing, or not rather, that we ſhould not tempt and mock God <hi>by praying for a ſight of our ſins, whileſt we ſee, and that there is not a forſaking of the ſins that we do already ſee.</hi> I ask, Does it follow, that becauſe we ſhould not tempt or mock God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a ſight of the ſins we have a ſight of, and yet don't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, that therefore we muſt not pray to God for a ſight of thoſe ſins that we have no ſight of, having firſt renounced thoſe we have had a ſight of? Well, the Lord keep our Lives out of the Power of a Jury that would take this Latitude of Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The following words of that good man are theſe, and very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury and Chriſtian they are; <q>For they that wait upon the Lord, their ſtrength ſhall be renewed (but for what, if not to</q>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:43652:13"/>
forſake ſin, and ſerve the Lord God) <q>and living in the Light, and walking up to God, it will bring you to true Hunger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs, that you may receive the Bleſſing from God, and give over tempting of God to give you a ſight of your ſins. And why? becauſe you ſee more then you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake;</q> forſake what you ſee, before you pray for more ſight; for all ſuch Prayer in ſuch Diſobedience is a meer Mockery, and God will not be mocked: and be <note place="margin">Pſalm 109. 7. Prov. 28. 9. Iſa. 1. 13, 14, 15.</note> it known to all, that God has determined not to hear the Prayers of the Wicked; for they are, ſayes the Prophet, an Abomination unto him. This yet appears to be his ſenſe by the following Paragraph; <q>And to all ye that ſay, God give us Grace and we ſhall refrain from our Sin; there ye have got a tempting cuſtomary word; for the free Grace of God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men, and this is the Grace which ſhews you Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and Worldly Luſts: Now, thou that liveſt in Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Lying, and Swearing, and Theft, and Murder, and Drunkenneſs, and Filthy Pleaſures, and luſting after the World, thou art he that turns the free Grace of God into Wantonneſs, and caſts his Laws behind thy back, and walkeſt deſpightfully againſt the Spirit of Grace. Oh vain man! yet thou canſt ſay, God is merciful, and live in thy Wickedneſs, paſſing on thy time without the Fear of God, ſporting thy ſelf in thy Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What think you now? Does this man ſay, the people ought not to pray for a ſight of their ſins, which they ſee not in order to Repentance, or can he mean ſo? let Candor ſpeak. For that I ſaid before muſt be the meaning of this Adverſary, or he means nothing, becauſe in the other ſenſe all muſt grant that men ought not to tempt, provoke and mock God by praying for a fight, when they have it and don't uſe it. What then is the Concluſion of this Matter? why plainly this, that from G. F. ſaying, that <hi>thoſe who ſay the Lord give us a ſight of our ſins, that have a ſight of them already and forſake them not, do therein tempt God:</hi> This Enemy of ours, makes no ſcruple of Conſcience to infer and conclude that G. F.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43652:13"/>
ſays, that <hi>we ought not to pray to God to give us a ſight of our ſins at all,</hi> without any regard to the Diſtinction of having the <hi>ſight</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, be it that ſuch have forſaken what God has given them a ſight of, or that they have Sins they have yet no ſight of, yet G. F. ſays, we muſt not pray for a ſight of our ſins, if this Adverſary may be credited. Well, the Lord God Almighty, who is the Searcher of all Hearts, knows the end of this Perſon in writing and ſpreading theſe Calumnies and Perverſions, and with him I leave him and his Work, but ſo, as that I ſincerely deſire, that he may have a ſight of his ſin againſt God and an harmleſs People, if he acts ignorantly; and that he may ſincerely repent, and find Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the Lord, if he acts maliciouſly, before he goes bence and be no more ſeen; for its not a ſleight thing to miſcharge, and that ſo peremptorily too, an entire People, about matters of the World that is without end.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Defence with theſe three things, the firſt is, that moſt of the Opinions he calls ours are not ſo evinced, or ſo much as attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be proved by the Author of the Libel againſt us. 2dly, Thoſe that are endeavoured to be faſtened on us, have not their due proof, one Perſon it may be is produced to make good a Charge againſt a Body of People; would our Adverſaries be thus uſed? would they be concluded by the Word or Act of any one Member of their numerous Communion? certainly no: Beſides, the Proofs that are brought, are ſome lame, others perverted, and ſome forged, which looks very diſhonourable on the part of our Accuſer, firſt to miſ-charge, then miſ-cite, and laſtly wrack words, well intended, to extort, if poſſible, a Conſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of guilt: but the truth is, Error can only be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Error, and therefore there is no wonder in the caſe. This is the Uſage we have moſtly met with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43652:14"/>

               <p>Laſtly, I do hereby offer a fair and free Conference with the Author or Authors of the Libel, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that can ſoberly pretend to a Conſcientious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction about our Faith or Practice, at ſuch time as ſhall be mutually agreed upon to be convenient.</p>
               <p>And this I offer, not out of Vanity or Oftentation, but in Duty to God my great Lord and Maſter, and in good will to all ſuch Perſons; and did not theſe Conſiderations prevail, and carry me to this Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention, my manifold Affairs and the many and large Books I have already writ on occaſion of theſe and the like Imputations, would have diſſwaded me from any freſh undertaking of this nature, and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded me againſt all Reflections upon my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
