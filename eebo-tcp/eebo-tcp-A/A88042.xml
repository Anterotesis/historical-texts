         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Can the Viſion therfore faile, and you not be in danger to periſh? It is the boldneſſe of Gods Meſſengers, and the late
enlargement of their bounds, that now enrageth nefarious and Malevolent perſons. That the Law may not be your Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

Councell, the Councell of Parliament: yea, I wiſh they may not (if they have not) prevailed with Him to take up Armes
againſt thoſe, who are and will ever be found to be his Loyall Subjects: But what meaneth the ſounding of the Trumpets,
and the ſtriking up of Drums in ſeverall Counties, by vertue of his Majeſties Commiſſion, if Warre was not intended in
this our Nation? It may be you are, or ſhortly will be ſent unto, for Men, Moneys, Horſe, and other Warlike Ammunition,
and if not to beare at leaſt to lend your Armes, which you have provided for the good of your Countries, that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Defence of his Majeſty, and the maintenance of your own Peace they may be borne by others. It is not his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
but his Majeſty miſinformed, that calls for this from you, not himſelfe, but his ill affected Councellors and the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
who follow them at the heeles, and (as it may be thought) many of them, not only criminous, but of deſperate For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
deſiring through the Sea of your blood to ſwimme to their <hi>hoped haven</hi> that put him on upon theſe ſtrange and unheard

take heed what you doe, you have cauſe to Feare, not to Confide, and if to Confide, not in a Prince carryed away by
private Councell, but in the great Councell of State, that Councell is his Majeſties; they were Summoned by his own Writ;
They are yours; they came together by your own Election; ſhould you doe contrary to their Advice, you would deſert both

come not out to helpe Them, much more if you ſhould goe forth or ſend any Force againſt them. The Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
intend nothing but Loyalty to his Majeſtie, and the continued and continuall preſervation of your Safety: Therfore
helpe them with your Prayers, neither let your Eſtates and Lives be deare unto you for their ſakes; and ſee that you lift not
up a hand againſt them, leaſt you be ſound fighters againſt the <hi>Lord.</hi> Defend his Majeſties Royall perſon to the laſt droppe
of blood in your Veines; maintaine his Dignity, with the priviledge of Parliament, with the hazard of your Lives; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according as you lately Proteſted, endeavour to bring all underminers of Church and State to condigne puniſhment.
Goe not out of your Counties, but defend them and your Selves. Lend not your Armes, leaſt being naked you be beaten
with your own Weapons. Take my advice, you may come to prevent Dangers. It is the advice of a Friend, and of one
that is a Loyall Subject to his Majeſtie; therfore let his promonition be a premunition to you all.</p>
