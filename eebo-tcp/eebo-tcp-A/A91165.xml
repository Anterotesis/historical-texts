         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Two Engliſh Gentlemen of quality (one of them
of mine acquaintance) travelling out of <hi>England</hi> into
<hi>France</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1658. and hiring a veſſel for their paſſage,
three ſtrangers (who came from <hi>London)</hi> deſired leave to

one of them at leaſt, to be a Jeſnit, by his diſcourſe;
and during their ſtay at <hi>Paris, ſaw all three of them there
walking often in the Streets in their Jeſuits habits.</hi> In <hi>Auguſt</hi>
following, they being at <hi>Angiers</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> there repaired
to their lodging an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> in his <hi>Friers</hi> weeds, who
informed them, <hi>That he was an Engliſhman by birth, but a
<hi>Dominiean Freet by profeſſion,</hi> newly come from</hi> Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
<hi>in</hi> Sapin, <hi>and bound for</hi> England; <hi>that he had been at</hi>
Rome, <hi>where he had left ſome goods with an <hi>Iriſh Ieſuit,</hi> who
promiſed to return monies on them in</hi> France, <hi>but had failed to
doe it; whereupon he was in preſent diſtreſs for mony to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport
him to</hi> England, <hi>deſiring their favour to furniſh him with
monies, which he would faithfully repay in</hi> London, <hi>and if
they had any Letters to ſend to their friends in</hi> England, <hi>he
would ſee them ſafely delivered.</hi> The Gentlemen finding
him to be an excellent <hi>Scholar of very good parts and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
entertained him 5. or 6. daies at their lodging, till
they could furniſh him with monies, and upon his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115455:18"/>
as a <hi>Freer,</hi> had a very good intertainment in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
at <hi>Angiers</hi> by the Freers thereof: During his ſtay
there they had much diſcourſe with him: He told them
he had been formerly a Student in <hi>Kings College</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi>
after that at <hi>Salamanca</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> for 8. years. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demanded by them, <hi>Whether there were not many Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
and Freers then in</hi> England? He aſſured them upon
<hi>his own knowledge, <hi>they had then above five hundred Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
in London and the Suburvs; and that they had
at leaſt four or five Ieſuites and Popiſh Prieſts in and
about London, to every Miniſter we had there.</hi>
               </hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they demanding of him; <hi>How ſo many Jeſuites and
Prieſts were there maintained?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>That the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
and every Order of Fréers had their ſeveral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers
in London, who by Orders from their Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
furniſhed them with what ever Monies they wanted
by Bills of Exchange returned to them; <hi>That all the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
and Prieſts in</hi>
               </hi> England <hi>were maintained according to
their reſpective qualities; <hi>A Lords Son, like a Lord, and
a Knights Son like a Knight;</hi> and if they chanced to meet
him in</hi> London <hi>at their return, though he were now in a poor
weed, they ſhould find him in Scarlet, or Pluſh, &amp; a better equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
than what he was in.</hi> He would not diſcover his true
name to them, but upon diſcourſe on a ſudden, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>His Cozen Howard in England,</hi> which made them
ſuſpect he was of that family. He told them further;
<hi>that though we were very cunning in</hi> England, <hi>yet the Jeſuites
and Priests there were too crafty for us, lurking under ſo many
diſguiſes that they could hardly be diſcovered: That there was
but one way to detect them;</hi> which they being inquiſitive to
know. <hi>He ſaid, it was for thoſe who ſuſpected them to be Prieſts
to feign themſelves</hi> Roman Catholicks, <hi>and upon that account
to deſire the Sacrament from them, which they could not deny
to give them</hi> (after Confeſſion to them) <hi>being bound thereto
by Oath, by which means ſome of them had been betrayed.</hi> He
further informed them: <hi>That himſelf had been at all the

<hi>and that none of them came ſo near the</hi>

for a long ſeaſon</hi> Iſrael <hi>had been without the true God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a teaching Prieſt, and <hi>without Law?</hi>
               </hi> And why ſo?
The Apoſtle reſolves us in direct terms, 1 Tim. 1. 4. &amp;c.
<hi>The end of the Law is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good
conſcience, and of faith unfeined: from which ſome having ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
have turned aſide to vain jangling: deſiring to be teachers,</hi>
(yea Reformers) <hi>of the Law, <hi>underſtanding neither what
they ſay, nor what they affirm. But we know that the

the Law is not made for a righteous man; but for the <hi>lawleſs
