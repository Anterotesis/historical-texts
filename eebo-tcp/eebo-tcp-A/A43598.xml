            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After which victory the Land being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine setled in peace and quietnesse, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed their Captain <hi>Constantine,</hi> to the tower of <hi>Kaercegent,</hi> now called <hi>Cicester,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their former Covenants made with <hi>Aldroenus,</hi> saluted him as their Chiefe Lord So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne, and there crowned, him King, in the <note place="margin">Constantine King of the Britaines.</note> yeare of our blessed Saviours Incarnation, foure hundred and three and thirty.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57258:54"/>
forsaken of the greatest part of his followers and frinds, and quite sequestred from all Kingly honours, hee grew into a deepe and dumpish melancholy, delighting onely (if any delight can be taken therein) in solitude and want of company: to expell which sad fits from him, which might bee dangerous to impaire his health, he would devise for his recreation and disport many pleasant fancies to beget mirth and somtimes laughter, by solacing his eare with severall straines of Musique, both courtly and rurall; the sound heard, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not seen; as with the Harpe, Bag-pipes, Cimball, and Tabret: and sometimes again <note place="margin">Severall sports devised by <hi>Merlin</hi> to make the melancholy King merry.</note> with the Lute, Orphorian, Viall, Sackbut, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and Organs: then to recreate his eye, hee would present him with stately Masques and Anti-Masques, and againe, for variety sake with Rustick dances presented by Swains and Shepherdesses: and where these grew any thing stale or tedious to his eye or eare, he would take him up into the top of one of his turrets where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee should see Eagles and Hawkes fly after sundry Games, and what fowle the King liked, they would strike it into his lap, to adde unto his slender provision for dinner and supper, which gave the King no small contentment.</p>

               <p>But before I come to the opening of this Prophesie, which to the ignorant may appeare rather a ryming Riddle, then to be grounded on truth or reason, it is necessary that I looke back to where I late left, and proceed with the History which thus followeth: the King more extasied in the embraces of his sweet and desired Bedfellow, his souldiers without any commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by him granted, make a strange and terrible assault upon the other Fort, in which <hi>Gothlois</hi> was besieged, who being of an high and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty spirit, scorning to be long immured, and coapt up without making some expression of his magnanimity and valour, issued out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and with great rage and resolution sate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Campe, in hope with his handful of men, to have dislodged and rowted a multitude, but it fell out farre contrarie to his expectation, for in the hottest brunt of the first encounter, hee <note place="margin">The death of <hi>Gothlois</hi> Duke of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall.</hi>
                  </note> himselfe was slaine, and all his souldiers without mercy offered, or quarter given, most cruelly put to the sword: the Castle entred and sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the spoyle divided amongst the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p>Early in the morning before the King or the Countesse were ready in their wearing Habits and ornaments, some of the besieged who had escapt the Maslacre, bounced at the gates of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57258:59"/>
                  <hi>Tindagoll,</hi> and being known to be of the Dukes party, were received; who told the Porter and the rest, that they brought heavy news along, which they must first deliver to their Lady, of which shee having notice, and knowing they came from that Castle, caused them to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into her presence, and demanding of <note place="margin">News of the Dukes death brought to the Dutchesse.</note> them what news? They made answer, The ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings they brought was sad and disastrous, that the Fort was the precedent night, robustuously assaulted by the Enemy, whom the Duke her Husband valiantly encountred without the gates, that all their fellow souldiers were put to the sword, the Castle taken and rifled, and that the Generall her Lord and Husband, by his over hardinesse was the first man slain in the conflict: at the relation of the first part of their news, she seem'd wondrously disconsolate and dejected, but casting her eyes upon the King, shee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain somewhat solaced in the safety of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>They also when they saw the King taking <note place="margin">A just cause of their doubt.</note> him for the Duke their Generall, began to blush at their report of his death, being wondrously astonisht that him whom to their thinking they had left wounded and breathlesse in the field, they now see living and in health, musing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that they posting thither with so much speed should arrive thither before them being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of the admirable transformation that <hi>Merlins</hi> art had wrought upon them: In this anxiety and diversity of thoughts, the King,

so Knightly demeaned himselfe, that it proved to their great disadvantage: some say that King <hi>Stephen</hi> would have crowned his sonne in his life time, but the Clergie would not agree thereto, having a command from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the contrary, and therefore his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose tooke no effect.

               <p>This Prince (as the Chronicle describes him <note place="margin">The Kings Character.</note> to us) was somewhat high-coloured, but of a good aspect, and pleasant countenance, fat, full chested, and low of stature: and because hee grew somewhat corpulent, hee used a sparing and abstinent diet, and much exercised Hunting. He was well spoken, and indifferently learned,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57258:101"/>
Noble in Knighthood, and wise in counsaile, bountifull to strangers, but to his familiars and servants gripple-handed, and where hee loved once or hated, constant, and hardly to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: he had by his wife <hi>Eleanor</hi> six sonnes and three daughters: The names of five of them <note place="margin">His Issue.</note> were <hi>William, Henry, Richard, Godfery,</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> of which two came to succeed him in the Throne, <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> of the sixt there is small or no mention: the eldest of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hight <hi>Mawd,</hi> and was married to the Duke of <hi>Saxony;</hi> the second <hi>Eleanor,</hi> to the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> the third named <hi>Iane,</hi> to <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This King was prosperous in the beginning of his Raigne, but unfortunate in the end, as the sequell will make apparant: he was of such magnanimity and courage, that hee was often heard to say, that to a valiant heart, not a whole World sufficeth, and according to his words hee greatly augmented his Heritage, and much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">The Kings Dominions.</note> to his Dominions. For hee wonne <hi>Ireland</hi> by strength, and in the seventh yeere of his Reigne, (for divers affronts offered him by <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scotland)</hi> he made such cruell warre upon him, that in the end hee tooke him <note place="margin">He taketh the <hi>Scots</hi> King pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</note> prisoner, and compeld him to surrender into his hands, the City of <hi>Carlile,</hi> the Castle of <hi>Bamburch,</hi> the new Castle upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> with divers other holds, and a great part of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which <hi>William</hi> before had wonne from the Borderers. He likewise added the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57258:101"/>
to his owne, and from the South Ocean to the North Islands of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> hee closed all those Lands, as under one principall; which done, and receiving fealty and homage of the said King, having a certaine summe of money promist to bee payd unto him within nine moneths following, hee suffered him to goe at liberty.</p>
               <p>He spred his Empire so far, that none of all his <note place="margin">No King before him of such large Empire.</note> predecessours had so many Countries and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces under their Dominion and rule: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> he had at once in his possession, <hi>Normandy, Gascoine,</hi> and <hi>Guien, Anjou,</hi> and <hi>Chinou,</hi> with <hi>Alverne</hi> and others, and by his wife as her rightfull Inheritance, the <hi>Pyrene</hi> Mountaines, which part <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi> which proves

In his first yeare, Sir <hi>Thomas Seimour,</hi> the Kings unkle, brother to the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> being Lord high Admirall, by the Viz-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, called Sir <hi>Andrew Dudley,</hi> having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vessells but the Paunce and the Hart; and these singly manned, there was a great conflict at Sea with three tall <hi>Scottish</hi> ships (in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <note place="margin">Victory by sea.</note> Seas) doubly manned and trimmed with great Ordinance: notwithstanding which, hee tooke them, and brought them into <hi>Orwell</hi> Haven, where he had good booty, and store of prisoners.</p>
               <p>And the same yeare in <hi>August,</hi> the Lord Protector, the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> with the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and others, marcht with a noble Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not farre from <hi>Edenborrough,</hi> at a place called <hi>Mosselborrough,</hi>

                  </note> the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Hoasts met, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them was fought a sharpe and cruell battaile: in which in the end the <hi>English</hi> were victors, and in which were slaine of the <hi>Scots</hi> foureteene thousand, and prisoners taken of Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, to the number of fifteene hundred: This yeare also was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the Communion should be received in both kinds; and at that time <hi>Stephen Gardner,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> for opposing the same, was commanded to the Tower: Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gardner</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower.</note> also was given, to all the Curats of every parish Church throughout <hi>England,</hi> that no Coarse should be buryed before sixe a Clocke in the morning, nor after sixe at night: and that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57258:205"/>
when any dyed the Bell should ring three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre at least.</p>
               <p>In this Interim, the two great Dukes of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> and <hi>Suffolke, Dudly</hi> and <hi>Gray,</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately murmuring, and openly maligning, that <note place="margin">The two Dukes of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> and <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
                  </note> the Kings two Uncles should beare such great authority in the Kingdome: by which, their glories seemed not onely eclipsed, but quite darkned, the elder brother commanding the Land, the younger the Sea; the one Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, the other Lord High Admirall; so that the whole Dominion and Soveraignty of the kingdome (the kings name excepted) was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided betwixt them: And further considering, that it was in vaine for them to attaine to their owne ambitious ends, but by sundring this fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall tye, and unloosing this Gordian knot <note place="margin">Their plots gainst the Protector, and Admirall.</note> of Consanguinity, which had beene so long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably continued betwixt them: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore projected betwixt themselves, how this (almost impossible thing) might be brought to passe, and doubting the event, if they should attempt to worke by their servants, as to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them with Bribes, or the like: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tooke a nearer and more safe course to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it by their Wives, and to draw their balas from out of their owne bosomes: and <note place="margin">The Wives made themcans to betray the Husbands.</note> most successively to their purpose, thus it happened.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Seimer</hi> Lord High Admirall, having married the Queene Dowager, (whose good Fortune it was of all the rest of the kings
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57258:206"/>
wives to survive her Husband) contested with her sister in law for precedence and priority of place: to which the Protectors wife standing upon her prerogative, could by no meanes bee wonne to give way: This emulation betwixt the two sisters, fitly sorting to the Dukes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, (for the one challenged the right hand, as once being Queene, and the other claimed it, as wise to the present Protector:) To this new kindled fire, the two Dukes bring fuell, <hi>Dudly</hi> incourageth the one secretly, <hi>Gray</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther privately, so that the Wives set the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands at oddes by taking their parts; so that by the instigation of those emulous and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Ladies, a mortall hatred grew betwixt the two brothers: insomuch, that in the third year of the King, the Admirall was questioned for the ill managing his Office, and sundry Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles preferred in Court against him: so that he was condemn'd in Parliament, and his head <note place="margin">The death of the Lord high Admirall.</note> strooke off, the Protector his brother signing the Warrant for his death.</p>
               <p>The one being thus removed, there was the lesse difficulty to supplant the other; for in the same Month of <hi>February,</hi> in which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall lost his head, was the Protector com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower, by the Lords of the Counsaile, of which the two Dukes were chief, and many Articles of Treason and ill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the state commenced against him: but about a yeare after his confinement, by his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Lords, and intercession made for
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57258:206"/>
him by the K. upon the sixt of <hi>February</hi> hee was released, &amp; injoy'd his former offices &amp; honors: but all this was but a lightning before death, for his two great &amp; potent adversaries stil prosecute their malice against him: insomuch that not long after, calling him to a second account, when he had nobly acquit himself at the Barre of all treason objected against him, he was in the <hi>Guild Hall</hi> of <hi>London</hi> (not by a Iury of his peeres) by <note place="margin">The Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector put to death for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.</note> twelve men convicted and condemned of Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: for which, on a Scaffold on Tower-Hill, hee suffered death: verifying what was before spoken of the young King.

               <p>The second treason (of the like to which was never president) was the attempt to blow <note place="margin">The powder Treason.</note> up the Parliament house, in which because it was so long predicted, I could desire to bee the larger, but that it is of such late memory, and new in the mouthes of all men, and so shall (no doubt) continue to all posterity: the fatall day appointed for that horrid and most execrable fact was the fift of <hi>November,</hi> in the third yeare of his Majesties Reigne. The names of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators were <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> a principall Iesuite resident in <hi>England, Robert Catesby</hi> Gentleman, <hi>Francis Tresham</hi> Esquire, <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <note place="margin">The names of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note>

time, and think not slight of this advertisement, but retyre your selfe into your Country, where you may expect the event in safety, for though there be no appearance of any stir: yet I say, they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a terrible blow this Parliament, and yet they shall not see who hurt them: this counsell is not to be contemned, and can doe you no harme. For the danger is past, so soon as you have burnt the Letter, and I hope God will give you grace to make good use of it, to whose holy protection I commend you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this came unto him without date or name, in a counterfeit and unperfect hand, which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comming to the Kings hand, when none of the Counsell could sound the depth thereof, (though they were men of great wisdome and experience) His Majesty was the first that tooke notice of these words in this Letter, <hi>They shall</hi>

               <p>This Treason after broke into a practice of Rebellion, of which the circumstances are too large to stand upon: Diverse of them being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged in an House together, as they were dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wet powder, a blunt Miller let a coale fall amongst it, by which most of them were cruelly scorched, tasting themselves in some measure of that fire-plot prepared for others: <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> issuing out of the House were shot to death, and their heads set after upon the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment House, and their quarters upon the gates of <hi>Warwick:</hi> after them issued both the <hi>Wrights</hi> who were slain also, <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> hoping the <note place="margin">Those that were arraigned at Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> like fate was taken alive, these following were by an honourable Tryall arraigned at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
