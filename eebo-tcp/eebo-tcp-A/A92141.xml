         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

GODLY READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Subject of Divine Influences (Chriſtian
Reader) is moſt obvious to dayly practiſe,
but a path untrodden (I conceive) to the
travels of the pens of the godly and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Divines who have written practical
Divinity, That is called the pillar of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination,
which is indeed new and wilde Divinity to
ſome; But it's no other way new, then the new truſt which
the Lord hath put upon the Mediator Chriſt, whoſe it is to
loſe none, to bring many Children to Glory, to caſt none
away who comes to him, for grant an efficacious and ſtrong,
but ſweet and none compelling, yet a mighty drawing and
love-forcing violence and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus over the
proudeſt piece of the ſix days works of creation, to wit,
over mans free-will, ſo as inſuperably, and without a miſs,
he muſt drive his flock to their eternal green paſtours, and
overdrive none. And modeſt ſpirits, and ſuch as are in
love with truth, need not contend; for me, I ſhall deſire
none to be farther in love with the Lords ſtrong flection,
bowing and turning of mans will whitherſoever God will,
then we may ſave the holy and ſtrong dominion of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord, that he may have a more powerful maſtery
over the entrance of the free and contingent acts of the
will of men and Angels then the creatures themſelves have.
And reaſon would ſay that ſoveraigne and independent
former of all, <hi>of whom, through whom, for whom are all
things,</hi> Rom. 11. ſhould be above the clay. Hence theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory
conſiderations by way of preface.</p>
            <p>1. There cannot be a knocking without but there muſt be
hearing within, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. for the Lords knocking internal,
whether at firſt or renewed converſion, hath ſomething pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar,
<pb facs="tcp:119064:11"/>
as hearing and learning of the Father, <hi>John</hi> 5. 45.
hath ſomething of which a natural man is not capable,
and ſo hath inſtructing with a ſtrong hand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 11. If
Chriſt had ſpoken to the graves and corps neer to <hi>Lazarus</hi>
corps, <hi>Come forth,</hi> as he ſpeaks indefinitly to all in the Goſpel,
<hi>Come to me,</hi> believe in Chriſt; and rebuke ſuch as will not
come, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. yet all ſhould not be raiſed out of the
grave, as <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It's the ſame letter and ſound of gracious word that
comes to all the hearers, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. and to <hi>Lydia,</hi> but the
ſame heart opening of the ſpirit goes not along; as many
externally hear the noiſe of the report of Goſpel-tidings, to
whom the arm of the Lord is not revealed, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 13, 14.
it's better experiencedly to feel, then literally to ſearch how
the word is the chariot, the Spirit the driver of the chariot.</p>
            <p>2. Such as receive the ingraffed word, or the word and
Spirit, ſhall not much diſpute how or by what clift <hi>quâ rimâ</hi>
the Lord came in, here he is now, the word is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
the blind mans word, <hi>John 9. 25. one thing I know,
that whereas I was blind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now I ſee:</hi> is enough, though
ſome cannot write a chronicle, or tell the hiſtory, or aim, how
place, manner of their converſion.</p>
            <p>3. Some are troubled how Soveraignty of quickning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
in the gratious Lord, who quickens <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in
every duty, and withdraws his ſoveraign concurrence as he
beſt pleaſeth, can conſiſt with our debt of duty. It's ſafeſt to
look to duty and the commanding will to riſe up and be
doing, and not to dazle the wit with diſputing the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
of God, nor to enquire into his latent decreeing
will.</p>
            <p>4. A gracious heart is ſo taken up with care to pay the
rent of commanded duties, as he hath no leaſure to argue
why? and if the Lord had decreed to give me quickning
influences I ſhould not thus decline. The theſis of an heart
of unbelief is a more edifying them to diſpute againſt, and
to weep over, then to quarrel with, and agitate the queſtion
concerning the Lords withdrawing of his congruous applying
of the word to the heart, or his praeſcience and permiſſive
decrees: duty is mine, Soveraignty is his.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:119064:11"/>
5. Faith ſuppoſeth this truth, <hi>though ſaving influences
be wanting, and holy Soveraignty withdraw them for
reaſons far above the reach of Angels and mens capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
yet it is my ſin that I lay under unreſiſted dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
It may be aſſerted that it is a ſinful inclination in us
to make the high decree of God our Bible, and to be unwilling
to be ruled by the revealed will of God. So <hi>Evah</hi> was leſſe
willing to believe the revealed threatning (<hi>in the day
thou eateſt thou ſhalt die</hi>) and moſt bent to climb
up to a knowing ſtate with God; which the Lord in his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atent purpoſe and decree did deny to man. So the divels
quarrel is not with their own apoſtaſie, but with the holy
Lords diſpenſation; <hi>art thou come</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to
torment us? and (which is another fault) <hi>before the time?
Matth.</hi> 8. 29. nor can we move queſtions concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and deep diſpenſations of God, but we muſt fall upon
the Almighty to defend our own ſin; the damned in hell
eternally rail againſt the decrees of holy and ſpotleſs juſtice,
and his decrees of giving to them life and being, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
to them the benefit of death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 15, 16. but as they
blaſpheme the God of heaven becauſe of their pains, ſo they
never repent of their deeds, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 11.</p>
            <p>6. It's ſafe ſailing in declining of rocks; when we adore
the Lords withdrawing of influences, and juſtifie him, and
bewail our own ſinful choice, and condemn our ſelves: in the
<hi>Pſal. 51. David,</hi> and in the confeſſion <hi>Daniel, c. 9. Ezra</hi> 9.
the humbled people of God do not hint at any heart wreſtling
with the decree of God, but only bewail their own rebellion,
and not <hi>hearkening to the voice of the prophets,</hi> and deſire
to ſit patiently and in ſilence in their lot of ſuffering, and
reproach and ſhame. It is true, they complain, <hi>Lam. 3. 13.
He hath cauſed the arrow of his quiver to enter into my
reins; but yet they believe, 24. the Lord is my portion,
ſaith my ſoul, therefore will I hope in him.</hi> And 2. they
check unbelieving complaining, 39. <hi>Wherefore doth a
living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his
ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. It cannot be conceived how a ſoul in guiltineſs muſt be in
a caſe of invincibly neceſſitated deſpair, if he conceive and
<pb facs="tcp:119064:12"/>
believe the Lord gave me a power to will or not to will free
from all divine determination, and before any act of his
foreknowledge or decree, I was finaly and wilfully to reject
the Phyſitian Chriſt, and this the Lord did foreknow, but
could not efficaciouſly hinder; what place can be left for
conſolation in God, or ſubmiſſion to the holy will of God, for
this was invincibly to come to paſs, before any act of his will
or praeſcience.</p>
            <p>8. Nor can I pray in faith, <hi>Lord, encline my heart unto
thy teſtimonies:</hi> if the voluntary determination of my own
heart to his holy teſtimonies, or the wicked vital refuſing
to yield unto, or to be led by his teſtimonies, go before the act
of the Lords knowledge or will, or before any efficacious,
congruous, internal and victorious drawing of me to Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>9. It cannot be denied but this very way which the Lord
hath taken in denying of his influences to the eternal ſtanding
of <hi>Adam,</hi> and to law-doing and law-living is the moſt
excellent courſe, and that fleſh and blood dare not to appear
to countermand herein either infinite wiſedom, or admirable
ſoveraignty.</p>
            <p>For 1. The Law-heaven the Garland, the crown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Law-merit ſhould have been a paradiſe where there
is no tree of life, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. no river of water of life, no
Lamb which is in the midſt of the throne, to feed and to lead
them to the fountain of living waters, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 17. yea, it
ſhould be darker and a leſs glorious heaven then the Goſpel-heaven.</p>
            <p>For 2. There ſhould have been there no new heaven nor
new earth, no chair of eſtate, no high lifted up throne for
the power of the Kings of the earth, who hath loved us, and
waſhen in his blood.</p>
            <p>Nor 3. Should there have been any new ſong, nor any
ſuch redeemed Muſitians, who ſing with a loud voice, as
<hi>Rev. 5. 12. Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive
power and riches, and wiſedom, and ſtrength, and honour,
and glory, and bleſſing:</hi> and what an heaven ſhould that
be that wants the faireſt roſe in that garden? it ſhould be
only the heaven of God Creator, which though glorious, yet
<pb facs="tcp:119064:12"/>
not ſo kindly nor ſo deſirable to us, wanting the ſavour and
delicious ſmell of the man Chriſt, head of men and Angels.</p>
            <p>4. Nor can there be more lovely Chriſtians then that great
and fair myſtical body of the ranſomed of the Lord; the
lovely company that are before the throne, cloathed in white
with palms in their hands, in ſign of eternal victory; who
have come out of great tribulation, and have waſhen their
garments, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,
and with them their glorious head, ſo that here ſhall be
compleated and perfected Chriſt myſtical.</p>
            <p>It is boldneſs to weave a web of carnal difficulties againſt
the Lords holy providence; he hated the firſt ſin as he doth
all ſin, but to ſay he was weak and impatient about its
entrance in the world, blames his omnipotency, to ſay the
watchman of <hi>Iſrael was;</hi> as to all care and vigilance of
holy providence, ſleeping or ſlumbring, and was thoughtleſs
and drowſie, not valuing whether his noble Sons of creation,
Angels and men, ſhould fall, and irrecoverably and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
be broken, and become fewel for everlaſting fire, or
ſtand and be eternally happy, is injurious to infinite wiſedom,
and the perfection of his holy will, to ſay that the Lord loved
ſuch a gueſt as ſin, muſt blame his ſpotleſs holineſs: but if any
ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But did man by any neceſſity of a divine decree
ſin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A compelling neceſſity everting the creatures liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
there was none, but a neceſſity by which the man was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to one diſtinctively to ſtand or fall, not copulatively
both to ſtand and not to ſtand, to obey and diſobey, there
was in created free-will, if we ſuppone there had been no
decree. Now the holy decree brought no neceſſity, 1. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling,
ſuch as is of a man bound hand and foot. 2. No
natural neceſſity, ſuch as that of the Sun to give light, the
fire to caſt out heat. Nor 3. No bruitiſh neceſſity void of a
diſcourſing faculty, ſuch as that of the ſwallow building her
neſt, the Bee making honey; but we muſt ſay there was ſome
eminent, holy and ſpotleſs neceſſity of decree in Chriſts thrice
rather then ſeven times praying: why King <hi>Joaſh</hi> ſmites
the ground thrice and ſtays, and ſmites it not ſix times,
<pb facs="tcp:119064:13"/>
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 19. why the Lord writes in his booke, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.
16. ſuch a number of drops of rain, ſuch a number of drops
of ſnow to make up ſuch a treaſure; and God determined,
<hi>Job</hi> 38. 22. ſuch a number of pound weights of mountains,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 12. and it was neceſſary the Lord ſhould determine
the names and number of the Stars, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 4. and why
ten acres of a vineyard ſhould yield one bath, not two; why
every mans number of his months ſhould be determined by
the ſtatute of a divine decree, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>2. Nor wrong we the Lord, or free-will either, to ſay God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould be ſold by his brethren: <hi>David</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and reproached by <hi>Shimei: Judah</hi> carried away captive
by the <hi>Babylonians: Iſrael</hi> oppreſſed by the rod of God, the

Jeſus crucified by <hi>Herod, Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Jews.</hi> Otherwiſe
the Lord could yield no comfort in his word to the godly,
when oppreſſed by the wicked, but the like, <hi>Comfort not

the wicked, for I permitted theſe evils, but theſe cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities

               <hi>therefore ſtay your prayers to me,
and believe not that I can avert theſe evils.</hi> Here is a
moſt curſed neceſſity which our adverſaries lay on God, while
as they would eſchew an holy, harmleſs, and moſt wiſe neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. But by the adverſaries way it follows that there
is a foregoing reaſon why the will of <hi>Adam</hi> made choice
of that ſinful act becauſe God predeterminated the will
thereunto, and the reaſon of the firſt omiſſion, or not
conſideration in <hi>Adam,</hi> or his ſleepineſs, is <hi>ob defectum
praedeterminationis divina,</hi> becauſe of the defect of divine
praedetermination. Therefore becauſe (2.) God withdrew
his actual influence of praedetermination, it was no more
in the dependent power of <hi>Adam</hi> to obey that, <hi>Eat not,</hi>
then the Sun can move when God draws away his actual
influence, ſo muſt the original of ſin be reduced on God.
<hi>So ſtrange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:119064:13"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A reaſon <hi>ratio</hi> why any man ſins, is, in good
Grammer, <hi>a moral motive inducing a man to ſin,</hi> and
that works by way of perſwaſion. Let not the Reader be
perſwaded that we teach that the real influence of God, or
that his holy concourſe any way is a moral motive of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or of ſin, as if <hi>Adam</hi> had been perſwaded to ſin becauſe
he ſaw and felt the Lord did firſt withdraw his concourſe or
influence whither it praedeterminate or move by praedeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
or collateral joyning, therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was morally
induced to ſin; this is a goodly dream.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ratio,</hi> a reaſon here muſt be taken for a <hi>phyſical and
a reall,</hi> not <hi>a morall cauſe;</hi> now the adverſary abſtained
from the word cauſe.</p>
            <p>And 1. we ſay <hi>Adam</hi> not through defect or want of the
Lords holy praedetermination, as if therefore, <hi>ideo,</hi> for that
cauſe he ſinned, becauſe the Lord did withdraw his influences;
but the adequate, culpable moral cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinning, and
of his choſing of a vitious action (for <hi>Adam</hi> in ſinning is only
and properly a moral cauſe under a law) is his own free-will,
freely declining from the rule; there is no defect or moral
want of Gods praedetermination, becauſe the ſoveraign Lord,
who is above a law, was not obliged to joyn his praedeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
influence to <hi>Adam,</hi> but rather obliged to withdraw
his praedetermination from the man, who in the ſame moment
of time was willing to want that praedetermination; for God
out of holy ſoveraignty withdraws in the ſame moment his
influence, in which <hi>Adam</hi> ſinfully rejects the ſame influence.</p>
            <p>3. This Adverſary, if he would turne the word <hi>ratio,
reaſon,</hi> into the word <hi>cauſe,</hi> or <hi>concurrence,</hi> would ſee
himſelf at a loſs; it will follow that the cauſe why <hi>Adam</hi>
ſinned, is becauſe God denied his cauſative concurrence, and
ſo the Argument ſhall hurt his cauſe; for the concurrence of
God is cauſative, then muſt the Lords withdrawing of his
concurring influence be the collateral cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
except he ſay that man hath in his power the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of God, and if ſo, <hi>Adam</hi> and all mens free-will muſt
be Lord of omnipotency and omnipotent concurrences, and
then why but God muſt rather make prayers and requeſts to
our free-will to incline and move his omnipotency to concur
<pb facs="tcp:119064:14"/>
to acts of obedience, then free-will ſhould make prayers to
God that he ſhould by his grace incline our hearts to his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies.
2. Muſt not the created free-will of man by this be
placed in the royal ſeat and throne of divine providence, to
domineer over and diſpoſe of all free acts of obedience and
diſobedience as it ſeems good to the Creature? And (3.) ſo
muſt the ſoveraign King be Lord of all free acts at the ſecond
hand, with the good leave of created free-will. And (4.)
the number of all free actings of final obedience and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and of the ſaved and damned, muſt be in the hand
of created free-will, and that primarily, and ſo in the crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tures
power muſt be the Book of Life; firſt by way of free
determination, and with the Lord and the Lamb the Book of
Life is but as a ſecond copy, and a conditional roll, containing
ſo many as the creature firſt determines. (5.) And ſo muſt
our Immanuel, God manifeſted in the fleſh, ere he can get en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
in the world, have a paſs ſubſcribed by free-will, and
God ſhall come in the fleſh and be Mediator and King ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,
as man will, it's not then eternal love who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
the medicine, and the Phyſitian before ever the man
was ſick; and if free-will had ſo pleaſed, Chriſt God man
ſhould have been holden out of the world, and the gates for
ever cloſed on him, ſo as knock as he pleaſeth, free-will might
have refuſed to open and let him in. (6.) Experimental
grace and pardoning mercy might have ſtood afar off, and
loſt man never have taſted thereof, yea ſuch riches of grace
ſhould never have been in the world. (7.) Mans free-will,
if it be the only determiner of it ſelf and his own free acts;
and if the ſtrong dominion of grace, for fear of ſtrangling
of liberty created, had no determining power, might well
have ſent that ſaving Redeemer back to heaven again to his
Father, and none of mankind ſhould ever have received
Chriſt, taſted of his precious love, his ſweet promiſes, and the
offered ſalvation; for created free-will is ſuch as may nill,
will, refuſe, let God decree and allure, draw, move, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
as he can or will, yet omnipotency of grace cannot raviſh
free-will. (8.) Yea, ſuch is free-wills nature that by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
ſelf-determination, the holy Ghoſt in all his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
attractions, in the emanations and flowings of love, which
<pb facs="tcp:119064:14"/>
is ſtronger then death, his ſtrong and powerful breathings,
and mighty drawings, by a power not inferiour to that which
raiſed Chriſt from the dead, may be fruſtrate and broken, for
free-will may ſtand out as a rock of iron and adamant
againſt the ſtrong actings of omnipotent grace, and be not a
whit moved at the perfume and ſweet ſmelling ointments of
Chriſt, his beauty, the refreſhments of the houſe of wine, his
tendereſt conſolations. (9.) For if free-will ſay not <hi>Amen,</hi>
though Chriſt work compleatly his work, make his ſoul an
offering for ſin, yet ſhall not Chriſt ſee his ſeed, nor be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with his wages, for free-will may refuſe to yield the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
over to God, as captives overcomed by his ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting,
and powerful drawings. (10.) Nor ſhall it be in
the power of the Almighty to be faithfull and true in fulfilling
his promiſe of giving a new heart to the elect, <hi>Jer. 31. 31.
Ezech. 36. 26. Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 9, 10. for though the Lord of free
grace give, wicked free-will may refuſe to receive the new
heart. (11.) The faithfulneſs and power of God, interpoſed
in the promiſe of perſeverance, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 4. Joh. 10. 27, 28.
1 Pet. 1. 5. Jude</hi> v. 24. <hi>Eph. 5. 25, 26, 27. Iſa. 54. 10. Iſa. 59. 20, 21.
Jer.</hi> 32. 39, 40. muſt be broken, if free-will may reſile from
God, and diſanul and reſiſt all the actings of God in bringing
many ſons to glory. 12. There can be no place to infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
free grace, pardoning mercy; to the merits of Chriſt
in dying to bring us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. in delivering and

grace, mercy, are effectually experienced in ſinners, if
it be in free-wills independent power to admit or reject the

betwixt the Lords granting of effectual grace to any one ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to another, from his abſolute dominion, will, and
differencing grace and predeterminating grace.</p>
            <p>4. Since the Adverſaries grant that the concurrence of God
to the entitative act of ſinning is cauſative, they are obliged
to roll away the ſtone, and to clear to us how the Lord is not
as well by their way the joynt and collateral cauſe of ſin (hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
be his Name) as he is the praedeterminating cauſe (as
<pb facs="tcp:119064:15"/>
is pretended) by our way;<note place="margin">See <hi>Rivetn.</hi> in Cath. ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxo tom. 2. Q 6. tract. 4. n 33. Meratins tom. 1. tract. de bonitate &amp; mal. hum. acta. diſpu. 11. ſc. 7. n. 4.</note> for <hi>Franciſ. Silevias, Lo. Meratins,</hi>
Schoolmen not to be deſpiſed, with reaſon ſay, If he be the
cauſe of theft who concurs, and conſents, and helps a man to
climb in at a window to ſteal, no leſs then he who praedeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the man to ſteal by either command or counſel, or then
by reall efficiency, then muſt the holy Lord be judged the cauſe
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt act of ſinning, as it is an act, both the one way
and the other.</p>
            <p>5. Neither does the concurrence or non-concurrence either
way hurt the natural way of free-wills working,<note place="margin">Strangius.</note> though the
Author make out-crys, O here be three neceſſities; what if
there be four or ten? the Author well knows the learned of
both ways teach there be divers neceſſities that hurt not freew ill.</p>
            <p>6. Neither is it to be forgotten that the Lords ſaving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
to bring the Elect to glory, is of an higher and more
excellent nature then the influence of God to <hi>Adam:</hi> For that
influence to <hi>Adam</hi> was 1. connatural, and not the fruit of
Chriſts merit, as are ſaving influences in Chriſt. 2. That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
to <hi>Adam,</hi> was not given to <hi>Adam</hi> as praedeſtinated to
obtain the Law-reward of life. I judge <hi>Adam</hi> was not prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate
to any ſuch Law-life, but to obtain life and pardon
in the ſatisfactory death of Chriſt. Nor 3. was that influence
given to <hi>Adam</hi> in order to perſeverance, for perſeverance
was commanded indeed to <hi>Adam,</hi> but it was neither promiſed
of God to him, nor was it ever in the purpoſe or decree of God
to beſtow it on him; therefore Gods influence to <hi>Adam</hi>'s obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
muſt be a far lower and weaker cauſality then the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
influences of Chriſt. It was ſaid by me, <hi>that God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
his influence from</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>am, <hi>who in the ſame moment
was willing to want it; not that</hi> Adam <hi>formally refuſed
it, but that materially, interpretatively, and in his actual
conſenting to ſin he refuſed it.</hi> The Adverſary crys
out, but ſoft words and ſtrong and hard Arguments were beſt.
<hi>It is queſtioned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether</hi> Adam<hi>'s will to eat was

               <hi>or poſterior and
later then the denial, or at once (it is of no moment whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were at once in time) they dare not ſay before,
becauſe then</hi> Adam <hi>had ſinned before he ſinned; if his
will to eat be poſterior to the want of God's influence,
<pb facs="tcp:119064:15"/>
there is manifeſtly an antecedent neceſſity: therefore Dr.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Armini.</hi> in his collation <hi>with</hi> Junius could have made
this Argument ſtronger. But 1. The Lord by order of nature
withdraws his influence, and in the ſame moment of time
(which is of great moment) <hi>Adam</hi> ſins and refuſes the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
And it follows not that <hi>Adam</hi> ſins before he ſins, nor
follows it that <hi>Adam</hi> ſins by any neceſſity deſtructive to the
liberty of the will; yea, it is a neceſſity helping and aiding
freedome, becauſe the Lord withdraws no influence from <hi>Adam</hi>
againſt his will, but in the ſame moment of time that the Lord
withdraws his influence from <hi>Adam</hi> to the act, <hi>Adam</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws
his conſent to the act, &amp; virtually ſubſcribes to the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the influence of God. The Adverſary is moſt angry at the
diſtinction, as dark and not intelligible, and ſays it cannot be
taught the people:<note place="margin">Strangius de vol. &amp; Act. dei circa p. l. 2.</note> why? <hi>The want of the influence of God
by order of nature is before the virtual and interpretative
merit of wanting that influence; if the virtual merit be an
evil merit,</hi> malum meritum, <hi>or a ſin, ſo it muſt be poſterior,
and later then the want of Gods influence, and not before
it; but it is like a fiction, that there be two demerits in</hi>
Adams <hi>ſin, one culpable, another unculpable. Anſ.</hi> 1. It is ſtill
ſaid by me, that the want of divine influence, by order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is before <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin. 2. It is not theologically ſpoken, that
the merit of ſin <hi>reatris penae</hi> is ſin or evil; it's a fiction that
the merit of ſin is either culpable or unculpable, it's rather
good, and an obligation to wrath, and a conſequent of ſin, and
is not ſin. No merit of reward is either formally obedience,
but poſterior to obedience; nor is a merit or demerit of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is formally ſin, but poſterior to ſin. Chriſt is liable to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for our ſins, and as an ingaged ſurety <hi>debet puniri</hi>
ought to be puniſhed for our ſins that were laid on him, <hi>Iſa.
53. 6. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Gal.</hi> 3. 13. but there was formally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently
no ſin in Chriſt, nor any evill, or any thing culpable
in Chriſt. 3. <hi>Adam</hi>'s virtual conſenting to want the influence
of God was his very firſt ſin formally; he who refuſes to ſtand,
and wilfully falls, he virtually refuſes a ſtaff or a pillar to lean
upon; he who formally wanders, he virtually hates his guide
<pb facs="tcp:119064:16"/>
and leader; he who formally loves darkneſs, and practically
walks therein, he virtually hates light, and deſires virtually
that the light ſhould not have ſhined on him; and ſo he who
willingly falls, and willingly ſhu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s his eyes, virtually deſerved
the ſtaff ſhould have been taken from him, and that the Sun
ſhould not have ſhined on him; he who willingly wanders out
of the way, doth virtually deſerve to be depraved of his guide;
and who ſo wanders are ſaid to deſpiſe the word of the Lord
their guide and rule. So here is no fiction, but evident truth,
<hi>Adam</hi> in the very act of ſinning deſerved, becauſe he ſinned,
that God ſhould have withdrawn his influence, but it was a
virtual deſerving, and formally a ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If for this reaſon <hi>Adam</hi> interpretatively put away
divine influence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Strangius,</hi> ib.</note> ſo that the fault is imputed to him, not to
God; it would ſeem by that ſame reaſon <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively
will and deſire the predeterminating influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God to a godly act of obedience; and ſo a godly
and pious work ſhould be aſcribed to man and not to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The virtual demerit is not the adequate cauſe why
the ſin is aſcribed to <hi>Adam,</hi> but the actual crooking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating
of the mind, will and affections from God, as the true
neereſt cauſe, eſpecially ſince <hi>Adam</hi> is under a Law not to ſin,
nor to refuſe virtually the Lords influence; and becauſe the
Lord is under no Law to give influences, his free withdrawing
can never make the ſin to be imputed to God, for God doth
nothing <hi>contra debitum</hi> in withdrawing his influence, but
<hi>Adam</hi> againſt a law virtually rejects the influence, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
ſins. So there is no reaſon why the good work ſhould
not be aſcribed to God for power to act, to wit, the image of
God, and actual acting are his free gift; but a power of ſin
and actual ſin are wholly from us, only not from God at all;
I ſpeak of the power formal to ſins, which is a crookedneſs of
power, ſuch as is a power to blindneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Whereas they ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> materially and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively
in the effect wants the praedeterminating influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God. I ask whether they underſtand the effect and
material and interpretative conſent or the formal and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
actual conſent, if the former be ſaid, it is a ridiculous
clavering, for they ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> deſired interpretatively
<pb facs="tcp:119064:16"/>
and materially to want the influence of God <hi>quatenus in
ſe,</hi> as he deſired to want the influence of God, if the latter
be ſaid, the neceſſity of ſinning ſtands, for if God deny his
influence to one of the oppoſites, and giveth it to the other,
it is a neceſſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſtrength of our argument is that, that is
not to be imputed to <hi>Adam</hi> as ſin, which was both neceſſary
and inevitable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The argument is weake, for one and the ſame volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
act of conſenting to eat in <hi>Adam</hi> is referred to, 1. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the Law, <hi>thou ſhalt not eat,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. and it is
formaly a ſinful act contrary to the commandment.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Adam</hi> in this ſinful act of conſenting to eat did alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively
and virtually, and indirectly, not in an other
formal and diſtinct act, will and deſire to want the influence
of God, now no precept or law is laid upon <hi>Adam,</hi> or upon any
man, to have or to want the influence of God, whether it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinative
or collateral; only in acts of obedience, which
cannot be performed without that influence; in ſinful acts we
are to want the influence of God requiſite to the entitative act.</p>
            <p>2. No neceſſity is or can be inferred from Gods determining,
either in his decree or in his actual bowing and praedetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the will to one of the oppoſites, but ſuch whereby the holy
praedetermination of God inſinuates it ſelf ſweetly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
in the boſome of the elective power, without any ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or forcing of the light of the mind, and its indifferency,
or compelling the will to be carried to any other of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites
then the will it ſelf doth connaturally embrace.</p>
            <p>3. The way of Adverſaries deſtroys all eternal decrees in God,
under pretence of eſchewing a neceſſity; for by this from eternity
the will of God was looſe, lubrick, potential, disjunctive, and fixed
neither upon the breaking or not breaking the legs of Chriſt,
that was left to the free-will and decree of the Souldiers. So
God from eternity neither decreed nor determined the ſelling
of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or the not ſelling of him; nor the crucifying of
Chriſt, or the not crucifying of him; nor the believing of Jews
and Gentiles, or the free not believing, for had he put a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of a decree on one of the oppoſites, on <hi>believing</hi> rather
then on <hi>none-believing,</hi> he ſhould (ſay the Adverſaries) have
fixed all free action, under a fatal and Adamantine Law of
<pb facs="tcp:119064:17"/>
eternal and inexorable neceſſity, and ſo deſtroyed free-will;
but ſo God ſhould determine and order nothing in free and
contingent events, but commit all to free-will, and to contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
working cauſes. 2. All Gods wiſe decrees of free and
contingent events in every page almoſt of the Scripture, muſt
be utterly deſtroyed. 3. He could foretel nothing by free agents;
propheſies and predictions muſt periſh, for God could not ſay
from eternity, <hi>I ſhall afflict my people Judah by the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;
I ſhall impoveriſh Job, and ſpoil him by the Sabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
I will deliver to death my Son, to the death of the

deſtroy all contingency of ſecond cauſes, for God cannot (ſaith
<hi>Strangius</hi>) deny his influence to one of the oppoſites and give
it to the other but he muſt deſtroy freedom, then muſt he decree
to give his influences to both oppoſites, and ſo ſhould nothing be
determined from eternity which comes to paſs in time, ah,
providence, or fortune rather. 4. God ſhould will and decree
one of the oppoſites in time <hi>de novo,</hi> and every day, and he
ſhould will and do in time many things which he decreed not
to do from eternity, becauſe (ſay they) his will and decree was
from eternity fixed upon no contingent acts. 5. No wiſe man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
ſo his family, no General his Army, no Prince his Subjects,
if he be wiſe, and knowing (as the holy Lord is alknowing)
he taketh no counſel in <hi>Arena,</hi> but he forecaſteth and decreeth
things within the compaſs of power to do, before he doth
things, for to will all of hand and of new, without eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
fore-fixing of the will, caſts all the contingent acts of men
and Angels upon looſe uncertainties. 2. Make the only wiſe
God raſh and dubious. 3. Puts him to learn by experience new
things to day, and to will and decree them fixedly in time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which yeſterday and before the world was, he was not
fixed in his will to do determinatly any thing, for fear of fatal
neceſſity. For 4. God had either fixed a decree concerning

wrote and ordained fixedly all ſingle contingent things and
actions to their ends, and he muſt have foreordained perſons
to glory, and to free acts of faith and holineſs, and to the habit
of free actions, for if God fixedly ordained perſons to free acts,
he muſt have <hi>fixedly</hi> ordained theſe free acts, and ſo there muſt
be chains of neceſſity laid on free will and free acts as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
argue; if the latter be ſaid, the decrees of election
and reprobation muſt be faſt and looſe, as the free-will of men
beſt pleaſes: and indeed this Author makes this a third ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
that overturns freedom, <hi>for if reprobation</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>and the decree of declaring the Lords juſtice be before ſin,</hi>
then is there a ſtrong and unwarrantable neceſſity of ſinning
laid on men and Angels. But Proteſtant Divines, the ſoundeſt
of Papiſts, <hi>Auguſtine, Proſper, Hilarius, Fulgentius,</hi> and the
ſoundeſt Fathers, maintain a decree of paſſing by of non-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
a purpoſe of denying ſuch grace to multitudes; as if it
had been granted <hi>Eſau, Iſmael, Pharaoh, Cain,</hi> ſhould have
believed and been ſaved as well as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> but this
grace the Lord decreed to deny, becauſe the Potter doth and
may diſpoſe of the clay as pleaſeth him; <hi>Becauſe it is not in
him that wills and runs, but in God that ſhews mercy.</hi> 2.
Becauſe he hath mercy on whom he will, and hardens whom he
will, and yet he is juſt, and juſtly is angry at ſin; and that
ſtands as the objection of the carnal Pelagian in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time,
<hi>Rom. 9. 19. Thou wilt ſay, why doth he yet find fault? who
hath reſiſted his will?</hi> this is the very objection of this Author;
if the Lord decreed to deny effectually renewing grace to the
maſſes of reprobates clay, before they did good or ill, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could run and will, that is, <hi>ante &amp; citra peccati

to give it to others becauſe he will: why ſhould God

the counſel of the Lord ſhall ſtand. 3. The decree of God
<pb facs="tcp:119064:18"/>
compels no man to ſin, nor lays on men any neceſſity deſtructive
to liberty of ſinning or obeying freely. 4. Gods decree is
the cauſe of no mans falling or ſinning. 5. The eternal ruine
and final ſinning of Angels and men fell out by order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and time, before the decree and will of God, how could he
then help it? here is a ſtrong and a fatal neceſſity that God
could not break, but ſince a ſparrow falls not to the earth, and
is ſnared without the will of the Father of Chriſt, how can men
and Angels fall eternally without his will? O there is an
abſolute will of God, and a conditional will, without which ſin
fell not out (ſay they) but the conditional will is a name no
more, for God ſo ſhould have decreed ſuch things good and
evil ſhould be, after they were and had being, not to ſay that
it muſt be as unjuſt that God ſhould will ſins exiſtence after it
falls out as before it falls out, as to the Lords loving or any
commanding or approving thereof, or as to the point of ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the will to act ſin; yea, the holy Lord no more ſtrains
by decree and actual influence the will in acts of holy and
ſupernatural obedience, then in acts of ſin; and there is a
door opened to fatal neceſſity in neither, for the Lord trails
violently no children to glory, and compels by decree or prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination
none to the entitative acts in ſin, nor violently
drives he either divels or reprobate men to everlaſting fire;
it is ſafer to believe holy providence for the want of the faith
of an all-governing Lord muſt bring perpetual trepidation
and anxity of conſcience, trembling and fainting of heart,
and deſtroy and ſulvert all ſolid conſolation, lively hope,
conquering patience. O that we could pray and believe
more, and curiouſly diſpute leſs, and ſinfully fret not at all;
but ſay, <hi>O the depth!</hi> and pray, <hi>thy Kingdome come:</hi>

ſhould be ſaved by the Law: for grace, mercy, forbearance,
and the patience of God towards ſinners ſould for eternity,
have been hid from ſinfull man, if righteouſneſs and life
had been by the Law. But God intended that all men to

9, 10, &amp; 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10. as both the Scripture and the
iſſue of two diſpenſations, of Law and Goſpel, do evidence.
2. Man in the covenant of works was under no tutor but
<hi>Adams</hi> free will; but now man as an interdicted heir,
for former waſteries, is disinherited, ſo that he hath not the
maſtery of his own eſtate, is put under another Lord, even

<hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 23. Satan ſeeks leave, or rather curſed licence, if
it were but to deſtroy the Gadarens ſwine, and he reputes
it his torment not to dwell with his Legions, in the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

would be as holy as <hi>David;</hi> nay, there is in the man a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
ſorrow, that he cannot have more power, and
ſtronger influences of hell to doe more evill; and ſo he
hates theſe influences of grace of which he ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>It may be doubted (ere we ſpeak of other differences)
whether perſeverance was promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi> in a law-ſtate,
or not; for if prayer was a worſhip enjoyned to <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fall, no leſs then publick worſhip of praiſing for
the workmanſhip of creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. it may be ſaid, if
<hi>Adam</hi> was to ſuit any thing in prayer to God, then eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
was he to pray that he might not ſin, and might not
be led into temptation, but might ſtand in obedience, and
ſo might have influences to determine his will to ſtand and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119064:19"/>
continue therein, and this the law of nature ſeems to ſay.
2. If he was to truſt in God for acts of providence, for his
ſtanding in obedience, then eſpecially, for acts of the Lords
free predetermination to cauſe him to ſtand; and ſo both
praying and believing muſt relate to a promiſe; and if ſo,
then muſt the Lord have promiſed in the firſt covenant of
works, perſeverance and influences to perſevere.</p>

                  </note> It may be probably ſaid, <hi>Adam</hi> was to pray, but the
particulars he was to ſuit in prayer are as unknown to us
as any thing; he was to ſanctifie a Sabbath, and to praiſe,
and to exalt God in his works of creation; but for praying
for perſeverance and predeterminating influences by which
he might perſevere, while Scripture ſpeaks, we muſt doubt;
he was to deſire, to intend and purpoſe to perſevere, as he
was obliged by the law of <hi>God</hi> to perſevere; but for inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
praying or believing that God ſhould give to <hi>Adam</hi>
perſeverance, either abſolutely or upon condition, that he
ſhould pray for perſeverance; and ſo upon condition that
he ſhould perſevere in praying for, or in believing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
to perſevere, the Scripture is ſilent; and we can ſay
nothing, where Scripture-light doth not lead the way: its
like that the onely means moral of perſevering muſt be
here a law without, the image of God within, and <hi>Adams</hi>
free will in obeying; but God having a purpoſe that the
covenant of works ſhould not be the fixed ſtanding way of
juſtification and life;<note place="margin">

confirmed, that they ſhould not fall, nor be able to fall;
yet have we no warrant to ſay, that they came to that

of free grace: or that <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt ſin was neglect of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of works or grace, is another thing. Yea its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written

promiſed any ſuch thing.</p>

the Hebrews uſe the verb in <hi>hiphil</hi> noting a double action;
when one cauſeth another to act, to note influences, <hi>Deut.
32. 39. I cauſe to die, and I cauſe to live. Hannah</hi> ſo ſings,

perfection, in ſhort, is in that language above others, and
when ſuch actions are aſcribed to <hi>God,</hi> they ſhew that <hi>God</hi>
hath an influence and impulſion, as the firſt cauſe in all
actions; the Scripture herein abounds. The Greek lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith they well agree, and he infers this theſis, they
both <hi>phyſically</hi> and <hi>morally are to work out their ſalvation,
in whom God both by the habit and actual influence of grace

be at hand when the believers are to act, as they are no
leſs under a precept, and a command to act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
pray, then the husband-man is under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

But the queſtion is <hi>de modo,</hi> how they are at hand, whither
ſo as the free will of man may command, and have in its
power the influences of God's grace, or the Lord by the
dominion of his ſtrong influence, ſweetly and connaturally
commands and hath in his power our free will, according
to his good pleaſure; Sure its ſafer that nature be under

               <p>For 1. We ſuppoſe that Chriſt is the head of the elect

not as from the third perſon of the bleſſed Trinity ſimply;
for ſo the ſpirit is the power of God, ſometimes as Judge

by his bloud. So Chriſt ſpeaketh to the ſpirit, <hi>Cant. 4. 16.
Stir up thou North wind, come forth thou South, blow upon
my garden, that the ſpice thereof may flow out.</hi> Where
Chriſt commands influences of the ſpirit of the North and
South wind, though of contrary qualities, of cold and heat,
moiſt and dry; both in ſharp rebukes, and ſweet conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
to fall upon his Church and garden; and it is his

               <p>Hence 1. the fear that Chriſt ſhall be wanting in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

grace, acts upon all the members, by quickening them to
will and to doe, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 16. Eph. 2. 21, 22. Eph.</hi> 1. 21. &amp;
22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>8. Chriſt as King gives repentance and remiſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.
31, 32. Then muſt he by that power royal give influences
to acts of repentance and of faith.</p>
               <p>9. As Prophet he opens the heart to underſtand the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<hi>Luke 24. 45. Act.</hi> 9. 17. and ſo muſt give influences
for that effect.</p>
               <p>Hence are we to look for the <hi>watering of the garden of
red wine every moment,</hi> from Chriſt the fountain of life,
and to know that we ſhould wither from the root, if Chriſt,
withdraw his influence; and ſo grace puts us under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of grace, to carry on the work of ſalvation. 2. Yea
it is to believe Chriſt is but an imperfect and half a Saviour,
and wanting in his Office, if we doubt he ſhall give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
to perfect to the end what he hath begun; then
branches out of Chriſt, and cut off from him, muſt wither.
1. Make ſure union with the Vine-tree, if you would be
ſure of growing to the end. 2. Know the way to the well
of life, be much with Chriſt, and lie, and be neer to the
well, if you would have influences every moment. 3. The
moſt glorious and ſhining Profeſſors that are not in Chriſt,
ſhall turn Apoſtates; a plant above the earth, with borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
earth on the top of an houſe, may grow for a ſhort ſpace,
but ſhall wither. 4. Heathen influences from a Creator
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119064:25"/>
without Chriſt ſhall not bear you out; the vertues of <hi>Tully,</hi>
of <hi>Seneca, Regulus,</hi> are of that nature that they may dry
up. 5. Yea, weak Believers, doubting that Chriſt ſhall give
influences to work in you to will and to doe, is 1. To que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether Chriſt ſhall faithfully acquit himſelf in the
duty of his Office; for by office he conferrs influences.
2. Its to queſtion his nature, whether the Head ſhall inlive
its members.</p>

in leaving them to the actings of their own heart; only it
may be ſaid, that God finding his child under deadneſs,
and acting in a dead and literal way, as he hath bowels of
compaſſion toward his choſen, under the evil of ſin, that
are ready to be drowned, he joynes his help of influences,
ſeeing his own goe about duties with wreſtling and pain,
ſince he knows ſome one way or other they muſt be over
the water, and helped, otherwiſe they cannot ſtir.</p>
               <p>2. As there are ſome ſaving graces from the Mediator, ſo
muſt there be ſome mediatory influences beſtowed covenant

relying upon God, when faith is put to believe that at

dayly, and for our dayly bread this day. We can but (4.)
hence, but believe the infinite wiſedome of the Lord, who
well knows how to husband and ſteward his ſhowres; for
in the man Chriſt they are continual. <hi>John 8. 29. He that

                  <hi>the

to God, the Father of Chriſt leaves us, out of the depth of
his ſoveraignty of diſpenſing influences. Chriſt was never
ſo morally deſerted.<note place="margin">The firſt <hi>Adam might</hi> want influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>cannot.</hi>

               <p>1. As the Lord would have a falling law-<hi>Adam,</hi> to whom

alſo would have a ſtanding and never <hi>ſinning-Adam,</hi> that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119064:26"/>
grace might appear to be grace. 2. Upon ſuppoſition that
the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is God man, it was impoſſible but the man
Chriſt, in all his actions moral ſhould want influences, or
ever ſin, or be left alone of the Father, but he muſt always
do the thing that pleaſeth the Father; nor is there any
murmuring to be againſt the diſpenſation of deepeſt wiſdom,
why we have not at our pleaſure influences of grace, that
we ſhould never ſin, as the man Chriſt never ſinned. 3. Say
we could ſee no reaſon, the thing is notire; the Lord acts
in the (firſt) elect Angels, that they never ſin; he denied in
the firſt fall influences to the reprobate Angels; and ſince
the Lord hath condemned them, and tied them with chains
of darkneſſe, that their whole actions, except the acts of
intellectual being and living, and the acts of knowing,
believing, deſiring, fearing, &amp;c. in the ſubſtance of the

Satans actions are moral, theſe excepted of which we ſpoke,

yet hath the Lord reſerved a liberty <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> to let out

not at his diſpenſation, who by ſad falls on Ice and ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery

to be ſeen but his wiſdome. (5.) And ſinful ſlips in us,
and freedome of withdrawing in the Lord, bring us to be

               <p>There is here no creating of clouds or rain, by King or
Husbandman, or Hoſts of men; the Husbandmans faith
and prayer in extreme drought may fetch rain: but we
have, in theſe actings in which God muſt joyn his gracious
influence, no real influence upon the Lord's influences;
the Roſe acts not upon the Sun by influences, but the Sun
acts upon the Roſe, though we may pray for influences

                  </note> there is praying, and yet heavineſs and dropping away of

the ſmoak; the Glaſs ſet muſt run out ſo many hours; ere
the Sea flow again, the Sea-man weeps and prays, but the
ſtorm continues and the wind hears him not, and he that
creates the wind ſuſpends his acting. God hath not ſaid
that the husband-man may pray away Winter, while the
ſeaſon be over; nor that the Traveller, when the Sun is
ſet and darkneſs come, ſhould pray away the night, while
the hours be over; So here God hath fixed a time for a
winter ſeaſon of heavineſs and trying deadneſs. The Lord's
mind is to pray for the right melting of the metal, and not
for the quenching and removing of the fire, he muſt do his
work; its wiſdom to know who orders our prayers, and to
pray for ſomething about his withdrawing, and not for the
removal of the withdrawing it ſelf; <hi>Paul</hi> three times prays
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. for the removal of the Meſſenger of Satan: But
prayer ſtirs not right then in all points; he ſhould have
prayed for ſufficiency of grace: our gracious Lord laying
aſide the droſs of our prayer, hears us not in granting
what we ſuit, but what we ought to ſuit in prayer, and in
granting what we ſuit not formally, but what the Spirit
ſuits internally in us; The man in a Feaver cries for
a Drink, the Phyſitian forbids to give him drink, and yet
gives to quench the thirſt ſome other thing then drink; ſo
the ſick mans ſuit is profitably heard. Yet my meaning is
not, that the Lord cannot, or will not at all take off an
arreſtment of diſertion, at the praying of his children, the
Lord cannot repeal that, <hi>Pſal. 50. 15. Call upon me in the
day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me;</hi>
therefore he repeals it not under withdrawings, which are
amongſt the greateſt of ſuch troubles as put us to call
upon God.</p>
               <p>2. Chriſt under the Lord's withdrawings, in point of
comfort and enjoyment of the felt favour of God prayed
and was heard, <hi>Heb. 5. 7. Matth. 26. 38, 39. Luke</hi> 22. 42, 43.
therefore by the like he doth hear us in ſuch a caſe; I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119064:28"/>
fetch the Argument <hi>a proportion;</hi> for Chriſt in whom Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
finds nothing, is not capable of the withdrawings of
God in point of duty. If any ſay it was Chriſt's duty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to rejoyce in God,</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It was an affirmative Precept which did not
oblige the man Chriſt actually in every moment of time;
and in <hi>radice</hi> it did, <hi>habitu</hi> it did, habitually it did oblige
him; for that <hi>rejoyce evermore,</hi> obligeth not ever to actual
rejoycing, but to a ſavory habit of rejoycing; nor did
that (<hi>pray continually</hi>) oblige the man Chriſt to pray actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and to ſpeak to God, when he was preaching and
ſpeaking to men, at one time; nor was actually rejoycing
in God phyſically conſiſtent with actual ſorrow in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
               <p>3. The praying to be led of <hi>God</hi> in his way, not to be led
into temptation muſt include a ſuit that <hi>God</hi> would ſend
influences, and not forſake us in the way of his obedience
under our defections: therefore there is need of a ſpecial
ſubmiſſion and a reſerve of time to ſail when his flowings
ſet the ſoul a float. Hence may a child of God ſubmit to
his deep ſoveraignty in withdrawings, and ſtoop humbly to
the Lord's holy decree, (his holy will be done upon clay)
and yet alſo deſire preſently the removal of ſinful deadneſs,
and pray againſt our ſinful omiſſion which neceſſarily
follows upon the Lord's withdrawing, and we are to nill
and hate ſinning, which reſults from the withdrawing;
therefore both pray and forget that ye have prayed, and
adore ſoveraignty. Pray under withdrawing for influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
yet truſt not on the act of praying; and though he
ſtill withdraw, pray, but without fainting under, and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
againſt ſoveraignty.</p>
               <p>The habit being of the nature of a power cannot actuate
itſelf, nor can we actuate and make uſe of the power of
grace; now as the God of nature is he in whom we live, and
move, and ſo we are acted by him in our natural ſtirrings;
ſo in Chriſt Redeemer Emanuel in whom is the fulneſs and
fountain of grace we live ſpiritually. Neither have we the
uſe and exerciſe of our grace in our own hand, nor can we
believe when we will, as a Muſitian can ſing when he will.</p>

               <p>For 1. The withdrawer of the influence is under no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
by any binding law to beſtow it.</p>
               <p>2. The man that wants the influence is willing to want it.</p>
               <p>3. The man is obliged, who ſo wants the influence by
an expreſly binding law of God to perform the act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and to abſtain from the contrary act forbidden;
and theſe three are the grounds why the Lord is not
chargeable with the act of diſobedience; and man is guilty
and chargeable therewith. Hence man is the culpable
cauſe of diſobedience; and he never wants the influence of
God, but his own ſin interpretatively is the cauſe. The
withdrawing of Dew and Rain is the cauſe of barrenneſſe
or non-fertility; the Lord's withdrawing is the phyſical
cauſe of non-obedience; but the will of man is the only
formal, vital, ſubjective, moral, and (as it were) the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119064:29"/>
cauſe of ſin; yea the only formal and efficient cauſe
of ſin.</p>

                     <hi>How we</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively <hi>yield to the</hi> want of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences <hi>of</hi> grace and ſin <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally in the</hi> ſame act.</note> except he be mad, or in an
extreme diſtemper of body; But no man refuſeth divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
with deliberate reaſon and the law of nature. 2. The
law of nature lays bands upon men not to caſt away their
cloaths; but to have, or to want the influences of God, falleth
under no command of God laid upon man. 3. No man, by
your way, hath the influences of grace in his own power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or reject them, as he that caſteth away his garments in a
cold day, hath undeniably ſuch a power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Every compariſon in ſome thing halteth; <hi>he who
caſts away his coat, is deſervedly cold,</hi> true, and with delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

man with deliberate reaſon refuſeth divine influences;</hi> For
willing or deliberate yielding to the ſin, either of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or of commiſſion, which is conjoyned with the Lord's
withdrawing of his influences, is both our formal ſinning
againſt the obligation of a command, and a yielding virtual
(which is enough to make up guiltineſs) to the want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
influences.</p>
               <p>2. True it is, <hi>to have or to want the influence of God, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
under no command of God laid upon man, as a man is by
the law of nature forbidden to caſt away his coat in a cold
ſeaſon;</hi> but in virtual yielding to have influences of God,
conjoyned with doing evil, and in virtual yielding to want
influences conjoyned with other ſins of omiſſion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
we ſin, and ſo are under a command; as he who
refuſeth a Staff, or a ſtronger man to lean upon in going
thorow a water, is guilty of drowning himſelf.</p>
               <p>3. Thus far we are deliberately to deſire influences that
we are to pray for them; <hi>Draw me,</hi> Cant. 1. 4. <hi>Lord teach
me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 33. <hi>Open mine eyes, that I may behold the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of thy Law,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>Incline mine heart to thy teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and not to covetouſneſs,</hi> v. 36. As we are obliged to
have a new heart, and to have the image of God, which we
willingly loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> and to be renewed in the ſpirit of
our mind, and to make to our ſelves a new heart, and are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119064:30"/>
commanded ſo to doe, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18: 31. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 23. and yet
the Lord's omnipotent creating of a new heart in us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fall under a Commandement formally obliging us to
create in our ſelves a new heart, and ſo are we cammand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conſequently to have the breathings and influences of
grace. 1. In the ſame act in the which we are commanded
to obey. 2. In that we are to pray for, and to deſire the
breathings of <hi>God.</hi> 3. In that there is a promiſe, <hi>to him
that hath it ſhall be given,</hi> Matth. 25. 29. Matth. 13. 12.
but how far the promiſe extends is after to be diſcuſſed.
(3.) As touching influences natural, they ſeem to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to free and voluntary Agents, and alſo to natural
cauſes; ſo the Lord commandeth the Sun to riſe, and it
riſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 19. and he commandeth the Sun, and it
riſeth not, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 7. it rains, becauſe <hi>the Lord lifteth up his
voice unto the clouds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> wanting of <hi>influences</hi> and our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>ſinning</hi> in the ſame act, <hi>further clear'd.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that abundance of rain may come; he
ſendeth out lightnings,</hi> Jerem. 14. 22. <hi>Pſal. 107. 33, 34.
God hunteth the prey for the Lyon, and gives food to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
Job 38. 35. 36. v. 41. In all theſe the natural cauſe
acts, and yet hath not in its power the influences of <hi>God;</hi>
and when <hi>God</hi> withdraws his influences ſo as natural cauſes
act not, they find no poſitive violence offered to reſtrain
them, or by-way of any poſitive impediment to hinder
them, only there is a negative withdrawing of influences
upon the Lord's part which they want with a ſort of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
yielding to the want thereof; and yet they have and
keep ſtill their natural power to act, <hi>actu primo,</hi> as the firſt
cauſe ſhall ſet them on work: And the very like may be
ſaid of moral Agents; God withdraws his influence, they
ſin, but find no poſitive violence comming from the Lord's
withdrawing, to reſtrain them or impoſe upon them, and
they connaturally and with a virtual willingneſs yield to
ſuch withdrawings, and keep an inferiour dominion over
their own actings.</p>
               <p>Hence 1. Moral Agents are to ſet to work to doe duties,
&amp; not to wait upon God's acts of influences; but they are to
act, as if the influences of God were in their power; for the
influence from Heaven to the duty belongs to <hi>God,</hi> (he does
not lay formal commands upon us to have, or to want his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119064:30"/>
influences) and the duty is ours; but we love more to look
to God, and judge anxiouſly his providence of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of influences, then upon our own duty. Its ſtrange:
I judge his holy withdrawings, and not my own ſinful
omiſſions.</p>
               <p>2. No man is to complain of the Lord's withdrawing of
influences; You are joyful and well content to want them.
Men put out their own eyes and yet complain God hath
made them blind: Of this, more hereafter.</p>
               <p>But this Argument may be retorted,<note place="margin">The ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians to the end they may exa't mans Free-will.</note> and unpoſſible it is
to defend the Dominion and Soveraignty of God by theſe
Principles; ſo if it be not in the dominion and ſoveraignty
of God to procure or hinder the acts of final obedience or
diſobedience, he cannot be Maſter of ſalvation, and of the
certain number of the ſaved; but the free-will of man
muſt be abſolute ever here, and the ſalvation of any muſt
be phyſically impoſſible to the ſoveraign Lord.</p>
               <p>But by the Adverſaries way; its not in the dominion
and ſoveraignty of God to procure, or to hinder the acts of
final obedience or diſobedience of any; but it muſt be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
in the power of created free-will, all things needful
to be done, both upon the part of the Lord's Decree, and of
the Lord's Influences, being done, to nill or will, obey or
diſobey. And 2. its in the power of created free-will to
doe, or obey, and to refuſe, or diſobey. And 3. to have
the ſtrongeſt influences of God in its dominion and created
power, or to want them. 4. Created freewill firſt ſtirs
and concurs, by order of nature, before the ſoveraign Lord
joyn his influence; all theſe be the Principles of Pelagians,
Jeſuits, Arminians; ſo ſhall created free-will have the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
above and before the ſoveraign Lord of all the acts
of obedience, of all the choſen of God, as to their number,
who ſhall be ſaved, who not, how many, how few.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Q. Whether or no are we to believe, pray, praiſe,
read, confer only then when the Spirit actually moves
us to believe, pray, praiſe, &amp;c. and not otherwiſe?
1. Duties are to be done under ſpiritual withdrawings.
2. The precept and the influence differ. 3. We are
and may pray at fixed hours.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Queſtion is the ſame of elicite acts,<note place="margin">Of our acts and ſpiritual duties under the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God. Something of the ſtate of the queſtion.</note> of love, fear,
hope, faith, and of imperate acts of praying, hearing,
praiſing; only the difference is, hardly can we ſet a time
to believing; the object ſometime wakens us, <hi>Pſal. 56. 3.
What time I am afraid, Ile truſt in thee;</hi> otherwiſe that
binds ever, which is, <hi>Pſal. 62. 8. Truſt in him at all times.</hi>
The Lord hath more fixed a time for praying continually,
and for praiſing the Lord always, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. Pſal.</hi> 146. 1.</p>
               <p>2. The queſtion is alike in all actions, and in ſpiritual and
ſupernatural actions; as whether the Husbandman may
Plow and Sow at fit ſeaſons, or only when the Lord the
cauſe of cauſes joyns his influence; for theſe and the like
are no leſs impoſſible without the connatural influences of
God, then the acts of praying, believing without the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
influences of grace. Now we would think it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
ſhould the Husbandman never plow but only
when he is diſpoſed to plow; ſuppoſe he ſleep longer in the
morning then he ſhould.</p>
               <p>3. The actual Influence cannot be a Rule; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know or feel the actual influence of God, Creator, or of
Grace, but only when we are aworking.</p>
               <p>4.<note place="margin">Our inability to do duties, when the Spirit withdraws, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us not from a moral obligation to perform the duties.</note> The queſtion of the obligation is one thing, and the
queſtion of ability to pray is another; for <hi>Magus</hi> yet in the

<hi>Acts 8. 22. Repent therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and
pray God, if perhaps the thoughts of thine heart may be

1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. to praiſe, to rejoyce, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. 18.
what ever their indiſpoſition be. Now though the man
fal'n in <hi>Adam</hi> be unable to keep and do the Law, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
men living in the viſible Church, be unable &amp; indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to believe in Chriſt and to pray, yet except we ſay that
ſuch are under neither Law nor Goſpel, we cannot ſay that
men, becauſe of their wretched eſtate, are not obliged to
pray, believe, love Chriſt, walk with God. Libertines ſay
its unlawful and a taking of the Name of God in vain, to
aym at praying, when the Spirit withdraws. Suppoſe we
could not reconcile our inability and our indiſpoſition to
pray, nor the acting of ſtrong grace and of weak will; yet
when God hath undeniably commanded duties and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
in the new Covenant grace, and gives the new heart,
and the habit of grace, no man hath warrant upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Lord's denying influence to abſtain from du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
for upon the ſame account one might caſt himſelf in
the Fire, and another in the Water; why, it may be the
Lord ſhall deny his influence to the fire and water, to burn
or conſume us, and ſo the water ſhall not overwhelme me,
nor the fire conſume me, though I wickedly caſt my ſelf in
fire and water.</p>

hours were not lawful; For if we cannot pray, but when the
Spirit moves us, we cannot ſay, we ſhall pray at any hour: for
we cannot tie the Spirit's joyning to our hours; and again, if
we are to pray at any hour we pleaſe, we uſe the habit of
grace and ſupplication, when, and as we will; as a Muſitian
may ſing when he will, or not ſing.</p>

<hi>Acts 3. 1. Acts</hi> 10. 3, 9, 10. and the godly Jews; for by
no divine Precept are we tied to ſuch hours. <hi>Papiſts</hi> abuſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119064:33"/>
the Scripture to Canonick hours; But in Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
we may fix a time to reading, praying, conferring
on the Word, and to other ſacred duties; yet do we not
tie the Spirit's joyning to our hour; the man Chriſt ſet a
night apart for praying; and ſo did <hi>Jacob</hi> for wreſtling by
tears with the great Angel, <hi>Geneſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 32. 24. Hoſ.</hi> 12. 3, 4.
without limitting the Spirit in his influences to any time;
nor yet will it follow that we uſe the habit or ſpirit of
grace and ſupplication, when we will; for ſanctified
will is to ſet the time, and to actuate it ſelf by the habit of
grace; And the ſame Argument ſhall conclude, that the
Husbandman who ſets a time for plowing and ſowing, muſt
limit the Lord to joyn his influences: <hi>For except the Lord
build the houſe, they labour in vain, who build it;</hi> though
they ſet days to the hired Maſons. Except the Lord keep
the City, the Watch-man watcheth but in vain; though
times be ſet to the hired Watchers. Its in vain to riſe up
early, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 1, 2. and its as impoſſible to plow, build,
watch, riſe early, without the common influence of God the
firſt cauſe, as it is to pray in Faith without the ſpecial
breathing of the Spirit of grace. Yet <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians</hi>
will not ſay that they ſin in ſetting a time for
building, plowing, watching; theſe ſeem conſiderable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
hours of praying.</p>
               <p>1. Though we fix an hour, it becomes Faith to await the
Angels moving of the water, and when the Lord adds his
influences to ſtep in and joyn our ſtrength cheerfully and
with humble praiſes to him who draws.</p>
               <p>2. When there is a bentneſs of heart ſuch a day or ſuch
a fixed hour to pray, build not too much upon the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and promiſes of our own heart, to ſay to morrow, Ile
do wonders by prayer, &amp; remove mountains. 1. Its good here,
as in a purpoſe of going <hi>to a City to continue there a year, and
buy and ſell and get gain,</hi> to ſay in a trembling ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God, as <hi>James</hi> counſelleth <hi>chap. 4. 13, 15. If the Lord
will, we ſhall live;</hi> ſo, to ſay if the holy ſoveraignty of grace
breath fairly and ſtrongly, Ile do well in praying; yet not
I, but his grace; and if the wind of the Lord blow not, ah
I cannot ſail. 2. As in the caſe of <hi>James</hi> his Merchant,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119064:33"/>
and of <hi>Peter</hi>'s undertaking, <hi>Ile die with thee, rather or I
deny thee.</hi> So here 1. The man ſows broad hopes upon
his own praying, and the harveſt is thin and nothing.
2. Such a Preacher ſhall ſet the Ship a float, and all ſhall be
well, if ſuch an Inſtrument act, and then the Lord is away,
and the Reed is broken, and the Sea flows not. 3. At the
Death of ſuch an Eminent Chriſtian, O there muſt be
ſtrange manifeſtations; and the poor man is taken away
under a cloud, and in a huge deal of darkneſs. The faith
of our repoſing upon our ſelves and the creature, and our
not repoſing on the Lord's acting in us to will and to do, in
theſe ſet times does diſappoint us. A godly jealouſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of our ſelves, &amp; a relying wholy upon the Lords actings
is good; and ſeldom can we difference between preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
confidence on our ſelves, with a godly trembling, and
a pure and ſpiritual relying upon God in his breathings of
grace. (3.) We ſtumble, that when the impetuous faird
of reſolving is on, and poſſibly the Lord effectually acting
us; yet when it comes to the time of praying, the whole
ſpirit is a lump of deadneſs, and the <hi>Comforter</hi> is away;
and the fleſh ſaith, <hi>I covenanted a meeting with Chriſt, and
he covenanted with me; but I kept the appointed time, and
he failed and came not according to his promiſe;</hi> And we
do not remember, that there is a promiſe that he will work
in us to will and to doe; but for a Covenant that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſhall keep your fixed hour, where is that? for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
even the hour before blows ſweetly and the hour after;
but he is abſent at your fixed hour. In a word, we may
limit a time for your Duty; for the obligation (to pray
continally) is perpetual; but we cannot limit a time or an
hour to his breathing. Its ever true, <hi>John 3. 8. The Wind
bloweth where it liſteth.</hi> (4.) The more Angel-like and the
more ſpiritual pride is, ſuch as is Angel-haughtineſs in the
damned ſpirits who were not content with their own ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in <hi>Evah,</hi> the more ſinful guiltineſs is in it; Pride
reſulting from acts common to men, as that of the King of
<hi>Aſſyria, Iſa.</hi> 37. and that of the King of <hi>Babylon, Hab. 2.
Iſa.</hi> 14. 13, 14. is nothing ſo damnable as the proud fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of holineſs and grace upon our vain nature; and here
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119064:34"/>
we think we can command the ebbing and flowing of the
Sea, and have the breathings of the Spirit at our will;
and if we be humble, it ſhould eſpecially be in ſtooping to
the moſt poor and holy actings of the Soveraign Lord, and
preſumptuous relying on ſelf; here is the firſt ſamplar
pride.</p>
               <p>Neither do we conſider that moſt of the Arguments, if
we may act when, and where, we will, Salvation and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and all the high actings of gracious Soveraignty
muſt be under our power; if we may, or can act without
the habit and influence of grace, and muſt be here, as when
one great higher Wheel moves and turns about many
Wheels, and the firſt moves the ſecond, and ſecond the
third, and the third the fourth, and ſo forth; ſo muſt the
habits of Grace, and the influences of the Spirit, and all
the outgoings of God be ſubject to mans Free-will as the
firſt mover; if we can pray and praiſe under the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence the 6. Argument may be removed, that though we
cannot pray, but when, and as the Spirit moves us; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
both that we are not looſed from our obligation to
pray, nor can we pray more or leſs fervently, but as the
grace of Chriſt, in whom is all fulneſs, qualifies us in the
habit and actings, becauſe the gracious acts depend not
upon our Free-will ſimply, but upon our Free-will as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
with the ſupernatural habit infuſed; nor do the
more intenſe and ſtronger actings of love, of faith, of
prayer, depend upon our Free-will, but as inſtructed with
the ſtronger habit and actual influences of God; But

is not. 1. Omnipotency and Soveraignty thus differ;
Omnipotency looks ſimply to effects phyſically, what the
Lord <hi>can doe:</hi> he can of ſtones make ſons to <hi>Abraham;</hi> he
can create millions of Worlds; his Soveraignty is not only
his holy Nature what he can doe and ſo ſuppoſeth his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipoteucy,
but alſo what he doth freely, or doth not
freely, and doth by no natural neceſſity, and ſo it includes
his holy ſupreme Liberty, and alſo what the Lord <hi>may doe,</hi>
as it were <hi>Jure</hi> he may doe all things, and (as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith)
<hi>gives not an account of his matters to any,</hi> Job 33. 13. by
his holy ſoveraign Will as above all Laws that bind the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creatures, he does as he pleaſeth, and what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth:
and none can ſay <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> Hence 1. Its graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119064:35"/>
of holy Soveraignty, that becauſe he is Soveraign,
he does not cruſh us; the fleſh ſpeaks that in <hi>Job</hi> 10. 3. to
the Lord; <hi>Is it good to thee that thou ſhouldeſt oppreſs?</hi> and
becauſe he is ſoveraign upon the account of his ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>he cruſheth not under his feet all the priſoners of the earth:
to turn aſide the right of a man before the face of the moſt
High,</hi> Lam. 3. 33, 34. whereas, to ſinful ſoveraigns, power is a

withdraw influences of grace from Angels and Men as
pleaſeth him beſt; he may let this Ground wither and dry
up as a Rock, and make the other Plot of Ground near by,
like a fruitful Paradice; and why may not Soveraignty
diſpoſe of hearts to harden them? but his outgoings of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
are not always to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>2. Our great ones are ſo far above the bloud, the cries
and ſufferings of the needy; let the poor die in the pit,
they have an higher imployment then to lend their heart to

Job 36. 5. <hi>Behold, God is mighty and diſpiſeth not any;</hi> ſaith

<hi>Faith</hi> can command <hi>Senſe</hi> to come up to the obligation

<hi>Heman</hi> hath come near this, and <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonah; all thy

yet hear ſavoury prayers ſpeaking the rejoycing, and kiſſing

Arrows that ſtick faſt in the ſoul; but <hi>David</hi> prays to an

he caſts on me waves of Hell; I ſend up tears and cries to

and ſore vexes my ſoul; I believe and truſt in his ſalvation,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 4, 5, 6. Thus its poſſible, for a Saint to love his
own fiery hell, and receive the coals of flaming wrath in his
arms, for his holy Soveraign and glorious Name, who is

mercy and grace, <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God manifeſt in the fleſh, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of Men and Angels? it ſeems to ſay that the Lord's
will is more ſet upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s final dutie, which never had
being, and which the Lord immutably from Eternity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
ſhould never be, then his holy Will is fixed upon that
wonder of the World, of Heaven and Earth; the riches of
the glory of his grace and other attributed in that precious
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119064:38"/>
and incomparable myſtery, <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh. Its
true, God wills us rather to obey, and not to wound our ſelves
by ſin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>then put him to pardon our diſobedience, or to
ſeek a Mediator or remedy for ſin.</hi> But the Lord by his
commanding will, in his Law chargeth us under the
pain of condemnation to obey; but the Lord by
no commanding will in his Law chargeth himſelf to

               <p>But except we ſeek a knot in a Ruſh. 1. Its <hi>Adam</hi>'s duty
and all mankinds in him to ſtand, obey and never ſin:
and God wills this obligation to lie upon man as an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

[<hi>Adam</hi> ought never to have ſinned.]</p>
               <p>2. God never willed <hi>Adam,</hi> nor commanded him in
Law or Goſpel, either abſolutely or comparatively to put
the Lord to ſeek a remedy or a Saviour to ſatisfie for us, or
to pardon ſin; we read of no ſuch will.</p>
               <p>3. Nor is it fit to ſay, <hi>that the Lord had rather</hi> David
<hi>committed adultery and murther, by God</hi>'s <hi>permiſſion, and be
pardoned for it, then not to commit it; for if this be meant</hi> of
the commanding will of <hi>God,</hi> no man can juſtly charge us
with putting ſuch contradictory wills upon <hi>God;</hi> as alſo
its unpoſſible that God can will the adultery of <hi>David</hi> to
be, by any other will, then his will of purpoſe and hloy

               <p>And then 4. The righteous Lord loves righteouſneſſe,
yet the Lord abſolutely and ſimply willed rather the holy,

he wills the final obedience of the <hi>firſt Adam;</hi> and he wills
more the manifeſtation of the glory of his free grace, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning

                  </note> Chriſt Jeſus, then he loſt

between the glory of the righteouſneſſe of <hi>God</hi> through

the grace of God; for the righteouſneſs of God through
faith, muſt be more excellent then the righteouſneſs of man,
or then all the acts of man by grace, believing, hoping,
lovering, repenting, praying, praiſing eternally in Heaven,
ſuffering of martyrdome; and therefore it cannot be ſaid
<hi>that God would rather</hi> in an antecedent, and principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<hi>have us to forbear ſin</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> to ſtand in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
<hi>then to put him to remedy ſin,</hi> and out of the

to ſave ſinners, as if the intention and heart-purpoſe of God
had been principally that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ſtand, and
all in him and the Court of the Law of Works ſhould be for
ever; and that the Lord in a ſecond intention and (as if it
were) compelled by a croſs wind muſt ſail into a next beſt
and ſecond harbour, which yet undoubtedly is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt
and higheſt declarative glory of the Lord which the
conceptions of Angels or Men can reach, and was (if I may
ſo ſpeak) the eternal delight of the Lord, <hi>while as yet, he had
not made the earth, or the fields,</hi> Pro. 8. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
30, 31. though I am far from thinking that any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God, doth conclude his holy Soveraignty; yet the
Lord's ſoul delighting in the holy obedience of Chriſt and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119064:39"/>
the eternal declarative glory thereof, ſhall be higheſt to me,
and in the hearts (I conceive) of the godly, the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
revealed end, and to Scripture.</p>
               <p>4. Neither is it better pleaſing to <hi>God,</hi> not to ſin, then
when the man hath ſinned, <hi>to ſeek pardon for ſin</hi> in the
bloud of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Not to ſin by no Scripture is choicer then to ſeek pardon in Chriſt's bloud.</note> I know not what Scripture ſo ſpeaks or ſo
teacheth both the one and the other is the approving and

and excellent then the Law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. as it muſt be;
the ſeeking of a pardon is a duty commanded in the Goſpel
and Covenant of grace, and not ſinning, is as ſuch an act
commanded in the poor and ſimple Covenant of works gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Adam.</hi> I ſhall heartily yield to ſin upon hope of
pardon (if any intelligent pure and only Antinomians ſo
teach) is utterly unlawful; but upon ſuppoſition that the
perſon is a ſinner, it is a more gracious act of obedience
(yea more glorious if I may ſo ſpeak) to fly to our Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
and Citie of refuge Jeſus Chriſt upon Goſpel-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
then upon Law-principles not to ſin; And thus muſt
the compariſon of betterneſs and excellency be made. But
the arguing ſeems to infer, that it is our mind, that God
willeth us to deſire and practically to will rather that
Chriſt the Phyſician ſhould appear in the declarative glory
of grace, mercy, pardoning, puniſhing, juſtice, then that we
ſhould practically will our own Law-odedience; but this
is forced on us and is not our mind, but a wicked Principle
of <hi>Libertines;</hi> for we ought rather to obey the Law and
practically to will final obedience to the Law of works and
eſchew ſinning as Hell, rather then deſire and with a more
intenſe and a ſtronger practical will ſeek the incarnation of
God; for that practical will can never be in us without
ſinning.</p>
               <p>Yea 4. It is a ſhame to compare together the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God (and we are in Chriſt made this righteouſneſs
of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.) and the inherent, mixt, imperfect
righteouſneſs of a renewed man; for the one needs no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and the other is ſinful, and as menſtruous cloaths
without a pardon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 6. I mean not that the believing,
praying, &amp;c. of the regenerate are formally and in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119064:39"/>
of the act ſins, but by accident they are ſinful and
polluted; but even in the ſubſtance of the act, they are
nothing comparable to the acts of obedience in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
which are every way complete and perfect according to the
ſtricteſt rule of the Law of works.</p>
               <p>Yea 5.<note place="margin">By juſtification we are not only negatively freed from guilt &amp; wrath but alſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> Its a falſe ground to ſay that by juſtification or
remiſſion of ſins (as ſome ſay, but they are not every way
the ſame) only the guilt of ſin is removed, or only delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from eternal puniſhment; for Chriſt's dying and
ſatisfying is ours, he dying in our ſtead and place, and we
dying in him legally (not phyſically) and ſo are we not
only by his ſatisfaction which is made ours, and by faith
applyed to us, negatively freed from Hell, but poſitively
righteous; (I ſay not inherently or perſonally) for Chriſt's
ſatisfaction is not a meer dying, nor meer ſuffering; for
beaſts may die and ſuffer much. But ſuch a dying and
ſuch a ſuffering, for 1. Chriſt's dying and ſatisfying hath an
excellency from the ſubject God-man who dyed, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.
2. It hath an excellent qualification from the patience, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
willingneſs of God-man, the like wherof could be in
no ſimple Man, in no Angel, in no Creature; for the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
influence of God was in him &amp; his obedience. As for the
damned in Hell, their ſatisfaction is of another nature dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from Chriſt's, &amp; is only ſatiſpaſſion and pure torment,
not holy, willing, ſuffering as the Law requires ſinleſs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
as contradiſtinguiſhed from active obedience. How
be it the Law moral doth require patient and ſubmiſſive
ſuffering without diſpairing or blaſpheming, in any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creature; for the holy Law cannot but condemn ſin
and blaſphemy, adhering either to our acting or ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Nor 6. Let it be ſaid to the undervaluing of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God through faith, <hi>that inherent righteouſneſs is the
full end of Chriſt's bloud;</hi> when in the ſtate of glory, there ſhal
be no more pardoning of ſin, but perfect inherent holineſs.</p>
               <p>For 1. that inherent holineſs in the eſtate of glory is not
perfect legal holineſs, nor the formal cauſe of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

ſo for eternity are ſuch as have violated the Law.</p>
               <p>2. Our <hi>righteouſneſs from the time forward</hi> ſhall not only

God intended as his only end to make us eternally Law-righteous;

of Planets and Stars, but by the Soveraign will of <hi>God:</hi>
now the co-exiſtence of things is a real event of providence
as is clear. Its from the <hi>Lord</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the ſame age and time, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi>
lived not together, and from the holy decree of God that
<hi>Jezebels</hi> body be caſt out, when there is none willing to
bury her; and from the holy decree of God, that the
Souldiers came with Spears to break the Legs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
that they find him dead and ſo break not one bone of him:
yea the exiſtence and living and acting of all things, and
the co-exiſtence, living and working together of them are
from the ſame providence of <hi>God,</hi> or then from nature, or
from the blind fortune, neither of which we can ſay; and
who appoints the meeting of two Seas, or the meeting of
two Rivers, or of two Men at the ſame place? or that the
new Star ſhould be in <hi>Caſſiopeia</hi> rather then in another
part of the Firmament? doth not <hi>David</hi> bleſs the Lord who
ſent <hi>Abigail</hi> to meet him with a counſel of peace? then
muſt theſe confluences and co-exiſtences of things be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Lord's book, and ſo decreed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 16. and
from the Creator God, as the efficient, and for God and
his glory, as the end, <hi>Rom. 11. 36. Rev. 4. 11. Prov.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
               <p>5. The wiſedom of God ſo appoints, as means for his
end, that black and white ſhould be in the ſame body, for
beauty, the poor and the rich, the full and the hungry to
try the charity of the rich and patience of the poor; that
ſome ſhould weep, ſome ſing and rejoyce at the laying of
the foundation of the ſecond Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3, 6. Some of
theſe are acts of mercy,<note place="margin">Soveraignty ſhines in means and end, things of rare provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to ſome, not to others.</note> Jeſus cometh by the way and two
blind men ſit by the way; <hi>Matthew, Zacheus</hi> are in ſuch
places and <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes by and ſaves both the one, and the
other.</p>
               <p>7. Some are acts of juſtice, as the falling of a piece of a
milſtone by a womans hand, and <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s near approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to the Tower, that a woman might kill him, who
might, twenty other ways have died, if the Lord did not
rule all the going of <hi>Achab</hi> to the war.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:119064:42"/>
2. The arrow at a venture ſhot at <hi>Achab</hi> and paſſing by
hundreds.</p>
               <p>3. The arrow directed to the one only naked part of his
body.</p>
               <p>4 The waſhing of the wounds in ſuch a Pool in the field
of <hi>Jezreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The Dogs licking of the bloud of <hi>Achab</hi> are all ſo
linked together, by the Lord's holy and juſt Decree, as this
is clear, if <hi>Achab</hi> go to the War againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the
Dogs ſhall lick his bloud, and he ſhall die in the battel.</p>
               <p>8. The adminiſtration of the means of ſalvation to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum,</hi>
not to <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> which would rather have
repented then <hi>Capernaum,</hi> does prove this is from the Lord;
if <hi>Peter</hi> hear, the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall effectually perſwade him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
if <hi>Cain, Pharaoh, Judas,</hi> hear, the Lord ſhall not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
perſwade them to believe. The Lord commands
reprobates to repent and believe, if they would be ſaved;
yet did he never decree the belief, repentance or ſalvation
of any of them: does not Soveraignty here ſhine? who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
the non-ſalvation of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the non-effectual
drawing of <hi>Judas</hi> to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> which ſaith there be no property
ſo called, and bands of conditions lying upon the Lord; if
<hi>Judas</hi> repent he ſhall be ſaved, as if a father promiſe to his
ſon an hundreth Acres of land upon condition that the ſon
pay him one hundreth ſhillings; if the father only can and
muſt furniſh to the ſon the hundreth ſhillings, and in the
mean time deny the purpoſe in his heart, to deny to furniſh
the hundreth ſhillings; it cannot be ſo ſtrictly ſaid that
there is the tie and band of a proper condition lying upon
the father, though it doth lie upon the ſon. And however
the ways of the holy Lord be equal, yet are they far above
our ways, and we are to be ſilenced at the bottomleſs depth
of holy Soveraignty; he lays obligations to duties upon
us, and is free from the debt of paying or beſtowing the
ſum of gracious influences (without which we willingly
cannot perform theſe duties) upon us: and he may juſtly
crave what we cannot pay, when our impotency to pay is
both our own, and alſo goes along with our elective, free
chuſing and hearty willingneſs, and rejoycing not to pay,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119064:43"/>
and to want the ſum, which only the Lord can of free grace
give us: <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſedome and
knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his judgements, and
his ways paſt finding out,</hi> Rom. 11. 33. To this head alſo I
refer.</p>
               <p>4. That Soveraignty which hath place in chuſing and

Iſrael,</hi> and their ſeed, not other Nations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 7. he

               <p>5.<note place="margin">Soveraignty is eminent in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of poſſible evils, and in determining the meaſure of ſufferings.</note> It is admirable Soveraignty, how many thouſand poſſible
plagues and evils he holds off, ſuch as millions of peſts, and
diſeaſes of <hi>Egypt</hi> and evil beaſts, <hi>Deut. 7. 15. Lev.</hi> 26. 6. why the
Bones of Chriſt are not broken; why a Dog ſtirs not a tongue
againſt <hi>Iſrael;</hi> why one only World, not athouſand worlds
were created: he appoints how long, what number of minuts,
hours, or years, his own ſhall be in the Furnace; the Lord
ſtands beſide as Maſter of the work, &amp; eyes the melting, what
quantity of Hony, or of Gall ſhal be in the Cup, how many
hours ye ſhall weep, how many days or hours the Candle
of the Almighty ſhall ſhine on your Tabernacle. Then be
humble, when he ſhines, and ſubmiſſive at the time and
meaſure of ſufferings; the evils that are holden off us before
in their cauſes they be prepared, when we know not, ſhould
teach us to adore Soveraignty. A friend that takes our
defence when we are abſent, and an Advocate who anſwers
for the ſick and far diſtant client, and not knowing that his
cauſe is called and debated; yea for an heir ſucking the
Breaſts, does call for much love and eſteem. Chriſt's care
ſhines for <hi>Peter</hi> and the winnowed believers, when he prays
and intercedes that their faith fail not, when they know
not any ſuch thing; for a hid love moves much. The
Lord fences us, we not knowing any ſuch thing, from drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and our children in floods, deep wells, from burning
quick, from a Hell of torment in every tooth, finger, bone,
ſinew, artery, lith, member of the body, of our ſelves, of
father, mother, ſon, daughter; and from ſpoyling, captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

by me and you, and do fall upon others by holy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties
appointment.</p>
               <p>6. The due timing of the worlds Creation,<note place="margin">The due time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things is from Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</note> and of all
things of time is from admirable Soveraignty, why the world
had not being, ten thouſand millions of imaginary ages
ſooner, or ſo many ages later; and from whence came this,
<hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> is a
depth of Soveraignty; its wonderful, Angels and ſouls
of Men are created eternal, time cannot waſt them: the
body of man, though a creature drawn out of the ſame <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
is not ſo. There is a Plant that grows a year only,
there is a Flower that ſmiles a moneth, another three
moneths, ſome Roſes are green in <hi>March,</hi> ſome in <hi>May,</hi>
ſome in <hi>June</hi> only, and there is a Tree that grows an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years; The like diſparity there is of the life of Beaſts
and Birds; He hath appointed <hi>a time for every purpoſe

are there ſeveral outgoings and influences of the
Lord.</p>
               <p>As 1. He will not have all the four Monarchies flouriſh
at once in there roſe and bloom, but one to be greater,
another leſſer, as all Rivers are not alike, nor can all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
be victors at one time.</p>
               <p>2. The Lord lands ſome children after three moneths,
ſucking, laughing, weeping; others live ſome days in the
Womb, and the Womb is their grave; yet often eternity
is a recompence for want of time, and that is Gold for Iron
and Copper; others ſail fourſcore and a hundred years,
and never find a gracious harbour: We fret, becauſe the
wicked live long and proſper; becauſe we forget that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
hath determined how many hours wicked men
ſhall laugh, how many talents or ſtone weights of the
Earth they ſhall have; and becauſe the Bride weeps, when
ſhall the night be gone? and the day dawn? and the King
come? there is a ſort of account rendred of this by <hi>John,</hi>

of his actions? <hi>Job</hi> 33. 11. this ounce of Gall muſt be in,

               <p>4. The Lord times his actions of deliverance well, when

               <p>1. IN regard of the Lord's manner of working. 2. And
of his end of working. 3. And of his omnipotent
arm. 4. Of his holineſs, he could not in greater wiſedom
have created things (for nothing can be added to infinite

of a worm,<note place="margin">

2. The foot ſhould not complain, why made he not me
the head? and the leaſt of. Stars, why made he me not the
Sun? nor the Earth ſay out of the lump of poor Nothing
out of the which I came, he might have made me the Globe
of the Heaven of Heavens, or an Angel, but he would not.</p>
               <p>3. Why made not God the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> as perfect as the
ſecond <hi>Adam?</hi> a houſe that can ſtand alone, is better
then an old houſe that needs aprop. O quarrel not, the
Vine tree is a more noble plant then the thorn, and the one
muſt be propped elſe it grows not. 2. The man <hi>Chriſt</hi> needs
influences of graces as well, as another man. 3. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
and glorified Spirits need the like; Man a houſe of
clay needs a pillar of excellent matter of the gold of free-grace
to hold him up in his actings.</p>
               <p>4. Why made he me not as holy as the man Chriſt?
why was this man born blind? O ceaſe, he who <hi>gives not
an account of any of his matters,</hi> when he made you a man
might have made you a ſnake or a ſtone; he is debter, of
two eyes, or of half an eye, of the loweſt gift or grace ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to no man; cloſe with all he does. That is an evil
wit that diſputes with God; Submiſſion, ſilent ſubmiſſion to
the hardeſt diſpenſation makes the child of God victorious;
we are above all things in conquering, when we are below
all things, in ſubmitting for the Lord.</p>
               <p>2. Job <hi>or any anſwer, Job</hi> 38. 8. Who ſhut up the Sea with
doors, as if it had iſſued out of the womb? <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. When I
made the cloud the garments thereof, and thick darkneſs a

<hi>give a reaſon of Eaſt and Weſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Lord puts forth Soveraignty on <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s arm
to dry it up, on <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi>'s feet, upon the mans eye-holes,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 9. that they ſhould be empty of eyes, on <hi>Judas</hi>
his bowels, on <hi>Job</hi>'s body ſmitten with boyls, his outgoings
of Soveraignty appear on the Fig-tree which he curſeth, on
the Gourd of <hi>Jonah,</hi> for he blaſts it, on the Fig-tree and
Vine-tree,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 7. Pſal. 75. 6.</note> for he marrs them, <hi>Joel</hi> 1. 4. As it pleaſeth him

another bit of clay behind the mill, where he ſweats and

               <p>5. <hi>Job</hi> gets no leave to ſwallow his ſpittle, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 19.
Precious <hi>Iſrael</hi> is plowed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. 1. and her back made

Amos 6. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Pſal. 73. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Except Soveraignty, what can ſilence the mind of one
who ſtumbles and doubts, and weeps, becauſe ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
are burnt in <hi>Sodom</hi> with fire, ſo many in the old
World are drowned with waters in the mothers womb and
the cradle, the young ſucking children of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> &amp;
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who never drew a ſword againſt the people of
God, could never bow their knee to the Idol <hi>God Pel,</hi> nor
ſtretch out their hands to him, periſh by the ſword, and
their heads daſht againſt ſtones? O they were guilty of ſin
original, yea and ſo were <hi>Moſes, David, Samuel, Noah, Job,</hi>
and <hi>Daniel</hi> when they were in the womb and weeping on
the breaſts.</p>
               <p>7. Soveraignty determines what is juſt; righteous <hi>Abel</hi>
dies in bloud, godly <hi>Joſiah</hi> in war, many bloody men ſmile
out their ſoul in peace; <hi>I took Sodom away</hi> (ſaith the Lord,
<hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 50.) <hi>as I ſaw good;</hi> a wall falls upon twenty

ſimple judgements as divided from ſin, prove nothing;
but how are we to ſtoop and tremble at holy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty?</p>
               <p>8. As touching gifts and graces much is to be ſeen of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.

wiſe, neither do the aged underſtand judgement.</hi> Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is a debt that God ows not to pay to <hi>Abſalom;</hi> nor
wiſedom to <hi>Achitophel</hi> more then to a ſtark fool, or to any
man who is born as a wild Aſs colt. This Soveraignty
gives faith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> meekneſs, to <hi>David</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
to <hi>Joſiah</hi> zeal, to <hi>Job</hi> patience, to the man <hi>Chriſt</hi> the
fulneſs of the Spirit above meaſure; there is more grace of
godly painfulneſs given to <hi>Paul</hi> then to the dayly eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of Chriſt; <hi>I laboured more abundantly then they all,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. you might have had wiſedom and uſed it, as
<hi>Achitophel;</hi> and yet ſaith one, <hi>God hath given me no more
grace, therefore let God blame God that I doe as I doe;</hi> if he
had given me more grace, I would have done better: and
if I had a heart according to the heart of God, I would
have been as holy, ſincere, and zealous as <hi>David;</hi> but he
denyed it to me, out of his abſolute Soveraignty, which is
far above my will and my ſtrength, influences of grace
both for the obtaining of the habits and the acts of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe practical Propoſitions are to be conſidered,<note place="margin">The ſhift of complaining of want of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences is refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>
1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. It is proud nature which ſaith, God is to be
blamed; for whether the Lord give, or withhold more
grace; holineſs and ſpotleſneſs doth eſſentially convey his
Soveraignty. Matth. 20. 15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to doe,
what I will, with mine own,</hi> ſaith he who is Almighty; For
he who is in an unſearchable way, above all law that binds
the Creature, can be ſubject to no blame. Suppoſe the
evil ſervant ſay, Matth. 25. 24. <hi>Lord, I knew thee, that thou
art an hard man, reaping where thou haſt not ſown, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
where thou haſt not ſtrowed;</hi> That is, thou ſeekeſt
much obedience, and a large harveſt, and ſoweſt upon my
heart little grace, and gave me but one talent; if thou
hadſt given me five talents, or two talents, I ſhould have
done as well as the ſervant who received five or two: but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119064:46"/>
thou didſt not any ſuch thing, therefore blame thy ſelf: and
ſo it is the very complaint of the very malignant ſervant;
as alſo the rich Gluttons divinity reflects upon the gracious
diſpenſation of <hi>God,</hi> Luke 16. 30. <hi>Nay father Abraham, but
if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent;</hi> Which
is, as much, as <hi>God</hi> is to be blamed, that his five brethren
repent not; for he beſtows not ſufficient helps of ſalvation
on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. What is the book of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets but a
paper roll of letters and ſyllables; would he ſend a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
from Hell, and a Meſſenger from Heaven to give them
ſufficient warning and inſtruction of a Heaven and a Hell,
it were good, but that he does not, he then is to be blamed;
not my five brethren. 2. He who ſhews mercy on whom
he will, and hardneth whom he will, and that by a ſtrong
mighty will which no man can reſiſt, he can find fault with
no man, though he ſin and harden his own heart; <hi>For his
abſolute Soveraign will is far above me and my ſtrength;</hi> but
ſo doth the Lord, ſaith the carnal man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. 19. and
the holy Ghoſt ſaith, ſuch an Objection is unworthy to be
moved or anſwered; nor becomes it baſe clay and the clay
pot ſo to argue with the great potter and former of all
things.</p>
               <p>2. Influences for getting of the habits or performing the
acts of ſaving grace, are the Lord's own; therefore Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
is his Law, he may beſtow them, or withhold them,
as he pleaſeth; eſpecially if the Creature be willing to want
theſe influences, and if the Sun rejoyce with all his heart
at the influences and concurring providences of God to the
contrary ſinful actings, as he doth; <hi>Exod. 5. 2, 8, 16, 17, 18.

of all under unbelief, and their guiltineſs, who are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and the myſtery of the Lord's rejecting the Jews
and calling the Gentiles, with the free obedience of the one
and free diſobedience of the other, and the Lord's having

mercy on whom he will, and hardning whom he will, with

<hi>Satan</hi> cannot deſtroy Satan, the body of ſin cannot love to

his Father, <hi>John</hi> 15. 24. and pleaſing himſelf in that way,
who yet complains that God doth withdraw his grace, and
ſo cannot command us, or exhort us to repentance, is like
to him who lies ſtill in the furnace, and loves to be burnt,

               <argument>
                  <p>1. Soveraignty in actings of grace, 2. We are not to
ſeek influences, but ſuch as are ſuitable to the Word.
3. Of divers influences. 4. How we complain of
want of influences, and how we may ſuit them. 5. We
are to act under indiſpoſitions. 6. How we are to
pray continualy. 7. Not to act duties while we feel
breathings of the Spirit is an unſafe Rule. 8. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
before Duties. 9. To wait on breathings
before we act Duties, how lawful, how not.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEt it be futher conſidered in theſe Particulars, how
unjuſt we are, and how free the Lord is.</p>
               <p>1. Who ever complains of the want of grace and yet
remains in the ſtate of nature, doth cloſe with his want of
grace.</p>
               <p>For 1. The renewed mans complaining of the want of
grace, is neither in ſenſe or godly feeling, nor in faith and
humble believing. Nature can no more complain of the
want of grace with any ſpiritual and godly ſenſe, then a
ſucking child can weep, becauſe he is not an underſtanding
man of thirty years old;<note place="margin">Nature cannot complain of the want of gracious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> for darkneſs cannot ſeek after
the Sun light, for ſo it ſhould deſire its own deſtruction;
nor can cold deſire heat, nor Satan be divided againſt
Satan, and therefore theſe are but feigned and counterfeit
bemonings; For the actings of ſinful nature with delight
ſay, that the man hates grace, which he profeſſeth, he ſo
much deſires; for only grace can thirſt after, and long for
grace. Joh. 15. 24. <hi>If I had not done among them the works
which no other man did, they had not had ſin: but now they
have both ſeen and hated both me and my Father.</hi> Such a
hatred of the fulneſs of grace, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> cannot conſiſt
with a lively deſire of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. It is a right Rule, not to ſeparate Soveraignty
from the Word, or the Omnipotency of grace from the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119064:47"/>
Promiſe, otherwiſe we make a ſort of Idol of Omnipotency;
ſeek we them and pray for influences of grace not perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily
<hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> to every ſingle acting,<note place="margin">We are not to ſeek Influences of life ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the word.</note> Pſal. 119. 2. <hi>My ſoul
cleaveth to the duſt: quicken thou me according to thy word.</hi>
Ver. 28. <hi>My ſoul melteth for heavineſs: ſtrengthen thou me
according to thy word.</hi> Ver. 107. <hi>I am afficted very much,
quicken thou me according to thy word,</hi> v. 154.</p>
               <p>For 1. A gracious heart ſeeks no other out-lettings of
grace to this or that duty, but according to the promiſe;
Now the promiſe is not contrary to the Soveraign diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and there is no ſuch Soveraignty, but that there are
many withdrawings of God, whence follows deadneſs and
the ſouls melting for heavineſs; Nor is there either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
or diſpenſation, that the belever ſhall, in every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time, be lively and vigorous, and have the heart
lifted up in the ways of God; except we would ſay, Earth is
Heaven, and we are not <hi>for a time in heavineſs, if need be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is a baſtard literal heat and vigor of going
about duties that comes not from the Word; no baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat
comes from the Word, but by accident; for the Spirit
that ſpeaks in the Word, ſpeaks his own ſpiritual and lively
comforts and actings; not that which may flow from a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is common to <hi>Seneca</hi> and other humane Writers,
and the Prophets, though even the ſtyle, livelineſs, majeſty
and divinity that may be ſeen in the letter of the Scripture
are eminently above the like in other Writers; The Spirit
immediately inſpiring, and the Spirit quickning in the
Word, are both the ſame Spirit that Chriſt promiſed to
ſend, <hi>John</hi> 16. of which Chriſt, <hi>ver. 14. He ſhall glorifie me,
he ſhall receive of mine</hi> (a word moſt myſterious) <hi>and ſhall
ſhew it unto you;</hi> and believers are afraid that their hearts
receive ſome other quickning between the ſound of the
Word, and the actings of the Lord upon their hearts, which
cauſeth them to pray for no quickning, but according to
the Word.</p>
               <p>The like may 3. be ſaid of the ſalvation of the Lord,
Pſal. 91. 16. <hi>I will ſhew him my ſalvation.</hi> Iſa. 12. 2. <hi>For the
Lord Jehovah is my ſtrength and my ſong, he alſo is become
my ſalvation.</hi> Pſal. 119. 170. <hi>Let my ſupplication come before
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119064:48"/>
thee, deliver me according to thy word;</hi> for we are apt to
ſeek ſtrange and whoriſh influences; the like whereof the
Lord beſtows not upon his people, Pſal. 119. 132. <hi>Look thou
upon me and be merciful unto me, as thou uſes to doe to thoſe
that love thy name.</hi> Pſal. 106. 4. <hi>Remember me, O Lord, with the

<hi>Epheſ. 1. 7. Col.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>Yea and 7. We could be ſatisfied with dumb and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
influences and inſpirations contrary unto, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the Word, as <hi>Evah, Gen. 3. 4, 5, 6. 1 Kings
13. 18. Matth.</hi> 4. 3, 6, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>8. What could the powerful influences of God Creator
ſeparated from Chriſt the treaſure-houſe of love and mercy
doe to us? and if Omnipotency were ſeparated from the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119064:48"/>
promiſes of the Goſpel, could it ſave us, in the Lord's way?
through the bloud of Chriſt; for power in God cannot
(to ſpeak ſo) ſave men, but by the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, the
only ſaving Name under Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. nor can Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
work a redemption now in this Goſpel-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
but that which is by bloud, Epheſ. 1. 7. Col. 1. 13.
<hi>And that which is to declare the righteouſneſs of God for the
remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Power acts by way of compleat ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the <hi>exceeding greatneſs of God's power to us-ward
who believe,</hi> is of the ſame ſize with the <hi>mighty power which
raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and ſet him on the right-hand of
God in heavenly places,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 14, 20. The power of
tranſlating a ſinner from Satans Kingdome to the Kingdom
of the Son of his love works as acted (as it were) and ſet on
work to act righteouſly to tranſlate no man, but the perſon
for whom a ranſome of bloud is given to juſtice, as the
Princes right power is only for the good of free and legal
ſubjects, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13. and that all power in Heaven
and Earth to ſave, <hi>Matth. 28. 18. John 17. 2. Matth.</hi> 11. 27.
and that Kingly and Royal power to give repetance to
<hi>Iſrael</hi> and forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. to forgive ſins,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 6. to raiſe and quicken the dead, <hi>John</hi> 5. 26, 28,
29. is a power (in a way) purchaſed by the bloud of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,
Rom. 14. 9. <hi>For to this end Chriſt both dyed and
roſe, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> And
by the way, its a righteous power over all fleſh and in
Heaven and Earth, though he died not for all fleſh, and for
all the Angels in Heaven, and all the men on Earth; it
were ſtrange to ſay Chriſt died for the reprobate, and not
for their ſins and final unbelief and rejecting of Chriſt, to
obtain a power to pardon ſome of their ſins, and not all,
and to give them repentance from ſome dead works, and
not from all dead works; and to purge them from ſome,
but not from all their ſins.</p>
               <p>3. Its moſt unjuſt to lay the blame of our ſinful omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
upon holy Soveraignty, becauſe he withdraws influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:
For 1. That is to reproach God, this is like the
malecontentedneſs of Satan and of Hell: for the damned
complain that ever they were born, and that they cannot
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119064:49"/>
be annihilated, and that hils and mountains cover them not
quick in ſoul and body; yea they ſtorm and rage becauſe
God gives them a being capable of eternal woe. 2. The
wakened conſciences of men out of Chriſt often fall upon
this recrimination; the gnawing of conſcience of <hi>Judas,</hi> is,
<hi>I have ſinned;</hi> and of the young man, Prov. 5. 12. <hi>How
have I hated inſtruction? and my heart diſpiſed reproof?</hi>
Yet it is a more commendable complaining and more
hopeful to complain of ſinful neglect of means, then of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
permiſſive providence of ſin upon the Lord's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of gracious influences, but conſcience in its kindly
acting is the tormenting worm that eats ſelf. No Divel
alledges this; its true, Satan bites at providence; God
hedges about a hypocrite, <hi>Job.</hi> and God commends him
(ſays he) Chriſt torments us before the time: Satan
trembles and frets at the exiſtence of God, and that God
is above him, <hi>Joh 1. 9, 10. Matth. 8. 29. Jam.</hi> 2. 19. and
ſo all his words to Chriſt ſpeak a barking at providence,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 4. its wrong that the Son of God ſhould want
bread; it is an uſeleſs providence that the man Chriſt go
down ſtairs; for God (ſaith he) ſhould ſave him though he
throw himſelf down headlong. Satan is a better Maſter,
who gives all the Kingdomes of the World to his Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
then <hi>God,</hi> who denies Bread to his own wel-beloved
Son; thus doth Satan, but in another kind, fret. So
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. its a bad providence that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> are not
as knowing as God, and <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 34. What have we to doe
with <hi>Chriſt?</hi> But may not conſcience accuſe providence
in the Lord's withdrawing of grace, eſpecially being
wakened?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Conſcience of Divels and the Damned is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned
either penally or ſinfully; theſe may be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
here; the Conſcience as <hi>penally</hi> wakned by the Judge,
primarily gnaws and torments it ſelf for ſin as puniſhed;
<hi>I have ſinned</hi> ſaith <hi>Judas,</hi> and he caſts down the ſeven
pieces, feeling the worm; but as the Conſcience is ſinfully
wakned by it ſelf in blaſpheming the God of Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi>
16. 9, 11. becauſe of pain, it alſo frets againſt providence, but
is is not pain'd for the want of ſaving grace and holy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119064:49"/>
which might have prevented ſin; yea their blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of God eternally, is a ſeal and a cloſeing with the ſtate
of unrenewed nature which is never moved for ſin, but
wreſtles againſt the providence which ſometime did permit
ſin,<note place="margin">How we may lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of grace; and how we may lawfully deſire Influences.</note> which now hath ſuch tormenting conſequences though
the conſcience in the mean time being taken with the Iuſtre
and apparent good in ſin, did alſo cloſe with the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſin, and with providence opening the way to tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 15. and ſeek ſuch a providence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 11,
12. and embrace it, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 10, 11. yet is there ſaving
good in a regulated ſpiritual complaining of the want of
ſaving influences;</p>
               <p>So as 1. They be not looked on as miſdeeds of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and we ſay not the Lord might have lent me the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
to ſuch a ſelf-denying death as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s journey
in aiming to ſacrifice his only ſon for God, but he would
not.</p>
               <p>2. Its good if there be a holy ſubmiſſive complaining of
the want of gracious influences, as terminated upon duties,
Iſa. 63. 17. <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us to erre from thy
ways? and hardened our hearts from thy fear?</hi> and not
looked on, as withdrawings of meer providence. Though
there be a holy claimbring to God, ver. 19. <hi>we are thine;</hi>
yet we are ſo thine, as thy grace is Soveraign; <hi>Thou never
beareſt rule over them, they were not called by thy name,</hi> and
yet no praiſe or thanks to <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they were called by
his Name rather then the Heathen.</p>
               <p>3. We may pray for, and ſo earneſtly ſuit and deſire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
as <hi>Draw me; quicken me, encline my heart, unto thy
teſtimonies;</hi> Therefore we may pray againſt withdrawings
of influences, as ſad privations of dreadful conſequents;
and ſo much is held forth in that Petition <hi>lead us not unto
temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Yet ſo, as there is no deſerving in us of having eyes to
ſee, and ſpiritual influences to ſee, to hear, to perceive
with a new heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 2, 3. as its not the merit of one
part of the Earth, the South, that it lie nearer the Sun then
another Northern part; nor the good deſerving of one
Horſe that he wear a golden Saddle and a ſilken Bridle,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119064:50"/>
rather than another: this would be minded; <hi>What am I
Lord?</hi> as it was Chriſt's mind to cry down works in point
of ſalvation, yet not to cry down all actings by way of
duty in the New-covenant way. Therefore 5. ſince
grace may be deſired (and all gracious influences are
grace;) ſo is there a conformity betwixt the believers will
ſuiting influences, and the revealed and approving will of
God (I ſay not his high decree and ordaining will;) for
ſure New-Teſtament or New-Covenant prayers, new oyl,
and new ſupply of grace, do import a freſh ſupply and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of influences, to be furniſhed to believers; &amp; eſpecially
ſince we may pray, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name in me, thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
come to me; thy will be done</hi> (by me) <hi>in the Earth, is
it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. We may and ought to ſuit of God what the Lord
promiſeth in the Covenant of grace; but the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to beſtow predeterminating grace in this Covenant,<note place="margin">The faultineſs in not praying is not becauſe the holy Spirit moves us not to pray, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſtir not up our ſelvs to pray.</note> as
after ſhall be cleared. Now the faultineſs of this, <hi>I will
not pray, untill the Spirit act upon me, and move me to pray,</hi>
is ſeen in that it importeth that the moral ground of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not, the command of God, <hi>pray continually,</hi> and that
command (<hi>call upon me in the day of trouble</hi>) which is moſt
falſe; for another warrant for all moral obedience, then
precept, promiſe or practiſe, can no man give; yea it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
that the warrant of prayer is the influence of grace;
Now the influence of grace is the efficient helping cauſe, not
the rule, not the objective cauſe of either our praying or
any acts of our obedience. Yea it is the way of <hi>Enthyſiaſts</hi>
to make divine impulſions, and not the word of precept the
Rule of our obedience.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">This (I will not pray untill the Lord firſt breath on me by his Spirit) is a wide miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</note> This (<hi>I will not pray untill the Spirit firſt act upon me</hi>)
muſt have either this ſenſe, I will not pray untill the Lord
firſt give a praying diſpoſition, or, untill the Lord firſt
actually breath upon me. This latter ſaith indeed, I will
not pray until I pray; for the Lord's actual influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
praying. The former cannot be ſaid; For there is
no warrant to diſobey the command (<hi>pray continually</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
I get a new diſpoſition from Heaven; for then might
all praying of the renewed be ſhifted, and the three Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119064:50"/>
in the garden might have ſaid to Chriſt, our Maſter
bids us pray, but <hi>we are heavy with ſleep and indiſpoſed, and
cannot pray, and ſo muſt we be excuſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Upon the ſame account, <hi>Magus,</hi> Acts 8. 21. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unrenewed men ſhould ſhift the command of praying;
for while we be tranſlated, out of nature to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of grace, we want the habit of grace and ſpirit of
adoption by which only we can pray acceptably.</p>
               <p>3. How unſavoury ſhall this be? a man falls over a
Bridge and is a drowning, another is going to the place of
Execution to die, another is ſick to death, all of them may
by this ſhift ſay, we muſt not pray leſt we take the Name of
God in vain, untill the Spirit breath upon us heavenly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
of ſpeaking in the Spirit to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. This ſhift cannot ſtand to ſuſpend praying, until the
Spirit breath from on high; for we are to pray for the ſpirit's
breathing, and for teaching, quickning, enlarging of
heart that we may pray and praiſe, <hi>Pſal. 51. 15. Pſal.</hi> 119.
36, 37, 40, 48. Wind fetches wind here, and fire begets
fire, as cold flint creates hot fire: ſo the Atheiſts, let
them pray that can pray; I'me no Miniſter; But it hath
this, <hi>I am ready to pray,</hi> but the blame of my not praying,
<hi>is to be laid on the Spirit,</hi> for the wind blows not; but this
is but witty lazineſs, as when the Sea-man will ſleep and
attempt no Sea-voyage, and lay the blame, which is his fall,

he is but a ſleeper; not a Husband-man who for bears plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſowing upon the account only that he finds not a

to plow ſpiritually as a Chriſtian; <hi>He who obſerves the
wind ſhall not ſow: and he that regardeth the clouds ſhall not
reap,</hi> Eccl. 11. 4. So are we to refer to his holy Soveraignty
the flowings of the Spirit, and to ſet about holy duties, as if
theſe flowings were in our power;<note place="margin">The precept chargeth us to obey as rational creatures not as diſpoſed or indiſpoſed.</note> We are to know that the
command and precept of ſpiritual duties is laid on us, as we
are reaſonable creatures as hearers of the Goſpel, not under
the reduplication as ſpiritually or not ſpiritually diſpoſed;
as the Creditor and the Law charge men to pay their juſt
debts, not as they are poor, or rich, but as they are deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119064:51"/>
yea precepts from the Lord bind the creature as the
creature, and moral precepts bind Men and Angels as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to obey, though not fit and diſpoſed. Therefore
muſt we here diſtinguiſh betwixt nature capable or having
at any time power to obey; and the real, or (as it were)
the phyſical aptitude and idoneous diſpoſition to obey.
The latter takes not away the obligation to pray or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
<hi>David</hi>'s being overclouded with a temptation is
not an excuſe of adultery and murther; nor is he thereby
freed from praying; <hi>Lord, lead me not into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 1. Under indiſpoſitions moral we rejoyce, that ſinful
indiſpoſitions do befriend us, and ſmile upon us to promote
ſin; as ſome love them well who counſel them, and joyn
with them in drunkenneſs, and are their brethren in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
ſo do we foment indiſpoſitions, and welcome and
fatten them, and do not violence to our corruption, and
deadneſs, and heardneſs; and ſome expone falſe light, to
be God's ſecret and virtual approving Will they ſhould
commit the ſin; as <hi>Evah ſaw the fruit that it was good for
food, and that it was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to be
deſired to make one wiſe.</hi> Gen. 3. 6. Here <hi>Evah</hi> ſubſtitutes
the tentation in place of the precept, and falſe light foſters
and cheriſheth a ſinful luſt and a wicked diſpoſition to ſin.
It is a ſort of tempting of the tempting diſpoſition, whereas
is were good to complain under a ſinful diſpoſition as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the bondage of a part of the body of ſin, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. for a ſinful diſpoſition is but a branch and bud of
the body of ſin which we are to wreſtle againſt, as a moſt
dangerous oppoſite to ſpiritual obedience. Indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
a ſpiritual diſpoſition to pray or praiſe, or hope, goes
along with the command. Now the obligation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to praiſe is ever one, and its good when the man can
ſay, <hi>My heart is fixed, I will praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to wait on the Lord lies ever on; it is a rich mercy
when the diſpoſition goes along with the command; as

no means, muſt the word or conſcience of the command of
God be laid aſide; For as the phyſical facility comes from
the ſpirit's holy impulſion, and ſpiritual warmneſs that is on;
ſo the ſavoury and gracious morality flows from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

the moral or obediential part is from the command,

ſo, no Scripture ſaith, <hi>Stand ſtill and act no duties until the

ſay no obeying of God is to be gone about, until feeling of
the breathings of the Spirit go before faith, and praying,
and all duties: and what is this but a tying of the ſpirit to
our ſpiritual ſenſes? men then cannot be accuſed nor

<hi>Now the Spirit's drawings we never felt,</hi> and this were
to render the Word of God uſeleſs; its enough to us, the
command cries to the conſcience, the voice of the Lord
ſounds in the Word, and none can alledge any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
actings of the Spirit; As alſo how ſhall the feelings of
the Spirit be known but by the Word? and the Spirit not
ſimply, but the ſpirit with the word is the only Guide,
ſince we are bidden, try the ſpirits whether they are of
God, or not, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. and as hard it were to put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
ones to ſuch a method; it were to render Duties
ſuſpicious and dangerous, and to condemn Scripture-light,
as guilty of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>2. We are now after Scripture is cloſed, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Canon given to us, to follow no duty but what is
warranted by the Word, and that the Spirit alone works
not by the Word, it muſt then be wild-corn, and no part
of the Lord's husbandry, and ſo not from the Lord: that
we are not to pray, while firſt we feel the actings of the
Spirit, for that poſition is both beſide, and contrary to the
Word. Something might be ſaid for this, we are not to eat
while we feel hunger, nor to ſleep while we feel drouzineſs,
though if eating and ſleeping be looked on as duties, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear the weight of Scriptural truth; yet to look to fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as a Rule before we obey a Command of God, and
to make the feelings of breathings our Rule hath no colour
of truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 4. It may be looked on as another extremity to
look to no actings,<note place="margin">Preparation before prayer.</note> nor diſpoſitions of the heart before we
pray; for though the diſpoſition of the heart be no rule
morally obliging us, yet to fall upon duties looking only to
the Rule, knowing the duty is a duty and ſutable to the
Rule, and no more but to flie to acting in our own ſtrength
is not good.</p>
               <p>For 1. It is required, that beſide it be an uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
duty, other Spiritual and Evangelick circumſtances
would be conſidered, as whether <hi>Jehu</hi> intend the honour of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119064:53"/>
God in killing the Prieſts of <hi>Baal;</hi> whether the intended
honour of God breath upon Phariſees, in praying, and in
almes-giving, or if only a thirſt to be ſeen of men, do blow
the trumpet and encourage men to the work.</p>
               <p>2. The frame of the heart in doing would be looked
to, as we ſuppoſe <hi>Eliſha</hi> did right in that he would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
while as a paſſion of Anger was upon him, and
therefore called for a Miniſtrel to ſing a Pſalm, and then the
Spirit of the Lord acted upon him; and whether, while
wrath is on, pure hands can be lifted up to God, ſee
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. poſſible out of eager oppoſition to <hi>Enthyſiaſts</hi>
and <hi>Libertines</hi> we run on another extreme, that we ruſh on
duties upon no other account, but only the Scripture is
clear, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> and that warranted us
to eat at the Lord's Supper prepared or not prepared, but
to ruſh on the dutie while ſome preparation or ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
go before is clear againſt another command of God,
<hi>Let a man try and examine himſelf and ſo let him eat;</hi> ſome
duties are of that nature, that <hi>ex natura rei</hi> of themſelves
they require fixed preparations, as the Prieſts ſanctifying
of themſelves, and theſe who offered before they came to
the Altar, <hi>Pſal. 26. 6. Exod.</hi> 40. 31 but whether this may
warrant none to pray, while they firſt prepare themſelves
to pray, before they pray, by praying, and ſo that prayer
which is preparatory muſt be prepared by another prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
prayer; and ſo, without end, ſpiritual preparations
muſt <hi>in infinitum</hi> go on before ſpiritual preparations is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </p>
               <p>3. The very ſinful habit and power is reproved in the

               </p>
               <p>The habitual blindneſs and hardneſs of heart that
may be in ſleeping men, the ſtate of non-regeneration, and
the ſtate of death and of uncircumciſion of heart, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<hi>Eph. 2. 1, 2. 3. Col. 1. 13. 14. Pſal.</hi> 14. 3. their poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

9. 26. the ſinful frame of the heart, <hi>Gen. 6. 5. Gen.</hi> 8. 21.
Hence, of force it muſt follow, that this is no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
the ſleeping man or ſwooning man, acting and
committing no actual guiltineſs, and making no uſe of free-will,
is guilty and rebukable before God, as the ſleeping
Wolf is bloudy,<note place="margin">The Lord's withdrawing of influences is conjoyned with our guiltineſs, and cannot found an honeſt excuſe for not praying.</note> the ſleeping Lion is cruel, becauſe of the
bloudy and cruel nature, that is inherently in both, when
neither of them do actually devour; ſo though influences
to the material acts of ſin, be not in our power, yet, ſince we
lodge that ſinful power, and virtually (as is ſaid) conſent
to want the breathings of God, and conſent that the ſinful
acts have houſ-room, in the ſleeping man, we are thence guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon that account, though we ſleep and are patient in
carrying ſinful powers, and ſinful acts now inherent in us,
and the withdrawing of influences of grace upon the ſame
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119064:55"/>
account, cannot be an honeſt excuſe; why, I pray not?
yea the wicked impotency, and indiſpoſition, and the three
Diſciples drouzineſs, and ſleepineſs the ſame way phyſical,
being on them in the night, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. is a new guiltineſſe
moral, (for Chriſt commanded watching in vigorouſneſſe
then) and their actual not praying, is another guiltineſs.</p>
               <p>3. Under withdrawings of influences of grace we are
guilty.<note place="margin">The Lord's not giving a new heart is not our ſin, and yet our not having a new heart is our guiltineſs.</note> 1. In not <hi>conſidering the temptation, ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
we ſee and hear, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 3. yea though the Lord's
not giving a new heart, be not our ſin formally; yet our
not having, nor receiving of a new heart, is our ſin. The
ſowrneſs and naughtineſs of the Earth in bringing forth
poyſonable weeds, is the Earth's own indiſpotion; the Sun
and Clouds extract theſe poyſonable herbs; the natural
drineſs of ſome rocky Earth and the not raining of the
clouds meet both in one, to wit, the barrenneſs of the earth;
and this takes not away the faultineſs of this earth ſo rocky.
2. Our guiltineſs that appears is evident, in our eik which
we make to original and natural malice; for acquired pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
meets with natural and original corruption, like two
floods to make a Sea or a great River; or as when a man
forceth a wound to bleed, which of it ſelf would bleed:
And again, what ever may be ſaid of the reſult of the Lord's
withdrawing of influences, we add an impulſion to his
withdrawing, as the adding of the heat of an Oven neer
the root of a fruit tree, to cauſe it to ripen, adds ſomething
to the heat of the Sun, and the Influences of the Heavens,
and when <hi>the heart walketh after the heart of our deteſtable
things,</hi> as it is <hi>Ezech.</hi> 11. 21. and with the intended benſil
of the free-will, we put our ſeal and conſent to the Lord's
withdrawing; there is no ground to complain of his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But does not the Lord's withdrawing of his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
ſince without his concurrence of that kind our act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are impoſſible, doe violence to free-will, which muſt
be indifferent to act or not to act, to doe or not to doe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a weak reaſon; for to our willing the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God is natural, and ſo is it to our nilling; the Lord

                  </gap>akes his influences, and the withdrawing thereof conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119064:56"/>
to all our actions to both willing and to nilling: dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and barrenneſs is as connatural to the tree as budding
and fruit-bearing, if God add his influences either to the
one or to the other;<note place="margin">The Lord's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences are connatural to all our actings, and how.</note> yea, ſince the Lord's concurrence is
ſutable to the nature of ſecond cauſes, the fire leaves not off
to be fire, nor is its nature deſtroyed, if the Lord withdraw
his influence, ſo that the fire burns not the three children:
nor is violence done to nature, by the Lord's joyning of his
influence to the fire to burn in acts of righteouſneſs or of ſin;
there is ſtill nilling and willing. And ſuppoſe that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
choſe to die a violent death, for the confirming of the
truth, there is no violence done to free will; nay, there is no
miracle in the Lord's concurring to the material acts of ſin.</p>
               <p>2. To have dominion over the Soveraignty of God is no
part of the creatures liberty,<note place="margin">Our actings have no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Lord's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, but contrarily.</note> but only it is free in order to
its own actings; nor is it eſſential to the free-will of Men
or Angels, or any creature to have the influences of God in
its power or at hand; As it is no part of the Sun's power
of yielding light, or of the fires quality of caſting heat to
have dominion and command over the influences of God
the ſupreme and firſt cauſe: but the Lord hath ſo a dominion
over ſecond cauſes, both in acts natural and ſupernatural,
that his influence as Midwife ever attends (ſaving his holy
Soveraignty) the bringing forth of all births, and effects
of ſecond cauſes. So as in the free-wills moral actings
the not acting of free-will, or the marring of the birth
of new obedience to a law of God is never from the Lord's
phyſical withdrawing of his influence, as from a culpable
cauſe; but the ſinfulneſs of the action is ever from our own
ſinful withdrawing of our will from under the moral ſway
of the holy command of <hi>God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſin of the creature is not from the Lords withdrawing of his phyſical influences, but from our with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from his moral command.</note> and let it be a myſtery how
the <hi>Lord</hi> withdraws his concurrence, as being above a law,
&amp; he is holy and ſpotleſs in ſo doing, and how we are under
a law and ſinfully guilty in that we love to want his holy
influence, and its our ſin, and he loves to withdraw his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence;
and it is his holy Soveraignty. Both which are
clear in Scripture, if we confeſs that we are debters to the
Lord, and to his juſt Law, and his holy Soveraignty, in
that he yieldeth his influences, and in his having mercy on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119064:56"/>
whom he will, and in hardning whom he will, in the Lord's
drawing of men or his not drawing of them to Chriſt; in
revealing the Goſpel myſtery ſavingly to whom he will,
<hi>Rom. 9. 18. John 6. 44, 63. Matth,</hi> 11. 26, 27. nor can the
Lord be a debter to the Creature in theſe. And this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie

               <p>1. Why then doth God find fault and rebuke and eternally
refuſe the ſo called? for if they were called with that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power that others are called with, ſure they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and come: but they are not ſo called; therefore God
cannot blame us, &amp; find the fault in unbelievers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 18. 19.</p>
               <p>2. If <hi>God</hi> ſo call ſome as they obey, and others as they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
not, becauſe he will, who can reſiſt his will? his will is
as himſelf: then do we reject God's calling, and eternally
periſh, becauſe God ſo doth will? Now not any ever brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
moved any ſuch Objections, but the carnal <hi>Jew</hi> in
<hi>Paul</hi>'s time, and the <hi>Socinians, Jeſuits,</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> in the
age we now live in, and ſtumblers at the word; for all ſuch
enemies to grace, turn the Objection into an argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the abſolute will, and invincible grace of God, and
anſwer not with the holy Ghoſt, who <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. calls it a bold

muſt be of the ſame ſtamp with the fleſhly <hi>Jews,</hi> who thus
object againſt us, and ſuch are the Patrons of univerſal grace
and free-will. Hence let that be diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p>1. Would God give me grace I would be a man according
to God's heart, as well as David.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> 2. I was born in ſin and I cannot have more grace

               <p>3. Would God give me a new power, I would run; now
this power he denyes to me, and gives to many.</p>
               <p>That this ſpecial practical doubt may be fully removed.</p>
               <p>1. A word to the Objector. 2. To the Objection.</p>
               <p>To the Objector 1. <hi>If the Lord had given me the ſame
grace that he gave</hi> David,<note place="margin">The objection of many, if God would give me influences of grace as he did to David, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp;c. I would be as holy as any, diſcuſſed.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſhould run as</hi> David. 1. It is
of much concernment, who moves the Objection, whether
a Convert, or a non-convert: it is commendable in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but in an unhumbled non-convert, it is ſenſeleſs.
If the ſenſe be, <hi>had the Lord beſtowed on me the grace habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

man according to the Lord's heart, as well as David.</hi> No
thanks, no praiſe or glory to <hi>David,</hi> that he is a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to God's heart; True; and therefore no guilt is
upon the Objector, nor is any puniſhment due to him that
he remains in curſed nature; this follows not.</p>
               <p>2. The ſenſe is;<note place="margin">The non-ſenſe of this had I more grace, I ſhould be more gracious.</note> had I grace I ſhould be a gracious man:
what is this but I would have been a convert, if God had
made me a convert.</p>
               <p>But 1. The Objector ſays no more, then the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
had the Lord made us Divels to be elect Angels, and
confirmed us in grace, then ſhould we have been elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
So might <hi>Judas</hi> have ſaid, had grace made me the

ſuppoſition, will neither be bread to feed him, nor a web to

O, if I had bread, and ſuch empty deſires cannot feed an

hunger; but there is not a right eſteem of bread, there is
no wiſe life-hunger, ſuch as is in living men.</p>
               <p>3. It were good that the Objector were humbled, and
did lie at the water ſide, and complain, oh if his Ship
would fetch me over, and his wind would blow: <hi>Who ſhall
deliver me? what ſhall I doe?</hi> were he loathing his own
ways, and highly in love with ſuch ways of godlineſs, as

feeds upon ſuch aſhes.</p>
               <p>4. The Objector would be convinced of his backward
deſires:<note place="margin">O if I had more grace I would labour and run more, is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ſpeech in the ſluggard.</note>

kind of being is delighted with its own being; the Serpent
hath not a deſire or a real love to be turned into a man,
nor would a Lion be turned into a Lamb, nor a Divel into
an elect Angel; that deſire is contrary to the malice he

would not be deſtroyed by an habit of grace; nor doth an

child of God; nor one tormented in Hell really will to be a
holy Saint in Heaven; he only would be an eaſed and
painleſs man, and ſeeks not to be free of blaſpheming God.

Natural wiſedom is not uſed for Chriſt, but againſt

much riches, I would build Churches, Bridges, Hoſpitals,
entertain many Poor, erect Schools and Colledges; Now,
have the loyns of the poor and naked bleſſed you for any

God ſeeks of no man above that he hath, or according to
what he hath not: and if you fail in what you have, what

and many go off that way many miles on the North

ſaith, there is not a Bridge over this River, but we mnſt

grace, to <hi>Noah,</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> would
have given you all the actual influences to eſchew the ſlips
of infirmities, which theſe men committed; and except you
ſuppoſe this, you muſt lean upon the habit of grace, which
is but a creature, and ſo muſt not have the room of God.
Now if you have not any ſuch habit, your hope muſt be a

profuſely in the ſervice of ſin; and theſe affections might
ſerve much in a way of honouring God: And its a pity
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119064:60"/>
that <hi>woulding</hi> and <hi>wiſhing</hi> is the All of many mens religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
had I more grace, I would more honour God. Which
is retorted, 1. Had I more habitual grace, and a richer
talent, I would more diſhonour God; Some have a great
ſtock, and ſin more terribly againſt the received mercy of
habitual grace. 2. Its retorted, Had I more of nature and
of natural parts, I ſhould doe more for God; but more of
nature you have, and what doe you? Is it not thus? had I
the wings of an Eagle, I would flie. But theſe wings you
have, and you lie, and you creep; you doe but ſlumber
and ſleep in the ways of God, you flie not. 3. Why is not
this ſaid, Had I more corruption (as it is eaſie to gain here,
and doe evil, and wax worſe and worſe) I ſhould run with
Divels and Reprobate men, from evil to worſe; for this is
a truth, had I the acquired blinded mind of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and
trayterous heart of <hi>Judas,</hi> I ſhould be worſe then they. If
it be ſaid there is not the like reaſon between nature, and
grace; for one habit of ſaving grace helps to make the will
ſtronger, and more bent to gracious actings, then gifts or
common parts or natural parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true; the habit of ſaving grace makes the ſoul
readier to act ſavingly for God. Saving grace doth more
ſtrongly effect the will in an habitual way,<note place="margin">Faith and Grace doe not depend upon extraordinary means, and teachers ſent from hell; and we are much deceived, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, Had we more grace, we ſhould be more gracious.</note> for gracious acts;
But no habit either of grace or nature can actuate it ſelf;
and therefore it is preſumption in a way of relying on the
habit of grace to promiſe much to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>8. Had I extraordinary helps of a teacher ſent from Hell,
I would believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We believe not the word ſpoken by Angels, the
Law, nor the word ſpoken by the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. and <hi>Heb.
12. 25. For if they eſcaped not, who refuſed him who ſpake
on Earth; much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away
from him who ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi> Chriſt came from
Heaven and out of the boſome of the Father, and hath
preached Heaven and Hell to us; for he had experience of
wrath, anſwerable to the pain of Hell.</p>
               <p>2. This is no other ſhift, then that of the rich man in the
Parable, Luk. 16. 30. <hi>Nay, father</hi> Abraham, <hi>if one went
to them from the dead, they will repent.</hi> Now repentance
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119064:60"/>
flows not from the Preachers experience, though he had
ſeen and felt the pains of Hell, or the joys of Heaven; nor
doth the experience of Heaven's joy or Hell's torment, heal
the broken and wounded will; and the rich man's divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
hath been the ſame with <hi>Pelagians</hi> way, that if the
word be feelingly and dexterouſly propoſed, it can waken
up the ſleeping free will; and repentance is a work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if the fire be dexterouſly blown upon, it will certainly
flame, and all depends upon the running and willing of
his five brethren.</p>
               <p>Now common grace, free will, and natural ability, at
beſt is but a potency; the actual ſtirring of ſaving grace
muſt extract, and (to ſpeak ſo) milk out of the very ſaving
habit, acts of ſound believing, and repenting, or then the
will and the habit muſt lie dead: far more is this true in
natural powers and common graces.</p>
               <p>Now in all this our Saviour anſwers well the whole
doubt;<note place="margin">If free will be weak in the improving a natural power it will be ſo in the improving of ſupernatural grace.</note> he that is not faithful in little, can he be faithful
in much? Luke 16. 11. <hi>If therefore ye have not been faithful
in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your truſt the
true riches?</hi> Verſe 12. <hi>And if ye have not been faithful in
that which is another mans, who ſhall give you that which is
your own?</hi> Our Saviour reaſons moſt ſtrongly, <hi>Joh. 3. 12. If
I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how ſhall ye
believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</hi> He that is not able to
bear a burden of the weight of one pound, would he bear
a burden of a thouſand talents? So he, <hi>If the Lord had
given me ten talents, I ſhould have equalled</hi> David <hi>or</hi> Paul, <hi>or
the beloved diſciple</hi> John, <hi>in grace and holineſs.</hi> Now ye
have not improved two talents, but digged them in the
Earth: For it is not here as in earthly things; mow a
Meadow twelve times in one year, and after thrice mowing
ye ſhall have but little: take continually away from a
deep fountain, and draw water from it night and day, at
length it ſhall be ebb or dry; but act and improve the
habit of grace, and the more it ſhall grow, and encreaſe:
And its certain, grace can waken up ſleeping free will, but
free will cannot ſtir up grace; death cannot make uſe of
life, but life can work upon deadneſs.</p>

and (I) and (ſelf) free-will opens the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi>

conſider, had you the influences of grace at your diſpoſing;
1. Then, might free will bar the Iron door, againſt ſin;
that ſin of Angels and men, without free wills good leave
ſhould never enter the world. And the Creature ſhould be
more Maſter and Lord Governour over providence, then
the Soveraign Lord himſelf: then could the Lord erect no
theatre, nor ſet a Chair of free-grace to the Mediator and
Lord of grace, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> while firſt he took Counſel with
created free will, and ſay, O creature may I have thy good
leave to ſend my Son to the world, and the diſeaſe muſt be
conſulted, ſhall there be ſuch a precious one, as the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
the healer of ſinners? Its true, no ſinner, no Saviour;
no loſt one, no Redeemer, ſuch as our <hi>Emanuel;</hi> but its
known, if influences of grace be, (as Pelagianizing univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
ſay) at the diſpoſing of nature, with that abſolute indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
the free creature may ſtand, or may fall, let the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governing
Lord doe his beſt to the contrary: there is here a
created Soveraign dominion; If God create the creature
free, it involves a contradiction, that God ſhould be free to
hold out or bring in ſin, and hell, and miſery, and God is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119064:61"/>
indifferent (except man muſt irrevocably periſh) to ſend his
Son in the fleſh, to ſaue finners: and ſuch a providence
might have been, if mans free will had ſo been pleaſed to
diſpoſe of its own free acts, and of the influences of God,
there ſhould for ever have been no Saviour, no Emanuel,
no declared free grace, no gracious deſign in God to open
experimentally to Men and Angels the wonder of Chriſt
and free grace; but that muſt come upon the Soveraign
Lord, by ſome bide-by deſign of nature and created
free will.</p>
               <p>3. Were influences at our diſpoſal, we might make our
prayers only to our own free will, who only can by this way
hear and help; but we pray to God only for quickning,
determining, leading, and ſtirring up influences, and for
effectual teaching; and influences are in a good hand, when
the matter is ſo.</p>

men made independent Lords of ſalvation and damnation,
and of the holy and deep decrees of Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.
And if ſo, there were not ſuch a thing as a decree

ſome after-wit, in the holy Majeſty of God (after he were
diſappointed of his former Goſpel-decree of chooſing all to

No wonder it be a depth to me; but there is no more deep
in it, if all have univerſal ſufficient grace, and if all have
the influences of grace in their power, then this is no depth:
<hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved; he that believes not ſhall be
condemned,</hi> and God rewards thoſe who ſeek him: I deny
not there is a depth in all God's ways, in the induſtry of a

               <p>But 1. The flowing of ſin original is a work of holy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
who ſo puniſhed the firſt fall; and you carp not at
the indwelling of ſin original, by which the poyſon of the

under ſin original, in that, nill he, will he, he is born in

he that was never humbled for ſin original, as <hi>David</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it his plagne and ſore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. and <hi>Job</hi> 14. 4. is not
a captive, but a conſenter to ſin original.</p>
               <p>2. He that willingly lends lodging and a furnace, and
a warm hearth-ſtone to ſin original, and remains willingly
in the ſtate of unrenewed nature, is not a patient under ſin
original, the man is not a captive and a priſoner againſt his
will, to him who hath the power of life and death, and to
him who ſends a writ of grace, and bids him come out, and
caſts ope the priſon doors, yet he remains there, eats, drinks,
ſleeps, ſports. Chriſt the Lord of life hath ſent the Goſpel,
which is a bill of free grace, he bids you come out of curſed
nature, be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind, come to me,
and I will eaſe you; yet ye will not change your life, this
20, 30, 40 years, ſince the Goſpel of grace came to you;
you eat, drink, ſleep, wake, laugh, rejoyce in a ſtate of

               <p>3. I would I were without original ſin, (ye ſay) and yet
when you willingly lye, ſwear, whore, you put ſeal, ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and conſent to <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt ſin; He that delights in the
ſtreams and drinks with delight, does he not love the water
of the fountain? then to ſay, <hi>I would be without ſin original,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:119064:64"/>
is as much, as I would be without ſin, and I would not be
without ſin; does not this man allow <hi>Adam</hi>'s deed, and
ſerve himſelf heir to <hi>Adam</hi> his father's ſin, twenty times in
one day? and in ſuch a man ſin original is not diminiſhed,
and brought down to a ſin of infirmity; as in <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom.
7. 15. <hi>For that which I doe, I allow not; for what I would,
that I doe not; but what I hate, that I doe.</hi> That is a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<hi>would,</hi> a renewed hatred of one entering a proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt ſin; but original ſin lives in its vigour and
reign of the Law, in this man; and where this ſin hath the
full conſent and benſil of the will, the Law, in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
power, is on its ſide. Hence that excuſe the man
brings, as in <hi>Fenner</hi>'s <hi>Wilfull impenitency,</hi> page 95. 96.
which proves that he is not humbled; thou excuſeſt thy ſelf
for thy original ſin too; <hi>Lord I would be without original
ſin, but I cannot; if I could, I would. Belike then if it had
been thy caſe, as it was</hi> Adam<hi>'s, thou wouldeſt not have eaten
of the forbidden fruit; and therefore it was his fault, and
not thine, and thou wouldeſt not have ſinned, if thou couldſt
have otherwiſe chuſed. David</hi> confeſſeth this ſin as his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal,
as well as his natural ſin, Pſal, 51. 5. <hi>Behold, in
iniquity</hi> (that is the higheſt of ſin) <hi>I was formed, and in
ſin did my mother warme me, or conceive me,</hi> He names
the perſon twice; and the holy Ghoſt blacks all faces

<hi>Verſe 19. By one mans diſobedience, many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
that is, all, except the man Chriſt; and this man
muſt be free of ſin and condemnation, as the ſecond
<hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. He would have original ſin removed in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
way, and not in the Lord's own way, and ſo
tempts God, as Satan tempted Chriſt to work miracles for
bread, and to caſt himſelf down over the pinacle of the
Temple.</p>
               <p>1. Now this, <hi>Lord, I would be without ſin original, but I
cannot, thou haſt ſo ordained my nature to be; but it is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119064:64"/>
againſt my will and my heart, for my heart hates it,</hi> its dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dealing, and an untruth; for then the will muſt be
clean, then the Objector muſt be cleaner and holier, then
God ſays in Scripture the unrenewed man is.</p>
               <p>2. Then muſt the will be, by nature, free of ſin original,
whereas the frame of the heart is only evil from the womb,
and deceitful and deſperately wicked, <hi>Gen. 6. 5. Gen.
8. 21. Jer.</hi> 17. 9.</p>
               <p>3. Then muſt the holy Lord be in the fault, who might
give influences of grace, and a whole nature; yea, and the
holy Ghoſt from the womb, as he did to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt,
but denies it.</p>
               <p>But 1.<note place="margin">God ties us to his own way of removing of ſin, not to our empty wiſhing that it were removed.</note> God hath appointed no extraordinary way of
healing our nature. The Baptiſt was from the womb
cured of the dominion of ſin original, it entered not with
his life, in its full reign, as a King, as in others, and ſin
original was in the Baptiſt as in others, as to the demerit,
if God ſhould have entered in judgement with him. Now
the Objector would be free of original ſin in his own way,
not in God's way.</p>
               <p>1. He condemns God in that ever he permitted ſuch a
ſin to be; what warrant is there in Scripture for ſtriving
with any providence or phyſical influences of God? none
at all.</p>
               <p>2. What warrant to complain that all from the womb
have not the ſame influences of grace which the Lord gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
beſtowed on <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt?</p>
               <p>3. What warrant to deſire the extraordinary removal
of ſin original by annihilation? for <hi>God</hi> hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Lamb of God to take away ſin, and to diſſolve
the work of the Divel. The Lord's way is by praying,
<hi>Waſh me, and I ſhall be white as ſnow:</hi> and the Lord
will tie us, not to the <hi>Socinian</hi> abſolute taking away of
ſin, without Chriſt's ſatisfaction, but to an ordinance of
the Law, Pſal. 51. 7. <hi>Purge me with hyſope.</hi> Hence this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
or ſinful conceits in many; <hi>If God would add ſtronger
influences of grace, I ſhould be holy as an Angel. But this
he does not;</hi> and ſo comes in a lazie diſpairing, <hi>if
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119064:65"/>
God will not give ſtronger influences phyſical, I cannot help it:
I doe all that a man can doe, I pray night and day, tyde and
time; therefore if I periſh, I muſt periſh: if God will not
ſave me, I cannot be againſt his will; I can doe no more then I
doe, but muſt refer my ſelf to his will;</hi> So we would conſider
well, this ſinful caſe of conſcience, When 1. the man wiſhes
to be free of the inherency of ſin, becauſe ſomething that
is penal in luſt torments, and hinders ſleep; ſome bodily
pain goes along with night drinking, but yet he ſticks
ſtrongly to the ſinful acting thereof. 2. When the man
ſhould repent and mourn for his ſinful delighting in ſin, he
murmurs that <hi>God</hi> would not counter-work the being of it,
and that he ſo permitted it to be, and ſo diſpoſed of the
place, and ſtrength of temptation, ſince he could have made
it never to have been. And 3. The man wiſhes he might be
a patient in the removing of it, and frets that God will not
take it away, while he ſleeps, but withall he refuſes to be an
actor; 1. In ſorrowing according to God, and in loathing
it. 2. In challenging himſelf, Prov. 5. <hi>How have I hated
inſtruction.</hi> 3. In a godly improving of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the
ranſome-payer, and believing in him, for the Lord's way
of moral removing of ſin, by pardoning thereof, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 20.</p>
               <p>But this is alſo a tempting of God. 1. We are not to
pray for influences phyſical ſimply, and abſolutely for all
uſes, and ends to work miracles, to remove mountains, but
eſpecially we are to pray for more influences,<note place="margin">What ſort of influences we are to ſeek from God.</note> and ſuch as
are ſutable to our ordinary duties; Pſal. 119. 36. <hi>Incline
my heart</hi> (but he ſuits not of God every bowing of the
heart, abſtracted from the word) <hi>incline my heart unto thy

                     </gap>eps, let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
2. David</hi> ſeeks not every ſort of quickning influences;
but Pſal. 119. 25. <hi>Quicken thou me according to thy word.</hi>
Verſe 40. <hi>Quicken me in thy righteouſneſſe.</hi> Verſe

Quakers and Familiſts ſeek after the furious wild-fire of
hell, skaddings and flammings of a ſpirit abſtracted from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119064:65"/>
word; Hence the brothers killing of the brother hath been
father'd on the Spirit, and railing, bitter ſpeaking, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming
have been laid upon ſuch a ſpirit.</p>
               <p>2. A ſpirit that ſuggeſts neglect of ordinances and means
of ſalvation is not the Spirit of God. Would God put forth
more power, and ſtronger influences, I ſhould be holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
in the mean time the man ſleeps. So would the
Lord put forth ſtronger influences, corn, and wheat, and
vine-trees ſhould grow without husbandry, and ſowing;
ſhall the husbandman plow not, and pray for ſuch an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt?
ſo may the man ſay, Ile eat not, God can nouriſh me
without bread. Influences in the fixed and ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, are neither promiſed, nor to be expected,
but in God's way of uſing means; <hi>the hand of the diligent
makes rich.</hi> Should one ſtep out of the Ship and attempt
to walk on the Sea, having no warrant, but a ſpirit divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the uſe of means, and from hearing, reading,
meditating, praying? were not this a proud tempting of
God?</p>
               <p>3. Do not all the wretched and prophane, practically
contradict God? the drunkard will draw, and pull by
head and hair, influences to his drunken prayers; the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
the oppreſſor, and the looſ-liver will force influences to
his empty faith, I believe and am ſaved; and there muſt be
influences at theſe golden words, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 16. ſpoken to the
naked and hungry, <hi>Depart in peace, be thou warmed and
filled.</hi> There is ſome carnal fire and heat in their forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and they look upon theſe influences of God and
thank God for them, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11, 12. when as theſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are rather wrathful plagues of God, joyning with our
ſinful acting of hypocriſie, then favours and gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
of God. But as to the lazie diſpairing,</p>
               <p>1. It was the peoples way, when they are exhorted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
Jer. 18. 12. <hi>There is no hope, but we will walk after our
own devices;</hi> and they were far from doing all, that men can
doe, and praying night and day; they were ſtealing, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,
whoring, following falſe gods night and day, <hi>Jer.</hi>
7. 9. and yet they ſaid they came to the Temple to pray
and ſacrifice night and day, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:119064:66"/>
2. Is it not dreadful, that when <hi>God</hi> refuſes to rain
down influences on ſleepers, and the Spirit breaths not
upon dreamers, and men are reſolved to doe no more, not
to add a farthing more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the field and the precious pearl
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> if they periſh, they muſt ſubmit themſelves to the
will of <hi>God,</hi> they cannot force the Lord, nill he, will he, to
ſave them? true, all the Reprobates that cry to hills and
mountains to cover them, whether they will or no, they
muſt refer themſelves to the will of God; and this is a
wicked chiding with God: if God will not ſave me by ſuch
actings, as may ſtand with mine eaſe and pleaſure, let him
deſtroy me; for Ile doe no more then I doe.</p>
               <p>3. This is a murmuring, at the very marrow and flower
of the Goſpel, John 6. 43. <hi>Murmure not among your ſelves.</hi>
Ver. 44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father that ſent
me draw him.</hi> Then are we enclined to make war with
<hi>God,</hi> becauſe he will not give us drawing influences, and
beſtows them upon ſome. Hence theſe Diſciples gave over
all uſe of means, ver. 66. <hi>Went back and walked no more
with Jeſus.</hi> What then ſhall they doe? they cannot force
God to draw them: if the Lord will ſave us, its good; if
not, we cannot mend it; we'l follow Chriſt and his new-Goſpel
no more.</p>
               <p>4. Is it to you, fools, ſo approved a courſe to give over
means, ſo bleſſed of God. If it can be made out, that the
influences of God do ſo ſerve (in a manner) the inſtuſtry of
men, then are ordinances and means not to be neglected.
1. Means uſed are the Lord's way of comming to us, and
our way of coming to him,<note place="margin">The uſing of means is an approved way of God.</note> whether in the word preached,
<hi>Acts 2. 36, 37. Acts 4. 4. Acts 10. 44. Acts 16. 14. John 4.
9, 10,—29, 30, 39, 40, 41, John</hi> 4. 50, 51. or in miracles or
any other lawful way, 2. Becauſe to ſome certain uſing of
means in faith, there is a promiſe of an effectual bleſſing
made, Pro. 2. <hi>My ſon, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
Commandments with thee.</hi> Ver. 2. <hi>So that thou encline thine
ear unto wiſedome.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>Then ſhalt thou underſtand the
fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</hi> Prov. 8. 17.
<hi>I love them that love me, and they that ſeek me early, ſhall
find me;</hi> John 3. 18. 36. John 5. 24. John 11. 25, 26, 27.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119064:66"/>
Prov. 3. 1, 2. Prov. 4. 20, 21, 22. 3. Neglect of means is
dreadfully puniſhed of God, <hi>Prov, 1. 24, 25, 26, 27. Prov.
5. 12. Prov. 6. 9, 10, 11. Luke</hi> 14. 16, 17, 18, 19. 10. 24.
Hence the killing of the Prophets, and of the heir, is plagued
with being caſt out of the Vineyard, and the removal of
the word of the Kingdom. 4. The aſſiduous uſing of means,
and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s wreſtling in prayer all the night until day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
receiveth the influence of a bleſſing, and of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the prayer in faith and feeling, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 26. 29. and
it puts the ſoul in a neareſt capacity to receive influences
from God; love-ſickneſs near the throne is near to influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of grace &amp; glory, as ſweet ſmelled herbs are near to ſuch
influences, ſo as preſently they yield honey. Some refined
earth curiouſly hardened by the influences of the Sun, is
near to be turned unto fine gold, or choice ſilver; when we
go about earthly buſineſs with half a heart or godly indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
and with a diſtance from the Creature, we grow
more heavenly and more diſpoſed to receive the influences
of God. But ſuch a promiſe as this made to an unrenewed
man yet in nature, <hi>this doe, and ye ſhall be converted,</hi> I
read not; or let nature doe and grace follow; or let
common grace begin, and the ſpecial grace of converſion
ſhall follow.<note place="margin">How reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life goes not before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter ſaith.</note> It cannot be proved by the word which
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Appendix</hi> to his <hi>Aphoriſmes,</hi> anſwer to

ſo believe for remiſſion before their lives be reformed; and
that Reformation of life muſt go before the belief or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of pardon, though not before juſtifying faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. This is to bid men keep a diſtance from holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
and not come at him, or touch him by faith, though the
ſoul be humbly trembling before him; as the woman, <hi>Luk.
8. 47, 48. Mark</hi> 5. 33, 34. until they be holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
It is very like to this, come not within ſight of the
Phyſician, by faith, until firſt you be healed and reformed,
or come not to buy the fine linnen and the righteouſneſs of
the Saints, until firſt you be well cloathed with your own
inherent righteouſneſſe: But who ſhall heal the ſick, and
cloath the naked ſinner, if it be not Chriſt? Now Chriſt
not believed in for pardon, is he at ſo huge a diſtance
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119064:67"/>
from a ſinner that he cannot heal, if never ſeen, and never
touched by faith?</p>
               <p>2. This is to bring in an inherent phyſical pardoning
and juſtification by works; the Scripture knoweth not of
any juſtification but one, and that is through the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>3. What is meant by <hi>Reformation,</hi> whether halfe or
whole, whether begun or compleat reformation of life?
whole and compleat reformation there is none, while the
end and departure out of this life; and ſo no man is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
remiſſion of ſins, until they be going out of the body.
This is the comfortleſs doctrine of Papiſts, never to know

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. and that Chriſt is in us except we be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and never to know that we have life
eternal, and never to know that God hears us, and that we

none could be of good cheer, and love Chriſt much, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſins were forgiven; none could have hope, joy
unſpeakable and full of glory, and know they know God,
and are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe they love the
Brethren, until they be expiring, contrary to <hi>Mark 5. 24.
Matth. 9. 1, 2. Luk. 7. 47, 48, 50. Rom. 5. 2. Rom. 8. 18, 24.
Col. 1. 5, 27. 1 Pet. 1. 5, 6. Matth. 5. 11, 12. 1 John 2. 3.

               <p>4. Nor can there be a continued tract of repentance, and
begun reformation of life which is a work of the Goſpel and
New Covenant, not of the Law, except there be a hopeful
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119064:67"/>
mourning for ſin, and a looking to him by faith, whom we
have pierced, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. nor is it godly ſorrow working
repentance to ſalvation never to be repented of, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
10, 11. which wants faith of ſalvation, and faith of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Chriſt without faith of pardon, yea or begun juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
without faith of pardon, is unpoſſible. Nor can
there be a bringing forth fruit in Chriſt as implanted in the
Vine-tree (which is only reformation of life acceptable to
God) while men be firſt, by faith, engrafted in Chriſt as
branches, growing in him, <hi>John</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. nor walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in God's Commandments, while firſt the heart of ſtone
be removed, and a new heart and a new ſpirit given, as
<hi>Ezech. 36. 26, 27. Iſa.</hi> 44. 1, 2, 3, 4. nor can we believe
with juſtifying and ſaving faith, while we be born again,
1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 1, 4, 5. for if ſo, it were as much as the tree
bloſſoms, grows, and brings forth fruit, ere it be planted,
and the birth moves and ſtirs and receives ſeed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
in the womb, before it receive life in the womb.
3. Nor does the Scripture tell us of a premeriting of the
faith of pardon and remiſſion by a reformation of life, ſo
as converſion, the Goſpel, and accepting of Chriſt as Lord,
and a tract of obedience was required of the Jaylor, of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
and of the Thief upon the Croſs, before they believe.
For accepting of Chriſt as Lord, is obeying of Chriſt, and
faith in Chriſt, as ſaith Mr <hi>Baxter;</hi> and ſo Faith muſt be
required before Faith, and Reformation of life, before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of life; and ſo Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> forbids us to believe
and accept Chriſt, for our Lord and King, pardoning trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
while firſt we have reformed our lives. Now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our lives Evangelically, (for of this he muſt mean)
is to accept Chriſt as our Lord; that is, to doe Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
and live, to obey the new Law, and to perform new
obedience to Chriſt. Hence he ſaith, <hi>ibid. pag. 28. I deſire
him to tell me, whether he can prove, that any mans ſins are
pardoned, before they have accepted Chriſt for their Lord?
that is, before faith. If not, whether this be not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the ſoul to Chriſt to be governed by him, and ſo a
heart-reformation.</hi> Now it may be told Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that
accepting of Chriſt as our Lord, <hi>pag. 285. That is to take
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119064:68"/>
him both as our Saviour and to obey him,</hi> pag. 286. <hi>to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to him and obey him, and to ſquare our actions according
to his will.</hi> Now the actions are not one or two, but all
our actions to our death; and ſo no man compleatly takes
Chriſt for his Lord, and ſo no man compleatly believes,
until death; and ſo the conſolations of Chriſt muſt be as
morally cold as the conſolations of <hi>Solon,</hi> who ſaid, no man
can be happy while he die; and the comforts of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
no man is happy who may fall in the calamities of <hi>Priamus.</hi>
Chriſt muſt make us glad of a painted nothing; <hi>Rejoyce and
be glad,</hi> there is a great reward laid up for you in Heaven;
rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious, nothing can
<hi>ſeparate you from the love of God; mountains and hills may
be removed, but my love is more ſtable. But 1. Ye cannot be
ſure; therefore doubt and tremble. 2. Suppoſe you ſtand to
day, and know that you know him, you may be, and thouſands
as happy as you are, to morrow limbs of Satan and eternally
damned.</hi> Now if no man compleatly take Chriſt until he
have conſummated and perfected his obedience to the
death, Chriſt's word to any, <hi>be of good chear, thy ſins are
forgiven,</hi> is but comfortleſs; for they are neither forgiven,
nor half forgiven, until he hath taken Chriſt for his Lord,
and wrought his days work to the end; and then, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
till then, can he have comfort in his wages and in his
work. 2. It may be anſwered the woman diſeaſed of the
bloudy iſſue, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 34. the woman who did waſh Chriſt's
feet with her tears, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47, 48. ſo the man ſick of the
palſie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 2. the juſtifyed by faith who have peace
with God, <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 103. 3. the repenting man upon the
Croſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 42, 43. had their ſins forgiven upon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of believing, without any teſtimony of their good
works; and Scripture tells us not, that a Maſter bids his
ſervant rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious, at the
beginning and morning of his day, for at night, he ſhall
have a rich reward, if ſuch a ſervant, and millions of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in his caſe, may fall and looſe whole wage, for they
doe but half work.</p>

think none are in <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's caſe; for beſide that God
imploys ſome to, and for rare advantages, and gaining of
ſouls to the Kingdom of Chriſt, ſhall there be nothing of
the holy Ghoſt in multitudes of infants in Covenant with

ſuch as was in <hi>John Baptiſt:</hi> and let not others
caſt themſelves away, as not belonging to Chriſt, who yet
are his, becauſe they know not, ſuch pangs and throwings

               <p>2. Some require milder influences as beng led all their

There is a temper of ſolid walkers by faith, enjoying much
peace, yet not acquainted with great Spring-tydes, nor
with extreme low ebbs, of the outlettings of the holy Ghoſt.
I ſpeak not of <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Prophet, who ſaw God, and whom

Its then a faulty ground of ſome, <hi>never one was like me, none

               <p>8. The Soveraignty of God's dealing with conſciences
in the Old and in the New Teſtament is to be obſerved.
It is not,<note place="margin">The Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the New are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together, and their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</note> 1. To be denyed, but the deſertions under the

dimneſs and darkneſs made them to ſee leſs love, and
more Law, and leſſe of Chriſt the ſeat of mercy, and
more of the curſe and of wrath, as the night darkneſs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſpirits and dreadful things more terrible. 2. It was
the purpoſe of God to awe generally that people more with
Law-fear, and bondage, then his people under the New
Teſtament. But it is a wicked doctrine of ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi>
and others, that all deſertions are, under the N. Teſtament
cried down and gone; and it is our legal miſtake, ſay they,
that works trouble of conſcience, under the N. Teſtament,
and an exerciſe of ſuch as are under the Covenant of
works; though it may be ſaid law-ſorrow purſued theſe of
the Old Teſtament; but the Saints now are leſs paſſive and
more active, in purſuing ſorrow according to God, yet in
another reſpect, becauſe of greatneſs of light, and Goſpel
experiences, and a higher meaſure of illuminations, and
ſpiritual preſence in more abundance is promiſed and

                  <hi>Above ſtrength. 3. In ſo much that we diſpaired,
even of life. 4. But we had the ſentence of death in our
ſelves,</hi> and what ever be the kind; for even Chriſt had ſo
much the more ſorrow, at the withdrawing influences of
the comforts that immediately flowed from the God-head
perſonally united, and this was Chriſt's hell in part; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are to look upon deſertions in the ſong of <hi>Solomon</hi>
as prophetical, and relating to the deſertions in the New
Teſtament, in the which the riſe of the grief is not ſo
much from the apprehenſion of ſin legally tormenting, as
from the ſenſe of the want of the ſweet comforting preſence
of God, and of the wel-beloved Chriſt; yet there is as
much in that of pain, as in any we read, Cant. 5. 6. <hi>I roſe
up to open to my beloved, my beloved had withdrawn himſelf,
and had paſſed away; my ſoul went forth, becauſe of his
ſpeech:</hi> Ainſworth, <hi>My ſoul was gone, and departed, that is,
failed, fainted, I was even a dead woman through fear and
grief; for death is the departing of the ſoul from the body,
Gen.</hi> 33. 18. This though an Evangelical deſertion, is as
much as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, my moiſture is turned into the drought
of Summer, and as the waves of the Lord's wrath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
over <hi>Heman;</hi> yea, and it is more painful to be thruſt
out of Heaven, and to be deprived of an high meaſure of
enjoyed and felt love, and is a ſadder torment then all the
law-burnings, though they have in <hi>David</hi> and others ſome
ſuch love-ſickneſs, which was ordinary to the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-diſpenſation;
and theſe and the like the ſoul is more
able to bear: that the habit and ſtock is rich, as Chriſt,
from the perſonally indwelling God-head, was ſtrong in his
deſertions peculiar to him; and the richer the habit of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119064:71"/>
grace be, the more able is the ſoul to ſtand out: the ſtrong
ſhip is more able to endure the ſtorm, then the crazy and
rotten veſſel; a Giant is fitter for a battle with a Giant,
then a Child is.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Some are kept in perfect peace whoſe minds are ſtaid on
the Lord, and being juſtifyed by faith have peace with God,</hi>
Iſa. 26. 2. Rom. 5. 1. There are two ſorts of diſpenſations,
one fundamental, another not fundamental; the former is
the Lord's carrying on his begun work, which is to will
and doe to the end in his ordinary courſe; the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is not fundamental, reſpects the Lord's way of
doing, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in ſuch circumſtances, and the degrees
of grace given or infuſed, which do not vary the ſpece, and
nature of the work. We read not of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s curſing the
day he was born in, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> doe; nor is there
any ſhaddow of it in <hi>Joſeph;</hi> yet nothing hinders but <hi>Job</hi>
and <hi>Jeremy</hi> may and did at other times, enjoy ſweet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and nearneſs to God.</p>
               <p>But 1. We would not take extraordinary feaſts to be
dayly food; nor ſhould we much wonder when a change
cometh: but how do we chide, quarrel, complain, becauſe
it is not always ſo? Nor 2. Should we be rough, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
to ſick ones: its the Lord's way that all in the
houſe ſhould not be ſick at once; but ſome are ſick and
ſome whole to wait on the ſick, and all to bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
burthens; all the diſeaſes of the houſe are not the
ſame in kind and degree.</p>
               <p>2. Some do all their life dwell in the borders of hell,
and never have fair ſayling, nor fulneſs of aſſurance, until

called to pure living by faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10.</p>
               <p>3. Some, once in all their life have one only remarkable
night of wreſtling with God, and prevail, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did;
and ſome love ſo their priſon that they take a ſentence, <hi>à

helliſh.</p>
               <p>2. Next to them are reprobate men, who caſt off Chriſt,
and turn into Satans camp. No ſaving influences are due
to ſuch as are reprobate to good works. Ah, beware of
habitual hating of Chriſt, and his houſe, dependers and
ſeed: yet are there here degrees; for none are in that
meaſure deſerted or blaſphemers of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>3. Chriſt's deſertion was extremely penal and brought
out tears and ſtrong cries, mixt with a curſe; and only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
were ſuſpended as touching viſion and enjoyment
or fruition, and the actual comforts of God; the crown in
a manner was laid aſide out of the eye and ſight of the man
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119064:72"/>
Chriſt, yet wanted he never influences. 1. For acts of love;
<hi>Father remove.</hi> 2. For acts of faith; <hi>O my father remove.</hi>
3. For acts of praying more earneſtly, Luk. 23. 44. <hi>O my
father remove this cup.</hi> 4. For acts of witneſſing a good
confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> 5. For acts of preaching
the confeſſing man to Paradiſe with him; none are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
and curſedly deſerted who can pray and hope, and
believe in the furnace as Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4. The redeemed of God are not all one and the ſame
way deſerted. 1. Some are extremely at under as <hi>Job,</hi>
who apprehended that God did purſue him as an enemy,
<hi>Job</hi> 13. 20. though <hi>Job</hi> and every believer be the friend of
God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 23. 2. The Spouſes deſertions are leſs, being
conveyed with love-ſickneſs;<note place="margin">Various kinds of deſertions on the Lord's redeemed.</note> 
                  <hi>Magdalen</hi> hath no wakenings
of conſcience for ſin, nor any poſitive agony or law-chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges,
but only love deſertion, ſhe ſays with tears; <hi>They
have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have
laid him.</hi> 3. Some are meer deſertions as to the act of ſin.
God is angry at <hi>David,</hi> when God withdraws, ſo as he
numbers the people, and commits adultery and murther:
and Chriſt is angry at <hi>Peter</hi>'s pride when he ſuffers him to
deny his Maſter; but neither <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> feels any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the Lord in ſuch withdrawings of gracious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
but its ſo much the worſe, the man is wounded in
his ſleep, and many moneths and days after the wounds
bleed. O what trembling at holy ſoveraignty, why
deadneſs to duties ſhould come on <hi>David,</hi> not on <hi>Aſa.</hi>
On <hi>David</hi> at this time, not at another time: Hence a caſe
may be, Whether abſence of the Lord in his influences
may be meer and only love ſickneſs for him whom the ſoul
loves, or alſo abſence with conſcience of ſin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The predominant may be ſickneſs only for the
want of Chriſt; as in the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. and in <hi>Magdalen,
Joh.</hi> 20. I ſay the predominant, becauſe we cannot ſay,
that God withdraws in his outlettings of grace, but there is
guiltineſs in the Spouſe ſo made ſick becauſe of his abſence,
and with <hi>Magdalen</hi>'s ſickneſs for Chriſt there appeareth a
doting too much on the man Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 20. 13. I know not
where they have laid him.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>I will take him away.</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:119064:72"/>
Ver. 17. <hi>Touch me not.</hi> When we are too bent upon Chriſt
as a Comforter, not as Chriſt, its juſt with God we be
pained and ſick with the want of him; and that we ſeek
him and find him not, ſo ſpiritual ought we to be under
the pain of abſence.</p>
               <p>2. But its cleer in the man Chriſt, there is paining, with drawing,
and forſaking on the Lord's part; <hi>Why haſt thou
forſaken me?</hi> and neither ſin nor conſcience of ſin, nor
any hazard of love-ſickneſs after God's near embracings,
but upon the due account; for Chriſt could not idolize
God as comforting.</p>
               <q>

                  <hi>Diſtinguiſh theſe three.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>1. Gracious withdrawing from whence cometh ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelief.</p>
               <p>2. The frowning of God, and hiding of his face.</p>
               <p>3. The penal ſorrow and ſmarting under his abſence.</p>
               <p>As to the Firſt; Its lawful to plead and pray againſt
withdrawings as they neceſſarily bring in ſin; the more
gracious the temper is, we ſhall pray more earneſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the leaſt ſin then againſt the moſt fiery hell.</p>
               <p>As to the Second which is the frowning of God; 1. The
nature of a child ſaith, its lawful to weep when the Father
is angry. 2. Inherent grace and the ſparkles of the image of
God cannot endure well that eternal favour ſhould be hid.
3. The nature of faith and of love to God will ſay, that the
man ſhould be ſaddened when the love of God is either
hid or provoked. 4. The practice of the Saints ſaith ſo
much, Job 13. 24. <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face?</hi> Pſal. 13. 1.
<hi>How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</hi> 5. His ſhining is
deſirable; <hi>O ſend day light.</hi> Pſal. 31. 16. <hi>Make thy face to
ſhine upon thy ſervant.</hi> Pſal. 80. 3, 7, 19. 6. Its lawful to
deprecate the anger of God. Pſal. 79. 5. <hi>How long Lord,
wilt thou be angry, for ever?</hi> and eſpecially a gracious
heart is ſadned moſt at the outgoings of wrath againſt
prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 4. in which the Mediator, and the precious
name of God, in a manner, ſeem to ſuffer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 3, 10.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119064:73"/>
                  <hi>Pſal. 83. 1, 2, 3. Iſa. 52. 5. Exod. 32. 11, 12. Joſh.</hi> 7, 8, 9.
7. Hardly can a natural ſpirit lay to heart, yea or know
that God is angry,<note place="margin">To deprecate the anger of God, how lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, how not.</note> as a child of God can doe; as its all one
to a man in a dark pit under the earth whether it be day-light
or mid-night; the one doth not comfort him, nor the
other ſadden him.</p>
               <p>As to the Third; Its a great deceit that we more penally
ſmart at the abſence of the Paradiſe of comforting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
then at the want of real communion with God; this
ſhould calm the heart notwithſtanding the pain of the
abſence of God as a comforter, that we believe his unfelt
love and care, as a God in Covenant. Mic. 7. 7. <hi>I will look
unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my ſalvation, my
God ſhall hear me.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>When I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord
ſhall be a light unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Lord, as is elſewhere ſaid, in a courſe of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
deſerting, will not come until his own time come;
as ſome Feavers muſt have their own courſe of natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo that the man ſhall ſweat out of the tertian Ague by
length of time: if you ſhould uſe all the medicine of the
Earth, yet this forbids not art and induſtry altogether, to
help nature. So Chriſt under the ſtroke of ſoveraign ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
prays and was <hi>heard in that which he feared,</hi> Heb. 5. 7.
believed, hoped, and ſo overcame, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
               <p>And becauſe Soveraignty hath a ſpecial hand in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Influences are given of God to various temptations.</note>
we are to take heed to temptations to weaken us in
duties; as <hi>Maſter, pity thy ſelf.</hi> 2. Sometime Satan tempts
to duties, to pray when we ſhould hear. 3. Sometime to
groſs carnal ſins, <hi>fall down and worſhip me;</hi> and ſometimes
to ſpiritual fins, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command theſe
ſtones to be made bread.</hi> 4. Sometimes to duties in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
as for <hi>Timothy</hi> to drink water, the inceſtuous man to
mourn until he be ſwallowed up of grief, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5.
Sometimes Satan tempts himſelf to goe out that he may
more tempt, and return with ſeven divels worſe then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
6. Sometimes he tempts by a boyſterous imperious u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation.
<hi>Job</hi> is mine, he ſerves God for hire. All hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
are Satan's, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 7. Sometime he tempts to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
liberties, to ear, ſetting the Law of nature in oppoſition
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119064:73"/>
to the divine poſitive-law, <hi>Gen. 3. The tree is good for
meat;</hi> then God and Nature ordained it for food. In all
which, holy Soveraignty gives influences natural to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter;
nor will he have us to queſtion his Soveraignty. 2.
Nor would he have us to make either his giving or his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of influences our rule. And 3. In all our actings
he would have us to tremble; What if providence put a
croſs benſil or byas on the heart, what can influences not
doe to haſten a <hi>Judas</hi> to his place, though the holy Lord
remains ſpotleſs and free? 4. There is much need of that,
<hi>lead us not into temptation.</hi> 5. Had the Gold will and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
it oweth thanks to the Goldſmith, though he burn and
melt it, becauſe he removes the droſſe. Its true, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
lames and wounds particular nature, when he opens a
vein; but he ſaves the whole body thereby, and the ſick
perſon ows him thanks. Were there no more but theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
influences that act in temptations, as to their preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fruits, to wit, the humbling of the tempted ſinner, the
diſcovery of latent corruption, of the wiles of Satan, the
praiſe and glory of his grace who knows how to counter-work
(in a manner) his own influences, and doth inviſibly
uphold his own children, under theſe temptations; the
Lord is here to be loved and adored, as <hi>wonderfull in counſel
and excellent in working.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. Of ſtriving againſt Soveraignty. 2. Some ſtriving
is lawful. 3. A gracious behaviour it is to be woe
at God's forſaking. 4. To repine at Soveraignty in
hearing or not hearing of prayer. 5. Contradicting.
6. Murmuring. 7. Counter-working of Soveraignty
is dreadful. 8. Oppoſing the operations of the Spirit.
9. Diſpairing. 10. Reproaching proud diſputing.
11. Submiſſion to want of influences. 12. What
way the Lord recompenſeth deſertions. 13. Cloſing
with influences of the Law-rebukes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ELihu</hi> moſt gravely ſpeaketh, Job 33. 13. <hi>Why doſt thou
ſtrive with him, for he gives not an account of any of his
matters?</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to ſtrive and contend in words
only, as <hi>Mercerus</hi> and <hi>Pagnin,</hi> either in judgement or out
of judgement, <hi>jurgare.</hi> And its ſtrange that any dare
chide or ſcold with the ſoveraign Lord.</p>
               <p>But 1. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſtriving and wreſtling in a holy willful
peremptorineſs in praying, the Lord being on <hi>Jacob</hi> the
wreſtlers ſide really to bear him up by his grace, is a lawful
ſtriving.</p>
               <p>2. There is a difference betwixt a meer temptation and
a threatning. The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> ſtrives not againſt
Chriſt's not anſwering her one word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. what? he
is maſter of his own Anſwers. When Chriſt ſays, <hi>I came
not but for the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> ſhe ſtrives
not; he is Maſter of his own journey from Heaven to
Earth; yet that Anſwer weakens her not in the duetie of
praying, and worſhipping. But when ſhe is reproached
as to her intereſt in Chriſt, <hi>Its not meet to take the childrens
bread and to give it to dogs,</hi> ſhe mildly, yet in the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of faith contradicts Chriſt: ſuppoſe Chriſt out of his
own mouth ſhould deny a child of God to be a child of
God, there is place for a holy ſtriving and contradicting
of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:119064:74"/>
3. It is a gracious behaviour in the man Chriſt,<note place="margin">It is a gracious temper to weep when the Lord is abſent or angry.</note> that he
is affected with grief for the Lord's forſaking, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it <hi>with tears and ſtrong cries,</hi> Heb. 5. Should not the
child weep, when the father is angry? 2. The privation
of the greateſt good, ſuch as the overclouding of the Lord's
favour, is a due cauſe of ſadneſs; Woman, why weepeſt
thou, ſaith the <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Magdalen?</hi> why weep I? they
have taken away my Lord. 3. It wants not reaſon I weep,
for my father is dead; there is my mothers grave, ſhe is
very new buried, therefore I weep; all my goods are taken
away, and therefore I weep; yet the Lord hath forſaken
me, and I weep not; that is dreadful. So <hi>Job, Jeremiah,
David, Hezekiah,</hi> are ſadly afflicted, when the Lord ſeems
angry.</p>
               <p>4. There is a ſoveraignty in hearing or not hearing of
prayer,<note place="margin">A ſoveraignty in the Lord's hearing, or not hearing.</note> againſt which we muſt not ſtrive. 1. Sometime
the unwritten bill is anſwered, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 24. and the Lord
yields to our blank papers, and ſubſcribes them. 2. Some times
he hears the dumb mans ſigns, and his breathing,
inſtead of his praying, <hi>Iſa. 38. 14, 20. Lam. 3. 56. Pſal. 6. 8.
Pſal.</hi> 102. 19, 20. 3. Sometimes the Lord hears, and ſends
the meſſage of deliverance, but we hear not, nor doe we
know or feel that he hears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 4, 5, 6. compared with
<hi>ver. 16. Dan.</hi> 10. 12. one crying for comfort may be heard
and not comforted. Iſa. 66. 13, 14. <hi>As one whom his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And when ye ſee this, your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your bones
ſhall flouriſh like a green herb.</hi>

               <p>3. Beware of murmuring and angry and fretting words

Exod. 15. 24. Exod. 16. 2. Numb. 14. 2, 27. and much
more. Its dreadful to contend with the Almighty; and
for ſo ſmall a thing as a drink of water, and for a piece of
fleſh, ſhould we fall a pleading with the ſoveraign Lord?</p>
               <p>4. Eſpecially we ſhould not counter-work the uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
providence of <hi>God;</hi> for that is to give the Lord bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and to lead an army againſt him: as Iſa. 9. 10. <hi>The
bricks are fallen down, but we will build them with hewen
ſtones; the Sycamores are cut down, but we will change them
unto Cedars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. There be divers kinds of ſtriving with the Almighty;
ſuch are they who blaſphemouſly oppoſe the ſhining and
convincing power of the Spirit in Chriſt caſting out divels,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. ſuch are they who gnaſh with the teeth and ſpit
upon the ſhining beauty of godlineſs in <hi>Steven, Acts</hi> 7. and
kick againſt pricks as perſecutors doe, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. who if they
had the Father and Spirit incarnate, as the Son was, would
crucifie both, and would, were it in there blaſphemous
power, crucifie the God-head; whereas meek yielding to
the actings and flowings of the Spirit in others, ſays there
muſt be much of the Spirit there; for the Spirit cannot but
love the Spirit.</p>
               <p>6. Deſpairing ſtoutly of mercy and the power of grace is
of this ſort; when <hi>Cain, Judas,</hi> and others defie Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
and infinite mercy to ſave them, and ſpitefully
hate the influences of ſaving grace, and ſay, mercy cannot
ſave me; the compleat ranſome of the bloud of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
buy me from the ſecond death: To this we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a lazie deſpairing; what if I be never ſaved, I can, I
will doe no more? The people are bidden return; nay,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119064:75"/>
                  <hi>there is no hope</hi> (ſay they,) Jer. 18. 12. <hi>but we will walk after
our own devices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. There is here, the fainter reproaching of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
as if God were weary and not able to bring back
the captive people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 27, 28. Hence the Lord muſt
prove his Omnipotency by that rare piece the curtain of
Heaven ſtretched out, and a meaſuring line drawn over
the Earth, <hi>Iſa. 51. 14, 15. Iſa.</hi> 50. 2, 2.</p>
               <p>8. There is a proud diſputing with God when we dare
give in a bill againſt God. 1. Ah, he takes me for his enemy.
2. He hath left off to be gracious; An ungracious God is
no God. O the pride of a tempted mind that dare oppoſe
the very exiſtence of God.</p>
               <p>3. Some ſay, God hath need to be inſtructed to govern
the world better, otherwiſe what needed that be ſaid by
Iſa. 40. 13. <hi>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his counſellour, hath taught him?</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>With whom
took he counſell, who inſtructed him, and taught him in the
path of judgement, and taught him knowledge, and ſhewed
him the way of underſtanding?</hi> Or what needs that <hi>Job</hi> 21.
22. <hi>Shall any teach God knowledge? ſeeing he judgeth things
that are high.</hi> What a God is an unknowing God, who
needs a leſſon from the creature, or from ſome higher God?
and then who taught that other God who is ſuppoſed to be
higher then the moſt high? what a carnal mind is this that
chaſeth the Almighty God out of the world?</p>
               <p>4. What doe they who curſe the day, the ſtars, the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
the birth? as <hi>Job chap.</hi> 3. A gracious heart ſaith,
let the Lord be the Lord, and cloſes with all the attributes
of God, and with all the influences of Omnipotency, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
goodneſs, and juſtice on men, and of love, mercy,
grace, bounty, forbearance to the Saints, and to their own
ſoul; this is to ſing mercy, and to ſing judgement: whereas
its a note of Atheiſme to wiſh and vote out of the world
God, his attributes, and all the acting and influences of
mercy, juſtice, truth, grace, ſoveraignty, and to ſay, <hi>Its not
the Lord, the Lord can neither doe good, neither can be doe
evil,</hi> Zeph. 1.</p>
               <p>8. So would we beware to fight with the Lord's diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119064:76"/>
of grace; he is Lord and Soveraign diſpoſer of his
own comforts: whether we look upon comforts as duties
commanded, 2 <hi>Theſ. 5. 17. Jer.</hi> 31. 15. or as a reward of

16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 13, 14. he is the Lord of all influences to work
in us to will and to doe, and Maſter of his own rewards.
The Lord is Maſter of his own love-viſits, and is neither
debtor to the man Chriſt, nor to the elect Angels; yea, the
Lord's ſaving influences go along with his free decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection;
and look as the Lord of nature preſerves the ſpeces

forbidding the wind to blow in one earth, when it ſtrongly
blows in another. Some deadned deſerted ones are much
meekned and made to ſpeak out of the duſt, and fed and
fatned alſo with hunger; yea, if it were but lying at the
gate of Chriſt and knocking, though no anſwer at all be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
it hath much of Chriſt in it, in other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
deadneſs may be on, and want of holy vigorous act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the complainings fervent praying, Pſal. 119. 25. <hi>My ſoul

Some children are always malecontent and ſtill weeping,

any thing of Law-ſmiting and of Law-firings of the ſoul

ſtrive with God; ſo do Divels and reprobates for eternity
wreſtle with the Law-juſtice and the Law-curſe: grace
teacheth meek aſſenting to the Law as good and ſpiritual;
neither Chriſt nor any of his live at ods and variance with
the Law. Indeed to the Saints the Law is, as they ſay of
Elements, <hi>They exiſt not in their purity but with ſome mixture;</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:119064:78"/>
For the Law to believers is managed by Chriſt, and in his
hands made uſe of for ſaving ends, even when the believer
is in the Law-furnace; nor is there any who could guide &amp;
make ſo good uſe of the Law as Jeſus Chriſt. Some there are,
that one nights waking under the terrors of the Law would
make an end of them, if inviſible Goſpel ſtrength were not
furniſhed to them; and here there muſt be a mixture of
Law-influences, and of Goſpel impreſſions of Chriſt upon
the ſpirit. It ſpeaks much grace in <hi>Joſiah, 2 Kings</hi> 22. 19.
to feel and ſuffer, with ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of a meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and a tamed heart, the ſmart and pain of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

26. in the Prieſts, Prophets, and People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. 8. of the
chief Prieſts and Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 45, 46. does proclaim
much graceleſneſs of an undanted and unplowed heart:
where there is any ingredient of Goſpel-grace, there is a
coming down and a ſtooping to the influences of <hi>God,</hi> of
what kind ſoever,<note place="margin">Sometime we may pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, but its never lawful to reſiſt his commanding will.</note> yea and generally a gracious ſpirit dare

there can no caſe be given, in which we may reſiſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving

conformity with God, when the heart ſweetly cloſes with
impreſſions of rebukes, threatnings, convictions, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Evangelick commands. Its good earth that eaſily

Irons of the tilling Plough is convinced to be rocky and
barren: every ſtring of the harp beaten on by the hand of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119064:78"/>
the Muſician, gives a reſound like it ſelf; a Bell of ſilver
hath an other ſort of excellent ſound then a Bell of Braſs or
Iron: the gracious heart anſwers to every letter and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the word, to the promiſe with faith, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
with pliableneſs of obedience, to the threatning with
ſoftneſs and godly trembling; for all the Word and Law
and the ſeveral parts thereof are written and engraven in
the heart; and the gracious heart is a double or a ſecond
copy of the Old and New Teſtament. So <hi>Achab</hi> on the
contrary meets every word from <hi>Micaiah</hi> with hatred, and
there is a reſound and an echo of hatred and perſecution
which in the Phariſees meets the words of rebuke in
Chriſt's mouth, and bitterneſs in <hi>Herod</hi> reſounds when
<hi>John Baptiſt</hi> does rebuke his inceſt, and adultery. Take it
for a ſad condition when there is a practical contrariety
and hatred betwixt the heart and the word of the Lord;
a heart loathing of the word and a rejecting thereof is
dreadful; whereas the eſteeming of the word ſweeter then
the honey or the honey comb, more then thouſands of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

are before and above <hi>God:</hi> whereas the Roſe warms not
the Sun, but the Sun warms and nouriſhes the Roſe; and
the corn and herbs do not refreſh the Heaven and the
Clouds, but Heaven and Clouds nouriſh and refreſh the
corn and graſs; and it muſt be untoward and froward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
that the ſick man heals the Phyſician. It is the grace
(to ſpeak ſo) of the Lord's free grace that the Lord prevents
us, not we him; its impoſſible that nature can prevent
grace.</p>

cauſe;<note place="margin">The Lord ſtrongly bows free will.</note> yet that moral cauſe even the praying man ſtirs
not until God firſt prevent him to pray. Hence the Lord
moves and wheels about the heart and will of the man, who

is moſt free and moſt abſolute among all the ſons of men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

grace in the eyes of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi>) ſee Gen. 43. 14. <hi>The Lord
Almighty give you mercy before the man.</hi> If God could not
indecliuably bow the will to his own way, ſide, or end, (be
it by antecedent predetermination or what way elſe you
ſhall call it, ſo the Lord be the more Maſter of willing and
nilling then the creature) but in ſo doing he ſhould deſtroy
free will; we ſhould in all ſuch petitions pray for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
of free will, where ſure, we pray for perfecting
and the ſanctified bowing of free will to obey God. 2. If
the dominion of free acts remain ſtrongly in the creatures
power, we muſt in theſe ſuits (<hi>incline my heart unto thy te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies)
(lead us not into temptation</hi>) pray the Lord for
that which is not in his power to give. 3. If God do carry
free will whitherſoever he pleaſeth, then we muſt not defer
the only praiſe of our obedience, and of our victory over
temptations, to the grace of <hi>God,</hi> but to free will which
made the diſcriminating difference. 1. Hence we are to
commit our free will to the Lord's dominion of grace, and
not to believe that ſuch a tottering Goddeſſe as free will
which hath loſt and deſtroyed Angels and the firſt man <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
can guide well enough; Yea, 2. we are to bleſs the
Lord for that impotency (if ſo it may be called) that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Lord's heavenly influences are not in the creatures
coffers, to be husbanded by the creature; how falſe is it
that Chriſt hath bought free will to himſelf. 3. How ſweet
is it that our head Chriſt, and we in him are more maſters
of mens hatred and favour, then they are themſelves, <hi>Prov.
3. 1, 4. Pſal.</hi> 106. 46. for would enemies and haters ſhew

of their own hatred and love? not at all; we muſt thank
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119064:81"/>
and bleſſe an higher hand then ſuch men. 4. Should we

                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Becauſe God only is Lord and Maſter of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
and of the actings of all creatures,<note place="margin">There is no warrant for us not to act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is Lord of our actings.</note> we are not to be
idle, and upon that account to act nothing; for then ſhould
not the husband-man plow, ſow, and labour; for <hi>God</hi> only
is Lord and Maſter of the actings of the husband-man; and
without the influences and bleſſing from on high, the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-mans
labours from the beginning of the year to the
end, were no better then to plant Vine-trees in the bottom
of the river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> or to ſow Barley or Wheat in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
ſea. And ſo ſhould the Sea-man never ſayl; for
<hi>God</hi> only can create winds and tide, and <hi>God</hi> only is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, and of ſayling,
and of right ſteering of the Veſſel; for ſince the <hi>Lord</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
not his mind on the contrary, by forbidding men to
pray,<note place="margin">How we are to doe, though God only work in us to doe.</note> and others to plow and ſayl. 2. Since the Lord
offers no poſitive violence to hinder theſe actings; And 3.
becauſe he commandeth us to doe them, it becomes us to ſet
to work, and to act with and under him, and to commit the
event and bleſſing to him. Indeed, if the Lord were ſo
Lord of our actings, as he did all and whole the work, and
we did act nothing at all in praying, yea and in plowing,
but were meer dead and uſeleſs patients, as <hi>Libertines</hi> dream,
ſomething might follow to juſtifie our idleneſs; but our
corruption following Satan teacheth us either to ſacrifice to
our own net, and ſay vainly, either we doe all, and God
does nothing, and ſo we darken his glory who works all our
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119064:81"/>
works in us, and for us, or then we ſay on the other extreme
we doe nothing, and God does all; and therefore muſt we
ſay let God pray, labour the earth, trade and ſayl, and put
our hand in our boſome and ſleep? but the former is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and idolatry, and robs the Lord of his glory, and the
latter is proclaimed diſobedience; Yea, and whether the
influence of <hi>God</hi> antecedently maſter the creatures actings,
or we joyntly and collaterally be maſtered and determined
by the creature, we are in both caſes to act and doe what
is good, and are not to make God's influence our rule of
doing, or not doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. Hence to have, or not to have the influence of
<hi>God,</hi> is not commanded in the Word nor have we any <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
power</hi> over the Lord's acts of Omnipotency; for we do
not formally love <hi>God</hi> and keep his Commandments, in a
way commendable (if we ſpeak of the moral cauſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
becauſe he works in us both to will and to doe, but
becauſe he hath commanded us to love him, and to keep his
Commandments, <hi>John 14. 15. Pſal.</hi> 119. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Hence 1. The <hi>Libertine</hi> is blaſphemouſly wide, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can doe (ſays he) nothing good or evil, God worketh
all ſin, all obedience immediately in us; its in vain to read,
pray, hear the word, meditate, confer, or go about works of
reforming abuſes in religion, becauſe all theſe are to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
without the ſpirit. 2. We are not to do any thing, becauſe
<hi>God</hi> in his word hath commanded us to doe it,<note place="margin">The Word is the rule of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Spirit the real effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe.</note> but becauſe
the Spirit immediately acts in us to doe, and immediate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
of the Spirit is now inſtead of the Law and of the
word of <hi>God,</hi> either written or preached; but this is a wicked
confounding of the efficient real cauſe and the ſtrength of
which we obey, with the objective cauſe and morally dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
commanding and perſwading rule according to which
we are to regulate and order our obedience; yea, and
children can contradict this who know that the Maſon who
imploys his ſtrength to build, muſt be differenced from the
Maſons Rule and the Art, plummet and line according to
which he works: for otherwiſe its all one as to ſay the
power or faculty viſive of ſeeing were light were colours
that are ſeen, and the ſouldiers force and ſtrength
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119064:82"/>
of apprehending a man, and Law and juſtice according to
which they do it, were all one: a gracious ſoul doth all acts
of obedience upon the account of a command of God, and
fetcheth his moral and godly delight from the command of
God: the facility and ſtrength of doing is indeed from the
Spirit, for whoſe help he deſires to be thankful and to whom
he deſires to give all the praiſe and glory.</p>
               <p>2. Its a falſe Spirit which is ſo contrary to the word of
precept and command.</p>
               <p>3. Its fit to ſubſcribe to that, Pſal. 127. 1. <hi>Except the
Lord build the houſe, they build in vain that build; except the
Lord watch the City, the watchman waketh but in vain.</hi>
1 Cor. 3. 7. <hi>So then neither is he that planteth, nor he that
watereth any thing but God that giveth increaſe.</hi> But the
holy Ghoſt never dreamed of ſuch an inference, therefore
let builders, watchmen and Miniſters of the Goſpel go to
bed and ſleep, for <hi>God,</hi> he alone ſhall build Cities and
Houſes, and watch over men and all ſocieties, and bring all
ſouls to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yea, he hath commanded us to act and to
help the Lord (ſo he ſpeaketh, <hi>Judges 5. 23. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 9.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. and it hath a real truth, though he needs no
help from the creature) and we are for his holy commands
ſake to act, and to eye and truſt in him who in all the acts
of nature, and oeconomy and art leads the way, and in all
the acts of grace; yea, we are to rejoyce that the Lord
Jeſus is Maſter of work and only Steerſman.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. What the natural man can doe to get influences; the
natural man can doe more then he does, and can
exerciſe the natural powers to come within the boſome
of the net, though he cannot hale himſelf to land. 2.
How the Lord can command the naturally blind to ſee
and believe. 3. How ſin original deſerves eternal
wrath. 4. Its ſuch a ſin in infants. 5. The want
of original righteouſneſſe and a power of believing is
a ſin in us. 5. How the Lord commands impotent
men.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe greater doubt is how the Lord can command ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
acts to a man drowned in nature:<note place="margin">How the Lord can lay by a command, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and dead in ſin.</note> but its not
here as when a Tyrant commands a child to wheel about
the firſt heaven, elſe he ſhall kill him: for the ſo moving of
the heaven is neither a moral duty, nor was it ever a duty
compaſſible by the phyſical power of the arm of a child or
a ſtrong man. But the main intent of our <hi>Lord</hi> in laying
on ſupernatural commands upon man unable to believe,
is that men may know what they can pay, and what they
owe and can never pay, but not of their own pay the
debt of faith: the precept is not unrational where the end
is rational. 2. Not that the natural man may ſatisfie, but
that he may come and compone, and acquieſce to a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Goſpel treaty; for nothing heightneth the price and
worth of Chriſt more in the ſhining of free grace, nothing
kills and renders ſelf-condemned the man more then a ſeen
neceſſity of forgiving love; yea, the reading of the writ of
the Law-debt with tears, when this is holden out to us
(the Lord gave a bill of grace to thoſe who had nothing to
pay and he forgave them frankly) is a ſtrongly convincing
diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>2. Something which is really little or nothing, a natural
man may doe to fetch the wind when he cannot command
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119064:83"/>
it, and cannot ſayl, he may and often doth exerciſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
faculty of moving from place to place, and comes as
a meer natural man, upon a meer natural motive, ſinfull
curioſity,<note place="margin">We may uſe the loco-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty in hearing and God convert men beyond their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and a purpoſe violently to apprehend Chriſt, as
the ſouldiers doe, <hi>John</hi> 7. 45, 46, 47. yea, with bloudy
hearts and a purpoſe to perſecute as the hearers of <hi>Peter</hi>
doe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and yet beſide and contrary to the will and
intent, the man is wrought upon, and converted before he
go away; as ſome go to Sea and ſayl to <hi>India</hi> poor with no
intention to be enriched with gold, but only to get bread,
and yet they come again from <hi>India</hi> rich with <hi>Indian</hi> gold,
and many precious ſtones far beſide their intention. A
man rude and ignorant goes to <hi>Athens</hi> upon no purpoſe to
become learned, yet providence ſo diſpoſeth that he falls in
love with learning, and ſtudying many years, he returns
from <hi>Athens</hi> a moſt learned man. Now no man can ſay that
either the <hi>Indian gold,</hi> or the learning of <hi>Athens</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
any real or phyſical ſtrength to his loco-motive and
natural faculty of journeying to <hi>India</hi> or <hi>Athens:</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it be ſaid the Spirit of grace or the Goſpel of
grace did add any new real and phyſical ſtrength to <hi>Peter</hi>'s
hearers to cauſe them to come in under the ſtroke of the
preached Goſpel. Now the <hi>Goſpel is the power of God to
ſalvation;</hi> the Apoſtle uſeth ſuch ſpiritual weapons of ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
to caſt down ſtrong holds; its the arm of the Lord,
<hi>Rom. 1. 16. 2 Cor. 10. 56. Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. and the preached
Goſpel is the triumphing chariot of Chriſt conquering,
Chriſt's office-houſe of free grace. Now a man on his own
feet, and by his own ſtrength, though ſick, may come to the
Phyſicians office-houſe where all his medicine boxes and
helps and remedies of health are, and be cured ere he goe
a way, and may go away with perfect ſtrength and health;
yet he came to the Phyſicians houſe in no ſtrength nor
health, which he received from his art and medicine. The
Word is the net, the Fiſh may come in its own natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
within the boſome of the net; but its the ſtrength of
the arms of the Fiſher, that hales the Fiſh to land; the Fiſh
catcheth not it ſelf. The word of God is a ſharp two-edged
ſword, and doth the work by the Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. The
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119064:83"/>
mouth of Chriſt is like a ſharp ſword, Iſa. 49. 2. His arrows
are ſharp in the <hi>heart of the Kings enemies, whereby the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fall under him,</hi> Iſa. 45. 5. A man may in his own
natural ſtrength come in within the ſhoot of Chriſt's arrow,
and under the ſmiting and ſtroke of the drawn ſword of the
Goſpel; for Chriſt puts forth his power in his Miniſters, and
renewed and unrenewed may come and hear.</p>
               <p>3. The difference betwixt the Law and Goſpel is, that
the Law neither promiſes nor gives ſtrength, but preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that the man hath ſtrength: but the Goſpel promiſeth
a new heart, and the Law engraven in the heart; therefore
Chriſt doth reign in the New Teſtament in the actual Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
of grace, and men by a meer local motion of
nature or ſome ſuperadded morality good or bad, come in
to wiſedoms houſe of wine, and bring themſelves in under
the ſcattered fire coals of Goſpel-adminiſtration, with no
intention ſpiritual to believe and be ſaved; and ſo the
coming in to hear, and the applying of the natural organ
of hearing, the ſetting on work the unrenewed mind, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
conſcience, heart and affections to the literal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and weighing of the ſtrong reaſons that are in the
Goſpel caſteth the man and his ſoul by a good and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
conſequent under ſuch heavenly flamings of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
influences as convey the preached Goſpel by an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God, in due order, to cauſe ſuch as are choſen of
God believe: its in a mans free will to draw near to the
fire, or not to draw near, but when he is come to the fire
ſide, the fire can make him hot, whether he will or no. By
a free election a man caſts timber in the fire; but without
any election, a ſtrong fire cannot chooſe but burn dry
fewel. Its true, the ſea-man cannot create winds, nor
change the blowing of the wind from Eaſt to Weſt; yet he
can prepare his veſſel, hoiſe the ſayls, and fit the ſhip for
receiving the winds. The husband-man hath no command
of winds, of rain, of clouds, of ſummer Sun; yet may he
dreſs, labour, and ſit and prepare his rigs and garden to
lie under the ſeaſonable influences of ſuch Summer air,
rain, dew and impreſſions of the heaven and the clouds, as
the Lord of nature ſhall afford. Now as all the Kings and

Powers on earth cannot command wind and rain; ſo is
there no induſtry required of the husband-man to procure
ſummer or calm ſeaſons: nor can the Plough act upon the
Sun and clouds; nor is the blame to be laid upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
ſleepineſs, that the wind is not fair for ſayling, and
that the Sea flows not ſo high; yet hath the Lord of purpoſe
left to all unrenewed men born where the Goſpel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
the gates and ports of wiſedoms houſe open, that they
may come and hear, and paſs their judgement what they
think of <hi>Emanuel's</hi> land, that runs with wine and milk; yea
and the entry to this houſe is feazable and acceſſible, by
natural ſtrength, to fools and ideots, to learned and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
ſo that they need not ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
That is, to bring Chriſt again from above: Or, who ſhall
deſcend into the deep? That is, to bring up Chriſt again from
the dead. But the word is now near even in thy mouth, and
in thy heart, that is, the word of faith which we preach,</hi> Rom.
10. 7, 8, 9, 10. Deut. 13. 14. The preached Law leading
pedagogically to Chriſt in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, and the plainly
preached Goſpel offered to all in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, is an open
door to all, who love to come near to Chriſt and to be
warmed by him; in which conſideration there is a key
put in every mans hand. 1. The unrenewed man turns
away his ear from the Law, and will not let the news of the
Goſpel lodge in his ear, or the outer room of his ſoul; ye
ſet not a work the literal actings and cogitations of the
heart, to think whether Chriſt, and Heaven and Hell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerns
you, or no. So 2. The believer under deadneſſe
and ſaddeſt deſertion, when he is at this, All is but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
work I had before, <hi>Pſal. 31. 22. Jer. 2. 4. Job</hi> 13.
24. God reputes me as an enemy; He may read the word,
hear the Goſpel preached, and caſt himſelf in Chriſt's way,
and come in under the caſt of his ſaving influences, and ſo
the fire may be kindled of new: the ſin is that the natural
man uſeth wit, judgment, memory, for a worldly bargain of
gain, but not for ſalvation. 3. Chriſt is in his own ordinance:
never man before he be converted, can ſavingly intend
his own converſion; <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Matthew,</hi> when
Chriſt ſpoke to them, minded no ſaving work on their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119064:85"/>
nor did the three thouſand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. nor the Jaylor,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. mind ſo much as they met with. Many came to
Chriſt for bodily health, and to be freed of Satan in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
poſſeſſion; yet when they ſee and hear Chriſt lying at
wait, in ambuſh, in the preached Goſpel, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their intentions taken captives. There is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the doing of the bulk and body of an
action, and the action commanded by the higheſt authority
of God; even though the man perform not the action upon
the account of a divine command. Suppoſe <hi>Naaman</hi> had

both a ſin, (the contrary of it being moral goodneſs a part of
original righteouſneſſe and of the concreated image of
God, to wit, of righteouſneſs and holineſs, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 23, 24.

a hainous ſin, and alſo judicially afflicted for former ſins:
And then the holy Law may as well charge men to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

As God may charge <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart to be ſoft, and moved
with rods, and to yield to the command, (<hi>Let my people
go</hi>) when God judicially hardens the heart.</p>
               <p>2. Suppoſe that man loves willingly to be blind, as all
love their native blindneſſe.</p>
               <p>3. Suppoſe the blind man to be under the moral debt
of having his ſeeing faculty, even the compleat image of
God, and of loving, &amp; not hating his Phyſitian Chriſt (when
revealed and preached) who only can reſtore his faculty
of ſeeing. Now man remaining after the Fall a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creature, is obliged by the firſt command to believe
God in all he ſaith, and to love Chriſt, God incarnate or
not incarnate. He from whom the eyes are plucked, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be under a moral obligation to ſee, becauſe the eye
ſeeth not by freedome, that is, inherent in the eye:
But a man within the viſible Church is obliged to perform
all free obedience of believing in Chriſt revealed, whether
habitual or actual, which his <hi>Creator</hi> commands; ſo the
compariſon halts widely.</p>
               <p>4. Suppoſe the man does firſt with his own hand put out
his own eyes, as we did in <hi>Adam;</hi> and that the relation of
penalty follows this blindneſſe, by the will of the juſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
as its here.</p>
               <p>5. Suppoſe the blind man gave virtual conſent to the
voluntarily loved want of the lovely and gracious art of
the onely Phyſician, who can reſtore his ſight, as the caſe
is here.</p>
               <p>6. Suppoſe that the Creator of eyes hath once given the
facultie of ſeeing, and that he is not obliged to reſtore it
ever when the man caſts it away; and that the man a
thouſand times winks,<note place="margin">Original ſin is ſin properly ſo called.</note> and ſhuts his eyes, and hates to be

with the juſt and holy Lord.</p>

               <p>4. Heathens, ignorant of ſin original, are ſtill left by
ſuch maſters to accuſe Juſtice. If Infants be free of ſin,
why is nature called by them a ſtep-dame, which hath
brought forth men in ſuch miſery when they enter in the
world? Why do Infants ſuffer death, burning, drowning,
ripping up, and wounding in the wombe? Why ſuffer
they ſuch wrath of pining ſickneſſe, incurſions of Devils,
if all theſe be free of ſin? Some ſay theſe are temporary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
but it proves not any ſin deſerving eternal burning to
be in Infants. The Lord needs not my lye; but let any
man anſwer me in point of holy ſpotleſſe juſtice, how a
puniſhment of ten degrees can more be inflicted for that
which is no ſin, nor any tranſgreſſion of a Law, then a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of a thouſand degrees? See how Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> with

whole ſins and half ſins, whole wrath and hell, and half
wrath and half condemnation, or half hell.</p>
               <p>Q. But what Law is there that we ſhould have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of believing, or the image of God? The covenant of
works doth preſuppoſe that image to be in man; otherwiſe
he is not in a capacitie to be in covenant with God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it could not be injoyned and commanded in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have this <hi>Image</hi> of God.
And if ſo, the want of it muſt be a meer puniſhment, not
a ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting man is both a creator and alſo a law-giver.</note> The Lord in creating <hi>Adam</hi> muſt neceſſarily have
a two-fold Conſideration. One 1. of a Creator. 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of a Law-giver. In the firſt the Lord creates Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but in the latter he is ſuch a ſpecial Creator, to wit, a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119064:88"/>
Law-giving Creator, who, while he creates Being, does
concreate theſe noble Principles, and write and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ingrave the Law of the Image of God, the natural
knowledge of God, his holineſſe, juſtice, mercie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
of right and wrong, and a natural holineſſe and innate
conformitie of the heart to the eternal Law of God in mans
ſoul. A Painter drawes the portraict of a living beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heroick King, according to the living man; the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
both gives being to the painted image, and ſuch a
being, according to the law and art of painting; he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
exactly and accurately his copie and living ſamplar,
and ſo gives a law to his own acts of painting. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, in one and the ſame act, both creates man,
and gives him a being, even holineſſe, his image, and holy
being; and in creating of man, gives, and concreates,
and ingraves the image of <hi>GOD,</hi> ſound knowledge, right
inclinations; and while the Lord creates, he gives and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves
a Law; and while he gives and ingraves a Law, he
creates man. And therefore it follows not that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works does not preſuppoſe the image of God in
man; and it does not follow but the very act of God in
ſtamping and ingraving his image in <hi>Adam,</hi> is alſo a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of him a Law. Yea, God in creating any creature of
nothing, does alſo concreate, as a ſort of Law-giver, ſuch
a natural Law. <hi>Every creature, Sun, Moon, Heaven, Earth,
Sea, Man, Angel, ought to be ſubject as a creature to God
Creator in being and operation.</hi> Here is both the act of a
Creator, and alſo the act of a Law-giver.</p>
               <p>Now the eternal Law of God requires that mans ſoul
ſhould be, by creation, indued with the image of God;
and <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> by that image ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to that Law
for a time, <hi>Eat not, leſt ye die.</hi> They knew the Law was
juſt, and they knew it was their natural obligation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey;
and how can it be denied but this knowledge was a
part of the mans natural goodneſſe and holineſſe, and ſo
agreeable to the eternal Law of God; and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
of this, to doubt of the truth of this, as Satan indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to doe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. was a blacking of that fair image,

houſe of ſinful <hi>Adam,</hi> that we lay claim unto, is a botch-houſe,
and leper-houſe, and worſe: And this is more vile
then if there were none of the world that we could claim
kindred unto but ſerpents, dogs, ſwine and wolves.</p>
               <p>2. How proud and ſhameleſſe are we to deny this run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
botch of ſin original, and ſay it is no ſin? would it
cure a man of a raging peſt-boile, to ſay it was no peſt, to
give it another name? It's a part of original ſin in our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm
to belye the Lord, and ſay it is ſoul-ſickneſſe, but
it is not ſin; it deſerves not the ſecond death. Infants then,
dying Infants, are no debtors to the compleat ranſome of
blood that Chriſt gave to deliver them from the wrath:
And when our Saviour bleſſed Infants, and ſaid, <hi>Of ſuch is
the kingdom of heaven,</hi> his ſenſe muſt be, that infants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
this life in infancie, hold heaven by no Charter of
Chriſt, the heir of all; are not waſhed from ſin, are not
delivered from wrath to come, nor obtain ſalvation by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119064:89"/>
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as it is in 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
               <p>3. What debt is this; who of Angels or men can pay
the hire of free love to Chriſt? ye were born beaſts, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Lions, Dogs, and broods of Satan and the Serpents
ſeed, and Chriſt hath made you ſons of God, Kings and
Prieſts to God, heirs of life, co-heirs with Chriſt, partakers
of the divine nature, the firſt-born of <hi>God</hi> written in heaven.</p>
               <p>4.<note place="margin">No man can bring himſelf in a ſpiritual capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace.</note> Never dream that your own ſtrength, or good parts

               <argument>
                  <p>The ſecond particular of fetching influences is by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
actings by the word and ſpirit. 1. Its a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether juſtified ones perform any moral actions
without any influence of the habit of grace. 1. Some
heat and warmneſs may ariſe materially from actings
in duties though cuſtomary, formal, dead. 3. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
of ſpiritual actions are the beſt preparations for
ſpiritual actions. 4. Influences of grace oyl the
wheels of the ſoul for more ſpiritual acting. 5. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and literal actings, though void of grace, becauſe
they are ſome way under the inſtitution of a divine
command are nearer to ſaving actings of grace, then
the contraries of theſe actions are. 6. A practiſe of
free grace in the Lord, is to be differenced from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of grace. 7. How the Lord is under a neceſſity
of giving influences.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere be ſome actings even in renewed men,<note place="margin">How to fetch influences.</note> partly
from the Spirit, partly from nature, cuſtome or forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
The queſtion is thus framed, becauſe it is a diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
queſtion; Whether juſtified ones doe any actions mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
good from an only principle natural, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the indwelling ſpirit at all, ſince their ſins, after
their being in Chriſt, are not committed with the full
benſil of the will; for the Spirit in ſome meaſure retards
and weakens the motion of the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and the habit
of ſin original is weakned and remitted or ſlacked in its
ſtrength in the regenerate; and therefore it would ſeem, if
the ſpirit do weaken, retard and blunt the actions of the
fleſh, that far more there is in all moral actions that are
good morally, ſome influence of the Spirit leſs or more.
So the Queſtion is, whether or no the children of God may
ſafely ſet to work, though their actions proceed from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119064:90"/>
natural power, cuſtome or a meer office, with little
influence of habitual grace, to works of grace that they
may fetch influences of grace.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">The Spirit of grace hath his own influence in actions which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form out of cuſtome and formality at leaſt in the progreſs of theſe actions.</note> Its not unlike it may be ſo for the godly who went to
the morning and evening prayers and ſacrifices, as is clear,
<hi>Pſal. 141. 2. Acts 3. 1. Luke</hi> 1. 8, 9. might go about theſe
duties ſometime upon meer cuſtome (and the children of
God who know their own backdrawing hearts ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
this) and they may pray from a natural conſcience, and
not ſo much as is required, and otherwiſe they do mind
the duty as an Ordinance of God, and yet be inflamed
with ſpiritual duties ere they end; this is confirmed by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
praying at ſet times; ſo may a Paſtor by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of his office, preach and pray at the beginning with
much deadneſs and coldneſs, and more then an ordinary
ſtraitning of ſpirit, and yet a fire flaught of a heavenly kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
falls upon the ſpirit before the work be ended. Any
who believes that the wind blows where it liſts, and that
the influences of the ſpirit are various as touching their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
may ſee the truth of this.</p>
               <p>2. The children of God appear dead, cold, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly
to complain in the beginning of praying, and of a
Pſalm, as is clear in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22. 2. exponing that of him
(as ſome verity it hath in ſome points of him, <hi>v.</hi> 2.) and in
<hi>Ezekiah</hi> in his ſong, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. 10. in <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. and in

yet there is confidence of believing, triumphing, rejoycing
in <hi>God</hi> and praiſing, ere the Prayer and Pſalm be ended.</p>
               <p>3. The prayers of the children of <hi>God, Pſal. 22. Pſ. 6. Pſ. 38.

our God? <hi>So</hi> Lam. 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c. compared
with</hi> ver. 2, 22, 23. <hi>in which actings under unbelief and

faith eying the command of</hi> God, <hi>in the darkneſſe,
when there is no light,</hi> Iſa. 60. 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c. there go along
ſome farther actings of the ſpirit: not that we think there
is any truth of that of the School-men;</hi> To him who
doth what he can, by the ſtrength of nature, God denies not
helps and influences of grace. <hi>Yet in theſe we ſee God
comes along with his influences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we ſay 4. That there are in the renewed child of
God, ſome ſtirrings of the ſpirit in all theſe acts, we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
under deadneſs, then one act of praying, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of grace makes way <hi>phyſically</hi> to another, and that
to a third; for to ſay nothing of the promiſe, <hi>To him that
hath it ſhall be given,</hi> (of which hereafter) I do but provoke
to the experience of the Saints, if here the ſecond pull of
prayer be not ſtronger then the firſt, and the third then the
ſecond, and the fourth above the third; for when the
wheels are a going, the Organs of the ſpirit do not weary:
And there is a reſerve of freſh ſtrength and a ſtronger
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119064:91"/>
recruit, and ſupply in <hi>Jacobs</hi> wreſtling until the dawning

with God, then in his wreſtling all the night, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.
26. <hi>Let me go</hi> (ſaith the Angel of the Covenant, Chriſt)
<hi>for the day breaketh: And he ſaid, I will not let thee go, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou bleſſe me. 28. As a Prince thou haſt power with
God,</hi> ſaith the Lord to him. And we ſee one throwing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
of the key when the lock of the door is ruſted, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the ſecond throwing obout more eaſie, and the third
throw does yet more, and the ſeventh or the tenth throw
makes the paſſage of the iron bolt yet moſt eaſie, and the
door at length, with little violence, is opened, when now
the ruſt and ſtraitneſſe is removed: And a flaming of the
fire prevailing over a dry tree, makes eaſie way to a ſecond
flaming, and that to a third, and ſo to all the reſt, till the
timber be conſumed, and the fire be fully victorious. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
adds to believing; praying begets more praying;
and we ſee motion breeds warmneſſe, and that ſtronger
motion, and cold hearts that are dead, and almoſt frozen,
by one ſmiting of influences grow hotter, and by two or
three or ſeven actings of the ſpirit, grow yet hotter, and

                  <hi>If a man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were to run a race, if he were
to doe any bodily exerciſe, there muſt be ſtrength of body, he
muſt be fed well, that he may have ability; but the uſe of the
very exerciſe it ſelf, the very particular act, which is of the
ſame kinde with the exerciſe, is the beſt thing to fit him for it.
So in this dutie of prayer; it's true, to be ſtrong in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
man, to have much knowledge, to have much grace,
makes a man fit and able for the duty: But if you ſpeak of
the immediate preparation for it, I ſay, the beſt way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
us for it, is the very duty it ſelf, as all actions of the
ſame kind increaſe the habits, ſo prayer makes us fit for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
and that is a rule. The way to godlineſſe is the compaſs
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119064:92"/>
of godlineſſe it ſelf; that is, the way to grow in grace, is the
exerciſe of that grace.</hi> I wiſh this man of God, and others
more experienced then I, had ſaid more of this unknown
ſubject; and that the Lord would ſit builders in both
Kingdomes to draw up a body of <hi>Theologia practica,</hi> that
Divinity were more in our hearts, its too much in the heads
of many; only I ſpeak here of preparation to receive influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
D. <hi>Preſton</hi> of the preparation to duties, to praying
under indiſpoſition. But I would not be underſtood ſo, as if
I thought acts of influences, which are acts of Omnipotency,
might be ſharpened and facilitated by our actings; Only
my meaning is that the paſſive capacity of the ſoul may be
widened and enlarged to receive ſhowres of quickening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
from the Lord by frequent acts. Experience, in
my weak apprehenſion, may ſpeak influence of grace oyls
the wheels of the ſoul. Prov. 1. 5. <hi>A wiſe man will hear, and
encreaſe learning: and a man of underſtanding, ſhall attain
unto wiſe counſels.</hi> We grow hot, like hot iron redded in the
fire, by praying, and are ſoftned and macerated like dry
and parched ground, by frequent ſhowres; and though the
heart be frozen and cold, when we begin to duties of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
praiſing, meditating, conferring of the word, hearing,
yet <hi>incaleſcimus,</hi> we grow warm by acting: the riſing of
the Sun cauſeth the Ice to drop off the houſes. Its a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
heart that is in the ſame caſe after frequent prayer, that
it was in before; It ſays that the man hath been ſweating
at the letter and bark of the duty; little of the bark or
letter of the duty takes glewing with the heart, but hardly
can the grace of the duty go along with the heart, but there
is much that cleaves to the heart; ſo that influences thaw
the heart. <hi>Luke 24. 32. Did not</hi> (ſay the Diſciples) <hi>our
hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and
while the opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> Cant. 1. 4. <hi>When the
King brought me into his chambers: we will be glad &amp; rejoyce
in thee, and remember thy love more then wine.</hi> Sure when
the influences of Chriſt are fiery and live coals, it is no
wonder they leave lively warmings upon the heart. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.
16. <hi>Awake, O North wind, and come thou South, and blow
vpon my garden that the ſpices thereof may flow out.</hi> It muſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119064:92"/>
be a ſpeech to the Spirit to breath upon the Saints that
they may ſmel and flow more in the actings of the ſpirit.
Pſal. 119. 32. <hi>I ſhall run the ways of thy Commandments,
when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart.</hi> Running ſpeaks more of
a ſpiritual capacity to receive drawing influences either
actual or habitual; and the enlarging notes ſtraitning, and
that influences find us dead and bring vigourouſneſs with
them.</p>
               <p>Though in this or that act of breathing there ſhine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
liberty; for who hired the Lord to moiſten the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
tree? yet there is place for that Queſtion, Whether
the Lord hath not brought himſelf under a holy neceſſity
of giving influences? to which its anſwered in theſe.</p>
               <p>1. As there is a neceſſity of a Decree relating to means
and end,<note place="margin">How the Lord brings himſelf under a ſort of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influences.</note> ſo is there a neceſſity of a promiſe, as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
The Lord created the firſt Vine-tree, and the firſt
Roſe, and they ſeeded and brought forth other Roſes and
Vine-trees; the Lord firſt prevenes ſavingly the dead ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
&amp; by an infuſed habit (as we ſhall hear) puts the ſinner
under an obligation to duties, and puts himſelf, becauſe of
his intended end, to ſave loſt ſinners (as it were) under an
obligation of beſtowing influences of grace, (though in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
conſideration they be given through ſoveraignty of
grace) becauſe his holy decree carries him not to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own ſeed, nor to forſake the work of his hands.
Nature giving hunger, and the holy and ſupreme Lord of
nature giving appetite to eat and drink, gives us alſo a
power of concoction. The Bird by an intended end lays
one ſtraw and one feather in the neſt, and ſo it muſt lay
another and a third and a fourth; for the Lord of nature
intends a compleat houſe for the Eggs and the young birds:
and in like manner the Lord of grace hath a deſign of
grace in his heart to bring many ſons to glory. And he muſt
upon the like intention proceed, to make the ſeed a tree;
but firſt he muſt make it a plant, and ripen the grape and
boyl it more with the heat of the Sun, until he make it ripe
for the wine-preſſe and the fat: So muſt he add influences
dayly of free grace for the perfecting of the work he hath
begun, in his holy decree as well as in the execution,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119064:93"/>
until he perfect it unto the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But 2.<note place="margin">A practiſe of grace, and a promiſe of grace in God.</note> There is need to diſtinguiſh betwixt a <hi>practiſe of free
grace</hi> in the Lord, (ſome call it half a promiſe) &amp; a <hi>promiſe
of free grace:</hi> And theſe muſt be cleared. As to the former;
the <hi>Lord</hi> doth many things of meer grace relating to his
free goodneſs. 2. To his free decree of grace. 3. To his holy
order of working, which he hath not promiſed to do: As of
his free goodneſs, he creates the world, he feeds the Ravens,
he preſerves wicked <hi>Sodom</hi> from the ſword, and curſed
<hi>Cham</hi> from being drowned, when the whole world in godly
<hi>Noah</hi>'s time periſhed in the waters; yet hath he engaged
himſelf by promiſe to none of his creatures, Angels or Men
that he ſhall create the World, that he ſhall feed the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
that he ſhall preſerve <hi>Sodom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. According to his free decree of grace he intends from
eternity to ſave <hi>Jacob;</hi> For he loved him, before <hi>he had
done good or evil;</hi> and he ordains all the choſen to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.
But becauſe he decrees to bring <hi>Jacob</hi> and ſuch to
glory, it follows not that he engaged by promiſe becauſe of
his eternal decree, to bring <hi>Jacob</hi> to glory, except we
ſhould ſay what ever <hi>God</hi> decrees to doe, that alſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to doe; which were not good divinity.</p>
               <p>3. As to his order of working; the Lord ordinarily from
much labouring and painful ſowing brings a rich harveſt;
from careful watching he makes a ſafe City; Yet there is
not any promiſe in the word that from the ſimply careful
uſe of means, the deſired end ſhall follow; for the City is
often well watched, and yet ſurprized: ſome ſow much,
and reap little, <hi>Pſal. 127. 1, 2. Hag.</hi> 1. 6, 9.</p>
               <p>Yet is there a practiſe of free grace in this order;<note place="margin">A Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference betwixt the Lord's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace and his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the blind men cry, <hi>Son of David, have mercy on us;</hi> (yet
they poſſiby intend only by the way ſide to beg) and <hi>Chriſt</hi>

of grace that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall heal all blind men begging by the

that the Lord Jeſus who is as mighty now as ever, ſhall ſend

influences of grace to reveal <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a ſaving manner, to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119064:93"/>
him; not becauſe he reads, or becauſe there is a promiſe
made to ſave all who read the word. Upon ſinful ends,
the multitude, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. come to hear the word; their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hearing, being mocking enemies, was naught; Yet
by a practiſe of grace, not by any promiſe of grace they are
converted. Now in this it may be ſaid, that the natural
yea and faithleſs uſe of means hath ſome influence <hi>ex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura
rei</hi> upon the effect, not by promiſe, yet by the decree
of <hi>God;</hi> and ſo by no merit, becauſe by no promiſe (for
another merit, then what is founded upon free promiſe,
and not upon the worth and condignity of work and
wages, I hope never to acknowledge, by his grace, whom I
deſire to be my inward teacher) and to me reading, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
uſe of means, have a material influence as to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
not to the promiſe of grace; For according to the
Philoſophy I learned; ſix is materially a number nearer
of blood and kindred to eight, then four is; yet ſix and
eight are numbers in ſpece and nature no leſs different then
eight and four, or then eight and two which are materially
farther different then ſix and eight, which are different only
by two. So the Embrio before life, and the birth now
quickened by life differ in nature and ſpece, as living and
not living differ: Yet the Embrio the ſhaped organized
body void of life is materially nearer to a living birth,
then the ſeed is to a living birth. So I ſhall never teach
that hearing, reading, literal conſidering of the weight
of reaſons in the Goſpel from Heaven, from the
beauty and preciouſneſs of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Civil profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are nearer to converſion and to Chriſt then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profane and flagitious, and how they are alſo farther diſtant.</note> the excellency of free

cloſing with Chriſt, and that they confer not ſome influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(<hi>materially</hi>) of help in promoving towards Chriſt;
What theſe truſted in may doe as in another thing. Hence
though there be no promiſe, no moral connection betwixt

grace and the incoming of the new creation into the ſoul;
yet comparatively a connection there is, in this ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:119064:94"/>
1. As painful tilling, ſowing and labouring is nearer to
a plentiful harveſt then lazy ſleeping in Summer; ſo diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and moral walking in the Commandments of <hi>God,</hi> by
which the man is <hi>not far from the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and
nearer to it, is nearer to converſion then the godleſſe and
ſlagitious converſation of a diſſolute wretch; as he, who is
at a diſtance from a City, by twenty miles only, is nearer
to the City, then he who is diſtant a hundred miles from
it; though both be diſtant from it, and the one formally is
out of the City as well as the other; this is a wily compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
I aſſert no preparatory diſpoſitions to converſion, as
<hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> teach.</p>
               <p>2. The man yet unplowed and never broken by the
Law, ſtanding in a whole condition, not caring for, nor ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needing, or valuing <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is farther from ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of ſaving influences, then the law-humbled &amp; law-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſinner, who, though he be but half ſick, like the woman
with child, who is under raw and far-off ſhowres of child-birth
pain, not yet, by ſome weeks, near her time, needs
not yet the help of the midwife, yet looks a far off to child-birth
pain.</p>
               <p>3. Out of all queſtion the proud gallant that feareth
neither God nor reverenceth man, and hath laid Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
his count and fixed his thoughts concerning Heaven
and Hell, hath ſomething more to doe, before <hi>Chriſt</hi> rain
ſalvation on him, then he who prays, hears, gives almes,
whores not, roars not, blaſphemes not; for he hath fewer
miles between him and Chriſt's influences.</p>
               <p>4. Therefore though the natural man cannot pray in
faith, and the renewed man under a ſad and deep dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
can doe little or nothing, yet literal and natural
acting at praying is not only better then nothing, but is
by way of command <hi>in genere mandati divini,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">External uſe of means is to be gone about, as nearer to converſion then no uſe of means, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs.</note> more near
to praying in faith and fervour then either blaſpheming, or
no praying at all; even as literal and natural heat is nearer
to ſpiritual and ſupernatural heat, then extreme coldneſſe;
and as fire-heat is nearer to life-heat or vital warmneſs
(for it may and doth often cheriſh and nouriſh vital heat)
then Ice-coldneſſe; though as touching the nature and

reſtore vital heat to a dead man; and all the ſweet
moral qualifications, diſcretion, natural zeal, civil vertues
in their ſummer greenneſſe cannot put a man in a ſpiritual
capacity to receive divine and ſupernatural influences;
yea, many carry ſuch bewitching luſters to hell with them,
and never promove a whit farther then to the ſtate of a
civil convert, a ſaint of Satan, and die ſo; and by accident
civil ſaints are a huge way farther from Chriſt, then rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
Its true, ſome of our Divines have ſaid natural prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are hurtful, deſtructive and noxious to converſion.
I wiſh they ſpeak not ſo; their meaning is as they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in, &amp; men are by aſſed by them, praying in the ſtreets &amp;
giving of alms with ſound of Trumpet ſo circumſtantiated
in regard of, 1. The ſubject, proud Phariſees. 2. In regard of
the end, <hi>to be ſeen of men, not to glorifie the Lord.</hi> 3. In regard
of the manner, as ſelf-righteouſneſs truſted in, to the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt, are deſtructive to ſincere praying in faith and
humble feeling, and to true and ſincere acts of charity.
But we ſpeak of the acts commanded as to their ſubſtance;
God highly is provoked at diſobedience, when men will
not put their finger to a duty: and no doubt hypocriſie, in
the manner of doing duties, deadens the heart, and makes
the ſoul unfit to receive influences; But this hinders not
but the unrenewed man, and the deadned convert, are to
blow the fire, and to go about duties, and to fetch the wind
in their kind, and to caſt aboard and turne about, that they
may ſayl and fetch the harbour; Yea, and if there be not
fire in the ſhip, without doubt the ſtriking of ſteel and flint
may make fire. If a dead child of God cannot pray, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
preach, cannot believe, he is to ſay and <hi>take with him
words, Lord, I cannot pray, I cannot preach, I cannot believe:</hi>
Nor in all theſe is any thing ſaid againſt theſe two, 1. The

For charges and commands are layed upon us under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions;

therefore lawleſſe, and freed of all debt of duties which are

2. What aſſurance can any man have tomorrow, or the
next hour, more then the preſent hour, when deadneſſe is
on, that he ſhall be maſter of the Spirits breathing on him,
to fetch ſpiritual diſpoſitions? Now omiſſion of praying,
and of other duties, is a hainous ſin. Can ſin be a hire to
purchaſe or buy the breathings of the Holy Ghoſt? Did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man get ſweet acceſſe to God through the Mediator
Chriſt in prayer, who delayes praying becauſe he wants
a praying diſpoſition? And can the Lord welcome in the
Mediator Chriſt the man who fathers the ſinful omiſſion of
prayer, and other duties, upon the holy Spirit of God?
Looſe Profeſſors delay their repentance upon this, when

from praying continually; and that <hi>Pſal. 50. Call upon me

For it hath this good ſenſe, call and pray in the day of

of deſertion and indiſpoſition, and when the Lord
hides his face and ſhines not. So the want of a ſpiritual
diſpoſition is the frowning of God upon the ſoul; and it's
an ungracious heart which will not pray when the Spirit in
his ſhining influences withdraws. And therefore</p>
               <p>4. It's not the Spirit of the Lord, but the ſpirit of Satan,
which ſuggeſts any ſuch carnal arguing. I have no heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpoſition for the preſent, therefore I will not pray; for
the Spirit of the Lord quickens men to duties, and that is
known to be a ſpirit from hell that weakens men in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               <p>THere is another way of fetching influences of grace,

Pſal. 119. 1. <hi>Bleſſed are they that walk in the law of the Lord,
they ſhall doe no iniquity;</hi> then upon the account of a holy
walk, the Lord muſt beſtow influences of grace to preſerve
men from doing acts of iniquity. And there muſt be a

renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings as
Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, and walk and not

Now freſh ſwiftneſs and recent vigour of ſpeed ſhall be

becauſe <hi>God gave them not an heart.</hi> Nay, but his ſcope is
to complain of the peoples abuſing of the plenty of means.
I gave you the grace of outward means, but ye miſgraced
(to ſpeak ſo) your own heart; therefore it is juſt that ye
be blind and deaf, ſince ye wickedly wink and ſtop your
ears; though it cannot be denied that God would have
them humbled by reflecting on their own wilful winking

ſuch as have influences from the Lord to run, through his
free grace, the Lord of the ſame free grace giveth new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences

he makes ſome rich in grace, he makes them of rich in
grace, yet more rich in grace; and whom he loves freely,
he yet more freely loves. And the truth is, the Lord makes

give place to the Divel, and rotten talking and malice and
wrath ſtealing in; <hi>Paul</hi> is put to that neceſſary word,
Epheſ. 4. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit of God,
by which ye are ſealed to the day of redemption.</hi> For ſuch
ſins bring on withdrawing of influences. Chriſt knocks
and ye put a little ſtone in the Key-hole, and the ſprent is
broken, and the dore will neither open nor ſhut: when
the wheels of the Horologue are broke, there is no ſound of
hours heard; when the bones are cruſhed, the man cannot
walk; the ſpiritual organs, diſpoſitions and powers of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
ſoul were blunted and out of frame, by his adultery
and bloud-guiltineſſe: No wonder then the Spirit was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to dwell and act in his wonted lodging, Pſal. 51. 11.
<hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence: and take not</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>thy holy Spirit from me. 12. Reſtore unto me the joy of thy
ſalvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit.</hi> Its good to
keep the wheels whole.</p>
               <p>But ſin cannot ſo interdict or lay an arreſtment upon
influences as to conclude and reſtrain the free grace of
<hi>God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ripening of guiltineſſe, makes way to ripening of free grace.</note> nor does the Lord by the Saints falls, fall from his
ſoveraignty and princedom of grace; yea, rather from the
heightning and abounding of ſin does the reign and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power of grace ſhine the more; the more tumid the
boyl is, and the more the fleſh about it burns and flames
with the ſwelling of the humour, the more it is ripened for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:119064:98"/>
breaking and healing. A Feaver at the height begins to
decline, as the Sea full at the outmoſt point of the ſhore
does reflow and ebb again. See death and ſin's reign, and
grace and Chriſt's reign, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 17, 21. See <hi>Ezech. 20. 23.
Ezech. 16. 59, 60. Ezech. 26. 21, 22, 23. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14,
15, 16, 17. make ſome ripeneſs for fulneſs of grace. Though
Chriſt's reign cannot ebb or fall; But no thanks to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but great praiſe to him who makes medicine of the
rotten and attry bloud of our wounds.</p>
               <p>5. Its conſiderable that gracious actings fetch influences
for other gracious actings; for grace is nearer of kin to
grace then nature can be to grace.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the Author of influences (that we may
come more particularly to the ſupernaturalneſs of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences)
we know <hi>the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The three perſons, the Father, Son, and Spirit give influences.</note> 
                  <hi>the Son, the holy Spirit</hi> are all
in Scripture ſaid to act upon the ſoul, in a gracious way.
It ſhall not be needful to ſpeak much of the Father's influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
upon the man Chriſt in ſending and beſtowing the
<hi>Spirit and the anointing above his fellows upon him:</hi> In the
influences of the God-head, in a perſonal union upon the
Man Chriſt in filling him with the holy Ghoſt from the
womb: and eſpecially the Lord was mighty in him in
preaching with authority; ſo that the hearers were aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
<hi>and all wondered at the gracious words that proceeded
out of his mouth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fulneſs of influences on the man Chriſt.</note> in praying while his countenance ſhined.</p>
               <p>And 2. The Lord's influences were evident in diſputing
with the Doctors in the Temple, when he was but twelve
years of age, in ſilencing the learned enemies in ſtrongly
convincing parables.</p>
               <p>3. God was mighty in miracles of all ſorts, in caſting out
Divels, healing all manner of diſeaſes inſtantly without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
in raiſing the dead, in rebuking the ſea and the
winds, multiplying the loaves, blaſting the fig-trees, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.
39. <hi>Iſa. 61. 1. John 3. 34. Iſa.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>4. Influences more then ordinary were ſeen in his
ſtrength againſt the Divels, and juſtice and wrath of God
for our ſins, in praying, ſtrong believing, in tears and cries,
in preaching and exhorting his Diſciples, converting the
Thief that ſuffered with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:119064:99"/>
5. He muſt have had ſtrong and mighty influences in
the courſe of a holy and ſinleſſe converſation, in a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
walk, refuſing a Kingdom when it was offered to him,
<hi>John</hi> 6. though he could have born it out; in being poor
for us; in having no hole nor lodging to hide his
head; in meek and patient forgiving of his enemies; in
being much in prayer, ſpending whole nights in praying;
in praying and faſting forty dayes; in obeying all lawes,
fulfilling all righteouſneſſe, ceremonial, moral, natural;
in all works of mercie, obedience to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to Parents,
Brethren, to ſoules of men; in his vertues of faith, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
meekneſſe, patience, love, zeal, hope, delighting in
God.</p>
               <p>Now though none can be ſo neer to God as the man
Chriſt, who in one perſon was not neer to God only, but
was <hi>God-man</hi> and <hi>Emanuel;</hi> yet learn we hence, the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
we are to God, the more are we under the ſhowres of
influences of grace. It's good to be holy, and keep cloſe
communion with God, and dwell hard by the Fountain,
and we ſhall be watered. The tree planted by the rivers
ſide hath moſt influences; and the man that lies in a bed
of roſes, and is neer to ſpikenard, to mirrhe, aloes, and
Caſſia, and is dayly among the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

garden of all fragrant ſmels, will carry ſome ſweet ſavour
away. The Lord Jeſus his out-lettings of free love and
grace, muſt run much upon theſe who are daily neer to
him. Keep a diſtance from God, and be much at cups,
at chambering and wantonneſſe, in the company of the
whore, of the profane, of the ſwearer, what hope of
ſhowres and waterings of influences of grace upon ſuch a

condeſcends to take on the perſon, and, as it were, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

noble generous Vine-trees to be planted in the higher gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
and ſhall an earthly husband-man plow, delve, ditch,
plant, purge, and do all that becomes his office? ſo that it
the Vine-tree had wit and reaſon, it could not make a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
will the husband-man care for me? will he delve,
and dreſſe, and purge me, that I may bring forth more
fruit? Far more may the believer ſay, Chriſts Father and
my Father is the good husband-man, and both have begun
the good work in me. Faith would ſay, he will not be
wanting in his office of husbandry; he will ſend ſhowers of
bleſſings and influences upon his mount Sion, and upon me
a withered and dry twig.</p>
               <p>3. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn 15. I am the Vine-tree, ye are the
branches.</hi> Now look what influences of ſap and life the

heart to underſtand the Scriptures is his office, and to
warm the heart by the word, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32, 45.</p>
               <p>3. As High Prieſt he aſcended on high, and contributes
his influences for ſending down the Spirit, <hi>Luke 24. 49.
John 14. 16, 17. John</hi> 16. 7.</p>
               <p>Yea, and predeterminating influences to circumciſe the

predeterminating grace, or give it another name, I contend
not, or call it an impreſſion of ſtrong delectation on the

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119064:100"/>
Chriſt be Maſter of their free will, and he muſt have a bar
of ſtrong influences on their heart, that it ſhall not be in the
power of Satan, the world or ſinful fleſh to pluck them out
of his hand. Hence againſt all trepidation of mind, this is
removed; what warrant have we, that we can make uſe of
the influences of grace that are in the hands of the Son?
theſe are a fowl flying in the wood, which we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
take theſe anſwers.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">The influences in the Son are all for our uſe and good.</note> What ever Mediatory grace is in the Son they are
gracious influences laid by for our good; as what ſums of
money a rich man is to give out for the profit of Minors, he
mixes it not with his own, but looks on it as none of his,
but to be expended for the good of others; and the Minors
having aſſurance of the faithfulneſſe and care of their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
look upon it as their own: we are by faith to look
upon the treaſury of Chriſt that is begun to be beſtowed on
us; and that Chriſt ſhall not withdraw, (being a moſt
faithful Tutor) what is neceſſary for our beſt life.</p>
               <p>2. Chriſt being the beſt of Kings, the moſt faithful of
Prieſts, and above all the Prophets, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and who ever
they were, by office is to give out influences. If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Chriſt ſhall acquit himſelf as a King, then ſhall
his ſubjects find the outlettings of grace for repentance and
remiſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. for Chriſt is worthy of his throue and
chair of Princely ſtate We are to believe, as our high
Prieſt, he ſhall, by vertue of his office, apply by the Spirit
the bloud of attonement and <hi>ſprinkle the nations therewith;</hi>
As alſo, when we ſin he gives out influences for believing
that our Advocate lives and intercedes for us; and the acts
of opening the heart to believe the Scriptures, to be guided
in all truth, to be comforted and quickned, come from
Chriſt the great Prophet; and if he be <hi>God,</hi> what the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of Heaven and Earth does by his office, if he feed
all living things, the Ravens move not the queſtion what
they ſhall eat to morrow, nor the Lillies of the field how
they ſhall be cloathed: far more, believers are to reſt upon
this, Chriſt ſhall fully execute all his offices in all parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them.</p>
               <p>3. The Vine-tree, by a flux of nature, ſends ſap to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119064:101"/>
branches, and the head does not deliberate nor interpoſe
freedome of will to ſend down life and influences of life to
the members; but nature hath a ſtrong hand in this: at
leaſt love is ſoon reſolved in the husband what ſhall be the
influences of good communicated by him to the Spouſe.
The great thing Redemption is purchaſed, and will Chriſt

and if any have the ſpirit, he cannot want the influences

               <p>3. What are the divers influences to be taken notice of:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119064:101"/>
The two ſpirits are clear, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 12. But we have not received
the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God. Paul</hi>
had ſaid that the world and the Princes of the world knew
not the myſtery of the Goſpel; why? <hi>They had not crucified
the Lord of glory, had they known him.</hi> As alſo the ſpirit
teacheth it, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. how is that proved? from the nature of
an infinite ſpirit, that ſearcheth all the things of the infinite
God; even as a mans ſpirit ſearcheth all the things of a
man, <hi>v.</hi> 12. How can we know the things of <hi>God,</hi> they are
far above us. He anſwers, we who have received, not the
ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> doe know the
things that are graciouſly given us of God: they know the
things of <hi>God;</hi> But <hi>v.</hi> 12. we are ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant by the <hi>ſpirit of the world?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its the humane ſpirit, by which we know Arts and
Sciences,<note place="margin">The ſpirit of the world.</note> and the things of a preſent world, which is
alſo the Spirit of God, and a ſingular gift of God. But
there is ſomewhat more in this ſpirit: a carnal ſpirit that is
oppoſite to the Spirit that is of God, a ſpirit that judges the
depths of Goſpel wiſedom to be fooliſhneſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Hence the differences of the two ſpirits.</p>
               <p>1. There are no ſaving influences due to the ſpirit of the
world. The worlds ſpirit ſees the myſteries of Philoſophy
and Arts, and the good things of a preſent flowing world,
and no more. And as an old man ſees all that a child can
ſee and know, and much more in a more ſolid way: So
the children of God often, as <hi>Moſes, Solomon, Daniel, Paul,</hi>
ſee with the ſpirit of the world in this ſenſe all which the
men of the world ſee, and in a more ſpiritual way; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> in them knows higher things that
are hid from the world and their ſpirit. As,</p>
               <p>1. How Heaven lies, how many Summers are in one
year in that land.</p>

what golden nothings and clay-dreams does the ſpirit of
the world follow after? what ſpiritual gallantry is in the
man, that ſays and reſolves, time and all that <hi>Solomon</hi> had
ſhall not ſatisfie me; I muſt either be a King above time or
have nothing. Will a beggar aſpire to a Kingdom; or a
ſow ſeek after pearls? what does the ſpirit of the world, but
lie, and ſwear, and whore, and oppreſſe in the ſons of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?
the godly is of a far more excellent ſpirit.</p>
               <p>5. Its a poor ſpirit that acts in <hi>Cicero, Seneca,</hi> and other

while the Lord creates the roſe-tree, the roſe-tree cannot

and ſeat of the ſpirit, <hi>Rom. 1. 16. Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. The word is, as
it were, the work-houſe and ſhop, and the ſpirit the worker;
the word the ſhip or chariot, and the ſpirit drives and ſtirs
the promiſes. The ſpirit honours ſo the word, the ſpirit
moves and acts when the word moves and acts; the ſpirit
utters not a groan but according to the will of God in the
word, <hi>Rom. 8. 26, 27. Acts 10. 44. While</hi> Peter <hi>yet ſpake theſe
words,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt fell upon thoſe that
heard the word.</hi> When the ſhip or the chariot moves, the
Pilot or Steerſ-man and the Coach-man are moved with
them. The poor Miniſter often drives an empty coach, and
carries but ſounds and letters; but when the ſpirit ſtrikes in
with the word, and is ſteerſ-man in the ſhip, the veſſel is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>float,
and ſayls gallantly before the wind.</p>
               <p>2. The word preached is the breathing of the ſpirit, and
the ſpirit ſpeaks and breaths through the word, and it is the
word of the ſpirit; <hi>the holy Ghoſt propheſied well of you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. The ſpirit is referred to the word as the ſoul to the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119064:105"/>
body; the body is but a lump of dead clay if the ſoul be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and the word is ſo many ſounds, ſyllables, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

widely miſtakes) the efficacy of the word is from the
ſpirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. the weapons of our warfare are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
but mighty; how mighty, not of themſelves, but <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
through God.</hi> We make not the word of it ſelf, a dead
inky letter, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Libertines</hi> both doe. The like
diſtinction is clear in a Sword or an Axe of ſteel, both the
one and the other from the matter and artificer that made
them hath <hi>actu primo</hi> ſharpneſs and aptneſs to cut: Suppoſe
the Artificer that made both be dead, yet the ſharpeſt two-edged
ſword that is, except it be weelded by the arm of
a valiant man can doe no good in war: And the like may
be ſaid of the Axe, both are dead things of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Hence 1. Since we are meer Meſſengers, we cannot
breath life in the word only, like the Trumpeter that
blows his warm breath through a dead trumpet of Braſſe;
but he blows or breaths no valour or courage in the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
that was not in them before. But if the ſpirit goe
along and breath life in the hearers they ſhall live, as ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

upon thy feet, and I will ſpeak to thee. 2. Then the ſpirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

So <hi>John 5. 25. Ezech.</hi> 37. 7, 8. It not a little concerns

in the lively power of God,<note place="margin">Speaking in the ſpirit is not ever ſaving to the hearers.</note> and yet nothing but the letter

the hearers are but as weaned children: <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 13, 14, 15.
the hearers are fatted hypocrites. And a poor man ſpeaks
the letter of the word, and happily deadly and weakly;
yet betwixt the ſpeakers mouth and the hearers heart, the
ſpirit ſtrikes in and the dead man lives.</p>
               <p>2. The letter of the word ſpoken by Chriſt lies dead,
until the Comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt come: then
he ſhall teach you all things (in a lively way, which the
man Chriſt, as man only did not) <hi>and bring all things to

               <p>3. The light may remain only light and literal and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe:
the Diſciples in the garden with Chriſt knew they
ſhould watch and pray, yet they ſleep. The ſpirit brings
not up literal light to ſpiritually quickning light, <hi>John 16. 7.
The ſpirit ſhall convince the world of ſin, becauſe they believe
not in me.</hi> What did not all the Prophets convince the
world of ſinful unbelief? Iſa. 7. <hi>If ye believe not, ye ſhall
not be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Iſa. 53. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi>
Did not Chriſt himſelf convince the world of ſinful unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief?
<hi>John</hi> 3.<note place="margin">The ſpirit's convictions.</note> 18, 36. <hi>John 5. 24. John</hi> 11. 26, 27. and all the
Miniſters of the New Teſtament convince men that they
ought to believe and receive Chriſt by faith? But all theſe
are but literal convictions, until the ſpirit carry into the
heart the marrow of the promiſes and threatnings of the
Goſpel with a ſtrong hand,<note place="margin">In the ſpirit's conviction there is ſome new ſtrength added to the word.</note> and the natural man while he
is in the mouth of Hell with <hi>Judas</hi> is convinced of the Law
deſerving, and of unbeliefs deſert, but not of actual dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
The deceit of the conſcience is this, that all are
under ſin and the curſe, who believe not but God muſt
give a general ſuſpenſion againſt the Goſpels decree and
ſentence of death for my unbelief, and to moſt of mankind.
Ah, this is not to be convinced of unbelief by the ſpirits
working: Nor in all this does the ſpirit adde any divine
majeſty and power to the word which was not in the word
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119064:106"/>
before, when he effectually perſwades and convinces; As
the hewer puts no metal in the Axe which was not in it
before, only he applies powerfully his ſtrength and art to
the effects which he produceth by the Axe and other tools,
by which he makes curious carved work. Nor does the
ſouldier adde any new ſharpneſſe to the Sword which it
had not before, only he uſeth the Sword for valorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.
All that the ſpirit doth is in the powerful and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
application of threatnings and promiſes in actual
perſwading to believe; all the majeſty and heavenly power
the word hath <hi>actu primo</hi> from the immediately inſpiring
ſpirit: and this is alike to all; only much godly trembling
is required that the ſpirit may in his mighty influences goe
out with the word.</p>
               <p>2. Hence that is wild-fire and ſparkles of hell not the
ſpirit of Chriſt nor the influences of grace when a dumb
ſpirit ſpeaks not in the word, but in ſignes, images, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
deviſed by men, as a dumb man ſpeaks with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
The Spirit of God loves to work and act with his

               <p>The Prophets, <hi>Acts 13. Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts 16. Philip,
Acts</hi> 8. accurately obſerve the command of the ſpirit, as
being as binding as the command of the Father and the
Son. The commands of God to the men of God were more
legal in the Old Teſtament; but the commands of the ſpirit
now in the New Teſtament have more of free grace and
perſwaſive leading,<note place="margin">Obedience is to be yielded to the ſpirit, as to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son.</note>

is a ſpiritual cloſing, Cant. 1. 4. <hi>The King hath brought me

               <p>3. A ſtate of tranſlation is to be gone about; The man
hath not the ſpirit till he be once over the water tranſlated
to the Kingdome of the dear Son of God. Chriſt is not
owner of the man that hath not the ſpirit: <hi>If any have not
the ſpirit, he is none of Chriſt's,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. Chriſt and the

Law-giver purſuing all that are out of Chriſt. Ah, who
can drink unmixt wrath, as Chriſt did, and live? and who
may ſtand when he is angry? then reſiſting is terrible.</p>
               <p>2. There is vengeance in readineſſe, and grinding of

               </p>
               <p>3. But there is a vengeance beyond a vengeance, and

(not that nature ſinleſs is wholly dead and paſſive, as
Familiſts and others tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nothing, and is denyed: as Matth. 10. 20. <hi>It's not ye that
ſpeak, but the ſpirit of your Father that ſpeaks in you.</hi> Though
they be living perſons in their nature and being, <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>John</hi> ſpeaks: and yet the ſpirit ſo diſcourſes and lays aſide
the creature called <hi>ſelf,</hi> and ſets up God, that as if ſelf were

annihilated and not there at al (I mind no Libertine anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation)
the ſpirit as the predominant ſpeaks in the man
and acts in him, rather then the man. And the Spirit of the
Father, prayeth, preacheth, reigneth, actech, diſputeth,
confeſſeth in the believer. 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>But I laboured more
abundantly then they all;</hi> then muſt <hi>I</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi> be preferred
and exalted above <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple, and all the

yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> Acts 6.
10. <hi>And they were not able to reſiſt the wiſedom and the ſpirit
by which Steven ſpake.</hi> He ſaith not they were not able to

Then <hi>Peter, filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſaid unto them, &amp; made
anſwer to the perſecuting Rulers; this is a far other thing
then if he had ſaid, <hi>then anſwered Peter</hi> the Apoſtle; for
<hi>Peter</hi> was before this, filled with the Holy Ghoſt, but now
the Holy Ghoſt in a new fulneſſe and flowing of heavenly
influences in the man <hi>Peter</hi> is Maſter-ſpeaker. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
this is cleer from 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. Prophecie came not of old
by the will of man;</hi> (though the Prophet was not compelled to
prophecie, nor his will Phyſically ſunken down to nothing)
<hi>but holy men of God ſpake as</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>acted by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
1 Pet. 1. 11. The Spirit of Chriſt ſpake in the Prophets before
hand of the ſufferings of Chriſt and the glory that ſhould
follow. Though there be a difference betwixt the ſpeaking
of a Prophet, and the acting of a believer; there is much of
ſelf in the Prophets, <hi>who bite with the teeth and cry peace.
Micah</hi> ſets himſelf againſt ſuch, <hi>cap. 3. 8. But truly</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>I am full of power, by the ſpirit of the Lord, and of might,
and of judgement to declare unto Jacob his tranſgreſſions
and to Iſrael his ſin.</hi> 3. There is little of ſelf in children;
the children of God (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the word given to ſucking chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of two years old, <hi>Matth, 2. 18. Acts</hi> 21. 21.) are like
ſuch as are learning to walk; there is little ſelf-wiſedom or
of ſelf-deſignes in the motions of young children. So doth
the ſpirit act with facility and without reſiſtence in the ſons
of God; Who may not ſee the colour of ſelf, and feel ſome
ſavour of the creature &amp; of ſelf in men? O if we could ſavour
in looking, ſpeaking, acting, of the ſpirit! The rivers, loths,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119064:109"/>
and fountains iſſue themſelves in the Sea and be mixed
therewith; its the ſalt Sea and not the rivers which ebb
and flow: the under-acting of ſinleſſe nature in ſpiritual
actings hindereth not the work to be denied of the man
and affirmed of the ſpirit; So as we ſay not the man, but
rather God in the man acts and ſpeaks. Indeed things are
not denominate from their externals; a veſſel of copper
waſhed over with ſilver, or a cup of braſſe over-gilded and
luſtered with gold, is not, nor is named a veſſel of ſilver or
a cup of gold. Though we name things by their skin and
out-ſide, yet when the hypocrite prays, the Lord ſays the
man prays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 41. but the Spirit of God prays not in
him. Nor doth the Lord name <hi>Magus</hi> a true believer from
his profeſſion, only the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>he believed.</hi> It's
good when the converſation ſpeaks heaven, and the ſpirit
is viſibly ſeen acting in the behaviour and walk of men.
It's true, there is much of renewed ſelf, (as 1 <hi>Cor. 15, 9, 10.
Gal. 2. 20. Rom. 7. 17, 22. 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 20, 21.) in ſpiritual actings,
and this heightens the excellency of the actions: corrupt
ſelf renders the act of praying and preaching wider and
bigger, but not better and excellenter; eſpecially in publick
renewed ſelf rendereth it excellenter.</p>
               <p>And 5. Not unlike unto that touched before is a chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a ſpiritual man,<note place="margin">To doubt as a bewildered man of all ways and to deſire to be led of God is a ſpiritual character.</note> when the man is ſpiritually bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and doubts of all ways he walks in, except the way
he is ſure to be of God, Pſal. 143. 10. <hi>Teach me to doe thy
will, thy ſpirit is good, lead me into the land of uprightneſs.</hi>
Hence theſe three follow. 1. The ſpiritual man doubts of
all ways, and knows that he is a bewildered and ignorant
traveller of himſelf, and knows not by his own light, 1. The
way. 2. The home and lodging. Or 3. The guide. It
ſaith, the ſpiritual man judgeth the ſpirit of God a good
leader and guide: it's no ſophiſme <hi>à diviſis,</hi> thy ſpirit is
good, thou art a leader; therefore the ſpirit is a good lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and guide: it's much to have the faith fixed upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of dayly guiding by God. 3. It ſays I am willing
<hi>to commit my goings to thee; Take the guiding of me; be
father, guide, leader, tutor, king to me.</hi> All theſe ſpeak ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
bewilderedneſſe; And thoſe two are well joyned.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119064:109"/>
1. Senſe of bewilderedneſſe; and 2. Praying to the one
onely guide in heaven and earth: Pſal. 119. 19. <hi>I am a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
on earth: hide not thy Commandments from me.</hi> The
Commandments are the way, and a hid and covered way
is a miſery to a ſtranger or pilgrim. A frequent ſight of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and errors, and a being in love with the ſpirits
leading is good. Though a man could get the work
through, be it praying, hearing, reading, warring, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
eating and drinking, yet he is not ſatisfied with the
bulk of the work, except the ſpirit be the doer. This gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſpirit looks not ſo much to praying as to praying in
the Holy Ghoſt; nor to hearing as to hearing in the ſpirit
of faith; nor to fighting, though <hi>David</hi> be ſtronger then
the enemy, except the ſpirit of the Lord lead the army, <hi>Pſal.
60. 1, 2, 9, 10. Pſal. 140. 7, 8. Pſal.</hi> 18. 29, 30, 31. Nay it's not
enough to eat and drink except the ſpirit act the man to eat
and drink for God. Men ſpend and waſte away their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings,
and call not for the ſpirit to get them compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.
We are men abundance to build the Temple, and
mighty Kings favour us, and work-men have ſtrength in
legs and arms to lay ſtones in the wall: O but that will
not doe it, Zach. 4. 6. <hi>Not by might, nor by power; but by my
ſpirit ſaith the Lord of hoſts;</hi> and ſo only is the Temple
builded.</p>
               <p>6.<note place="margin">Spiritual faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual character.</note> There is a ſpiritual facility in the ſpiritual actings of a
ſpiritual man. 1. The acting is connatural and eaſie when
it comes from an inward principle; the ſtream naturally
without violence flows from the fountain, and ſo doth heat
from the fire: nor is it any pain to the earth to fall down
and deſcend, or for the light bodies, fire and air to aſcend;
it's neither toyl nor labour to the Sun to give light: for all
theſe come from principles internal. There is violence in
the motion of an Horologue, and therefore the wheels ſhall
be worn out by time; but the actings of the ſpirit are ſweet
and facile; grace makes the Commandments not grievous;
its no pain but eaſie to a gracious paſtor to love Chriſt; it
breaks neither leg nor arm to deſire Chriſt and be
ſick for him, and to feed his flock for love to the chief
ſhepherd. 2. Pſal. 25. 9. <hi>The meek will he guide in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119064:110"/>
judgement, the meek will he teach is ways.</hi> It's eaſie for God,
to guide any man, to guide and lead Lions and Unicorns;
but in the very object there is a facility to counſel a broken
and danted ſpirit. If a man be in his flower and prime,
and rich and mighty, healthy and proſperous, readily he
will doe but what he will; but if the man be in chains and
broken and meekned with the rod of <hi>God,</hi> he is eaſily
bowed and counſelled to what is good; as iron red hot
will bow and yield to the ſmitings of the hammer: i'ts
hard to lead a Lion. The Lord ſpeaks like the Lord to
<hi>Job,</hi> cap. 39. 9. <hi>Will the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn be willing to ſerve thee? or
abide by thy cribs? Canſt thou bind the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn with his band
in the furrows? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</hi>
but it is eaſie to bind a lamb. Meekneſſe is eaſily led and
drawn: when the ſpirit comes in, the man is made pliable
for counſel; he is a plowed and a broken man, who ſaith,
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to
doe?</hi> There was no pride in him, but the fulneſſe of the
ſpirit of the anointing above all his fellows and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who ſaid, <hi>not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> And if any
living man ſhould have had his will or a piece of his will,
it was a man whoſe holy will could never crook; and it
was now when ſinleſſe, holy, harmleſſe nature was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the greateſt queſtion that ever Heaven or Angels knew.
But the fulneſſe of the ſpirit bids him quit his will, and ſo
he did. The ſweet paſſive tractableneſſe of the ſpirit of
grace will enjoyn the man to be ranged, bridled and led of
God: there be ſome, whom God can neither lead nor drive:
any inſpiration fals upon him, a moral influence, this I
ſhould and ought to doe; but I ſhall not, I will not doe
it let God doe his beſt; and it is as if a burning cole were
caſt into the ſea or river, will it burn the ſea? will it be
welcomed and received? no, its preſently quenched. An
unbroken Tyrant void of the ſpirit, when he heard that
charge, <hi>Let my people goe; They are my ſervants</hi> (ſaith the
Tyrant) <hi>not thy people.</hi> Exod. 5. 2. <hi>Who is the Lord that I
ſhould obey his voice, and let Iſrael goe?</hi> Let his influences
be lodged with meekneſſe. O wreſtle not againſt warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but yield to them! So are all gracious influences ſweet,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119064:110"/>
delectable and eaſie; is it pain, nay its ſweet and pleaſant for
a field of Roſes, of Vine-trees to receive ſhowers and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
influences from the Sun and Heaven. It was ſweet
for the baptiſed man Chriſt to receive and lodge the Holy
Ghoſt who came down in the form of a Dove on him in all
his influences.</p>
               <p>7.<note place="margin">A publick ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit declares a ſpiritual man.</note> To act much in the ſpirit brings more abundance of
the ſpirit. 1. The more publick the work be, the more is
the man under the ſpirit. Chriſt muſt have been under
mighty flowings of the ſpirit, who for the publick Catholick
duty of redeeming mankind was willing to be ſuſpended
from the influences of his perſonal comfort, and to be under
that ſad cloud of being forſaken of <hi>God</hi> that <hi>God</hi> might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

John 16. 14. <hi>He ſhall glorifie me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> of the ſpirit)
<hi>for he ſhall receive of mine.</hi> Then the more we glorifie God
and Jeſus Chriſt his Son we teſtifie we partake the more of
the flowings of the ſpirit. The Church hath ſo much the

               <p>2, We are alſo with <hi>Magdalen</hi> and other godly perſons
ſo far to be dead to the private comforts of love to Chriſt

ſubmit to the Lord's diſpenſation of his ſoveraign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of influences of comfort, yea and delight in other
inferior duties. What though he will not feaſt me with the

what if he withdraw joyful influences of believing, of

the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>8. A watching condition is a ſpiritual condition. The
Spirit of God is much ſeen in keeping the ſoul watching.
Epheſ. 6. 18. <hi>Praying with all prayer and ſupplication in the

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119064:111"/>
then the privation fences off the habit, or doth ſet a man to
work againſt life. We ſit not watchfully upon the motions
of the ſpirit, to warm them and to draw life out of them,
as the Hen by careful ſitting upon dead Eggs bringeth forth
living birds. Who would think a tree and a huge tree can
come from a ſorry plant? or ſixty or an hundred grains of
wheat in harveſt to be in one ſingle grain caſt in the earth
in ſowing time? Can the fleſh wait for the Lord? is not
hope an act of life? Yea, it's lively hope oppoſite to a dead
and rotten hope: and waking is nearer to life, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of life, then ſleeping, which is the death of the man as
touching the exerciſe of the ſenſitive life: Then ſince the
ſpirit is a ſpirit of life, and a quickning and living ſpirit,
<hi>Rom. 8. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. the more watchfulneſſe in any, the more
of the ſpirit; For when the ſpirit enters in the dry bones,
they become an army of living men, whereas before they
were farther from life and ſpirit then ſleeping bones. <hi>Let
us not ſleep as do others: but let us watch, and be ſober. For they
that ſleep, ſleep in the night,</hi> 2 Theſ. 5. 6, 7. <hi>The night is far
ſpent, let us walk honeſtly, as in the day, not in rioting and
drunkenneſſe, not in chambering and wantonneſſe, nor in
ſtrife and in envying,</hi> Rom. 13. 13. This is like the putting
on of the Lord Jeſus, which is a work of the ſpirit; for ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
men put not on their garments. Miniſters eſpecially
are to watch, yea <hi>to watch in all things:</hi> then in ſleeping
they muſt watch, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. And hardly can fighting, and
enduring hardneſſe, as a good ſouldier of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

Who can ſleep and be ſecure, and reſiſt Satan? or ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

38. cap.</hi> 2. 2, 46. How can ſleeping men receive influences of
grace? doth the Lord caſt influences upon ſleeping mens
boſomes? So are we to act as our acting way be fathered on
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119064:112"/>
the ſpirit; as the Spirit of the Lord came upon <hi>Gideon,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Sampſon,</hi> and they fight, and the Spirit of the Lord upon
<hi>Zechariah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehojadah,</hi> and he prophecied, 2 <hi>Chro.
24. 20. Luke</hi> 1. 64. the father of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was filled with
the Holy Ghoſt and prophecied. <hi>Simeon</hi> came by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
into the Temple. This acting in the ſpirit is oppoſed to
acting in the fleſh, and in the ſpirit of Satan; as <hi>Bullinger</hi> of
one brother who ſlew his brother, and pretended the ſpirit:
and <hi>Pareus</hi> tels us the like. As the Lord the Father and
Son never ſpake to <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> to Patriarks or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
but he made them know it was the Lord; ſo neither
does the ſpirit act in any, though the way ſeem violent, as
in <hi>Phineas</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> their executing of juſtice, but the
Spirit makes it known that it is the Spirit, and that he is not
in the mighty wind, nor in the fire, but in the calm voice. So
<hi>Samuel</hi> leiſurely and adviſedly convinceth <hi>Agag</hi> ere he
kill him, and gives a reaſon to his conſcience from divine
juſtice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 35. 32, 33. though <hi>Samuel</hi> then had laid

<hi>Lord, Lord, open to us.</hi> Which us? to us workers of

Mountains and rocks fall on us, and hide us from the face of

               </argument>
               <p>HAving formerly ſpoken of Influences of grace in
general, we are now to deſcend to more ſpecials:
Hence theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Some influences are from Satan, ſome from God.</p>
               <p>2. The way of Satans influences.</p>
               <p>3. Its lawful to diſpute with Hereticks, inſtruments of
Satan, but not lawful to diſpute with Satan.</p>
               <p>4. Chriſt ſought neither the Tempter nor the temptation.</p>
               <p>5. Some influences are natural, ſome ſupernatural.</p>
               <p>6. Some moral, ſome Phyſical.</p>
               <p>7. Some Prophetical, ſome not.</p>
               <p>8. Some publick on the Church, ſome perſonal.</p>
               <p>9. Some influences are given for the habit of grace or
gifts, ſome for the act, ſome for both.</p>
               <p>10. Some proper to the head Chriſt, ſome for the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>11. Some influences are fundamental, ſome not.</p>
               <p>12. Some influences are given for ſaving graces actings;
ſome for the actings of a gift.</p>
               <p>13. Differences between acting of grace, and acting of
gifts.</p>
               <p>14. Some influences are <hi>viatorum,</hi> of ſuch as are in the
way to their countrey; ſome are <hi>comprehenſorum,</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
ones; ſome of grace, ſome of glory.</p>
               <p>For the fuller opening of the Doctrine of <hi>Influences:</hi>
ſome influences are from Satan, ſome from <hi>God.</hi> Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from <hi>God</hi> are both moral, when he commands good,
and forbids evil; and real and phyſical, in that all move
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119064:114"/>
in him, as the firſt cauſe and mover in operations of nature.
2. of grace. 3. of glory. But Satan being no Maſter
or Lord of providence, hath no real ſtirring in ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
his actings upon angel or mens ſoules are not phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
but only moral or tempting actings, or helliſh inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
inductive to ſin; and it's no ſmall mercy that the
Prince and God of a loſt world, who by permiſſion acteth
really on the air, earth, and waters, yet hath no power of
immediate,<note place="margin">How Satan knows the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the heart.</note> real, or phyſical acting upon minde, will, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and conſcience, he having only a borrowed key, and
at the ſecond hand power to ſuit the heart, by fancy, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and outward objects, 1 <hi>Kings 22. 22. John 13. Acts</hi> 5. 3.
Some one way or other the court-gate of <hi>Achabs</hi> heart, of
<hi>Judas,</hi> of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> lie open to Satans ſcout-watches.
It were ſafer to watch and fear, then to diſpute
how that ſubtle Spirit can blow up the lock and get in; for
he knows not what is in a mans ſpirit. The ſpirit of a man
is under God, the onely keeper of this caſtle, and knows
rooms, doors, and what is within, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. But devils
lying about the out-works, the ſenſes, the fancie, and the
imagination, which is a material houſe, and hath doors,
windows, and entries paſſible to devils; he can here blow
the bellows, and kindle iron works.</p>
               <p>There be two wayes to know the ſecrets that are done in
a cabinet-camber. 1. Satan can ſend in poſts with letters,
and write his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Satan keeps correſpondence with the heart.</note> his wiles to the heart. This is one
way of putting it in the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt, by
ſending his mind and will through the fancie to the heart,
and the fancy being ſet on work by the will and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
can carry the miſſive letter; elſe how could the
Lord rebuke the ſin of actual imaginations? as he doth
<hi>Jer. 9. 4. Jer. 13. 10. Jer. 18. 11, 12. Nah.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>2. The heart can write back an anſwer of the miſſive
letters, and print it on the fancy. We know there is fire
in the houſe by the ſmoke that comes out at the chimney.
A man may ſpeak out at a window to another. Satan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
by the ſerpents tongue, and by <hi>Evahs</hi> eyes, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoughts of a Godhead growing on the tree, and can
ſend in a word of a meſſage to the heart, <hi>All theſe will I
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:119064:114"/>
give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> And thou
ſhalt have thirty pieces of ſilver, if thou wilt deliver up the
Lord to us; and from the ſons of diſobedience he gets a
return; he knew what <hi>Achab</hi> ſhould anſwer to the 400
Prophets, and heard that, <hi>Thou ſhalt goe, and alſo prevail.</hi>
And reaſon would ſay ſince all Satans prevailings have
theſe two; 1. A commiſſion ſought and obtained to tempt
<hi>Job</hi> c. 1. and as particular as if written, as is clear <hi>v.</hi> 12. Or
a ſentence of the great Judge to puniſh ſin, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 20,
21, 22, 23. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. It may appear that the lictor and
executioner, though he know not the heart and the thoughts
of the Judge directly, yet he knows his own written com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and what ſentence he is to execute, and what
miſchief he ſhall doe, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 22. as the executioner
knows whether the ſentence bear heading or hanging.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Ananias</hi> is blamed for Satans lye that he <hi>put in his
heart, Why hath Satan filled thy heart</hi> (it's like there
were a good many ſeeming arguments moved by Satan to
promote the work in <hi>Ananias) to lye to the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
Then though Satans knocking and active tempting be not
our ſin; for our Saviour was tempted by Satan, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin;<note place="margin">It's lawful to diſpute with Satans inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not with Satan.</note> yet he hath ſo acceſs to to the heart, as our yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and being paſſively tempted with any degree of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the tempation, is our ſin.</p>
               <p>3. Neither may we diſpute or racket arguments with Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> We may diſpute with Hereticks, and convince
them, though they be Satans inſtruments, <hi>Tit. 1. 9. Tit.</hi> 3. 10.
and the blind man <hi>John</hi> 9. hold up a diſpute in defence of
Chriſt againſt the Phariſees; therefore we may diſpute with
Satan himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Men, to whoſe ears the Goſpel comes, are to be
gained by the power of the truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25. We are
commanded to confeſs Chriſt before men, not before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
This end is not attainable in the fallen Angels;
therefore Chriſt rebukes Satans confeſſing of him, <hi>Luke</hi>
4. 34, 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Chriſt holds up diſpute with Satan, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are to follow what is ordinary in Chriſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
that is, to reject Satans temptations, not brutiſhly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119064:115"/>
and irrationally (that is not victory over Satan by the
light of faith) but by evidence of Scripture, and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to yield to the temptation, and refuſe in faith.</p>
               <p>2. There is ſomething extraordinary in this, which we
cannot follow; for the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> here as Mediator car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the perſon of all the tempted ones, as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>
did repreſent all his, and gives a proof that he is <hi>Michael,</hi>
ſtronger then the <hi>Dragon;</hi> and that all the tempted ſeed
are by faith to rely on the ſtrength of the tempted Saviour.</p>
               <p>3. Nor did Chriſt hold up or entertain the diſpute with
Satan; he only gave one ſimple anſwer to every temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>It is written.</hi> Nor had the diſpute</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Christ ſought not the tempter nor the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but (in a ſort) a patient in being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted.</note> Its riſe from Chriſt. Chriſt is rather a patient for
our inſtruction, then an agent as touching the riſe of the
temptation; for <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the tempter
came unto him;</hi> then Chriſt fetched neither the tempter,
nor the temptation, or diſpute.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Satan brought him to the holy city,</hi> Matth. 4. 5. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>The Devil
took him unto an exceeding high mountain, and ſhewed him
all the kingdomes of the world.</hi> Then did not the man
Chriſt goe as from himſelf to the pinacle of the Temple,
nor to the exceeding high mountain to fetch and bring on
himſelf the temptation or the diſpute. See <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7, 8.
Yea Divines think he ſubmitted that his holy body ſhould
be ſo far acted upon by Satan. So <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 12. the Spirit
drives him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, caſteth him violently to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart.
<hi>Evah</hi> entertains a dialogue with Satan. 1. Speaks
by way of complaining of God. 2. And doubtingly of the
Lords word of threatning, <hi>Gen. 3. Saul</hi> the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.
ſeeketh after Satan, and makes a journey to him. Some
influences of God are 1.<note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Satans influences, and theſe of the Lord.</note> upon the act, yet ſo as they are
willingly received by us. 2. Though they be terminated
upon the material act under trangreſſion, yet is there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moral warrant nor perſwaſion to the ſinfulneſs from
the Lord, but the contrary. But when the influence is to
gracious acts, there are many ſtrong allurements from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
promiſe, threatning, to move us to cloſe with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119064:115"/>
act, and virtually with the real influence. 3. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
influences are to ſhameful acts, to walking naked.
2. To bloody deluſions, to kill the children to <hi>Molech.</hi>
3. To unwarrantable deluſions, to lay aſide Scripture, and
walk in the dark, attending on unwritten dreams.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Diviſ.</hi> Some influences of God are <hi>ordinis naturalis,</hi>

joynes his concurrence to the things of nature. Some are

camp, that he might ſanctifie the people with his blood,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 12. and if by <hi>his will we are ſanctified through the
offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt under a neceſſity of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſanctifying influences.</note> Heb. 10. 10.
then ſure ſanctifying influences muſt be bought and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
for his choſen people. The doubt is yet anſwered
more fully; what a wiſe man hath deliberately bought,
and with the price of blood, he muſt beſtow that for the
end for which he hath bought it. Then Chriſt muſt beſtow
ſaving influences for ſanctifying his people. We look too
much to what we cannot doe, and too little in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to what Chriſt muſt doe, upon the neceſſity of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of his bargain of redemption that he hath cloſed;
he muſt work in his own to will and to doe until the

                  <note place="margin">Moral and phyſical influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> Some influences are <hi>moral,</hi> ſome <hi>phyſical</hi>

that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be followed, all are to be forgone and
caſt over-board that we may gain him, in regard of theſe.
Chriſt ſtands at the door and knocks, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
refuſe to open to him; as howbeit the word carries
along with it the high and glorious authority of the Law-giver,
the promiſe of a Kingdome, the threatning of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
chains; yet it works but morally, and the robber
in the woods laughs at the paper-lawes, and at the far-off
general juſtice that is in cities, which cannot reach the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119064:116"/>
robbers that are in woods; ſo moral influences from the
word bear in upon the thought afar off a letter-heaven, or
a literal hell, with a ſuſpition of lying unbelief; theſe are
but fables. But when the Lord in real influences lays hands
on the ſinner, the man is then as if he were at the bar; the
robber on whoſe legs and arms the law hath laid bolts and
iron fetters, and is really wrought upon by more then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
influences, as <hi>Saul</hi> for three dayes ſpeaks ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And when the influences phyſical of God are upon
the ſoul of the ſpouſe, then love it ſelf and love-ſickneſs
ſpeak with ſenſe, <hi>His love is better then wine. O he is the
chief among ten thouſand.</hi> Many thouſand profeſſors live
and die under letter-influences, and a paper-New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
they hear, read, know the word, are baptized, and
deceive their own ſoules, and have but ſeen (as <hi>James</hi>
ſaith) <hi>their image in the glaſs, and forget themſelves.</hi> Such
never knew heart-ſickneſs, nor the terrours of God, nor
any real work on the conſcience: then ſeek heart-drawing,
and heart-divinity.</p>
               <p>4.<note place="margin">Ordinary and extraordinary influences.</note> Some influences are <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors;
ſome are <hi>prophetical</hi> and <hi>extraordinary.</hi> Now
as to theſe which are prophetical, it may be a queſtion
whether they be real and phyſical, or only moral. It ſeems
there are two things here, 1. The viſions. 2. The publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them. As to the firſt, <hi>Jeremiah ſees the rod of an
Almond-tree, and a ſeething pot, and the face of it toward
the North. Ezekiel ſees a whirlwind and a cloud out of the
North, and fire infolding it ſelf, and the colour of amber out
of the midſt of the fire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prophetical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences.</note> 
                  <hi>and the likeneſs of four living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and every one of them had four faces, and four wings,</hi>
&amp;c. And <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw <hi>a ram with two horns, one higher, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leſſer, puſhing northward, and weſtward, and ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
&amp;c. It's clear theſe were real viſions, and had real
influences of God carrying them into their mind really,
and they could not ſhun but they were in an extaſie, and
God really made them ſee as to the publiſhing of them,
juſt as they ſaw them. They ſeem to be moral agents, yet ſo
as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> could not ſhun to prophecie; nor could <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
when his eyes were opened, and he falling in a trance,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119064:116"/>
but ſee <hi>the viſions of the Almighty,</hi> and could not goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the word of the Lord, but muſt prophetically bleſs
(and no more thanks and praiſe can be due to them in ſo
doing, then to <hi>Satan</hi> confeſſing Chriſt to be the Sonne of
God, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.) So are many, who are convinced, and
tremble at the word, and when the terrours of God, and
a fever or ague of the preſſing indignation of God takes
them,<note place="margin">It's dangerous to reſiſt ſtrong light and the influences thereof.</note> declare God to be righteous, and themſelves guilty,
are but little praiſe-worthy: For the Law acting in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
conſcience, is another party repreſenting God the
Judge; and when ſuch turn again to their vomit, as there
be many falſe births of this kind, how prodigiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
are ſuch? for they carry about Satans light of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
conſcience, and their own profane hearts: ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
it is to doe violence to light which ſpeaks from God.
<hi>Saul</hi> at the beginning of his reign, and <hi>Demas,</hi> and ſome
others, are helliſh examples of Apoſtacy to cauſe others
fear.</p>
               <p>5. There are ſome perſonal influences upon a ſingle man
that are more private, which are very deſirable: But there
be ſome more publick influences on the Church; ſo the
Lord walks in the midſt of the golden candleſticks,<note place="margin">Private and publick Church influences.</note> and
raines down Miniſterial bleſſings on his Church, holds the
ſtars on his right hand, and waters his Church. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.
2. <hi>A garden of red wine. 3. I the Lord doe keep it: I will
water it every moment, leſt any hurt it, I will keep it night
and day.</hi> Beſide protection that the Lord is the keeper of
the Vineyard, and Chriſt anſwers for the vines, the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
body is like a parcel of ground ſubject to drought and
withering, and Chriſt with ſhowres of influences muſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our withering, and he leading captivity captive, and
aſcending on his coronation-day, ſent down royal gifts,
Apoſtles, Prophets, Paſtors on his body myſtical, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is made viſible by him. The times of ſweet refreſhing
ſhowres, and of the ſinging of the birds under the Meſſiah's
Kingdome, require that we exerciſe our faith in looking
toward theſe promiſes. When the heavens ſeem to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and (as it were) with child of Summer-rain, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
34. 26. <hi>I will make them and the places round my hill a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119064:117"/>
and I will cauſe the ſhowers come down in his ſeaſon,
there ſhall be ſhowres of bleſſings.</hi> It's not rain for graſs or
corn, but of ſpiritual influences upon <hi>Emmanuels</hi> land,
where floods and rivers run milk and wine, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<hi>Iſa. 32. 3. The eyes of them that ſee ſhall not be dim, and
the ears of them that hear ſhall hearken. 4. The heart alſo of
the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledge, and the tongue of the
ſtammerer ſhall be ready to ſpeak plainly.</hi> Then is that true
alſo <hi>Iſa. 35. 1. The deſart ſhall rejoyce and bloſſome as a roſe.
5. The eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the eares of the
deaf ſhall be unſtopped. 6. Then ſhall the lame man leap as
an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſing; for in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
ſhall waters break out, and ſtreams in the deſart. 7.
And the parched ground ſhall become a pool, and the thirſty
land ſprings of waters: in the habitation of dragons where
each lay (ſhall be) graſs with reeds and ruſhes.</hi> And that all
this is a prophecie of ſhowres of influences of grace upon
the holy people under the New Teſtament, is clear <hi>v. 8.
And an high-way ſhall be there, and a way, and it ſhall be
called the way of holineſs, the unclean ſhall not paſs over it, but
it ſhall be for thoſe; the way faring men, though fools, ſhall
not erre (therein.) 9. No lion ſhall be there, nor any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous
beaſt ſhall goe up thereupon, it ſhall not be found there:
but the redeemed ſhall walk there.</hi> Were all the ſtones and
rocks of a a Land turned into gold, it ſhould prove that the
Sun had moſt ſtrong influences on that land. The ſtony
hearts under the New Teſtament are changed into new
hearts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. and a people of hard mettal of iron
and ſtone, transformed into precious ſtones, <hi>Carbuncles, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats,
Saphires;</hi> and that made true, <hi>All thy children ſhall
be taught of God,</hi> Iſa. 55. 11, 12. This doth evince that the
influences of God ſhall be mighty in thoſe who believe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Strong influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Meſſiah in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> even <hi>the exceeding greatneſs of his
power, which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from
the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
Such things ſay that ſuch as live under the Goſpel
would ſay what a change is made in them. The Goſpel
finds you ſtones and iron, and leaves you ſtones and iron;
O but that is ſweet, <hi>Chriſt</hi> found me clay, and now I am
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119064:117"/>
gold, as the man <hi>John 9. 25. One thing I know, that where
I was blind, now I ſee.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13. <hi>Once I was a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
a perſecutor, an injurious perſon, but I obtained mercy.</hi>
Ah it's a hard condition, born an heir of wrath, dying
worſe then an heir of wrath; for ſin original, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of wickedneſs was but a little brook when the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
man was born; but when he dies, it's a mighty river,
and a great ſea. What hath the Goſpel done to you? It's
more then the power of the Sun, it's a ſtrong influence of
God the firſt cauſe, that makes clay gold, and common
earth ſilver, and copper, and braſs. Many cannot tell
where Chriſt found them, and where they are now.</p>
               <p>2. If there be ſuch ſummer-ſhowres of heavenly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
under Chriſt, how is our fleece dry? And many are
rained upon green, and the bones flouriſhing like an herb
and a lilly, and thou art dry. This is not ſeen; prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is exceeding prophane, and is twice, yea ſeven times
prophaneneſs under Goſpel-influences.<note place="margin">Goſpel-influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſtrong.</note> The Goſpel-devil
is fiercer, and more a devil (to ſpeak ſo) then the Indian
devil. O but the Goſpel makes a ſad eik to wickedneſs,
Goſpel-ſwearing, Goſpel-whoring, Goſpel-drunkenneſs, are
worſe then <hi>Sodoms</hi> filthineſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 15. There is an
unperceived vengeance that cleaves to every <hi>Judas;</hi> the
man who is long in Chriſts company; and ſees and heares
what Chriſt does, and what he ſayes, his traitory is twice,
yea ſeven times traitory. Spilt and rotten wine is a worſe
liquor then fountain-water; ſome water is better then
ſome wine.</p>
               <p>3. How bleſſed then is that, this man and this man was
born in Sion! To be born and dwell in a Land where
Chriſt dwells, ſpeaks mercy: To be a plant of a young
Vine where the garden of red wine is, muſt be a mercy;
to be a plot of ground that Chriſt plows; to be a branch
that the Father of Chriſt purges that it may bring forth
more fruit, is an incomparable mercy. You might have been
born in <hi>China,</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> in <hi>Braſilia,</hi> where Satan dwels;
but ye were born in a land of Vine-trees and Olive-trees.
To be born in the Church (though men deſpiſe it) and in
covenant with God, and to be baptized, is to be born in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119064:118"/>
in the borders of heaven; for there is the Goſpel
and the Prince, who both can promiſe and give Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>6.<note place="margin">Some influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are for the habit, ſome for the actings of grace, ſome for both.</note> 
                  <hi>Diviſ.</hi> Some are influences for the habit, others for
the act of grace. Influences for the habit, as <hi>Iſa. 44. 3. I
will pour water on him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry
ground. I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing
upon thy off-ſpring.</hi> A land that raines ſhowres of rain and
milk, and raines down ſhowres of glory and grace, muſt
be the glory of all lands, and it muſt needs be an excellent
and a glorious Sun that ſhines upon that land. 2. There
are influences for heavenly diſpoſitions. Chriſt ſpeaks and
opens the Scriptures to them, and their hearts burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32. Every word of Chriſt caſts in a fiery
coal of love: Every fitting down under the Apple-tree
brings ſweetneſs; he hath influences by which he brings
on love-ſickneſs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 7, 8. Chriſt caſteth in a praying
diſpoſition on <hi>Saul, Behold he prayes,</hi> Acts 8. and caſts in a
mourning diſpoſition on the woman that waſhed his feet
with teares; and a diſpoſition of love, ſhe loved much,
ſo ſhe weeped over Chriſts feet, and kiſſed them, and wiped
them with the hair of her head. He caſt in a hearing diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
in <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 10. A love-ſickneſs after Chriſt in the
Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. a mourning diſpoſition on <hi>Peter,</hi> he weeps
bitterly. 3. There are influences by which Chriſt acts in
us, and the ſpirit acts in us to will and to doe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13.
and the ſpirit groanes and prayes in the Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.
Chriſt by his influences makes ſome one new work or other
what he hath done in you. Are ye a dry Eunuch, and
the heath in the wilderneſs? and are ye the dried up fig-tree,
and withered up by the root, neither leaves nor fruit?
God will blaſt brambles, and caſt them over the hedge,
and deny Sun and rain to them. Some there be on whom
Chriſt never acted as Chriſt; they are in the ſhadow all
their life, and never ſaw nor felt the Sun.</p>

bound and ſold. Then ſaith the man Chriſt, the Spirit of
the Lord hath ſent the ſtrong and fountain-influences of
the abounding anointing on me, and I may ſend the fruits

Now the earth hath no ſuch right by buying, nor any <hi>Jus

turn the earth into iron, and the heavens into braſs;
and ſo may the Lord ſimply and abſolutely deny the fruits
Chriſts anointing, binding up of wounds, and freedome
to the broken-hearted, and to the captives and ſlaves of
ſin, for any deſerving in them; yet as touching the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and engagement of redemption from ſins, and the
dominion, maſterdome, and law impriſonment thereof, the
meek and the captives have a more noble right in the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Chriſt, by way of buying and ſelling, to the healing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences

See alſo how the ſpirit in its fulneſs is given to Chriſt,
<hi>Iſa. 11. 2. The ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt on him, the ſpirit
of wiſedom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel and might,
the ſpirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.</hi> Iſa. 42.
1. <hi>I will put my ſpirit on him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to
the Gentiles.</hi> Theſe be mighty influences on him, to whom
(ſaid <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>) God gave not the ſpirit by meaſure,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 34. 3. There is a right of promiſe to influences,
<hi>Rev. 2. 7, 17, 26. Rev. 3. 12, 20, 21. John 14. 18, 21. John</hi>
15. 1, 2. In Chriſt <hi>promiſſio facit legale jus,</hi> Chriſt, as it
were, oweth me ſhowers of grace; for he promiſed to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
me. This promiſe is a draught of the river of life to
the deadned ſpirit. 4. There is a myſtical dueneſs and
connatural love-right: The head by natures law is a ſort
of debtor for influences of life to the members.</p>
               <p>Here are ſweet grounds for the ſtreams to beg from the

head.</p>
               <p>2. It was fit there ſhould be another higher providence
about the head, then about the members, and ſo more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
and tranſcendent influences extended toward
Chriſt, then toward any of the ſons of men, as that a new

influences in that the clouds are his chariots, and that the
man Chriſt intercedes at the right hand of God, and ſends
influences of life all the world over to his members, rules
all Empires and Kingdomes, the languiſhing and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>3. Theſe muſt be ſtrong influences, that with the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. is given a power to preach the year of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,

yet fallen out? God might otherwiſe have diſpoſed of all,
and we reflect upon his providence, while as we offend at
ſecond cauſes, but be comforted in a new world, and in a
more glorious providence of influences in ruling heaven
and earth, and in carrying the choſen of God to glory, then
if all were ruled to our will.</p>

but a reſerved and eſtranged God to be made our
God by our own earning and law-merit.</p>
               <p>3. The Lord Jeſus was infinite God, and the fountain as
large as now; but he was not our own fountain, nor the
influences and waterings due to in our witherings as

               <p>4. Chriſt is made the new great Lord, Factor, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Agent for his Church, to rule all for their good and
ſalvation; and heaven, and earth, and the world, and
life, and death, and things preſent, and things to come, are
put over in Chriſts hands; the morrow, the next years de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
the believers outgoing in death, are all made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

3. 21. and the watering of my witheredneſs, and the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Now is it not good that there is a wiſe providence
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119064:120"/>
in Chriſt, which fits both their prayers, and does the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

1. he inſinuates that in praiſing of God fleſhly dulneſs may

it's much to get the fountain made clean in our act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 2. We are to take heed that we knock not at the

and humane eloquence, and a civilized and well-skilled
fancy, and a literal mind verſed in the letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when we think that we are praying from the ſpirit of

<hi>Matth. 7. 22, 23, 24. Luke 13. 25. Matth.</hi> 25. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, May not ſound believers alſo blow at the

doe; for if <hi>ye love them that love you, what reward have ye?
and if ye ſalute your brethren only</hi> (not your enemies alſo)
what do ye more then others? So Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. to the

7. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 3. There is a vaſt difference betwixt (<hi>thus ſaith
the Prophet by the Lord</hi>) and (<hi>thus ſaith the man</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where are we when our righteouſneſs does not exceed
the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees? The devils
believe there is one God, and they doe well, <hi>James</hi> 2. 19.
and we fooles ſay in our hearts there is no God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1.
and do we well in ſo ſaying? The devils do tremble when
they believe there is one God: ah, Satan believes in ſad
earneſt when he believes! We ſport, yea doe not we laugh

faith conveyed with godly trembling were good: Ah, that
we know not the influences of God conjoyned with the

                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 4. Hardly can the uſe of a gift aſcend above it
ſelf to intend God and his glory; for the glory of God is
graces end, not gifts end. <hi>Zech. 7. 5. When ye faſted, did ye
at all faſt unto me? 6. And when ye did eat, and when ye
did drink, did ye not eat for your ſelves? and did not ye
drink for your ſelves?</hi> Heb. <hi>did not ye your ſelves eat as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

He meanes the ſpirit of grace in them did not keep theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
faſts and feaſts, but their own ſpirit, and cuſtome,
and ſelf; and did ye faſt for me at all? and he doubles
the word, that ſo he may the more convince them, <hi>even for
me?</hi> So the Lord might ſay to the Phariſees who prayed in
the ſtreets, Did ye at all pray to me, even to me? or did
the gift and vain-glory in you, or the ſpirit in you? So he
may ſay to us, Doe ye preach, hear, ſwear a covenant for
me at all?<note place="margin">Grace ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the gift u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all due and ſpiritual circumſtances, but the gift can never fanctifie grace.</note> Saving grace muſt ſanctifie the gift in its uſe and
end, that it be for God; but a gift can never ſanctifie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grace in its uſe and end. As grace which is above
nature ſanctifies nature, and heightens nature in its actings,
principles, and end; but nature, that is below grace, can

the ſame influences on the true and natural olive, and on
the wild olive; the ſame clouds and rain act upon the
vine-tree and the thorn-tree, upon the roſe, and the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,
and the nettle; and ſo the ſame word comes to the
ears of both elect and reprobate, but not the ſame quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
influences of grace upon both.<note place="margin">The ſame word, but not the ſame influences act upon all within the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi> governes, and
leads the Armies of the Lord by a gift; and <hi>David</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes,
feeds, and leads the Armies of the Lord by the
grace of God, and the ſame word of command layes an
obligation upon both; falſe Apoſtles preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> from a
gift, and labour by a gift, but <hi>Paul</hi> labours not as <hi>Paul,</hi>
but the grace of God in him.<note place="margin">We are not to rest upon the actings from a gift, but watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to try when we act from a gift, and when we act from a grace.</note> The virgins are drawn and
run, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. and <hi>John</hi> is drawn and runneth; but the
ſame lively influences act not upon the one and other: it
is a deluding concluſion, <hi>we have eaten and drunken where
Chriſt was preſent,</hi> and his Saints preſent, therefore the
Lord ſhould open to us; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath preached and his
faithful Prophets in our hearing, in our ſtreets, therefore
ſhould we be admitted into the Bridegroomes chamber,
<hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25. What can then be builded on this? I was at
the Lords Supper, where undoubtedly Chriſt was in his
influences of life; I did ſwear a covenant to God, I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the Goſpel, I heard ordinarily ſuch a Preacher in
whom undeniably the Spirit of God ſpoke, and was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
acquainted with him, and loved him dearly, and
ſhall that man be ſaved, and I thruſt in hell? The great
errour is, men try not their wayes, principles, motives, and
ends.</p>
               <p>Now as touching influences of grace, it is not as when
the ſame hand ſmites upon the ſtring of the harp well tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and on another ſtring of the harp that is miſtuned;
it's the ſame word that ſounds in the ears of theſe in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Church, but not the ſame ſpirit of grace in the ſame
ſaving influences that act upon the heart; yea the ſpirit
leaves the heart of ſome to its own deadneſs, and acts upon
others to bring them to wonder, to be amazed and aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and leaves them there; and acts upon a third ſort, to
leave a ſtrong conviction and a work of humiliation upon
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119064:123"/>
them; but it does no good, it's nothing above a law-work
mixt with ſome letter of the Goſpel; and the Spirit works
in ſome a lively ſound work of ſaving grace; and the ſame
word is the common inſtrument in all. So our Saviours e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration
of four ſorts of hearers takes in all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.
How many wonder, and deſpiſe, and perſecute? <hi>Luke 4.
Mark 7. Mark 9. Matth. 12. John 11. Acts 3. Acts</hi> 4, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Influences of the ſpirit ſaving and lively are called by
the names of the Fathers drawing, of the Bridegroomes
drawing, <hi>John 6. 44. Cant.</hi> 1. 4. the Spirits leading, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
14. the Lords teaching, <hi>Iſa. 54. 13. John</hi> 6. 45. the blowing
and breathing of the wind upon the garden, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16.
the Lords quickening in his way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 37. the Lords
circumciſing of the heart, <hi>Deu.</hi> 30. 6. the Lords opening of
the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. the Lords inſtructing and ſpeaking to
men with a ſtrong hand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 11. the Lords power in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
not inferior to that by which he raiſed his Son from
the dead, and quickens the dead that are in the graves, <hi>Eph.
1. 18, 19, 20. Joh.</hi> 5. 25. But no ſuch ſhowres of influences go
along with a meer gift; which is eminent in many, &amp; exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the ful, to the good of the Church, &amp; yet ſuch builders
of the ark for ſaving of others periſh themſelves in the waters.</p>
               <p>3. If we conſider the Lords intention, this is clear; Did
ever the Lord decree or promiſe to bring any to heaven by
the gift of prophecie, of wiſedome, of learning and arts,
whether the men believe or not? or does the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſo labour the ground for the growing of the bramble,
as for the growing and flouriſhing of the vine-tree, or for
the thiſtle and the briar as for the wheat? What can
Chriſt make out of a preaching <hi>Judas</hi> never given to him of
the Father? nothing, he never believing, but to ſend him
to his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 6. In one and the ſame ſpiritual acting of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and believing the ſpirit and the fleſh may concurre,
not as formal principles, for the fleſh and corrupt nature is
no formal principle of praying in the ſpirit, and of believing;
the holy Ghoſt uſeth no ſuch tooles, but the fleſh concurres
by way of retarding and weakening of the acts of praying;
for it is of the fleſh onely that our praying is not with that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119064:124"/>
deepneſs of humble ſenſe of want, with that ſtrong deſire
with that fervour of believing that becomes.</p>
               <p>So corruption concurs in the worke as the broken thigh
or legge in the halting horſe, as halfe a tooth in eating,
not as a formal principle of motion. Hence the influences
of grace muſt be accommodate to our gracious actings, that
are mixt: he is a meek Spirit, who is willing to ſigh in a
Saint, beſide the body of ſin which caſts in ſomething of
our ſinfull corruption to retard the work.</p>
               <p>2. In the ſame prayer the ſpirit and the fleſh ſpeak at
once or by turnes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 15. prayes in the ſpirit, <hi>O Lord
thou knoweſt me, remember me, and viſit me, and revenge me
of my perſecuters; take me not away in thy long-ſuffering;
know that for thy ſake I have ſuffered rebuke. 16. Thy words
we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e found, and I did eat them: and thy word was unto me
the joy and rejoycing of my heart.</hi> But in the ſame prayer
the ſpirit in his ſuſpended influences, as it were reſting, lies
by, and the fleſh mixes in it ſelf, <hi>v. 18. Why is my pain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,
and my wound incurable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calvin.</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. in Jerem. 15. 18. diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guendum inter ipſam doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam quae pura fuit, &amp; inter ipſos (homines, prophetas) nunc autem dum in ſeipſum deſcendit (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheta) fatetur ſe agitari mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis cogitationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, quae carnis infirmitatem redoleant, nec careant omni vitio.</note> 
                  <hi>which refuſeth to be healed?
wilt thou be altogether to me as a lyar, and as waters that
fail? Calvin</hi> ſaith we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the doctrine,
yea I adde the prayer that is from the ſpirit, and the ſinful
complaint in the prayer from the fleſh. So <hi>Job</hi> complains
ſpiritually, 10. he acknowledgeth and adoreth the power
of God, <hi>which poured him out as milk, and crudled him like
cheeſe, cloathed him with skin and fleſh, and fenced him with
bones and ſinews, and gave him life and favour,</hi> v. 9, 10, 11,
12. Yet the fleſh almoſt caſts all down, and makes him to
loſe his thanks, <hi>v. 18. Wherefore haſt thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>brought
me forth out of the womb? O that I had given up the ghoſt,
and no eye had ſeen me!</hi> Compare <hi>Jobs</hi> ſad complaint with
his triumphing faith, in looking through ſo many hundred
years to his <hi>living Redeemer</hi> and Kinſman, who ſhall <hi>ſtand
the laſt man upon the earth,</hi> v. 25, 26. Then are we taught
to difference betwixt influences from our ſinful fleſh and
his holy Spirit, and to beware of mixing our clay with the
Lords pure fountain actings of his Spirit, and not to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
and vitiate his wine with our rotten water. It look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like the zeal of God in the diſciples to deſire to call for
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119064:124"/>
fire from heaven to burn the <hi>Samaritans</hi> old and young;
it was a cruel end mercileſs thing to refuſe Chriſt and his
diſciples lodging. O but ſaith Chriſt, rebuking them, <hi>Luke
9. 55. Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of.</hi> Pray
that God would rebuke the fleſh while ye pray; and try your
own ſpirit, and take heed to it.</p>
               <p>2. Reſt not on a gift, nor upon the literal ſtirring and
baſtard heat that comes from a gift, or upon literal tears that
often flow from a weakened fancy in prayer. <hi>Eſau</hi> both
runs and was hot in his hunting for the bleſſing, and <hi>ſought
the bleſſing with teares;</hi> but there were here no influences
of the ſpirit of grace. <hi>Eſau,</hi> Heb. 12. was a prophane man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 7. It may be a child of God may be deluded in
a particular, thinking his actings from a gift to be actings
from grace; but</p>
               <p>1. An habitual deluſion, ſuch as was in the five fooliſh
virgins, <hi>all their life, and until the market</hi> of buying oyle
was ſpent and over, cannot fall into a regenerate man;
for the Lord reveals his ſtate to him.</p>
               <p>2. A child of God may all his life not put a diſtinct dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the gift of preaching in <hi>Judas</hi> and the
grace of preaching; for there is no certainty of faith, of
the ſaving grace of others as touching particular men.</p>
               <p>3. There is in the Saints a ſpiritual ſenſe of diſcerning
Chriſts voice; and here two things are to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
               <p>1. The actings of ſenſe.</p>
               <p>2. The objects of ſenſe, and ſpiritual diſcerning the acts
of ſenſe in order to others, are not infallible either in the
habit or the act; the eleven may all their life miſtake <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi>
But as touching the object, the ſaving influences and
actings of God have them in ſome ſingular and peculiar
thing by which <hi>actu primo,</hi> and in themſelves they may be
diſcerned. As Chriſts preaching had ſuch grace in it, never
man ſpake like him. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching in the evidence, and
demonſtration, and power of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that a ſpiritual diſcerning might take up: the garden
flower and the wild flower that grows in the mountains are
like other, yet the ſenſes of ſeeing and ſmelling find a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119064:125"/>
It's dreadful when Chriſts preaching, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
ſpeaking and praying in the holy Ghoſt, brings forth
mocking and perſecution, and the miracles of Chriſt that
were done by the power of God are fathered upon the
Prince of devils; it's hard to perſwade men of the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs
of their own heart. What comes from ſelf, comes
from grace: the heart, becauſe it is the mans own, is good
to God; the prayers are the mans own and good; the
lamps they are our own, and they ſhine, and therefore the
ſhining is from the oyl of grace within, and yet the lamp is
empty.</p>
               <p>2. As to others, hardly ſee we what condition they are
in; and becauſe the ſmell of dead bones comes not through
marble-ſtones in the Tomb, therefore the paintry of a
profeſſion ſatisfies us; yet it was not want of charity that
made <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 2. ſay, <hi>The good man is periſhed out of the
earth, and there is none upright among men; they lie in wait
for blood.</hi> As now it's called moroſity, raſh judgment, to
ſay that the generality of Miniſters, and too many time-covenanters
know little of any work of the Spirit on their
hearts.</p>
               <p>10 <hi>Diviſ.</hi> There are influences <hi>proper to the way to the
Country,</hi> and influences <hi>proper to the end and to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi>
or influences of grace, and influences of glory. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
for the way, though they come from Chriſt our
life, yet for the moſt part they come by ſome meanes, the
word,<note place="margin">Differences betwixt the influences of grace, and theſe of glory.</note> the ſeals, prayer, faith in the promiſes: what influences
they have who never heard the Goſpel, but have the law
of nature within, and book of creation and of providence
without, by which they may read and ſpell a Godhead,
and duties they owe to God Creator, is harder to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:
But they ſhall be witneſſes to judge us, and ſhall
juſtifie <hi>Sodom, Matth.</hi> 10. 15. But did we read more, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
more the covenant of grace, we ſhould have more
of the influences of grace: the influences of glory are the
immediate and eternal out-lettings of God without word,
or faith, or praying. The tree of life hath growing on it
apples of life all the moments of the year; that is, a long
ſummer, and a long year; the tree is ever green, ever bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:119064:125"/>
eternally bearing fruit, and the inhabitants eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
feaſting on the fruit. The river of life runnes for
ever and ever, flowes eternally and never ebbs: they eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
drink in life and joy from him which ſits upon the
Throne, and the Lamb. So many millions of glorified ones
as there are, ſo many eternal and immediate dependencies
and living beames of glory united to the Son of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
becauſe Chriſt is our life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. therefore muſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
be a life of immediate influences of grace in the firſt
glorious conſerving power of God in preſerving bodies of
clay in a being of 1. Incorruption and immortality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
ſickneſs, cold, pain, old age, and death. 2. In a
ſtate of glory, free of ſhame. 3. In a ſtate of bodily ſtrength,
power, and activity free of weakneſs. 4. In a ſtate of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality,
free of a neceſſity of earthly helps, eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſleeping, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43, 44.</p>
               <p>2. It muſt be an immediate out-letting of God in the
fourth life of eternal bleſſedneſs and glory above the life of
nature.</p>
               <p>2. The life intellectual of reaſon.</p>
               <p>3. The life of grace, in the viſion of the face of God,
1 <hi>John 3. 2. Rev. 22. 4. Job</hi> 19. 26. knowing him.</p>
               <p>4. In the influences of fulneſs of joy and delights, or
pleaſures, and that ſo long as Chriſt-God ſhall live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore.</p>
               <p>Now theſe three. 1. Fruition of God, as the laſt end
and ſatisfaction in him onely, ſeeking no other lover but
God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. Loving and adhering to God, there being no room
for faith and hope, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. (whence comes filling of
the concupiſcible part, deſire, delight.)</p>
               <p>3. Praiſing him eternally and the Lamb.</p>
               <p>Theſe three (I ſay) have both the conſideration of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and of a reward; in both conſiderations the Lord lets
out his immediate influences on that bleſſed company in all
theſe. 1. We are ſick of love after our priſon here, rather
then for our choiſeſt life. 2. We ſeek not the earneſt and
firſt fruits of this life.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The nature of the habit of grace; that there is 2. Such
a habit is clear in the word. 3. It's purchaſed by

The ſtronger the habit of grace is, the ſtronger and

               </argument>
               <p>THe third particular is, how the Saints may fetch the
holy breathings of the Spirit by ſupernatural habits:
And touching this we ſhall ſpeak to theſe.</p>
               <p>1. What the habit of grace is.</p>
               <p>2. How it is the ſeed of influences of grace.</p>
               <p>1. What neceſſity there is of the connexion betwixt
the habit of grace; and how we may fetch breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Spirit from the habit of grace.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt: The habit of grace is a fixed diſpoſition
infuſed in the ſoul by the Lord, purchaſed by Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his death, by which we perform ſupernatural du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">The habit of grace is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> A habit is a heavenly diſpoſition or quality gracious,
by which the man even ſleeping is denominated a convert,

13. <hi>Acts 2. 44. Acts 4. 4. 1 John</hi> 3. 14.</p>
               <p>2. It is a fixed quality different from a ſpiritual diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

as a permanent quality; ſo</hi> Iſa. 44. 3. I will pour water on
him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground. <hi>What

<hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. And I will give them one heart; and I
will put a new ſpirit within you; and I will take the ſtony heart

in their hearts. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. A new heart alſo will I give
you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

of fleſh.</p>
               <p>And alſo that this is an inbiding and permanent quality,
infuſed of God, and an habit not acquired by our indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
by which the Saints are, and really are named anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
renewed, born again, new creatures, is clear 2 <hi>Cor.
3. 3. Foraſmuch as ye are manifeſtly declared to be
the Epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by us, written not with ink,
but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of ſtone,
but in the fleſhly tables of the heart.</hi> So this habit is called
the ſeed of God, 1 <hi>John 3. 9. The anointing</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi> 1.
2, and 20.) <hi>which ye have received of him, and abides in you.

               <p>4.<note place="margin">The habit of grace is given through the merit and grace of Chriſt.</note> This new fixed diſpoſition is given through the merit
of Chriſt, <hi>Acts 5. 30. Whom ye ſlew and hanged on a tree,</hi> v.
31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince
and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſins.</hi> Then is Chriſt the giver of repentance, and of
all ſpiritual habits, not ſimply, but as crucified and made
a meriting Prince.</p>
               <p>2. The Father hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:119064:127"/>
in heavenly places in Chriſt; then alſo with the habit of
ſanctification.</p>
               <p>3. We are ſanctified by the the willing offering that

<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10. and the people ſanctified by his blood,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 12. Then in the merit of this blood muſt we have
the habit of ſanctification.</p>
               <p>4. If the conſcience be <hi>purged by the blood of ſprinkling from
dead works, Heb.</hi> 9. 14. then is the heart of ſtone removed,
which is nothing but this deadneſs in us before our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and new birth; and if this be done, ſo that we are
ſprinkled with clean water, cleanſed from all our filthineſſe
and idols, and the heart of ſtone taken out of us, and a new
heart of <hi>fleſh, even a new heart</hi> given us, not for our own
doings, <hi>but for his own names ſake,</hi> Ezek. 36. 22, 25, 26, 32.
that is, from the precious and onely ſaving grace of Jeſus
Chriſt, as it is exponed in the New Teſtament, <hi>Acts 3. 16,
25, 26. Acts 4. 12. Rom. 3. 24, 25. Epheſ. 1. 17. Coloſſ. 1. 13.
Acts</hi> 10. 42, 43. So for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake is exponed in the New
Teſtament for the Son of <hi>Davids</hi> ſake; and for the Lords
names ſake, is all one with this, for the merits and death of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>5. Chriſts blood is a ranſome, not to buy us from wrath
only, and from the evil of puniſhment, but alſo from the
evil of iniquity and ſin, and ſo from the bondage of our
vain converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. from all iniquity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 19.
from living to ſin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and ſo to purchaſe the grace
of the new birth, and to make us Kings and Prieſts to God,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>6. The Spirit poured on the thirſty ground, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 3.
on the houſe of <hi>David, Zech.</hi> 12. 10. is either a gift of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or a grace. The former can be ſaid by none but <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi>
and <hi>Socinians;</hi> for if the only principle of the life
of God, and the new birth, be a work of our induſtry,
Chriſt died in vain; if it be a free grace, we muſt receive
it out of Chriſts fulneſs; <hi>For out of his fulneſs we all receive,</hi>
John 1. 16.<note place="margin">From the habit of grace we perform ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actings.</note>
               </p>
               <p>5. By this ſupernatural habit, we perform ſupernatural
duties, and new acts of life; for <hi>Iſa. 44. By the Spirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:119064:127"/>
they ſhall ſpring up as among the graſs, as</hi> (verſe 4.) <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
by the water courſe.</hi> They ſhall graciouſly profeſſe and
ſwear a covenant to the Lord, <hi>v. 5. One ſhall ſay I am the
Lords, and another ſhall call himſelfe by the name of</hi> Jacob,
<hi>and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and
ſirname himſelf by the name of Iſrael.</hi> And when the Spirit
is poured on the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſecond acts flowing
therefrom are acts of believing, and looking on Chriſt
whom they pierced, and mourning over Chriſt, and being
in bitterneſs, as if his firſt-born were dead. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. the
putting in the new heart hath walking <hi>v.</hi> 27. in the Lords
ſtatutes, keeping his judgments. The firſt young motions
and life-ſtirrings of the circumciſed heart, are the loving
of the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. the returning and obeying the
voice of the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Then 1. ſaving influences in ſpiritual actings, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
praiſing, hearing, are meer deluſions without this new
habit, not the motions and actings of a living man from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of life:<note place="margin">Vital actions flow from ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</note> But ſome cozeners by the art of Satan have
made dead images to ſpeak, but that ſpeaking, or laughing,
or weeping was but counterfeit, and from no kindly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of life in the dead ſtone. The heavy elements move
downward, and that from an inward principle of nature;
but the motion of the wheeles in a horſe-mill is not from
nature within, but from the beaſts that draw the wheels;
nor is the motion of the ſeveral pieces of the horologe from
a principle of life, but from art. And the actings of men
deſtitute of ſuch a ſupernatural habit, ſuppoſe they <hi>give all
their goods to the poor,</hi> and give their bodies to be burnt,
yet are there no influences of the life of Chriſt in theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they come from compoſed art and induſtry of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
cuſtome, formality, and vain-glory, and ſuch leave
their name <hi>in the earth for a curſe.</hi> Be not ſatisfied while
the wind breaths out of the right air, even from a life of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from the head Chriſt. <hi>Chriſt lives in me,</hi> Gal.
2. and the actual influences of grace from above are ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
having Chriſt living in you. Chriſt ſhall furniſh
wind and ſweet breathings of the Spirit to his own life; it's
a curſed caſe of conſcience, when the man hath peace and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119064:128"/>
ſo much quietneſs as to be ſatisfied with, and to thank God
for his formal faſting, and paying of his debts to all,
<hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. and ſuch counterfeit influences pleaſe him all
his life.</p>
               <p>2. How doe they undervalue Chriſt and his blood, who
father all influences of praying and ſeeking of God upon
their own induſtry and nature; in this the mouth may
kiſſe the hand, we kiſſe not the Son. It ſpeaks grace when
every ſincere ſigh, and every good word and thought is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the price and ranſome of blood; when the ſoule
is at this, <hi>O I would kiſs Jeſus Chriſt for this looſing and
melting of heart; and I am the endeared debtor of Jeſus
Chriſt for this lively breathing upon the heart.</hi> This keeps
from murmuring and fretting at other times when the man
weeps over his deadneſs; ah, it's (ſaith the complainer)
long ſince I ſaw him.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">The differences of the habit of grace from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther habits.</note> The differences betwixt the habit of grace and other
habits of arts and ſciences would be conſidered,</p>
               <p>1. In the riſe; induſtry and free-wills trading may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
the habits of ſciences and arts; this is infuſed from
heaven. <hi>I will pour water on the thirſty ground, ſaith the
Lord, for mine own ſake do I this,</hi> Iſa. 44. Ezek. 36. 32. This
habit is indeed Chriſts trading, and the fruit of the travel
of his ſoul, and ſtands Chriſt at a high price.</p>
               <p>2. Other habits may be forgotten and loſt; this is a part
of the believers ſtock, of Chriſts buying, and ſo in Chriſts
keeping. Chriſt keeps his own purchaſe from waſting in
ſhipwrack: <hi>It's the immortal ſeed, the well that ſprings up to
life eternal,</hi> John 4. 14. the <hi>remaining anointing,</hi> 1 John 2.
20. the <hi>imbiding ſeed of God,</hi> 1 John. 3. 9.</p>
               <p>3. The leſſe excellent the habit is, the more it is under
the dominion of free-wil: the Muſician may ſing when he
will, he needs no influences of grace to ſtir up his habit;
the natural man from himſelf may blow upon the natural
habits of arts and ſciences, and the remanents of the image
of God, and he may do much from common honeſty; but
the more excellent and ſpiritual the infuſed habit is, the
further it is from being under the dominion of free-will;
only the North and South-wind of the Spirit can act upon
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119064:128"/>
this habit ſupernatural: nor can we pray ſimply at the nod
and ſtirring of free-will, only the Spirit of Jeſus is ſteereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
here; and this is to be holden, that the Spirit ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes,
as we are guilty conſenters to his withdrawing, and
in the ſinful omiſſion of calling upon the Lord; and when
the Spirit acts upon the free-will, and the habit of grace,
we are willing conſenters to that bleſſed breathing, and
willing joyners in the work of praying; and ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
and praiſe the holy Ghoſt gives to his Saints in
all holy actings, <hi>Num. 14. 24. Gen. 22. 16. Gen. 32. 28. Num.
12. 7. Rev. 2. 3, 13, 19. Rev.</hi> 2. 4, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>So we are 1.<note place="margin">We are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low holy reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions with prayer. 2. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trembling, and 3. Faith. The falſhood of vowes.</note> not to engage in the ſtrength of free-will;
and let us know thus much, that when reſolutions of rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the grace of Chriſt are taking, and we ſay this
we ſhall do by the grace of Chriſt, we but uſe the name of
grace; but there is within 1. A fixedneſs of relying on
nature, and we follow not our reſolution with prayer, as
<hi>David, Pſal. 119. 106. I have ſworn and will perform, that
I will keep thy righteous judgments.</hi> He ſeconds his vow with
prayer, <hi>v. 108. Accept, I beſeech thee, the free-will offering
of my mouth, O Lord; and teach me thy judgments.</hi> In
praying for any mercy, as for grace to keep the way of
God, which we have vowed to keep, we are to interpoſe
Chriſt as Surety for the performing of the vow.</p>
               <p>2. There is not godly fear and trembling in diſtruſting
our ſelves. <hi>David,</hi> after the Lord makes a covenant with
him, and <hi>David</hi> by the Lords grace had accepted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to ſtand to it, he caſts himſelf down to the duſt, 2
<hi>Sam. 7. 18. Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my houſe
that thou hast brought me hitherto?</hi> If we did but conſider
how cozening and unſtable as water our hearts are, we
ſhould fear our own bentneſs to backſliding when we ſo
vow. It ſpeaks honeſt ingenuity after a man hath borrowed
money, and given word and writ to pay it, when he is
anxious how to anſwer the day, and be acquit of the
debt.</p>
               <p>3. Faith ſhould rely upon the promiſe of God for influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of grace, and look away from nature, and ceaſe from
the breathings of free-will, eſpecially ſince they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:119064:129"/>
in the promiſes of perſeverance, and in the promiſes
of the covenant, <hi>Iſa. 54. 10. Iſa. 59. 21. Jer. 31. 35. Ezek.</hi>
36. 27. For among men he who engageth for a good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,
doth alſo engage to labour, to harrow and ſow. He
that covenants to bring home to a Prince a ſhips loading of
gold from <hi>India,</hi> he muſt alſo engage to prepare a ſhip, and
ſea-men, and proviſion for them, and to ſet out to the Sea
for ſailing, and to take the opportunity of the winds. Now
ſince the Lord hath promiſed to bring many children to
glory, this puts on Chriſt a ſort of engagement, eſpecially
if we add to this the truſt that the Father hath put on him,
<hi>John 17. 2. chap.</hi> 6. 37. to work in them to will and to doe,
and when they fall, to raiſe them again: and as faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
upon the promiſe of glory, ſo is faith to rely upon
Chriſt for grace and influences, and new breathings of the
Spirit, without which, perſeverance promiſed, even unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
attaining to glory, is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>3. The ſtronger and the more intenſe the habit is, the
more connatural and kindly, and the more ſignal, bended,
and ſtrong are the acts that flow from the habit.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">A ſtrong habit of grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces eaſy, and connatural, and ſtrong acts of grace.</note> Rain and ſweet ſhowres poured upon the dry ground,
make the growing the more eaſie and connatural; and
when a ſtrong habit of the love of Chriſt, ſtronger then
death and the grave, which many waters cannot quench,
was fixed and rooted in the heart of the Martyrs, the acts
of ſuffering, even the torments of the rack, of burning
quick, of the teeth of wild beaſts, of exquiſite and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enduring
tortures, were exceeding both eaſie, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and refreſhing to themſelves and others, and they had
anſwerable ſtrong acts of influences, and a mighty preſence
of God; as the three children have the fourth man, the
Son of man walking in the fiery oven with them, <hi>Daniel</hi>
hath the increated Angel to ſtop the mouths of the lyons;
and there muſt have been ſtrong influences of grace, when
they refuſed deliverance, and believed a better reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. 2. When there is a ſtrong habit of love, and
of ſoul-love to Chriſt, there are ſtrong and painful acts of
diligent ſeeking, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>There be three acts of ſeeking and not finding. 1. In the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119064:129"/>
bed. 2. About the ſtreets, and the broad way. 3. At the
watchmen; and yet no giving over until ſhe find him
whom her ſoul loves, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. The habit of love,
even going on to love-ſickneſſe, produces ſtrong praying,
fervent adjuring of the daughters of Jeruſalem to tel Chriſt
that ſhe is ſick of love for him, and a moſt pathetick ſong
of praiſing of Chriſt in all his excellencies, <hi>Cant. 5. 10. My
beloved is white and ruddy, and the chief among ten thouſand.</hi>
v. 11. <hi>His head is as the moſt gold, his locks are buſhy and
black as a raven. 12. His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of water,</hi> &amp;c. And there muſt be ſtrong love within,
when ſuch high expreſſions came out, <hi>Pſal. 42. 1. As the Hart
panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee,
O God.</hi> v. 2. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God.</hi>
Pſal. 84. 2. <hi>My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts
of the Lord: my heart and my fleſh cryeth (ſhouteth aloud)
out for the living God.</hi> Now anſwerable to theſe muſt be
the actual breathings of God, ſtrong impreſſions, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the ſoul be like the thirſty ground, like the chaſed hart,
dying, ſwooning, and fainting, and in a fever of love-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for Chriſt: all which argue there muſt be valid and
mighty influences upon the ſoul. Ah, little of the love of
Chriſt is a feaſt that ſoon fills and ſatisfies us. Dry, faint,
and dead acts of praying and ſeeking, ſpeak weak influences
and coldneſs of indifferency, whether we have Chriſt or
want him.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A ſupernatural habit is a ſeed of influences. 2. We
are to improve the habit of grace. 3. The habit of
grace in order to the three perſons brings a neceſſitie
of gracious influences. 4. The Lord is under divers
neceſſities to confer influences. 5. Chriſt intercedes
for the non-converted. 6. Chriſts Office. 7. The
Spirits office, put both under a neceſſity of conferring
of influences. 8. Divers uſes reſult from the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that the Lord hath brought himſelf under to confer
influences. 9. How the habit of grace is acted upon,
how it ceaſeth not.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS to natural powers, the God of nature hath prepared
influences to ſeeds and plants apt to grow. There
are prepared of God alſo influences for their actual grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
So to the Sun, fire, clouds, he hath in readineſſe ſuch
influences, though he freely let them out; ſo to ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
powers and habits he muſt let out and prepare ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
influences.</p>
               <p>The habit of grace is a ſort of new nature, a heavenly
power, a kind of ſeed of ſpiritual actings, and a weight
that inclines the ſoul to acting, and by a ſort of a pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refreſhing diſpoſition ſwayes and drawes habitually the
man to ſupernatural acting. In nature ſuitable influences are
due to the powers;<note place="margin">Actions ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and influences ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, are ſome way due to the habit of grace.</note> as the habit of muſick inclines the man
to ſinging, and a natural inſtinct draws the bird to build
its neſt; and the Lord hath ordained ſuitable influences
for this inſtinct: ſo this habit of grace as a weight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
the ſoul to act, not by any neceſſity of exerciſe, but
by neceſſity of ſpecification; it inclines not by determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the act, but only habitually. Therefore influences
ſuitable to this habit muſt be ſome way due; as in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo alſo in grace. A habit of grace in the renewed
man, does not determine him continually to pray, believe,
praiſe God, while the habit is in him. Hence</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:119064:130"/>
1. Becauſe corruption is in <hi>David,</hi> though as a broken
and ſubdued habit, he ſins in numbring the people, he is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
carried to be avenged on <hi>Nabal,</hi> he commits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
and murther, which doe weaken the habit of
grace.</p>
               <p>2. If the habit of grace be ſtrong, and much of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God in <hi>Steven,</hi> in <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> they act in
the way of God accordingly.</p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">Sometimes the habit of grace is qualified with heavenly diſpoſitions.</note> If the habit of grace be qualified with a ſuper-added
diſpoſition, heavenly and ſpiritual, there are boylings and
ſtirrings in the heart; as in <hi>Paul</hi> to pray, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. after the
ſpirit in him hath been graciouſly and heavenly exhorting
the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he kneels down and prayes; and
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 16. while he is waiting for <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> there
is upon his mind a <hi>burning fever, when he ſaw the city wholly
given to idolatry.</hi> And there will be ſome ſweet akings and
gnawings of the heart preſſing the man to pray, praiſe, and
ſing, <hi>Pſal. 57. 7. My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed,
I will ſing and give praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. What are we to doe in ſuch a caſe then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are to purſue theſe warmings and flamings of

command of God for praying continually, ſmite the iron

3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>2. The graciouſneſs of the Lords holy nature revealed,
<hi>Exod. 34. 6. The Lord God merciful and gracious, long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and abundant in goodneſs and truth</hi> to fallen man (for
he hath revealed no pardoning grace and mercy to fallen
Angels; nor is that the ſcope of <hi>Moſes, Exo.</hi> 34. or of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
any where.) Now if ſo, he as the Lord is under ſome
neceſſity (upon ſuppoſal that he created men and Angels)
to declare his pure immixed juſtice in the fallen Angels;
ſo by ſome neceſſity of decency ſuitable to his goodneſſe
and holy nature he muſt chooſe ſome to glory, and give
them inherent habits of grace, that he may carry them to
heaven in a way of voluntary obedience: ſo that upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
he hath ſo declared himſelf to Angels and men, there
muſt be glorious emanations and out-goings of free grace,
both to ordain ſome to glory, and beautifie them with the
habit of faith to believe in him that juſtifies the ſinner, and
habits of ſanctification. I ſay, upon ſuppoſal he ſo reveal
himſelf in his word; otherwiſe, abſolutely and ſimply the
the contrary order, that he had placed fallen Angels in
mans room, and men in the place of fallen Angels, had been
as juſt and good as that which now is.</p>
               <p>3. The holy Lord gives ſome to Chriſt: and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
them with grace to come, and giving to them of his
free grace the habit of faith, it's an engaging of the holy
Lord to give influences ſuitable to the habit: upon the very
account that the Lord make over a man to Chriſt, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:119064:132"/>
his own image in him, he intends to make him an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
veſſel in his houſe, and to adorn the man ſo gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Chriſt; as when the Lord builds a houſe, he minds
that ſome ſhall dwell in it.</p>
               <p>And 2. the great deſigne of free grace in Chriſt muſt
in theſe two bring him under a holy neceſſity to bring his

he hath an actual right to them, <hi>I have paid a ranſome for
them,</hi> them alſo I muſt bring in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Chriſt
is under a neceſſity of driving them in, then is Chriſt under
a neceſſity of a decree common to him with the Father and
the Spirit, to breath upon and cheriſh the habit of grace,
that his great deſigne of free grace in the work of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
may ſtand ſure, and attain its graciouſly deſigned
end; as alſo he is</p>
               <p>2. Under an official and mediatory neceſſity to the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
to beſtow on them the freely given habit of grace; and
ſo I judge,<note place="margin">Chriſt advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, to bring them in to himſelf.</note> with reverence of the judgment of others, that
Chriſt hath an advocation and office of interceſſion for the
elect, even ſuch as are not yet actually converted: not that
he extends the ſame acts of advocation to the choſen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and to the choſen not yet converted.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe Chriſt as Mediator and high Prieſt prayes for
them, and ſo that habits of grace and influences may be
beſtowed on them, <hi>John 17. 20. Neither pray I for theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their
word.</hi> Nor can it be ſaid that Chriſt intends not they
ſhould reap any mediatory fruit of his prayer, till they be
born and actually believe; for he prayes and intercedes
for their converſion and faith, they yet being in nature
and unrenewed; for that is true in ſome ſenſe, Chriſt prays
for their faith actual, when it is in being, and ſhall actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be aſſaulted, that it may not fail them under temptation;
and ſo that prayer of Chriſt for the diſciples and <hi>Peter,</hi>
ſtands good for all believers, when they ſhall actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and be winnowed, as <hi>Peter</hi> was: the millions of them
neither did believe nor were born, when Chriſt as an high
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119064:133"/>
Prieſt offered to the father both the one &amp; the other prayer;
but that Chriſt in no ſenſe intercedes for the choſen till they
be converted and actually believe, cannot be defended. For</p>
               <p>2. Whatſoever Chriſt hath purchaſed by the merit of
his death, as our high Prieſt, offering himſelf on the croſs
for the elect, that ſame Chriſt as our high Prieſt in heaven
applyes them as Interceſſor. This propoſition muſt be ſure;
for what Chriſt purchaſeth and buyeth by the merit of his
death on the croſs, that he actually makes good as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
in heaven. It's true he is ſaid to buy and redeem
perſons, not things, or graces, as faith and the habit of
grace, he purchaſeth an inheritance and a redemption to
us, and we have repentance and remiſſion of ſins in and
through his blood; for, in his blood, by an Hebraiſm, is,
<hi>for his blood;</hi> and yet remiſſion of ſins is not properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
or ranſomed, never being captivated; but in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
that remiſſion could not be ours but by ſatisfaction.
But ſo it is, that Chriſt purchaſed by the merit of his death,
as our high Prieſt, offering himſelf for the elect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that we ſhould be freed from all iniquity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. from
our vain converſation of unbelief, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. that we
ſhould have repentance, remiſſion of our ſins in his blood,
and faith, the free gift of God in Chriſt even when we were
not yet born. <hi>And he died for us while we were yet ſinners,
weak and ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5. 6. <hi>And God commends his love to
us that Chriſt died for us</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>while we were yet ſinners; for if when we were enemies,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>we were reconciled to God
by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall
be ſaved by his life.</hi> If Chriſt as high Prieſt offer himſelf a
ſacrifice for us, to obtain reconciliation to us, when we
were not born, and when we were ungodly and enemie, she
muſt intercede, that ſuch a purchaſed reconciliation and
merited grace, the grace of faith, and the habit of faith, be
in his due time beſtowed on us.</p>
               <p>3. If Chriſt as our high Prieſt have received the elect
from the Father, <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them to
me;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. 6, 9, 10.</note> and as Redeemer entruſted to bring them in, he muſt
ſend the Goſpel to them as Mediator, and intercede, that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119064:133"/>
Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers may be gifted with
the Spirit, and ſent to preach; for the giving of the Spirit
that way is a fruit of Chriſts aſcenſion and kingly triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
while as <hi>he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men,</hi>
as Interceſſor, <hi>for perfecting of the Saints, and the work of
the Miniſtery,</hi> Eph. 4. 11, 12, 13. that the Gentiles who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, and the blind, may ſee and be converted, <hi>Acts
26. 17, 18. Acts 13. 46, 47, 48. 1 Cor. 3. 5. Matth. 4. 15, 16.
John</hi> 10. 16.</p>
               <p>4. Chriſt, who had reared up a new form of providence,
having choſen his own to life, muſt, as Mediator, take care
of the coming of the elect into the world, and have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
eye over the wayes of his own choſen, that <hi>Saul</hi> and
others fall not into that unpardonable ſin againſt the holy
Ghoſt, and that <hi>Saul</hi> before his converſion goe not farther
on then making havock of the Church, yet <hi>ignorantly
through unbelief;</hi> and this is the more to be laid hold on,
that the man Chriſts coming into the world, is, and goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with his own decree of electing ſome to glory, and to
the great work of ſaving loſt ſinners, <hi>Luke 19. 10. Matth.
20. 28. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. of bearing a rare and ſingular teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to the Goſpel beyond all Martyrs that ever lived, <hi>John</hi>
18. 37. as is clear in the birth and deliverance of <hi>Moſes,
Exod. 2. Exod.</hi> 3. And alſo Chriſt in his providence of
predeſtination to life, as Lord Mediator cauſeth the choſen
to be born and live, when the Goſpel is preached, and
comes to their ears, and works powerfully on their hearts,
<hi>Acts 16. 9, 10. Acts 8. 7, 8. Acts 19. Acts 9. 11, 12, 13, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. In another conſideration there is an official love of
Chriſt, founded upon the identity of nature which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Chriſt and choſen ones, and the man Chriſt loving
his neighbour as himſelf; and the humanity and natural
compaſſion in Chriſt is not deſtroyed, but perfected by his
ſtate of glory; he remains a feeling, compaſſionate high Prieſt,
<hi>Heb. 4. 14, 15. Luke</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. And alſo this puts Chriſt to
ſtretch his love to the unconverted that are his fleſh, and
given to him, that he muſt beſtow habits of grace on them,
and gather the ſheep with his arm, and drive gently thoſe
that are with young, and give new influences to fainting

knocks and ſpeaks heaven into the Church, <hi>Open to me, my
ſiſter, my love, my dove, &amp;c. Cant.</hi> 5. 2. yet ſhe opens not;
the habit being under the aſhes, yea, being a little frozen
and blunted, the ſpouſe ſhifts his preſence; <hi>I have put off
my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how
ſhall I defile them?</hi> And the habit of grace doth not hinder
<hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> but upon the Lords withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of actual influences they may fall into atrocious and
hainous ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 4. Yet in ſome ſenſe the habit of grace reſts not.
For 1. The habit of grace according to the degrees makes
the man ſtronger: as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> by the indwelling of
the holy Ghoſt in ſome fulneſs is ſtronger againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of perſecutors; and ſo is <hi>Steven</hi> fuller of the holy
Ghoſt, then men not converted. 2. The habit of grace
debilitates, weakens the acts of ſin in the regenerate, that
they ſin not with full benſil of will; as the indwelling body
of ſin again weakens the acts of faith, and others the like
flowing from the habit of grace; the combat betwixt the
fleſh and the ſpirit proves both the one and the other,<note place="margin">How many acts we may bring out of the habit of grace.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi>
7. 14, 15, 16, &amp;c. for this combat is ever in the regenerate.
3. The habit of grace of it ſelf as a weight diſpoſes the
renewed man to reſiſt ſin; as a ſtone though violently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the air, <hi>actu primo,</hi> habitually of it ſelf, inclines
the ſtone to move downward to its natural place; whence
come ſome far-off tendency and habitual bowings of
the heart to the love of Chriſt, as warmneſs of heart,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32. ſtirring of bowels at the inward motions
of Chriſt on the ſoul, even when he is kept out, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>5. The covered and borne down habit of grace may and
doth break out into praying after him when he is away,
and moſt anxiouſly and carefully ſeeks him, <hi>Cant. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.
John</hi> 20. 13.</p>
               <p>6. There is no ſuch ſleeping but the heart is waking, and
breaks out in theſe acts firſt, and miſſes him; he knocks,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119064:136"/>
and ſays, Open; then ſhe knew he was without. <hi>They have
taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid
him,</hi> John 20. <hi>I ſought him, but I found him not,</hi> Cant. 3. 2.
there is a diſcerning that it was his knock and breathing.
And 2. his voice, <hi>My heart waked at the voice of my Beloved.</hi>
3. She knew his very words, and repeats them, <hi>Open to me,
my ſiſter, my love, my dove, &amp;c.</hi> though then ſleeping. 4.
There is a ſpiritual wiſhing; O! if I could open and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the temptation of carnal drowſineſs; this appears
in the Spouſes confeſſion of the excuſe, he knocked and
ſpake lovely, and I refuſed rudely to open; <hi>I have caſt off
my coat,</hi> this is told by her by way of confeſſion of ſin; <hi>I have
put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on;</hi> for there may from the
habit of grace ariſe an habitual and a conditional deſire
that the temptation had never aſſaulted,<note place="margin">There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the temptation, which is a wiſhing that our luſt and Gods Law might both ſtand, and a virtual wiſhing that the Law of God had never had being.</note> and yet there is
an abſolute conſent to the temptation, and a wiſh that this
ſinful pleaſure were not aſtray to the Law; which is in
effect a labouring to reconcile my carnal luſt and the
Lord's holy Law, and it is as if I ſhould ſay, Ah, if I might
enjoy my lawleſs pleaſure, and yet the Lord not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed:
ſome ſick mans luſts after contradictions that
in his fever he might drink wine, and yet be free of a
further pain of fever; but all this is but a virtual fretting
againſt God that ever he made ſuch a Law. <hi>Evah</hi> deſired
that the falſly ſuppoſed Godhead which <hi>Satan</hi> ſaid ſhould
be the reward of eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge,
ſhould have been really and truly in eating that fruit, and
that was a clear fretting againſt the wiſedom of God, who
made ſuch a law as laies bands upon men, and forbids
them to eat of all fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 2, 3. yet would difference be
made betwixt the carnal mans wiſh,<note place="margin">Eight evidences that in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate the ſaving habit of grace never ceaſeth from omitting ſome influences.</note> that he might enjoy
his ſweet luſts, and not feel the ſmart of the evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the ſpiritual mans woulding not to do the
evil that he hates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15, 16. and yet he does it, and
ſo virtually deſires there were nothing offenſive and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to God in it. 4. From this habit it is that the
Spouſe ſends commendation to abſent Chriſt (to ſpeak ſo)
and deſires the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to tell him that <hi>ſhe
is ſick of love</hi> for him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 8. 5. There are checks and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119064:136"/>
ſoul-ſorrow at the thoughts of the words he once ſpake,
<hi>Cant. 5. 6. my ſoul failed when he ſpake;</hi> hence there are
godly reluctancies and ſpiritual propenſions of the ſpirit
and renewed man entering diſſent and proteſtations on
the contrary. <hi>Rom. 7. 15. For that which I do I allow not;
for what I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that I do.</hi>
Hence the ſpirits ſpiritual counter-workings contrary to
the fleſh, and the gracious pleadings in favours of Chriſt,
What do you? is not this againſt free love? Ah, will you
grieve ſuch a beloved? hence the inward prickings and
cuttings of the heart, like the wane-reſt of the Horologue,
ever ſtirring and checking the conſcience; if experience
ſay nothing of this thorn in the ſoul, and of the weakneſs
of the bones, little is known of the work of the ſpirit.
6. There is ever an holy apology and clearing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
part, that the ſpirit doth his part. <hi>Rom. 7. 22. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the Law of God after the inward man. v.</hi> 9. The
renewed man would do good; <hi>v.</hi> 16. conſents to the Law,
that it is good, and laies the blame upon the fleſhly will
and ſin dwelling in the man; <hi>v. 17. now its no more I that
do it, but ſin dwelling in me.</hi> 7. From this habit it is that
the renewed man is a captive, a ſufferer, a complainer,
<hi>Rom. 7. 23, 24. O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi> 8. The
ſpirit is contrary to the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and when fire and
water yoake in the cloud there is thunder, and nature
ſuffers pain; and there are actions and paſſions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
on both ſides, and finally the habit of grace ſo far
never reſts, as the fleſh cannot get ſin perfected without a
battle, and ſome thunder in the ſoul. Hence we ſee, did
we improve the habit of grace, how many ſpiritual actions
we may ſet about, and what wind and breathings we
might fetch if we ſhould<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſetting out to ſea, and laying all the ſails open in their

we lay not open our affections in their length and bredth,
in the uſe of all the ordinances before the Lord; <hi>Open thy
mouth wide and I will fill it, Pſal.</hi> 81. nor do we improve the
ſtock of habitual grace; the not improving of the ſtock in
trading brings on poverty.</p>

and above the habit inabling us to act graciouſly, and to

of gracious diſpoſitions, for there are wicked and ſinful
diſpoſitions added to the habit of ſin original.</p>
               <p>2. Gracious diſpoſitions are moveable qualities, this
differenceth the diſpoſition from the habit of grace; and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119064:137"/>
therefore know wherein ſpiritual diſpoſitions and ſpiritual
habits agree; and 2. wherein they differ. 1. Both are
above nature, for we being born in ſin, mind, conſcience,
will, and affections, being polluted and corrupt in ſuch
heirs of wrath; no man is born with habits of grace, or
gracious diſpoſition. 2. Through the want of both, all
are alike unfit by nature to be the work-houſe of the holy
Ghoſt. 3. Both the habit of grace, as it is proved Book 2.
and much more gracious diſpenſations are the purchaſe of
the merit of Chriſt. 4. Both are the ſupernatural gifts of
God infuſed from above, and neither of them acquired
or purchaſed by natural actings: it's clear of the habit
of grace. <hi>John 14. 16. I will pray the Father, and he ſhall
ſend you the Comforter.</hi> Chriſt ſends him, the Father ſends
him in Chriſts name. <hi>John 14. 26. he ſhall receive of mine and
ſhew it to you.</hi> Now the holy Spirit, the Comforter dwells
in the Children of God not perſonally, though he be ſaid
to dwell in them, and to ſpeak in them. 1. In the habit
and divine power, given to them to confeſs Chriſt before
men, <hi>Matth. 10. 19. Acts</hi> 4. 8. or in preaching, working of
miracles, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 8. or in praying, <hi>Acts 6. 10, 11. Acts</hi> 7.
55, 56. 2. In actuating that power, in giving grace actually

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 55, 56. as the Lord is ſaid
to thunder in the clouds, to give rain, not that he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
united with the clouds, but becauſe he creats in
the clouds the power of thunder and raining, and doth
actually determine the clouds to rain. 5. Supernatural
habits and ſupernatural diſpoſitions are neer to other, as
the fire and the flaming of the fire, the clouds and the
rain, the ſea, and the ebbing and flowing of the ſea; not
that the diſpoſition is the very operation and ſecond act of
the habit, but becauſe the dipoſition is a quality ſuperadded
to the habit, or the neerer principle and power of ſpiritual
acting. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were full of the

               <p>3. There is much nearneſs of heavenly habits, diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

as praying, praiſing, confeſſing, believing, rejoycing
in God, in ſuch unhandy tools? What holy trembling is
required in us, that we offend not ſuch an honourable and

               </p>
               <p>3. To ſay that ſpiritual diſpoſitions are as permanent
and conſtant as habits, is to deny the going and coming of
the Spirit in Chriſts love-viſits. Now certain it is the

there ſuch a flaming of love diſpoſitions, as when the Spouſe
ſaith <hi>Cant. 1. 5. A bundle of myrrhe is my beloved to me, he
ſhall lodge all the night between my breaſts.</hi> When a ſleepy
drowſineſs is on, that ſhe ſuffers the welbeloved to knock,

yea poſitively gives a reaſon that ſhe cannot lodge him in
the houſe, nor between her breaſts, <hi>I have put off my coat,
how ſhall I put it on?</hi> Such a ſpiritual love-ſickneſſe is far
off.</p>
               <p>4. When a contrary diſpoſition to adultery is on, and

of life is upon <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo that he denieth his Lord, there
could not be an heavenly diſpoſition to make ſpiritual
ſongs, to pray, to praiſe, to confeſs Chriſt before men, on
either the one or the other.</p>
               <p>5. If thoſe heavenly diſpoſition were ever in it, it ſhould
ſpeak much againſt the liberty of the bleſſed Spirit, whoſe
breathings and out-lettings are ſoveraignly free. Now by
this the work of grace ſhould be like the work of nature:
we ſee the fountain alwayes caſts out her ſtreames, the Sun
ever gives light; the work grace hath a day and a dark
night, and Sun-light and Moon-light; that we are in a
ſtate of outlawry when he withdraws, to be humbled to the
duſt for abuſed love-viſits, and may know what is Chriſts,
and what is ours; the fire is ever alike diſpoſed to caſt heat; a

great concernment to ſee with what diſpoſitions the heart is
ſeaſoned, and who they be that lodge here: as heat and
cold come in the water by turnes, as the ſummer is hot,
and the winter cold, ſo the ſoule even of the child of God
hath ebbings and flowings of dead and lively diſpoſitions;
as the frequent triumphing and rejoycing, and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and much repeated complaints of the Saints doe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
evidence, <hi>Pſal. 22. Pſal. 31. Pſal. 77. Pſal. 89. Lam.
3. Jer.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>There is a ſinful diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>2. The children of God may act ſpiritually under ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>3. What acts they then put forth.</p>
               <p>4. The obedience performed under greateſt indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
upon the ſole motive of the word, is the moſt ſpiritual
obedience.</p>
               <p>5. Sometimes the leſſe ſenſe, the more ſpiritual is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               <p>That there be ſinful and gracious diſpoſitions in men
can hardly be denied</p>
               <p>1. In all men by nature there is the habit of natural and
original ſin. Hence an indiſpoſition, and a reluctancy to
believe in Chriſt, to love, deſire, fear God.</p>
               <p>2. There is an acquired wicked diſpoſition in <hi>Doeg,</hi> he
loves to lye; a diſpoſition ſatanical and and helliſh in <hi>Saul</hi>
when the evil ſpirit troubles him, he is diſpoſed to kill
<hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſpecial ill diſpoſition here is the dead untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the children of God to pray, or praiſe, or confeſs
Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hence theſe conſiderations of this indiſpoſition.</p>
               <p>1. That it may befal the children of God.</p>
               <p>2. That they may act under this indiſpoſition.</p>
               <p>3. What acts they may and ought to performe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

As to the firſt, it needs not much probation.</p>

that the life of God in a believer can more intermit all
ſort of lively and vital actings, then the ſoul can live of
breathing, or to communicate vital heat to the body: the
unbroken and intenſe habit of ſin in the unrenewed, is the
mother-indiſpoſition that hinders influences of grace; as
caſt ſparkles of fire on cold iron, it makes no flaming, becauſe
of the denſity and coldneſs of the object: the Lord does
not beſtow every the ſame Sun-influences on the thiſtle
or nettle, and on the vintry; nor is it ſuppoſed that God
more beſtowes actual influence of ſaving grace upon a man

ſo overwhelmed, ſo that they cannot ſpeak, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 4. yet
they ſpeak prayers.</p>
               <p>2. There is holy complaining layed in the boſome of an
apprehended angry God; and though arrows of God ſtick in
the fleſh, <hi>Pſal. 38. 1, 2, 3, 4. Pſal. 119. 25. My ſoul cleaveth
to the duſt. 28. My ſoul droppeth away for heavineſs. 83. I am

for me.</p>
               <p>3. It's half a cloſing with a ſinful diſpoſition, when it
paines us leſſe. <hi>Paul</hi> proteſts againſt the fleſhes ſinful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<hi>Rom. 7. 15. I allow not the evil which I doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>He diſowns it,</hi> v. 17. It's no more I that doe it, but ſin
in me.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>He condemes himſelf for it,</hi> v. 18. I know in me, that
is, in my fleſh dwelleth no good.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>He complaines of it</hi> 23. I am led captive to the law
of ſin.</p>
               <p>5. His complaining ſo grows, that he ends in an out-cry,
<hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body
of this death?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No agreement betwixt theſe two champions the fleſh and the Spirit.</note> and triumphs victoriouſly in Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 25.
From which it is clear that <hi>Paul</hi> and the fleſh part open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and that there is no treaty of peace betwixt the
ſpirit and the ſinful diſpoſition flowing from the fleſh, as if
the fleſh and the ſpirit were two free, co-equal, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Lords and Princes, and each muſt have his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and princedome to himſelf, and the one muſt not
encroach upon the other; for the fleſh and its complices
muſt down, and the ſpirit muſt be up in Chriſt: Nor is
there any arbitrary agreement of the matter; for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
yields no liberty to ſin, nor gives away one jot or tittle
of the holy Law, to ſay <hi>Herod</hi> by the new covenant may
keep his luſt and <hi>Herodias,</hi> ſo he gladly hear <hi>John</hi> the
Baptiſt.</p>
               <p>4. There ought to be a going about of all duties, of
praying, believing, hearing, praiſing, &amp;c. under the loweſt
ebbings of the ſpirit, and the ſaddeſt deadneſs; ſo deadneſs
and indiſpoſitions be the ſin and ſinful affliction,<note place="margin">It's fit to go about duties under indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</note> and the
afflictive ſin of the child of God; for our obedience to God is
the more ſpiritual, that it hath no moral motive from ſenſe
and comfort, but rather the contrary, ſave onely the word
of command. So excellently Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 10. 9. Loe I come to
doe thy will,</hi> to ſuffer wrath, and the curſe for man; but
<hi>Pſal. 40. 8. I delight to doe thy will, thy Law is within my
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119064:141"/>
heart.</hi> His delight was in that ſaddeſt commandement (to
ſpeak ſo) in laying dow his life for his ſheep, and ſo had
no ſenſe to bear him up; for an agony, and ſadneſſe, and
ſorrow to death was upon the holy Saviour, when he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
and that peculiar law was in the inner part of his
heart. It's true, his Father loved him for it, <hi>John 10. 17.
Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life
that I might take it again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 1. It's a queſtion if in the act of ſuffering he felt that
love, when he complained that he was forſaken of God.</p>
               <p>2. Therefore the Father loved Chriſt, and Chriſt did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in his love, becauſe he kept his Fathers commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>John</hi> 15. 11. becauſe they were the Fathers comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
               <p>2. It's a temptation to act under deadneſs, which actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
blunts the heart; therefore to obey under a formal
temptation, is more ſpiritual obedience. As for Chriſt to
pray, to believe, to exhort his diſciples to watch, and when
pain, wrath, the actual preſſing curſe puts him to tears and
hideous cries, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. is a perfect copy to all obedience:
leſſe thanks to you to pray when the heart is oyled with
real influences,<note place="margin">Leſs of ſweet real influences, and more of moral influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the word makes obedience the more perfect.</note> and feaſted with ſome holy, and the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms
hony-comb, and the feelings of the out-lettings of
freeſt love; as what praiſe to a wheel to roll down the
mount? or for the fire to caſt heat, or the Sun to yield
light? Feelings of the ſtrong impulſions and breathings of
Chriſts love carry along ſuch a ſtrong neceſſity of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſts love, being a ſtronger and a more imperious
commander then a fiery Law, almoſt ſteals away the
elective power, but to pray under the frame and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of a dead diſpoſition working and re-acting on the
contrary, from a principle that is ſtrongly real, but from
pure moral influences from the pure ſpiritual commands,
1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 17. Pray without ceaſing,</hi> and <hi>Pſal. 50. 15. Call
upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> is the moſt ſpiritual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
obedience. That wine hath the moſt kindly taſte and
colour of wine, and is preſerved moſt connaturally, that
hath it's being on the mother grape; it's not ſo when there
is ſomething of art (I know not what) to preſerve it by, ſteel
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:119064:142"/>
or ſomething like that. Hence appears the decitfulneſſe of
our hearts, when the delight in the duty comes rather from
a meer phyſical cauſe, &amp; leſs moral, to wit, from the heavenly
flamings of quickening influences, not from the command,
the only kindly mother and moral motive of obedience.
The withdrawing of the rayes and beams of the perſonally
near Godhead now (as it were) under a cloud, which
was wont to give the ſavourneſs of ſtrong delight, made
our Redeemers obedience (as is ſaid) the more excellent.</p>
               <p>2. It ſpeaks much of ſavoury graciouſneſſe, when the
temptation is <hi>cos gratiae,</hi> a whetſtone to grace, and to
the ſpirit of adoption, and as ſailes and oares to praying,
and does not blunt us in duties.</p>
               <p>3. The greater combate with nature, the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is the obedience. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural diſpoſition
was ſtrong to love <hi>Iſaac</hi> his onely ſonne, to let the child
take his good night at his aged mother; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Jehovah</hi> his God in covenant ſo prevailed, as
he would ſhift the temptation, and hid the matter from
the mother <hi>Sarah,</hi> and ſtrongly ſecond the deſign of Gods
trying with reſolved pure ſpiritual obedience from only the
command of God</p>

Beſides theſe there be ſpecial diſpoſitions to pray, to

               </argument>
               <p>NOw to ſpeak of the <hi>burning of the heart,</hi> the place
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32. is clear. The two diſciples having part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

thorns under a pot, and the flaſhes of heat from burning
ſtraw leave no fire but aſhes, and much cold behind them in
the cold winter froſt; and the generality of dead profeſſors
can ſay nothing to one another, but I have long heard the
Goſpel, and yet am without God and without Chriſt. 2. I
am convinced of the excellence of Chriſt, and there yet is

love or love-ſickneſs, when Chriſt makes love a key that

this is the fift difference betwixt the literal and ſpiritual
heat; the heavenly heart-burning goes along with the
Scriptures. 2. With the Scriptures ſo opened and applied
by the ſpirit of Jeſus as by a ſtrong power, burning coals
are caſt into the heart. As touching the former, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt this and the Libertines ſpirit, or the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts,
are to be obſerved, and the ſpirit of the children of
God.</p>
               <p>1. Chriſts ſpirit extols the Scriptures; <hi>It is written, ſaith
Chriſt</hi> againſt Satan. <hi>Have ye not read in the Scriptures,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> againſt the Sadduces, <hi>Matth. 22. Search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>they bear witneſs of me.</hi> He taught the
multitude and diſciples, <hi>as its written in the Scriptures.</hi> He
rebukes them, <hi>Luke 24. v. 25. as fools and ſlow of heart,</hi> for
not believing the Scriptures. When he would carry in
real influences of grace to the heart, he carries them along
by the Scripture, and opens the underſtanding that they
may underſtand the Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 45. that is the
ſpirit of Satan in ſome, who boaſt that they are beyond
and above the word of the Kingdom, and ſuch muſt be
beyond and on the other ſide of heaven.</p>
               <p>2. They who wait for the Lord, and whoſe ſoul waits
for God, <hi>they hope in his word, Pſalm</hi> 130. 5, 6. Libertines
ſouls cannot wait for the Lord as the watch for the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">Hence conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences betwixt motions of the Spirit and looſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſms.</note>
               </p>
               <p>3. Its a work of the ſpirit ſtrongly to convince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of not believing in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16. 7, 8. now to
believe in him is the ſum of the Scriptures, of the Goſpel.
Enthuſiaſts extol perſwaſions by raptures, according to
which the brother killeth the brother, as <hi>Bullinger</hi> relates,
in place of the Scripture-convictions of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>4. The work of the ſpirit is to comfort, for its the ſpirits
office; and the ſound comfort <hi>is patience and comfort of
the Scriptures bringing hope, Rom.</hi> 15. 4. The ſpirit of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts
perſwades men of peace and comfort without and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the promiſes of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>5. The words of the book of the Law melt the heart of
godly <hi>Joſiah, 2 Kings</hi> 19. 22. and the Lord looks to him
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119064:145"/>
that trembles at his word to dwell with him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 2. The
Enthuſiaſts boldly mock the word as an inſtrument of
carnal and fleſhly regeneration, and ſeek a new birth from
a ſpirit alone ſeparated from the word.</p>
               <p>6. Deep humiliation is wrought by the word, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.
14. the pride of Satan reigns in the ſpirits of Enthuſiaſts,
who deſpiſe Scripture humility, and reproach tears and
the work of repentance, as a work of the Law and the
fleſh.</p>
               <p>7. Strong and couragious fighting, even to overcoming,
gets for a reward <hi>the hid manna, the white ſtone, and the new
name written thereon, which no man can read but he that
receives it:</hi> now fighting and overcoming is by the word of
the ſpirit, <hi>Rev. 2. 17. Eph.</hi> 6. 17. and faith in the word, 1 <hi>John</hi>
5. 4. Enthuſiaſts tell us of a dumb and Scriptureleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
by which men are perſwaded they are choſen to
ſalvation, and can know others by the face that are ſo
choſen.</p>
               <p>8. The true ſpirit leads unto all truth, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13 and
opens the true ſenſe of the Scriptures, and leads no man
by a new wild-fire light; nor doth the ſpirit of God ſway
and determin a topick conjectural way, while there
is a ſpeculative doubting as touching any light from
Scripture, whether the courſe be lawful or warranted by
the word or not: for the ſpirit of God leads by Scriptures
infallibility, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>9. The actings of the true ſpirit are gentle, civil, human,
and he bids us follow whatſoever is <hi>of good report</hi>—what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<hi>things are pure, Phil.</hi> 4. 8, 9. The ſpirit of Enthuſiaſts,
leaving Scripture, licences men to abominations which
Heathens abhor.</p>
               <p>10. The actings of the ſpirit of Chriſt are ſeaſonable,
<hi>Matth. 10. 19. in that hour it ſhall be given you; it is not ye
that ſpeake, but the ſpirit of your Father ſpeakes in you.</hi>
Enthuſiaſts ſpirit ſuggeſts night-works to be done in day
light, and many unſeaſonable actions contrary to godly
prudence, as to read godly Treatiſes when they ſhould hear
the Word preached; the ſpirit that ſuggeſteth this is not
of God, for the ſpirit of God cannot counter-work himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:119064:146"/>
11. The ſpirit of God acts the ſoul and the man within
his own orb and ſphere of grace. Nature acts not upon the
Moon to move it up to the ſphere of the Sun, nor could
it be called a kindly and connatural motion for the Sun
to move down in the orb of the Moon. It's not the ſpirit
of the Lord which acts the plow-man to move out of his
element in the throne or in another calling in which God
hath not placed him: for it is not from the motion of the
ſpirit of ſanctification for <hi>David</hi> to go out of his element
of grace, and move in Satans orb of uncleanneſs and
blood-ſhed: the ſpirit of holineſs is a friend to the holy
Law of God; all influences and actings of the ſpirit are
to be tried by the ſame rules by which the ſpirit is tried:
ſome influences to Scriptural duties are from God and his
ſpirit, other influences from the Scriptureleſs ſpirit of
Satan, or corrupt man himſelf; every ſtirring and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
muſt not be fathered upon the ſpirit of grace.</p>
               <p>The fourth particular is the ſubject or ſeat of burning,
and its the <hi>heart; did not our hearts burn within us?</hi> the
heart is the only ſeat of heavenly burnings; not ſimply,
as the heart of man, <hi>which is evil, and only evil</hi> by nature
in all its out-goings, <hi>Gen. 6. 6. Gen.</hi> 8. 21. and ſupplanted
and wicked, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. But the new heart of man, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
36. 26, 27. the heart in which the love of God, as a flood,
is ſpread abroad by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. the heart
and ſoul that loves the beloved Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. as
for the unrenewed heart it is no more a hearth-ſtone, or a
ſeat to kindle this fire upon, nor will it burn in this heart,
then if you would kindle a fire of coals and fewel and dry
timber upon the ſuperfice of the ocean ſea; for the heart of
the unrenewed man would eat up and quench all this fire;
and the ſpirit does no more give influences for the heavenly
burnings in the heart of an unrenewed man, then he
gives influences to the water to burn, and caſt out flamings
as a huge fire doth, or to the midnight darkneſs to ſhine as
the Moon or Sun: and this is the ſixt difference. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
heart is only the ſeat of this fire that comes down
from heaven, the natural heart is not capable thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there not an heart warmneſs in the natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed

               <p>But the differences be theſe:</p>
               <p>1. The heat of the unrenewed man is ſtrong, and
cannot be commanded; they haſten as mad men after
their idols, who run after other gods, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. 4. And
<hi>Paul</hi> ſays of his heat in perſecuting the Saints, <hi>Acts 26. 11.

in the Sea cannot quench. <hi>Nor can the floods drown it.
If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it.
would utterly be contemned.</hi> Then drowning and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
death, fair allurements and gifts, cannot counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
the love of Chriſt. What? and are loves coales ſo
hot? yea he ſpoke to that, <hi>v. 6. Love is ſtrong as death:
jealouſie is cruel as the grave; the coals thereof are coals of
fire, which have a moſt vehement flame, the flame of God.</hi> But
natural men for all their heat in the matters of God, can
let out and let in, and ſtretch out the truth for all their
heart-burnings, as if it were kid-leather; and they may
take and give, and borrow and lend upon Chriſts mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whereas the Saints are awed with that, <hi>Buy the truth
and ſell it not.</hi> Let indifferent and cold men, who never
felt the influences of loves fiery coals, know this. Ah, the

and coldly; the coales of ſelf-intereſt burn
ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>2. The bare letter of the Goſpel wins not in upon the
heart, it warmes the skin and not the heart; whereas
Chriſts ſpeaking and opening the Scriptures with his Spirit,
and the key of <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Literal heat is all upon the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and forms, not ſo as the ſpiritual heat.</note> caſteth not fire upon the heart, the

All <hi>Pauls</hi> heat is about Chriſt, and the hope of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
the <hi>Jewes</hi> his adverſaries heat could be nothing
of this heart-burning, but for <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in the letter, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
and other ceremonies, now wanting their life
Chriſt. For Chriſt had now 1. removed from the letter
of the ceremonial law, and there is no life there as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the obſervance thereof.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt hath 2. not departed from, and gone out of
the ceremonial law, as touching the doctrinal teaching
thereof to lead us to Chriſt; and therefore that law ſhould
be read, preached, believed, and ſtands cloathed with the
authority of Canonick Scripture, otherwiſe Libertines muſt
caſhier the books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Nor hath Chriſt removed out of the letter of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:119064:147"/>
Scripture Law and Goſpel, to teach us no more thereby,
but only by the Spirits inſtruction; for even the doctrine
of the Law curſes, <hi>Deut. 27. Deut.</hi> 28. are a part of the
immediately inſpired word of God ſhining with the ſame
majeſty, holineſs, divinity, convincing power, as the letter
of the Goſpel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>4. Chriſt hath not removed (as <hi>Saltmarſh, Dell,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
teach) from the Law moral the divine obligation to
holineſs and righteouſneſs; for it layes the ſame bands and
obligations to the duties of love and obedience to God,
and of love, truth, mercy, righteouſneſs, ſoberneſs, to man,
which was upon us in <hi>Moſes</hi> time; for that way grace
ſhould teach looſneſs, lawleſs wantonneſs, not holineſs.
We would preſs good works, holineſs, godly walking, on
all, as they would ſee God, and not be trees hewen down
and caſt in the fire. Suppoſe we could not with Schoole
accuracy rid marches as touching the neceſſity thereof;
but we are to beware of the leaven of the Phariſees, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by works.</p>
               <p>5. Chriſt and the Spirit of Chriſt dwell in the Law, to
joyn gracious influences therewith to humble ſinners, to
caſt them down, to bring them to ſelf-deſpair, that they
may flee to Chriſt</p>

               </p>
               <p>2. Rid marches betwixt the Law and grace: ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
ones muſt have their by paſt life and the ſtrict law
reconciled; otherwiſe they but walk in the fleſh, and ſo
live (as they imagine) in Law bondage, and are ſick of
the old diſeaſes, and ſo weaken their faith. Hence ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<hi>Thou art under the Law, and having made a bargain
with the Law to keep it, thou art in the fleſh, thou canſt not
ſpeak to a ſtrange King in another land, a King of grace,
ſince thou haſt fled back again to the old priſon; and if thou
ſpeak, it is with much ſtraitning and doubting; thou art the
Lawes man, and not Chriſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Keep near communion with God; keep the veſſel
free of leaking, and of under water; ſin weakens faith, and
ſaddens the ſpirit; and <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is there
is liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.</p>

4. Improve much faith. Frequent believing ſhall come
up to full aſſurance, and that makes ſtrong and bold knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for a Son who hath right to come where his own fleſh

as if it were unbelief; Chriſt had much heavineſs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to death,<note place="margin">Every heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not weakneſs of faith.</note> in his ſuffering, but no weakneſſe of faith.

               <p>5. Its atheiſm to ſuppoſe that influences of ſaving grace

               <p>2. As Gods active hardning of us is a puniſhment of ſin, the
Church may lawfully complain of it to God, and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
that and all the like ſad evils of puniſhment; yet it
ſhall never follow that God is the author or the cauſe of

Ile never make out to Chriſt, nor ask for the Goſpel; if
Chriſt will not heal us we muſt pine away in our ſins;

and caſting of a board again to wind to the right harbour,
and it is a ſort of courting the wind, and that is the caſe
of the ſoul that would live upon influences, its fit to pant
and gape, and carefully wait on for the holy breathings of
the Lord; could we wait in the way that the Spirit uſes to
come, and attend him in ordinances, he muſt come that
way, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> caſt himſelf in that way of Chriſt; providence
places two blind beggars in Chriſts way, &amp; the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
beſtows the Son of <hi>Davids</hi> mercy on them; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
placed the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> at the well of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
and Chriſt muſt needs go thorow <hi>Samaria,</hi> and her way,
ſhe looked for water from <hi>Jacobs</hi> well, and looked not for
the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> yet ſhe meets with him, and feels his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

to lie at the tide, and wait for, and ſeek the flowings of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:119064:154"/>
the Spirit; in one and the ſame work the ſounding of the
word and the breathing of the Spirit may be attended,
<hi>Pſalm 130. 5. I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his real helping and hearing, my crying out of the
deeps, or on his ſaving actings upon the dead heart, <hi>and
in his word do I hope:</hi> there may be a caſting of the goods
in the ſea to help the ſhip to land: there is failing of the
eyes in waiting for God, <hi>Pſalm 69. 3. Pſalm 119. 8. My ſoul

it removes the aſhes, it fans away the earthy part, and rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
it, and acts upon the ſmoke, and adds quickning; it's
fit to blow upon the habit of grace and heavenly diſpoſition,
yea, to blow in a ſanctified way, in a gift; ſo <hi>Paul, 2 Tim.
1. 6. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, to ſtir up the

ſuch as care for the fire, which is as it were buried under

the fire like to die out; others think it an alluſion to the
Prieſts dayly watching to cheriſh and keep in the fire which

                  </gap>, <hi>neglect not the
gift that is in thee;</hi> let it not ruſt: ſelf-ſharping and ſelf-impulſion
upon the heart, and acting upon the habit,
which is in worſe caſe becauſe it lodges in a lazy heart,
is required: we may deaden and neglect both our ſouls and
the new habit, whereas that prayer (<hi>Lord, increaſe our
faith</hi>) teacheth that we by diligent acting add to the
habit, to the gift, talent and diſpenſation, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of theſe are forcible means to draw down freſh
influences of life: the Lord of his grace having brought
himſelf (reſerving actings of ſoveraignty and deep wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
under a ſort of promiſſory neceſſity to beſtow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
and to give one talent to him who makes five
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:119064:154"/>
talents ten; idleneſs and ſleeping then muſt be no ſmall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to new quickening influences.</p>
               <p>5. As the husbandman is a fellow-worker in his way with
induſtry and art, with the Lord and nature, to fit his ridges
by plowing and ſowing to receive influences of dew and
rain, and impreſſion from heaven; and he works with God
and nature, who labours the vineyard, purges out bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
briars, ſtones, prunes the young vine-trees, that they
may receive influences from Sunne, Moon, Heavens, and
Clouds. Yet no husbandman, no vinedreſſer, can be Lord
of the influences of heaven: ſo hath the Lord commanded
us <hi>to plow up the fallow-ground of our hearts, and not to ſow
among thorns;</hi> to lie under the husbandry of Miniſters <hi>ſent
of God;</hi> to frequent ordinances; to yield up our hearts
by willing conſent to be acted on by God; to reſign them,
and put the heart out of our poſſeſſion, and yield to that
ſuit, <hi>My ſon give me thy heart;</hi> elſe we mock God in ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from him enlargedneſs of heart, in a ſort of compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
that we ſhall run, if he ſhall draw and enlarge:
But we keep faſt poſſeſſion of our own hearts, and doe not
reſign them to God. Hence a word of wakening to cry to
harp and pſaltery, to our gift, and to our tongue, and to
our ſleepy hearts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. 8. is requiſite; as alſo 2. that
we chide with our unbelieving ſoules, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 5, 11. and

               <argument>
                  <p>The fifth Queſtion is what is the enlarging of heart.
It is nothing but the wideneſs and fulneſs of the
ſoul and powers thereof in its actings. Hence theſe
Propoſitions concerning enlargedneſs of heart.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <label>Prop. 1.</label> WHen the ſoul is widened and ſtretched out in its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
we are ready to ſay, <hi>I ſhall never be moved,</hi>
Pſal. 30. <hi>I ſhall dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever,</hi> Pſal.
23. 6. which though true, when he was baniſhed from the
Tabernacle, <hi>Pſal. 42. Pſal. 84. Pſal.</hi> 63. he had uttered
thoughts of his ſtate. Some ſay, Shall I ever again be dead?
Shall I ever again doubt as a down-caſting ſoul? no, I
ſhall believe and hope under temptations to the end. But
we are no more to judge of our ſelves by our preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largedneſs,
then we are to paſs ſentence of the multitude of
people of a City by a ſolemn fair or great market, the town
is not every day ſo peopled: nor are we to eſteem of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by its ſwelling and running over banks after a mighty
long continued rain.</p>
               <p>2. Nor are we to judge of our ſelves according to our
ebbing and deadneſs of diſpoſition, that we ſhall ever again
believe. Saith the doubting ſoul, Shall I ever again ſee the
beauty and glory of his power, as ſometimes I did in the
Sanctuary? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. The birds reaſon not ſo; they ſay
not in winter, ſhall ever the Spring and the ſeaſon of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our neſts come again? ſhall birds ever have Summer-ſinging
again? And we are ready to make a weapon-ſhew
of grace when the heart is enlarged; I'le doe wonders: as
if the man were the Father who begat grace, and the Lord
of his own believing; as ſome believe the horſes ſwiftneſs
is the ſwiftneſs of the rider. Be humble, and pull down
the ſail when the heart is enlarged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. See in the Text enlargedneſs of heart and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
are near of kindred and blood. The diſpoſition and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:119064:155"/>
the gracious acting by divine influences are near other, as
the powder and flamings, the dry timber and the warm
harth-ſtone, to receive flamings. There is a near diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the <hi>Embrio,</hi> in the framed maſs of the birth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by the Creators influences a living ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 1, 2,
3, 4. So in Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. the law in the heart, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Lords righteouſneſs in the great congregations
are near other.</p>
               <p>2. The enlarged heart is ripened to receive influences
and quickening of grave for running. The God of nature,
by a ſort of neceſſity, muſt give influences to the egg ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to be a living bird: when the heart is boyling and
ſeething with thoughts <hi>of the King,</hi> the tongue is the pen of
a <hi>ready writer.</hi> When the heart is fixed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. 7. as if
he were maſter of influences, he humbly out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the heart engageth to ſing and give praiſe, <hi>I my
ſelf will awake early.</hi> There is here fire, therefore the Lord
ſhall blow upon his own kindling; no queſtion we may
caſt water on our own coals. The heart of the two diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
is burning like an oven, while Chriſt ſpeaks to them by
the way, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 31. yet they fortifie themſelves, and fetch
reaſons to ſtrengthen unbelief; ſo as they ſeem to fetch
unbelief, and unbelief comes not on them unſent for, <hi>ver.
21. We truſted that it was he who ſhould have redeemed Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Branches of enlargedneſs of heart.</note> 3. For the branches of enlargedneſs of heart;
there is a fulneſs of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> in the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> in <hi>Steven,</hi>
which was not a tranſient diſpoſition, but a permanent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;
but this breaks out in ſomething more then an habit.
The Spirit of the Lord came upon <hi>Sampſon</hi> in mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
when he broke the cords, and carried away the
ports of the City. <hi>Pſal. 45. 1. My heart is inditing a good
matter;</hi> like a boyling and ſeething pot, and that puts him
to ſpeak of the King. <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 32. 18. <hi>I am full of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the ſpirit within me conſtraineth me. 19. Behold, my
belly is as new wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burſt
like new bottles.</hi> There was a heavenly ſpring, a new foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
broken up in him, and excellently beyond all the

friends he pleads for the Lord his ſoveraignty. O what
fulneſs above meaſure above his fellows was in the man
Chriſt! the law was in his heart, and the fulneſs of
grace; and (as it were) to overtake the running over well,
he takes whole nights to prayer; and for Preaching and
working miracles, he hath not leiſure to ſleep or eat. If
there be a fire in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s bowels, what wonder then
prophecying flame out of his mouth, and he confeſs he was
weary with forbearing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. and God obtains his holy
end. The people are warned of their ſin, when <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith

               <p>2. <hi>There is a wideneſs and an all-neſs in regard of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
Solomon <hi>had wiſedome, and largeneſs of</hi> heart, as

1. 9. We ceaſe not to pray that ye may be filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               </p>
               <p>2. And <hi>Solomon</hi> was but a ſhadow, and the ſand of the

                  <hi>Whom God anointed with the holy Ghoſt and with power.</hi> Here
is wideneſs of heart, and abundance of influences, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of good night and day.</p>
               <p>3. The wiſedome of Angels is large. Hence that (<hi>wiſe

affections teacheth us that wideneſs of heart is outed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
acting,<note place="margin">Influences on Angels and the glorified ones.</note> and ſo in multiplied breathings of God: and
Angels doe not walk and run onely, but fly with wings,
cheerfully to doe the Lords will: and what influences muſt
be there, when each having ſix wings, they ceaſe not night
nor day to cry one to another, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
of hoſts, Almighty, which was, and which is to come, the whole
earth is filled with his glory,</hi> Rev. 48. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 3.</p>

               <p>5. The more the Prophets and Apoſtles ſaw of God, the
more the heart is enlarged to teach and to warn every man,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>3. There is an enlargement of heart in loving Chriſt, and
in the experimental knowing and feeling thereof, and in
godly fear and joy, <hi>Eph. 4. 19. Paul</hi> prays that the <hi>Epheſians</hi>
may comprehend the love in all the dimenſions of it, <hi>That
ye may be able to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

               <p>The Lord muſt be diſpleaſed with our narrowneſs. How
little a portion of him doe we ſee? We are not ſtraitned in
the Lords heart, but in our ſelves: He calls for wider
hearts, <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81. 10.
not the mouth, but the heart: our narrow heart, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

               <p>2. His vehemency of affection in doubling the expreſſion.</p>
               <p>3. His ſpeaking of it prayer-wiſe, <hi>O God, my heart is
fixed.</hi> His ſincerity.</p>
               <p>4. What the diſpoſition wrought in him, a fixed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to praiſe; and a waking up of his gift of muſick, <hi>awake
pſaltery;</hi> and of himſelf, <hi>I my ſelf will awake early.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How got <hi>David</hi> this heavenly diſpoſition?</p>
               <p>1. The occaſion was 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. as the title of the Pſalm
bears, <hi>Saul</hi> with three thouſand men-perſons, <hi>David</hi> in
the <hi>rocks of the wild goats in the wilderneſs of Engedi; Saul</hi>
went into the cave to cover his feet, and <hi>David</hi> and his
men remained in the ſides of the cave; and <hi>David</hi> went
in and cut the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, and had in his power
to kill <hi>Saul,</hi> and his men counſelled him ſo to doe; but in
ſtead of arfrighting <hi>Saul</hi> and his army, the Lord ſuggeſts
the fear and awe of God, he durſt not kill him.</p>
               <p>2. He truſted in God for deliverance another way then
to put hands on the Prince, as <hi>Pſal. 112. 7. A good man is
not afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed truſting in the
Lord.</hi> This is the fixedneſs of faith, oppoſite to fear and
unbelief, when another man would tremble, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
with three thouſand inſtruments of death, as many
men, as many deaths; yet his heart is fixed on God, both
to believe and to pray. <hi>David</hi> by prayer, <hi>Be merciful to
me, O God,</hi> and by faith gets this confident diſpoſition,
and this confident diſpoſition brings forth acts of believing
in ſtead of trembling, and reſolutions to praiſe and to ſing,
and give thanks. But if the queſtion be moved how gets
<hi>David</hi> grace to believe, and grace to pray? Certainly by
influences of grace upon the occaſion of the delivery: So
that here acts of praying bring forth holy diſpoſitions to
pray and to praiſe, as is clear, <hi>Be merciful unto me, O God:</hi>
and God both delivered him, and gives him fixedneſs of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:119064:158"/>
heart to pray and praiſe, when a natural man would trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the ſight and fear of ſo many deaths. And again, a
diſpoſition and fixedneſs of heart brings forth a reſolution
to praiſe and give thanks. And 2. a ſtirring up of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his muſick to praiſe, yea and actual praiſing, <hi>v. 11.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, let thy glory be
above all the earth.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ſhall beget a holy diſpoſition to pray?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Praying begets a holy diſpoſition to pray. When
<hi>David</hi> goes up the mount of Olives, fleeing from <hi>Abſolom,</hi>
he weeps and prayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. and that praying begets a
fixedneſs to believe, and a diſpoſition to pray, <hi>v. 6. I ſhall not
be afraid of ten thouſand of the people, that have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
round about me.</hi> Pſal. 6. he prayes, <hi>Lord, rebuke me
not in thy wrath, have mercy on me; return again, O Lord,
deliver my ſoul.</hi> That prayer is heard, and the reſult is
an heavenly diſpoſition to part with wicked men, 6. <hi>Depart
from me ye workers of iniquity,</hi> and a new diſpoſition of
aſſurance, <hi>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.</hi>
And aſſurance that God heard the man, is a new ſeed of
praying to him again, <hi>Pſal. 116. 3, 4, 5, 6. Pſal.</hi> 18. 3, 4, 5, 6.
So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. after complaints and heavenly petitions, <hi>v. 4.
Pull me out of the net.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Holy acts beget holy acts, and holy diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beget holy diſpoſitions.</note> 9. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Lord—make

               <p>1. Of commending the ſeeking of God, <hi>v. 19. O bow
great is thy goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for them that

<hi>v. 23. O love the Lord all ye his Saints,</hi> &amp;c. A diſpoſition
to encourage fainters, <hi>v. 24. Be of good courage, and he
ſhall ſtrengthen your heart.</hi> How ſhall I get praying? Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
helps to praying. How ſhall I get holy diſpoſitions?
Holy diſpoſitions beget holy diſpoſitions? How ſhall I get
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:119064:159"/>
courage and ſpiritual ſtrength? <hi>Pſal. 31. 24. Be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and he ſhall ſtrengthen your heart;</hi> that is, be ſtrong
in the Lord, and he ſhall make you ſtrong in him. So
<hi>Pſal. 27. 14. Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he
ſhall ſtrengthen thy heart; wait I ſay on the Lord.</hi> The cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of faith is commanded, and the argument is, <hi>God ſhall
ſtrengthen thy heart, and give thee courage.</hi> As if we were
the beginners of the good work: ſo does the Lord frame his
precepts &amp; promiſes to ſhake us out of our lazineſs, that we
abuſe not his grace and gracious influences to wanton idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
So the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">The Lord ſo frames his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes as our actings are ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably required to his influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ſtrong in the faith,</hi> and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and God ſhall ſtrengthen your heart, and furniſh you.
So the Father ſpeaks to his child, lift at this burden, I will
lift your arms, and ſtrengthen them to lift the burden, and
to bear it.</p>
               <p>2. They are refuted hence who ſay, The Lord bids us
be of good courage, and he knows courage and ſtrength
is from himſelf; yea, but ſo as you are to goe about acts of
courage. He bids us pray, and he knows prayer is his own
gift, and the work of his Spirit. It's ſo here; but he bids
you pray, that you may pray; believe, that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
So he commands heavenly diſpoſitions, and he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can give them. So he commands heavenly habits, and
heavenly diſpoſitions; but yet ſo as ye act. When a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
enjoyns one for ſuch a diſeaſe, ſtrive to have your
body and cloathes to caſt a good ſavour: does he not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
alſo that this ſick man ſhould carry about roſes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
oyntments? Would we act more in God, and pray
more, and haunt more in heaven, we ſhould ſavour more
of heaven: And when men complaines of deadneſs, it is
with reflection on God; he quickens me not, and therefore
I am dead; his Son is the reſurrection and the life, and he
ſends no inflnences of life on me. That is the phyſical
cauſe, and the Lord is free of your ſinful deadneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavourineſs
in ſo doing: Why? complain of the moral
faulty cauſe, that is, complain of your ſelf; complain that
ye lie not among the roſes; ye are not much meditating
and drawing life out of the precious promiſes; ye are not
often in wiſedomes houſe; ye are not much with the King
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:119064:159"/>
at his banquet; ye draw not near to his houſe of wine:
habits and heavenly diſpoſitions grow from multiplyed
ſpiritual acts; and ſpiritual acts come kindly from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>My heart is fixed.</p>
               <p>What is the particular diſpoſition here aimed at: For
clearing of this, know a diſpoſition in general (of which I
ſpake above) is one thing, and this diſpoſition is another.</p>
               <p>Theſe three muſt be differenced.</p>
               <p>1. The ſtate.</p>
               <p>2. The temper and conſtitution.</p>
               <p>3. The diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>The ſtate is to be renewed in Chriſt, or in nature born
of the ſpirit, or yet remaining and walking in the fleſh,
acted by the prince of the air, that rules in the children of
diſobedience: the birth and ſtate of living is neither up nor
down to the temper and conſtitution, which is either ſtrong
and vigorous, or weakly and ſickly; or betwixt theſe, the
ſtate of living or birth conſiſts <hi>in indiviſibili;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The differences of the 1 Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtate. 2 Of the temper 3 Of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> if the man
breath and live in nature, or in Chriſt, being now a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
perſon, he hath a natural or a ſpiritual life: but
howbeit ſome be born again; ſome are fathers and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced,
radicated, and confirmed Chriſtians; others are
young men ſtrong in the faith, and both theſe are of a good
ſpiritual temper and conſtitution. But there are a third
ſort that are babes in Chriſt, and though born again, yet
weakly and ſickly, frequent out-breakings, much doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
liable to ſtrong unmortified paſſions, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 12, 13,
14. And to be born of God is common to all the three ſorts,
and the eſſence and nature of the new birth agrees equally
and univocally to them all: all have their own influences
finiſhed to them from Chriſt; but the ſpiritual tempers
may differ, as weak and ſtrong, healthy or ſickly, good or
bad, at leaſt leſſe good.</p>
               <p>But as for diſpoſitions of the regenerate, they are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that go and come, now &amp; anon. I judge you will ſay the
new-birth and the heavenly diſpoſition are all one; For
<hi>David</hi> was born of God, while he was under a wicked di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition
to deflour <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> to kill <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> to be avenged
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119064:160"/>
no <hi>Nabal;</hi> all which were bad diſpoſitions, when the new-birth
is the new-birth and ſaving work of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And again, the ſpiritual diſpoſition differs not a little
from the ſpiritual temper.</p>
               <p>1. The ſpiritual temper is permanent; as one is a weak
man until he come out of his childhood; for ſo many years
or months he is Infant, ſo long a child, ſo long a youth:
So one is ſo long a babe in Chriſt, and grows to be ſtronger
in the faith, and at length comes to be a father in Chriſt;
but even while the ſame babes age in Chriſt continues,
and the ſame weakly and ſickly temper and inclination to
yield to temptations; in <hi>David</hi> new born and a babe, good
diſpoſitions may be on to pray, to praiſe, to commit his
life to God in extream dangers, to make Pſalms, and yet
<hi>Davids</hi> ſpiritual temper and conſtitution is and may be
bad and ſickly; as <hi>Peter</hi> before our Saviours death is born
again, and a believer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 16, 17. and by his much
ignorance and frequent ſlips, as acting Satans part in
diſſwading Chriſt from the neceſſary work of redemption,
his carnal confidence in himſelf, in ſaying, he ſhould never
deny Chriſt, his ſmiting off <hi>Malchus</hi> ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, his denial of
Chriſt with an oath, it appears that the ſpiritual temper
was weak and much carnal: nor can it be denied all that
time when <hi>Peters</hi> temper was weak; but when he gave a
confeſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. he was under a gracious
diſpoſition; and <hi>Peters</hi> continuing with Chriſt in his
temptations did ſuppoſe a gracious diſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tion in theſe acts
of his, and the reſt of the believing Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 29, 30.
3. The Lords Diſciples are all born again (<hi>Judas</hi> excepted)
but it were hard to ſay that <hi>John,</hi> the beloved Diſciple,
was of the ſame temper, before the death of Chriſt, with
<hi>Peter,</hi> who proved more ſinfully raſh in many things then
<hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. A diſpoſition is a tranſient impreſſion that may be
left upon the ſpirit by an occurrence of providence, which
though it ſometime continue long, is not neceſſarily alway
ſo. Upon the ſuppoſed death of <hi>Joſeph, Jacob</hi> refuſed to
be comforted; upon the departure of the Ark, <hi>Phineas</hi>
daughter in law is diſpoſed to die for ſorrow; which in a
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:119064:160"/>
great part was a gracious diſpoſition: its like this great
deliverance left a ſtrong impreſſion on <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit, and
brought out praiſing of God.</p>
               <p>But to the particular: this diſpoſition is a fixedneſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to believe,<note place="margin">What <hi>Davids</hi> preſent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was.</note> pray, praiſe, having its riſe from this
preſent merciful deliverance, its oppoſed to the trepidation
and doubting of unbelief, which made him ſay elſewhere,
<hi>One day or other I ſhall periſh by the hand of Saul;</hi> which alſo
ſaith, that this was not ever <hi>Davids</hi> condition; but being
deſerted of <hi>God,</hi> he was under a contrary diſpoſition: but
good it were alway to keep the heart under ſuch a fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Ah, but we are up and down, out and in, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtedfaſtneſs and unmoveableneſs in the work of the
Lord; the <hi>Galatians</hi> did run well a while; the balaſting
of ſaving grace is moſt neceſſary: it was a ſad word,
2 <hi>Tim. 1. 15. This thou knoweſt, that all they which are in
Aſia are turned away from me. John 6. 66. from that time,
many 2. of his diſciples,</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>took them to things
behind, went backward, and 4. walked no more with him:</hi>
they left both Chriſt and the profeſſion of Chriſt. It was a
ſad ſuſpending of influences when <hi>all the Diſciples forſooke
him and fled, Matth.</hi> 26.</p>
               <q>My heart is fixed, my heart is fixed.</q>
               <p>The ſecond particular is the doubling of the words.
In this and in the following words we have divers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
characters and properties of heavenly diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>1. The doubling noteth the heat and fervour of affection
in <hi>David,</hi> as that <hi>My God, my God,</hi> notes the heat of faith;
two gripes of faith is better then one: ſo ſaith the tripling
of that prayer,<note place="margin">The doubling of words or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences noteth certainty, 2. Addition of aſſurance, 3. Freeneſs of affection.</note> 
                  <hi>O my Father, O my Father, remove this cup,
Matth.</hi> 26. There is fire in the deſire <hi>Pſalm 57. 1. Be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to me, O God, be merciful to me:</hi> and twice in this
Pſalm, <hi>v. 5. Be thou exalted, O God, &amp;c.</hi> and again <hi>v. 11.
Be thou exalted, O God, Pſalm</hi> 46. that is doubled, <hi>the
Lord of hoſts is with us, v. 7, 11. for his mercy endureth for
ever,</hi> is repeated twenty ſix times in one Pſalm.</p>
               <p>1. In ſinners (in Chriſt it could not be) it notes a ſort
of diſtruſting of the Spirit; they will not believe the heart
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:119064:161"/>
at the firſt word: <hi>Not unto us, O Lord;</hi> that is not enough,
the heart is ready to ſteal the Lord's glory; therefore he
addeth, <hi>not unto us, but unto thy name give the glory:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the doubling of it ſpeaks the certainty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 32.</p>
               <p>2. It notes that we are to make an eik to our aſſurance;
<hi>my heart is fixed, O God;</hi> therefore two witneſſes are better
then one, he ſays it over again, <hi>my heart is fixed;</hi> for we
ſhall deny that any ſuch heavenly diſpoſition was in the
hour of temptation, and ſay all is but falſe work; in ſo
doing he blows the coal when he finds it ſmoaking, and
blows twice, and ſtrikes the iron again and again when he
finds it hot. So he awakes up tongue and voice, muſick
and harp, gift and grace, to praiſe the Lord; as when he
finds his heart in a praiſing diſpoſition, he deſires an eik
of all creatures in heaven and earth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103. all the
Angels, all his hoſts, all his works in all places of his
dominion to joyne with his ſoule to bleſſe the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 20,
21, 22.</p>
               <p>3. It notes a fierceneſſe and a ſtrong flaming of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and a ſort of violence of aſſenting to the influences
of grace which brought on that holy diſpoſition; which
teacheth us when holy diſpoſitions offer a divine violence
to the ſoul to joyn our violence to his violence: we will
run, that is our violence; <hi>Draw me,</hi> that is his violence.
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 32. I will run the way of thy commandments,
and preſs my ſelf to willing and hot obedience <hi>if thou ſhall,</hi>
or when thou ſhall, <hi>enlarge my heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>To this purpoſe we are to meet his actings of love,</hi>
Cant. 1. 4. The King brought me into his chambers, <hi>with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
and praiſing his love:</hi> we will be glad and rejoyce in
thee; we will remember thy love more then wine; the upright
love thee.</p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">It's fit to make an eike to the holineſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences which the Lord offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to us.</note> Let us intend and enlarge the acting of our heart to
him. Chriſt puts in his hand <hi>by the hole of the door,</hi> which
was a ſtrong inward ſtirring of the Spirit of Jeſus; and the
Spouſe meets this with bended and mighty acts of loving
obedience. As</p>
               <p>1. <hi>My bowels were moved for him.</hi> For whom? for him,
my Beloved, who did ſtand and knock, while his head was
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:119064:161"/>
full of dew, and his locks (wet) <hi>with the drops of the night,
v.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>I roſe up to open to my Beloved, and my hands dropped
with myrrh, and my fingers with ſweet ſmelling myrrh upon
the handles of the lock.</hi> Here are both repentance in riſing
to open, whereas ſhe excuſed and ſhifted the buſineſs before,
and ſenſe of the ſavourineſs and heavenly feeling as of a
ſweet ſmell of myrrh, joy, ſenſe of joy and delight in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him.</p>
               <p>4. There is a formal holy violence offered to him, the
Angel <hi>Chriſt</hi> wreſtles with <hi>Jacob,</hi> which is a ſort of fighting
and oppoſing his ſtrength to <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſtrength, and he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
trying and tempting reaſon to <hi>Jacob, Let me go, for
its dawning;</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> oppoſeth his violence on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<hi>I will not let thee go until thou bleſs me.</hi> And the
Beloved is wreſtling to win away, after long abſence and
much painful ſeeking, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. but the Spouſe offers
violence on the contrary with all her ſtrength, <hi>I held him,
and would not let him go, until I brought him to my mothers
houſe, and unto the chambers of her that conceived me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Its ſit to meet a thirſt of the Lords Spirit in a flowing
of feeling with a thirſt of faith; when Chriſt ſaith to
<hi>Thomas, John 20. 27. Reach hither thy finger, and behold
my hand; and reach hither thy hand and thruſt it into my
ſide;</hi> this was a great condeſcenſion of Chriſt in beſtowing
on him a flowing of feeling; and <hi>Thomas</hi> anſwers it with
a ſtrong act of the application of faith, <hi>My Lord, and my
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. When ſtrong convictions come upon the ſpirit we are
to yield our hearty aſſent to him. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 54. the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion
and the watchers of Chriſt ſeeing the earth-quake
and other wonders from heaven, ſay, <gap reason="foreign">

this was a righteous man: but ah, he calls and we anſwer

boſome.</p>

order their own hearts under heavenly diſpoſitions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the telling of this to God is a ſeeking help from him
to improve theſe diſpoſitions. <hi>Peter</hi> cannot make uſe of
the glory of Chriſts transfiguration which he ſaw, except
grace help (in a manner) glory, and the Lord inable <hi>Peter</hi>

new heart, or to guide and uſe well the heaven of a fixed
heart and ſuch heavenly diſpoſition at the Kings banquet
of wine, when he gives the hidden manna and the white
ſtone; when Chriſts banner over you is love, and his left
hand under the head, and the right embracing you, there
is then, if ever, need to pray; and Chriſt is our precedent
in this when he was transfigured, and in that heaven, ſo as
he ſeemed to be beyond praying, in a ſtate of praiſing, yet
he prays <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 29. and then there is need of watching;
yea, a believer is to pray, in a good ſenſe, to be delivered
from the evil of our prayers, and from the ſinful abuſing
of ſpiritual acts of a renewed heart from the evil of the
flowings of free grace and heavenly diſpoſitions, ſo to
ſpeak, and therefore ſhould we tremble for fear that our
ſinful abuſe of the impreſſions of the Spirit and heavenly
diſpoſitions move not the Lord to hide his face from his
own ſhinings of grace, and darken his own Sun, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloud
his noon-day beams, and rays of light and love;
and who knows that God may mar his own feaſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the table before the believer eat, becauſe he was
ſinfully wanton at the ſight of dainties, and prayed not
humbly that Chriſt would bleſs his coming down to his
garden, and his banqueting with his Spouſe. <hi>Pſalm 141.
David</hi> prays for his own prayers: its a great art to carry
equally the running over cup of conſolation, or to guide
the comforts of the Spirit: when the man is high, the head
is giddy. Pſalm 77. 6, 7. <hi>I will offer in his tabernacle ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of praiſe, I will ſing, yea I will ſing praiſes to the Lord:</hi>
this hath been a warmly condition of his ſpirit, therefore
he follows it with prayer, <hi>v. 7. Hear, O Lord, when I cry
with my voice.</hi> The body being warm and ſweating, there's
need to take heed that cold get not into the heart.</p>
               <p>2. To tell the Lord of our fixedneſs of heart is a ſort of
in aging of him to perfect his own new building, and to
ſend rain and ſummer warmneſs on his own ſowing, and to
perfect what he hath begun; and its a ſecret praying that
God would make an eik to his own work, that he would
give influences of grace, and would be pleaſed to milk
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:119064:163"/>
out holy actings, <hi>willing and doing</hi> out of holy diſpoſitions.
Pſalm 119.<note place="margin">The Lords giving of grace laies bands on him to give more grace and to add new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences to old.</note> 35. <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy precepts,
for therein do I delight.</hi> If the Lord give freely of grace
a diſpoſition to delight in his precepts, he will alſo give
grace to walk in his paths: he that made the plant, creates
the tree and the fruit; he who made the vine-tree, makes
the Summer-ſun to nouriſh it. <hi>v. 159. Conſider how I love
thy precepts; quicken me, O Lord, according to thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
The Lord who gives the life of love, and a warmly
diſpoſition of heart to the precepts of God, muſt alſo give
more quickning to that life: he that brings the ſown corn
to a blade, brings it to an ear of corn, and to be bread:
the ſaving work of grace is one piece, one building, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
walls, and covering; its one growing tree, root,
bulk and branch, one compleat new man: Doth the Lord
of free grace create half a new man, or rear up half a new
building? No; grace is grace is grace going on and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing,
till it be reaped grace, and ſo glory.</p>
               <p>3. He tells the Lord of his fixed heart by way of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
and praiſe, as <hi>Pſalm 131. Lord, my heart is not
haughty:</hi> he lays before the Lord the depth of the mercy
of heavenly diſpoſitions, and of a fixed and prepared heart,
though he was at the mouth and entry of death; the cave
was like to be his burial place, being chaſed for his life into
it, yet he tells the Lord he feared no evil in the valley of
death.</p>
               <p>Hence 1. Try the diſpoſition of the heart, ſee what
hearts ye can bring out before the Lord; its true, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
thief could not, as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſay, <hi>Lord, I have
walked before thee with a perfect heart;</hi> or as Paul 2 <hi>Tim.
4. 7, 8. I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my
courſe, I have kept the faith;</hi> yet the crown is laid for love,
and ſuch as love his appearance, though all cannot wind
up to be ſuch fighting ſouldiers as <hi>Paul</hi> was:<note place="margin">What a heart the repenting thief, and what an heart <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> brought out before the Lord in his dying.</note> the repenting
thiefs flock was ſmall, his race ſhort, yet what he wanted
of inherent grace that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had, he had it
of free righteouſneſs, and Chriſt crucified was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
of both. <hi>David</hi> brings not out his fixed heart in
his extream danger, as building his peace on it; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:119064:163"/>
of works on juſtification and peace is not cauſative,
no more then the poor bride can ſay ſhe hath put a debt
upon the bride-groom to love her with marriage love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe wears his golden chains, his bracelets and jewels;
its the bridegrooms comlineſs that he puts upon her: nor
can roſes and lillies ſay, our Creator is our debtor, oweth
us love becauſe we are ſubjects bearing his colours, ſmell,
vertue, and beauty of the Creator: What would the roſe
be if the Creator ſhould take all from it he gave to it? We
know ſuch a rock to be covered with water, therefore its
full ſea; here is ſmoke, therefore here is fire: And ah!
what a heart in death can the unrenewed man bring forth
before the Lord? except he ſay, <hi>Lord, I was never in Chriſt;
Lord, I never wept for ſin; Lord, I never did a good work
for Chriſt,</hi> but all for my ſelf; Lord, I propheſied in thy
name, but I was never born again, but hated all thoſe that
were born again.</p>
               <p>2. How ſtrongly may the believer argue who hath any
heavenly fixedneſs of heart, or any thing of Chriſt in him?
Its a ſort of holy obligation (with reverence) that he ſhall
bring forth to acting all his own holy diſpoſitions; it ſpeaks
an ingaging of holy unchangeableneſs, that he ſhall perfect
the good work he hath begun; but be not ye lazy, and do
not ye ſleep, and ſay, God ſhall do of all his grace; that is
a ſtrong argument that the man who habitually uſes ſuch
logick hath nothing to do with Chriſt: Ah, the Spirit will
do whether I will or not; and in the mean time thou liveſt
a ſenſual beaſt; know that thou but foments lies of the
holy Ghoſt. <hi>Jude</hi> puts theſe two together, <hi>v. 19. ſenſual,
not having the Spirit:</hi> and before, <hi>v. 8. Likewiſe all theſe
filthy dreamers defile the fleſh:</hi> dreaming and filthineſs are
conjoyned. Men dream the influences of grace ſhall go
along with their diſpoſitions for good, and they are but
natural diſpoſitions at the beſt; and the <hi>Lord</hi> never ſaid
he would perfect nature, and finiſh works of nature that
are begun in ſwiniſh dreamers: woful ſecure dreaming
deſtroys external profeſſors; men will not awake, neither
are they afraid of that condition, but a trembling profeſſor
is the ſureſt and ſafeſt profeſſor.</p>

               <p>The fourth point in the text tells us what this fixedneſs

the reſt of the characters and properties of the heavenly

as ſinging of praiſe, and awaking of his gift and grace,
which flow from holy diſpoſitions: hence the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

               <p>1.<note place="margin">2. Property of holy diſpoſitions</note> Once grace brings forth another, and ſo holy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
holy actings; faith and truſting in God brings

unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord.</hi> The diſpoſition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving

therefore I ſpake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. A diſpoſition of loving God brings forth praying;
Pſalm 18. 1. <hi>I will love thee, O Lord, my ſtrength. 3. I will
call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praiſed. Hannah,
Jonah, Hezekiah, David</hi> the afflicted ſoul, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 102. gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
ſad and heavy, pray and call on God in that caſe.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The diſpoſition of felt mercy brings forth praiſes;
Pſal.</hi> 30. 5. O Lord, thou haſt brought up my soul from the
grave— <hi>v. 3. Hence that,</hi> Sing unto the Lord, O ye Saints of
his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holineſs.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>David</hi>'s joyful diſpoſition to glory in the Lord brings
forth his dancing before the Ark with all his might, and
his conſtancy therein to be yet more vile before the Lord,
what ever <hi>Michol</hi> ſaid to the contrary;<note place="margin">Diſpoſitions ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual are ſeeds of holy actings.</note> and this is moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

make them more nimble and active in wreſtling.</p>
               <p>2. The very intention &amp; apointment of <hi>God</hi> ſpeaks ſo much:
<hi>God</hi> hath ordained heavenly diſpoſitions for heavenly actings
as he hath appointed the plant to be a tree, the ſeed to be
growing corn &amp; bread; the Lord ſends a praying diſpoſition
on <hi>David,</hi> as a ſeed of praying; &amp; a praiſing diſpoſition that

though he was a man of a meek diſpoſition, that he breaks
the two Tables of ſtone containing the written law, when
he heard of the peoples worſhipping of the golden calfe;

brings forth a thorn-tree, and the thiſtle-ſeed a thiſtle;
it's clear in <hi>Cain,</hi> the Phariſees: So gracious diſpoſitions
produce acts of love, faith, hope, godly ſorrow, works of
righteouſneſſe and mercy. As wine-grapes grow out of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:119064:166"/>

diſpoſitions in Chriſt were ſtrong habits of grace; and the
running-over fountain and fulneſſe of the holy Ghoſt, the

that accompany the fulneſſe of the holy Ghoſt, is a very

where there comes out <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi>
leaping for joy, fulneſs of aſſurance, like a ſhip with full ſails
and full wind. As fulneſſe of love and of all ſpiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of tenderneſſe muſt be in the bowels and heart of
Chriſt, who ſends out acts of enduring pain, blood, ſhame,
death, horrour of wrath, and the curſe of a revenging God
for ſin. The love of Chriſt needs no exhortation to acts of
love; nor is there need of earneſt requeſt and intreaties to
the fire to caſt out heat, and the Sun to give light: need you
exhort an extreme pined-away ſick man to be pained and
weak, or requeſt the Sunne to ſhine? How mighty and
ſtrong are the acts of longing and languiſhing after Chriſt
that flow from love-ſickneſſe? and then what ſuitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of grace muſt goe along with theſe actings? what
pullings of ſtrength to pluck up mighty cedars? what an
influence of love in God <hi>to bear up all things,</hi> and ſo to bear
mountaines, to bear torments, to bear new deaths? O
what a mighty arm of omnipotent grace, <hi>Col. 1. 11. Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened

know ye his ſtrength and his mighty puls that have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
many?</p>
               <p>3. When the diſpoſition of grace is on, a ſmall object
brings forth ſuitable actings; Chriſt lets out one caſt of
his eye upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>he went out and wept bitterly;</hi> a
ſmall ſhake of the tree brings down ripe apples, they fall of
their own accord: a gentle quiet gale of wind will cauſe a
light ſwift veſſel to make twice as much way as a huge ſhip:
a rent in the garment of a deadly enemy ſeemes a ſmall
tranſgreſſion; but to <hi>David</hi> it hath a mighty ſmiting of
heart. We are afraid to come under the pull of Chriſts

13. Some will not be cured, and are averſe from being
drawn to come to Chriſt and be ſaved; and an hating of
meanes is a virtual hating of the ſweet and ſpecial alluring
attractions of grace; and we value actings of grace at ſo
low a rate, as if we could doe all our alone by pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

pained for the want of Chriſt in his comfortable preſence,
who was now to her feeling abſent. Here is a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dialogue between the Spouſe and her companions, who
are leſs experienced with the way of Chriſt then ſhe; there
was a more comfortable dialogue betwixt Chriſt and the
Spouſe, but ſhe ſlighted that, and therefore now is glad to
ſpeak with the ſervant when the Maſter is away.</p>
               <p>In the words there is the Spouſes ſpeech, containing a
charge, that the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> carry a meſſage to
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The particular meſſage,</hi> I am ſick of love.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Church did formerly of late confer with Chriſt,
and refuſed to open to him when he was knocking and
ſhowring down influences of grace; now ſhe is glad to
confer,</p>
               <p>1. With the ſmiting watchmen, where ſhe found little
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. Next with private Chriſtians in Aſſemblies. This is
a mean of the Lords ſhowring down of influences in the
publick and domeſtick, or leſs publick meetings of his
Saints; for ordinances of all ſorts that are appointed of
Chriſt, they drop down ſavoury and ſeaſonable dews. The
Lord writes in his book the ſavoury conferences of ſuch as

               <p>1. The Lord owns ſuch as are his.</p>

as many coales in one heap make a great fire. Nor

the breathings of the ſpirit are not ſtrong,<note place="margin">Senſe is proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then faith.</note> the wind
is not fair: But faith is not content to look through the
key-hole, and ſee the half of his face, and is humbler: Ah,
may I but hear of him, or kiſs his feet and weep over them,
touch but the skirts or the hem of the garments of Chriſt,
and it is good. Some muſt be feaſted with the King, taken
into his houſe of wine, embraced in his armes, or there is
no peace, but fretting: But here faith was commended as
great, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. who would be well pleaſed with the crums
that fall from the table; nay it was humble, and hungry,
and yet lively faith, <hi>Luke 15. 18, 19. Father; I have ſinned,
I am no more worthy to be called thy ſon, make me as one of
thy hired ſervants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Is not ſpiritual hunger humble? <hi>David</hi> had a great
room in the houſe, and was a type of the chief corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,
and prepared in abundance for the building of the
houſe, and was a man according to Gods heart; but when
he was baniſhed, ah, how happy was a door keeper in his
houſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 3. The room of a ſparrow or a ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But are not love-diſpoſitions now under deſertion and
the Lords withdrawing, the ſtronger and more powerful in
Chriſt?</p>
               <p>1. The very withdrawing of Chriſt, as touching his end,
is mercy, and requires ſtrong miſſing: Chriſts hard pulling
to be away, ſuites ſtrong holding on our part, <hi>I will not
let thee goe;</hi> for there is ſtrength and bones in love to reſiſt
a contrary.</p>
               <p>2. Diſpoſitions heavenly in the affections, make a huge
deal of noiſe and tumult, as here there is pathetick charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to tell Chriſt her love-ſickneſs under deſertion; and
it's good when deſires for Chriſt under abſence are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt:
that faith humbly and ſubmiſſively waiting on in
hope, is ſtronger alſo when it makes leaſt noiſe and tumult;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:119064:170"/>
as the deepeſt river without rumbling runs quietly down
the banks. But</p>
               <p>1. Learn to husband well love-feaſts of nearer and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preſence; believe for the time to come; pray for the
time to come; hear and obſerve for the time to come;
lay up love in ſtore for times of ſpiritual ſcarcity: Ah, we
waſte diſpenſations of the love of Chriſt, and ſwallow them
over without humble believing, and godly watching and
fear, and waſte prodigally feaſts of love: we then learn to
grow in experimental knowledge, in ſolidity of believing;
ſenſe is wanton, and feeds it ſelf, and we neglect faith and
the growth thereof.</p>

and inſpirations of the ſpirit, to make the letter of
the word effectual, is an argument of heightning his ſin of
adultery and murther; and he layes bonds on his own
heart to improve influences, <hi>Pſal. 119. 33 Teach me, O Lord,

lay bands on his people to be plants of righteouſneſs; and
his blowing with the North and South wind of his ſpirit
upon his garden requires the duty of the flowing of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and their thriving; and the ſpirit of the Fathers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
calls for bringing forth of more fruit; and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
leading requires that we ſhould willingly follow ſuch a
guide; and the Spirits teaching requires that we be docile
and ſpiritual; and the Spirits convincing, that we bow
and yield to his conviction. The Spouſe then under the

               <p>2. Can one call on God, or cry to him <hi>Abba Father,</hi>
who never laid hold on him as a Father? Know then that
unbelief is an iron door betwixt Chriſt and many who
pray, or rather cry to him: for many pray to an unknown
Chriſt. Could <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtle with an unfound and farre-off

praying. The legion of devils in the poſſeſſed man, <hi>Mat.</hi>
8. ſpake words, and made a ſuit to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but they prayed
not: <hi>Davids</hi> enemies <hi>cry, even to the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 18. 41.
but pray not.<note place="margin">How to judge of the nature of praying.</note> The damned in hell ſpeak words to God,
but they blaſpheme and quarrel with holy juſtice, but pray

               <p>2. The loweſt diſcernable breathing out of a ſigh through
the holy Ghoſt, hath as well the nature of prayer, as an
eighth part of an ounce of gold partaketh of the nature of
gold no leſs then a mountain of gold.</p>
               <p>3. The groaning of the Spirit of the Lord is in every
praying, and therefore let none be beguiled, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of the Spirit; for no man can ſay that <hi>Jeſus is the
Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 3. It's not want of
charity, nor unneceſſary diſcouraging of any, to ſay a thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:119064:171"/>
is a thiſtle, and not a roſe, a thorn is a thorn, and not
a vine-tree. Where the ſpirit of grace joynes no influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſaving grace, can you call that ſpeaking to God a
work of ſaving grace? It were good men were not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to treaſure up pieces of braſs and copper, and ſuffered
to dream they have a treaſure of gold.</p>
               <p>4. Senſe of deadneſs in prayer oftner ſpeaks the life of
prayer; and a godly ſenſe of blindneſs is a large meaſure

Father made him ours by free gift, the withdrawing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences.
2. The ſhining and ſmiling. 3. the ſuſpending
of influences needful for the act of feeling is phyſical and
real. The Lords outward diſpenſations make no change of
1. Covenant-intereſt, the Covenant is eternal; the Lords
abſence from his own is not eternal. Nor is there change
in relation of intereſt; no diſtance of miles, no frowning
or hiding of his face makes Chriſt leave off to be a husband,
a head, a ranſom-payer, a Father.</p>
               <p>2. Faith layes hold on right and on propriety. When
the heirs poſſeſſion is ſuſpended, and an out-lawed heir, here
is an heir; the uſe of the breathings and influences is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;
the mill ſtands and grindeth not, the ground is
plowed; yet the ſame Lord and heritor of mill and land
remaines. Hang not your rights, writs, and charters upon
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:119064:171"/>
your ſenſe, or upon the ups and downs of the Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation;
nor doth a believers heaven ſtand in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
out-lettings of the Lords free grace, or his withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
though the more of the Spirit any hath, the more
doth their ſpiritual life and being depend upon the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of grace; as all things that grow and have life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the influences of the Sun and Heaven, trees; and
plants,<note place="margin">The life of grace depends on influences of grace.</note> and flowers, and herbs, ſuffer a ſort of death by the
departure of the Sun from them, and they begin to live
again when in the ſpring the Sun moves near toward them;
ſo are the out-goings and gracious influences of the Sun of
righteouſneſſe to the renewed ones, in whom is the life of
Chriſt: for Chriſt keeps in being his own life, and cannot
but keep it in being and operation, <hi>Rom. 8. 10. And if
Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin: but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is life becauſe of righteouſneſs.</hi> v. 11. <hi>But if the Spirit of
him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you; he that
raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal
bodies by the Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> See both the life
of grace in this life is kept in being by the Spirit; and the
life of the body, which ſhall be made ſpiritual in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
is reſtored again by the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. Deſerted ſoules under the Lords withdrawing would
neither caſt away their confidence, nor be too ſecurely
comforted when the Lord withdrawes (to ſpeak to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)

               <p>4. The act of Atonement made by Chriſt, accepted by

all whole and untouched under deſertion: For our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

land and ſhore ſail not, and move not, though the green
Sailer judgeth ſo, becauſe he and the veſſel are in ſail.</p>
               <p>2. Nor is it ſafe to ſleep, and lie and be ſecure, when the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:119064:172"/>
Spirit in his flowings withdraws. It ſpeaks ſome out-caſt,
or out-lawry; and the child ſhould not be quiet, when he
knows the Father is diſpleaſed: nor would Miniſters heal
them with all Goſpel and hony, and lay aſide all Law; for
what cures help the diſeaſe and the firſt fever, the ſame are

Pſal. 88. Pſal.</hi> 80. 7, 19.</p>
               <p>3. It imports the feeling of that pain. The ſecond act
of ſickneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 12. as to the pain through want of
feeling and enjoying God. 1. Two things are here.</p>
               <p>1. The want of the life, though the believer be ſtill lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
choſen, redeemed, tranſlated from death to life; but
the Lord, who can put a check-lock and an iron bar on all
our comforts, withdrawes, and lets the Spouſe ſwoon, and
ſtayes not the heart with flagons of wine and apples, that is,
with the effectual applying of the word of promiſe, by which
the heart is eſtabliſhed or ſtrengthened, <hi>Jam. 5. 8. Rom.</hi> 1.
11. and by which we ſtay and reſt our ſelves upon the word
the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 6, 7, 8. Acts</hi> 14. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>2. There is here ſuſpending and the want of the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Spirit the comforter, which is the other want.
Now the Lord hath holy and neceſſary reaſons why he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
influences to the feeling and knowledge of theſe rich
comforts.</p>
               <p>1. His holy Soveraignty. Now ſoveraignty never acts
ſeparated from infinite wiſedome, when it's moſt abſtract
from the object; as in making a world, or not creating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:119064:172"/>
thing; in ordaining of the ſame lump, ſome to be veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of honour, and ſome of diſhonour. There is a reaſon
of the object, but never a reaſon concludent, or ſo obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
binding and limiting the Lord; but the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
to wit, no created world, no ordaining of ſome to
honour and ſome to diſhonour, ſhould be as good. As we
ſee in thouſands and millions of poſſible worlds of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, other Angels, and other creatures which he can
create.</p>
               <p>2. Infinite wiſedome judges it fitter that old <hi>Jacob</hi> weep
and be not comforted that <hi>Joſeph</hi> be ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> then
be a rejoycing free Patriarch at home; that the man
Chriſt lie before him with tears and ſtrong cries, then that
it be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>3. To infinite wiſedom it is clear, that a creature and a
ſinful creature cannot ſo meaſure out ſenſe and comfort as
the only wiſe God; as it is not ſo fit all the members of
the houſe, ſervants, children, ſtrangers ſhould be their own
ſtewards of the bread, wine, and dainties of the houſe,
ſpices, ointments, myrrhe, aloes, and caſſia, as that there
ſhould be one wiſe and faithful ſervant over the family, that
all and every one hand over head run not to the heap.<note place="margin">Withdrawing of comforts come from wiſe and holy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in God.</note>
Therefore is the Lord to be adored in his wiſedome, as
much in withdrawing influences of ſenſe and comforts, as
in beſtowing them: Judge if all the fatherleſs infants, and
pupils, and minors of the earth were left to be fathers and
tutors to themſelves, how would it be with their inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
If all the ſick on earth were their own only Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
whether old or young, ſhould it not be ill with the
health of many? Some cures are worſe then the diſeaſes:
there is a ſickly and unnatural thirſt on ſome perſons ſick
of a feaver;<note place="margin">The wiſedome of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing that we depend on him.</note> it would be ill with them if either abundance
of wine, or a fountain of water were at their bed-ſide:
the choiſe and elective faculty of the ſick mans mind, is
often as ſick as his body. Let me not then be my own
comforter, but let the Spirit of infinite wiſedome enjoy his
own office, and be the other comforter, whom the Father
ſends in Chriſts name.</p>

diſeaſes are ſo diſeaſes, as ſome fluxes and ſome fevers, as
they are alſo medicinal helps of health, and healthy and
lively diſeaſes. The Lord, and nature under the Lord,
gives excellent medicine: who knows but <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
botch, which was otherwiſe deadly, was a natural
help to his fifteen yeares health and life which followed?
Look not on the holy Lord when he is acting as a Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
as if he were acting as a Judge. Want with good will
the ſenſe and comfort that the Lord would have you want
in his infinite wiſedome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But whatever we pray for, we are to pray for it
with ſubmiſſion, and a reſerve to holy ſoveraignty, as well as we
are to pray for ſenſe and comfort?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a doubt and a great one, whether with alike
ſubmiſſion we are to pray for that which is <hi>bonum honeſtum,</hi>
and a gracious duty, as we are to pray for <hi>bonum jucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
that which is pleaſant, or the reward of a duty:

conjoyned an humble ſubmitting to the Lords denying of
ſaving influences, without a ſinful counter-working of his
holy will now revealed, or without charging folly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
dealing upon the Lord. For,</p>
               <p>1. His own grace is his own grace, and he is free of all
debt and obligation to give gracious influences to Angels
or men; as alſo grace to uſe the meaſure of grace given, is
rather to be ſought then a large meaſure.</p>
               <p>2. There is in love-ſickneſſe for Chriſt a weakneſs of the
ſoul,<note place="margin">A love-ſickneſs from the want of Chriſt.</note> and a fainting for the want of Chriſt; and this may
come from the apprehended curſe and anger of God for
ſin, which is a diſeaſe after converſion that the child of
God may be ſick of. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 6. 1. <hi>Lord rebuke me
not in thine anger.</hi> Pſal. 38. 2. <hi>Thine arrows ſtick faſt in me,
thine hand preſſeth me ſore. 3. There is no ſoundneſs in my
fleſh becauſe of thine anger, neither is there any reſt in my
bones becauſe of my ſin. 4. For mine iniquities are gone over
mine head: as a heavy burthen they are too heavy for me.</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:119064:174"/>
Pſalm 90. 7. <hi>We are conſumed by thine anger, and by thy
wrath we are troubled; thou haſt ſet our iniquities before
thee; our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>Rom. 8. 14. For ye have not received the Spirit of
bondage again to fear,</hi> is all one with this, we ought not
to receive it, or we have not received the habit, but are
and may be under the temptation and actual aſſaults of
that ſpirit of law-bondage. Now in this ſickneſs in the
renewed ſoul, this is wrong, that the conſcience goes back
to its old priſon,<note place="margin">As touching pardon we have peace with God <hi>jure &amp; de facto,</hi> but as touching the blot and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of ſin, we ought not to have peace with ſin or with our ſelves, as under that blot.</note> and comes again under the ſpirit of
bondage: for Chriſt having made our peace by the blood
of attonement on the Croſs, there is ground of peace with
God, as touching the Law-debt of ſin; otherwiſe we fail
againſt the ſufficiency of the paid ranſome: but as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the blot of ſin, we are never to have peace that way,
and ſo it is good that the ſoul is troubled that way; and
that the world is whole and needs not the Phyſitian Chriſt,
is the death of the world and a worſe diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Hence the third; it's alſo good that the ſoul is pained
for the want of righteouſneſs; thoſe ingredients make
love-ſickneſs a ſpiritual diſpoſition for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>1. That the ſoul is ſick and pained for the want of ſaving
influences.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Ingredients of love-ſickneſs.</note> It is pained with a ſpiritual burden; a carnal man
cannot be pained with a ſpiritual burden, no more then a
horſe or an Elephant can be ſad for the want of a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſoul, or a ſucking child weep becauſe he hath not
learning, and the knowledge of a Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>3. Sickneſs is a pain and diſtemper through want of
health, and argues a conſtitution of life, and this ſickneſs
is a fainting and weakneſs of the ſoul for the want of
Chriſt, he being the health and life of the ſoul; and that
ſpeaks an excellent ſoul-conſtitution, that the ſoul lives,
breathes, enjoys its beſt being of life, and the moſt vigorous
and ſtrong life in Chriſt, and when Chriſt is away in his
ſweeteſt operations of felt love and intimate embracings,
flamings and out-lettings of free grace, the ſoul is deadly
ſick, and there is no cool for this fever but the ſhining and
lovely ſpeaking of the Phyſitian Chriſt: love hath killed
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:119064:175"/>
ſome becauſe they could not enjoy the party loved. <hi>Elies</hi>
daughter in Law not only is ſick, but died becauſe the glory
was departed.</p>
               <p>4. The fits of this Ague are ſtrongeſt when the Lord is
away; cold paineth moſt in the abſence of heat; ſickneſs
in the want of eaſe and life: hence <hi>ſeeking him whom the
ſoul loves</hi> in all means, and ſeeking him with care, <hi>Saw ye
him</hi> (O watchmen) <hi>whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> So there is
panting, as is in ſickmen, or chaſed wild beaſts dying a thirſt;
the fleſh and the ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble ſoul crying out for the living
God. Pſalm 42. 1, 2. <hi>My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for
the courts of the Lord.</hi> In this love-ſickneſs fainting and
ſwooning are neer to dying: the moiſture turned into the
drouth of Summer: leanneſs of body ſpeaks ſickneſs; <hi>My
heart and my fleſh cry out for the living God;</hi> when the
pain of the ſtone, and childbirth pain put ſome to ſhouting
the ſickneſs muſt be vehement; ſhouting and crying out
of pain, <hi>O pain of pains, I want Jeſus Chriſt, my ſoul is
away;</hi> this cauſeth ſpiritual diſtempers and doubts; this
ſickneſs keepeth the ſick perſon waking; there is no ſleep,
there is no rejoycing: The woman cannot ſleep, but riſeth
early in the morning, and weeps on Angels and men, <hi>John
20. 1, 12, 13. Ah, they have taken away my Lord, and I know
not where they have laid him.</hi> It was a branch of this
ſickneſs in the man Chriſt, though of a far other kind, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God to forſake him, he <hi>with tears and ſtrong cries</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moans
himſelf to God.</p>
               <p>It's a wicked diſpoſition 1. to think we ſhall do well
enough without influences, and the breathing of the Spirit.
<hi>David</hi> is in the miſt, and miſſes the way when he prays in
his blindneſs, <hi>Lord, lead me;</hi> and miſſes life and ſome
degrees of it, when he prays ſo often for quickning: the
Artificer that wants his tools and inſtruments can work
none.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">The pain of love-ſickneſs.</note> When a ſoul can live contentedly and joyfully and
wants God, and lives fat and rejoycingly 60. or 70. years
without Chriſt, and never miſſed Chriſt; how few know
this ſickneſs? Eſpecially 1. The pain of hunger and thirſt
which is deſtructive to life; the fruitful earths diſeaſe and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:119064:175"/>
pain in a manner is want of rain and long drouth; as <hi>Pſal.
63. 2. Pſal. 14. 4, 6. Lam.</hi> 2. 20. this plague brings forth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
of ſpirit, ſtretching out of the hands when one
is a dying and cannot ſpeak, the eating of young children;
the hinde for drouth and want of graſs calves in the field,
and forſakes her young ones, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 5. Few are put to
ſhifts of all ſorts for want of Chriſt. 2. Few know the
ſorrow and ſadneſs of an abſent husband: every wind is
bleſſed in the wifes thought that blows where he is; every
ſhip that is thought to carry him home is a ſhip of deſire;
the earth is loved that he walks on; the houſe bleſſed that
he lodges in; and when the husband is dead, what mourning
does the wife of youth make over his grave? Ah, few know
heart-breaking and ſorrow becauſe Chriſt is gone;<note place="margin">The righting of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the damned.</note> this

deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory
of his power, 2 Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9. were for the want of the ſaving
preſence of Chriſt, which makes holy as well as happy.
3. Impatiency of deſire is paining, how long ſhall the
Lord hide his face? when ſhall I ſee him? <hi>come, even ſo
come;</hi> there is much paining impatience in that prayer
for the marriage day in ſuch as long for his appearance,
<hi>Cant. 8. 14. Make haſte my beloved, and be thou like to a
Roe, or a young Hart upon the mountains of ſpices.</hi> So as the
ſong began with deſire of Chriſts firſt coming to kiſs her
with the kiſſes of his mouth, in Chriſts more bright ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in the Goſpel, preached by himſelf in the fleſh,
and his Servants the Apoſtles, Paſtors, and Teachers; ſo
it endeth with a ſtrong deſire of his ſecond coming, that he
would come with ſpeed, as the <hi>young harts,</hi> which flee for
ſuccour to the mountains where ſpices grow, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 17. as
there are divers words expreſſing this impatient deſire, every
hour ſeeming a day, and every day a year to love-ſickneſs,
longing for that day the dawning whereof is the eternal
celebrating of the ſolemn marriage betwixt Chriſt and the
Bride the Lambs wife without parting for ever, <hi>Rev. 22. 12.
Behold I come quickly. 17. And the Spirit and the Bride ſay,
Come. And let him that heareth, ſay, Come.</hi> And v. 20. <hi>Surely I

comes ſpeak loves deſire upon the Bridegrooms ſide, and
upon the Brides ſide in love-ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>1. How ſweet is it when pain it ſelf makes prayers to
Chriſt? and want ſpeaks to riches, death and deadneſs to
him who is the reſurrection and the life.</p>
               <p>2. Yet ſenſe alone ſpeaking often miſtakes and chides,
yea, impatient ſenſe, miſtaking the wiſe and holy diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of God; for Chriſts abſence is wiſe, but not unkind
and void of love; he does not ever abſent himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is angry, or hates ſuch from whom he withdraws
his influences,<note place="margin">Saith above ſenſe.</note> but to increaſe hunger and lively deſire.</p>
               <p>And 3. Holy miſſing of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. Careful ſeeking, <hi>Cant. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. Cant.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>And 3. Strong deſires of love-ſickneſs are more ſolid
and edifying graces then feeling, ſenſe, and comfort of his
preſence as we uſe them; and theſe are often ſtronger
when Chriſt is abſent then preſent, and ſo the influences
of the ſpirit that accompany miſſing of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. Seeking of him.</p>
               <p>3. And impatient longing for him are more uſeful then
influences that accompanies ſenſe. See how lively they are
in <hi>David</hi> when he wants Sanctuary-preſence, <hi>Pſal. 42. 1, 2.
Pſal. 63. 1, 2. Pſal.</hi> 84. 1, 2, 3, 4. In the Spouſe, <hi>Cant. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.

never brings forth ſuch a love-ſong, ſo highly extolling
Chriſt, as faith under abſence.</p>
               <p>3. Strong believing and reſting upon the promiſes when
the Lord hides himſelf under love-ſickneſs and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
wrath, fetch ſweeter influences then ſenſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
as may be clear in the godly, who 1. move queſtions,
yet ſo as love and faith encline moſt to the edifying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,

under a cloud believeth he will not caſt off for ever: <hi>and
will he be favourable no more? 8. Is his mercy clean gone
for ever? doth his promiſe fail for evermore? 9. Hath God
forgotton to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his tender
mercies?</hi> In theſe queſtions the fleſh and unbelieving ſenſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:119064:176"/>
have a great hand; the queſtion in ſenſe includes this,
<hi>Is the Lord the Lord?</hi> and pure faith never moves ſuch a
queſtion as that, but the aim and ſcope of faith is to beat
down ſuch queſtions; and the ſenſe of faith in theſe is,
the Lord hath not caſt off for ever; the Lord will not leave
off to be gracious for ever and ever; his mercy is not clean
gone; his promiſe and covenant is everlaſting, and fails
not.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Under the ſenſe of wrath, faith eying the nature of
God revealed in his word corrects ſenſe.</hi> Lam. 3. 8. When
I cry and ſhout he ſhutteth out my prayers. <hi>Ah, no,</hi> v. 25.
The Lord is good to them that wait for him, to the ſoul that
ſeeketh him: <hi>that is a harbour in place of a rock.</hi> 2. He
was unto me as a Bear lying in wait, and as a Lion in ſecret
places. <hi>Ah, not ſo.</hi> v. 24. The Lord is my portion, ſaith my

influences of grace under abſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. <hi>What is thy beloved more then another beloved?</hi> This
is not the ſpeech of enemies, for they diſcern her <hi>to be
the faireſt among women,</hi> and ſee heavenly beauty and grace
in the Spouſe.</p>

of grace, the ebbing and flowing of ſpirits, the breathings
of Chriſt, the Kings chambers, the houſe of wine; theſe
are imaginations: preach fundamentals, faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

are not neceſſary, obliterate them out of the

               <p>What is thy Beloved?</p>
               <p>All profeſſors ſee not with one meaſure of light: the
Spouſe is a wonder to many profeſſors not ſo acquainted

               <argument>
                  <p>What may be done in the uſing of means, hearing the
word by us, to fetch influences, if there be any truth
in that, Deus facienti quod in ſe eſt non negat
gratiam. God denies not grace to the man who
does what he can. Whether doth God command all
uſe of means external or internal, in whole and part?
2. Whether grace be above. 1. The deſire. 2. The
diſpoſition. 3. The prayer. 4. The purchaſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
3. No ſufficient univerſal grace is due to Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians.
4. Martinez de Ripalda abuſeth many
Scriptures to prove ſufficient grace. 5. No Goſpel-promiſe,
no Goſpel-threatning in Scripture concerning
univerſal grace. 6. Sinners are now interdited heirs.
7. The connexion betwixt natural and ſupernatural
acting in converſion. 8. Of the natural providence
of God Creator, and the ſupernatural and Redempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
providence of God by which the choſen are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Whether God commands all uſe of means external and internal, and every part thereof.</note> IT's a queſtion whether the Lord commands the only
meer bulk of the duty, to uſe means, and hear and
read, whether we act in faith or no; certain it is not the
full and plenary intent, ſenſe or purpoſe of any command
of God to enjoyn acts that are maimed, lame, hypocritical.</p>
               <p>1. It's againſt the perfection of the command; <hi>The Law
of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul, Pſalm</hi> 19. 7. Not
only extenſively, but alſo intenſively, and arreſts the whole
man, and all the thoughts and powers of the ſoul, and the
principles of the moral actions.</p>
               <p>2. The Lord forbids rather, and rebukes ſuch an uſe of
means, as includes ſinful defects in the principles, manner
and end. <hi>Pſalm. 50. 16. But unto the wicked God ſaith, What
haſt thou to do to declare my ſtatutes?</hi> Iſa. 1. 12. <hi>Who required
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:119064:179"/>
this thing at your hand, that ye ſhould tread in my Courts</hi>
in the way and manner that you do. So Chriſt rebukes
the Phariſees praying and alms-giving with the blowing
of a trumpet in ſo doing, and ſhews them they have no
reward for ſuch works, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. therefore there was
no reward promiſed to ſuch works.</p>
               <p>3. Hypocrites, as touching the manner of their doing,
do counterwork their own work as touching the ſubſtance
of the duty commanded: vain-glory, hypocriſie-like
poiſon, and death in the pot pollutes the action as Ink and
mire vitiates a cup of wine being mixed therewith; better
it is comparative to do ſomething of the bulk of the duty,
then wholly to omit it, and do nothing leſs or more.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> Both all the good action and every part of it, <hi>totae
actio &amp; totum actionis</hi> falls under the command of God: he
who commands us to hear in faith, and read with believing,
commands us alſo to walk and journey to the place of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and commands us to encline our bodily ears to give
attention of mind to the word, as we hear a moral oration
without wandring of heart, though in theſe (<hi>hear the word
of God, conſider, hear diligently, encline your ears, lay to your
heart what is ſpoken</hi>) God laies the obligation of a divine
command on us, to the phyſical act of walking to the place
of liberal hearing, as to the ſubſtance of the act, and a tie to
far more, even to do the act with all the ſpiritual circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
he who commands his ſervant to go to ſuch a City
fourty miles diſtant, he commands him to go ten miles of
theſe fourty miles alſo, and while the ſervant is moving ten
miles towards the City, he gives obedience in part <hi>pro tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
and in ſo far to his maſters command: hence it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that giving of alms in the ſubſtance of the act, is
neerer in nature to the giving of alms in a ſpiritual Goſpel-way,
then not giving of alms at all, but a cloſing of both
bowels and hand to the ſtarving and famiſhing of the poor.</p>
               <p>To the other queſtion it may be enquired, 1. Whether
grace be above the deſire of nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nature hath no power of getting ſupernatural
gifts by the ſtrength of nature; but nature hath a capacity,
not ſuch an actual deſire, which ſuppoſeth uſe of reaſon
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:119064:180"/>
and diſcourſe to ſupernatural happineſs;<note place="margin">Nature and Grace.</note> a capacity is an
inclination to that which may perfect it; ſo man intends
or enclines toward God, and is unquiet while he find him:
but it's to abuſe all Grammer to call a natural capacity
an inbred appetite, and natural deſire.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Whether grace be above the diſpoſition of nature?</note> Whether grace be above the diſpoſition of nature?</p>
               <p>

of ſin by which a man is dead in ſin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. cannot conſiſt
with a ſweet diſpoſition of nature to get grace; the ſame
wine cannot be both ſweet and ſour; nor is there any
ſweetneſs in ſour and bitter or unrenewed nature.</p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">Whether grace be above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures prayers?</note> Whether the grace of God be above the impetration,
purchaſe and prayers of nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture teacheth us of no prayers by
natures help, but by the Spirit interceeding in the Saints,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. nor of any purchaſe of grace that nature can make;
grace prevenes nature, but nature prevenes not grace.</p>
               <p>4.<note place="margin">Whether grace be above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures merit?</note> Whether grace be above natures merit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It were ſtrange to ſay that nature can of condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
merit grace, ſo as God ſhould be unjuſt if he deny
grace to nature: where is that written? and does not this
make man and nature to make God a debtor? as for the
other merit of congruity, if grace were not above this
merit, we ſhould teach that nature may ſo far act as to
make God a debtor to the mans acting, as God ſhould
fail againſt decency, good manners, courteſie, if he ſhould

as any verſed in the doctrine of grace, and in <hi>Auguſtine,
Hieronymus, Fulgentius,</hi> their works know.</p>
               <p>6. Whether the Lord does infallibly tie grace to works

               <p>6. Whether <hi>Gabr. Vaſquez. 1. part. diſp. 91. q.</hi> 1. 14. doth
upon good grounds defend that rotten opinion of the

               <p>This is not better then the reſt; for it ſuppoſeth that

and earns by its endeavours faith and juſtification; no man
ever yet did what he can.</p>
               <p>Q. 8. Whether <hi>Martinez de Ripalda, Tom. 1. de Ente ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturali
lib. 1. diſp. 20. ſect. 3. ſect. 4. ſect.</hi> 5. ſaith right,
that <hi>God</hi> doth ſo ever confer helps of ſupernatural grace

and its in mens free-will, be they Jews, Chriſtians, or
Pagans, to open and believe; but grace, <hi>ex lege providentiae

               <p>1. <hi>Aſſert.</hi> This rotten principle of the School-men, that
to the man in nature who does what he can, either by the

The blowing of the wind on the garden of delicious flowers
extracts ſweet ſmelling: the firſt three or four throwings

conferring, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. concerning Chriſt crucified, ſeem
cold and indifferent; yea there is much unbelief and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
on the Spirit, <hi>v. 21. We truſted that it ſhould have been
he which ſhould have reſtored Iſrael;</hi> though they ſay he <hi>was
a Prophet mighty in word and deed before God and all the

cold concerning his office as Redeemer, and concerning
his Reſurrection; but they goe on in the conference, and
purſue the duty, though literally, till he begun, <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26,

of <hi>Samaria's</hi> is very literal at the beginning, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerning <hi>Jacobs</hi> well; yet ſhe going on in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
there comes a warmneſſe, and a liking, and a ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the water of life, and a diſcerning of Chriſt to be a
Prophet; and at length a warmneſſe, of faith in believing
him to be Chriſt, and a leaving of the water-pot, and a

Here it is that the firſt three or four ſteps bring not heat

ſtrike the flint oftner then once brings out fire at length;
and when there is a kindled and a fixed habit of grace, and
gracious diſpoſitions, flamings of heavenly diſpoſitions
follow apace: becauſe creation is a mids to the execution
of the decree of predeſtination to life eternal, therefore he
who in predeſtination to life giveth his own to Chriſt, <hi>John
17. 2, 6, 11, 12. v.</hi> 6. hath eſtabliſhed a new ſupernataral

               </p>
               <p>1. As by the firſt fall all things fell. 2. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi>

and deſtroyed all; and the Creation, and the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of heaven and earth was made ſubject to vanity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of mans ſin, and is now as a woman travelling in
birth, crying in pain under corruption and vanitie, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 20, 21, 22. So the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> coming to the throne,
made <hi>a new heaven and a new earth;</hi> and as a Midwife to the
travailing woman, brings forth the birth, the free ſons of
God, &amp; carries on the work in bringing the man Chriſt in
the world; for the man Chriſt is not created and brought
in the world by God ſimply as Creator and Law-giver, by
the covenant of works, but by God as now acting to redeem
the world, and making a new Creation and a new world.</p>
               <p>3. Hence the bleſſing of the creature, and of the earth,
which was under a curſe for mans ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18. is now
from Chriſt, whom <hi>he hath appointed heir of all things,</hi> Heb.

               <p>4. And look, as when a Kings ſon and heir is married,
all the ſervants and Courtiers are cloathed in Scarlet and
gorgeous apparel: So when Chriſt is declared <hi>Mediator,</hi>
husband and head of the body the Church, the whole ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the creation have a new right, through Chriſt
the heir of all, to the liberty of the ſons of God, and to be
delivered from bondage. And hence the Saints have a
right through Chriſt to the influences of this new provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the chief of which are the influences of ſaving
grace: and though there be no promiſe made to the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
<hi>do this and ye ſhall be converted;</hi> yet Chriſt hath by his
blood merited converſion, and influences for converſion
to them; and as in Chriſt all providences are redemptory
providences, ſo hath the Lord ordained according to the
decree of predeſtination and of redemption, that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
coming to ſuch a place where <hi>Acts 2. Peter</hi> preaches,
where the Gaoler heares <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 16. to the well of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
where the woman confers with Chriſt beyond her intention,
are means of the converſion of ſuch as are ordained to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
ſo as providences of themſelves natural, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
through the intention of God made redemptory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
for the converſion of the choſen.</p>
               <p>3. There is no connexion promiſſory betwixt natural
or literal acting begun, and ſpiritual acting and heat of the
life of Chriſt: As theſe actings are conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they ſeem to be one web; but the one part of the
web is courſe and groſſe cloth, the other is ſilk and cloth
of gold; they depend one upon another as ſome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
and general means, and are intended of God.</p>
               <p>2. there is a coeviſtence betwixt them by a practiſe of
grace, not by a promiſe of grace.</p>
               <p>3. There is an order of priority and poſteriority betwixt
them.</p>

                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:119064:184"/>
4. There is a vicinity material betwixt them; as five is
a number nearer to ſeven then three; and yet three, five,
ſeven, all differ among themſelves in nature and eſſence:
to hear is nearer to hearing in faith, then no hearing at all,
or obſtinate turning away the ear; they are knit together
as a piece of inſtitution watered (if I might ſo ſpeak) with a
command, and a heavenly acting of God; for as was ſaid
before, the literal acting ſome way falls under a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>4. If there be a literal fixedneſs of conſideration in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the duty, and ſome literal miſſing and ſenſe of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
it puts the man in the borders of a ſpiritual duty, and
hardly wants the ſoul ſo acting the ſaving flowings of the
Spirit: the very bulk and body of a promiſe may give
ſome literal wakening to a dead ſoul; and the skaddings of
a threatning ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

12. 1, 2, 3, 4. David</hi> gives a literal hearing by the light of
a natural conſcience to <hi>Nathans</hi> general parable. At length,
when the Spirit ſets it on by application, <hi>thou art the man,
David,</hi> v. 10, 11, 12, 13. comes to ſome life of confeſſion,

51. Indeed theſe two, the literal part, and the ſpiritual
part, make (as it were) in groſs one bulk or body of a
work; but they are conjoyned as the clay and the gold in
<hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image; they are joyned by God, not

                  </gap>or the other; it's therefore good
to be about means: the waiting at the tyde is not ſailing,
yet it makes way for ſailing. What connexion is there
betwixt <hi>Saul</hi>'s journey in ſeeking his fathers aſſes, and
<hi>Samuel</hi>'s anointing him King of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> none at all, but a
providential union there is; but no man can ſay that there
is here either a divine inſtitution, or a gracious promiſe,
yea, or a congruity of means and end, of work and wages:
though there be ſomething of a marred inſtitution in dead

work as God ſets them on. 3. A gracious heart reflects
upon it ſelf. 4. We may do more by the habit of grace then

by unbelief that reprobates make to the Goſpel.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is a matter of difficulty to determine, becauſe of the
various caſes, what we may here do in the uſing of means.
1. Unrenewed men and renewed both can do leſs in
uſing of means, when two mountains and two rivers are
in the way, then when one only is before them; an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed
having both his natural corruption and a ſtrong
temptation againſt him can do no leſs. So <hi>Naaman</hi> by his
office being obliged to go to the houſe of the Idol-God
<hi>Rimmon,</hi> and not yet converted, could more hardly
abſtain from that outward Idolatry, then now when to
natural corruption fear of offending his maſter the King of
<hi>Aſſyria</hi> is added. No doubt <hi>Pilate</hi> naturally loathed and
hated Chriſt, as <hi>Herod Acts</hi> 12. did the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> but when <hi>Pilate</hi> is afraid to offend the people, and
to ſeem an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> willing to pleaſure
the Jews, it's no wonder then both be not only weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in uſing the means to believe in Chriſt, but alſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
oppoſe Chriſt and the Goſpel, and if both had
been engaged in a profeſſion of Chriſt, as many now are,
they might have uſed means more largely to believe,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:119064:185"/>
and preferred Chriſt not in their heart and real eſtimation
of mind to men pleaſing, but in ſome externals alſo; but
that ſhould be no concludent argument that they really
loved Chriſt, becauſe a name may put men to hazard
court, and means, and life, rather then deny Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Corruption and temptation both encreaſe the difficulty of uſing of means.</note> This ſeems a conſiderable difference, the earth cannot
plow and ſow wheat of it ſelf, yet when it is plowed and
laboured, and ſeeded, it can enlive and nouriſh the ſown
corn; but though we can do much more in the uſing of
means then we do, yet means work upon us, if they be
only external,<note place="margin">Influences work as God ſets them on.</note> by no neceſſity of nature, but according as
he ſtirs, who hath mercy on whom he will, though men run
and will: Nor can we deny but the child of God, indued

life from the head,<note place="margin">The gracious heart may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon it ſelf ſpiritual actings and purge it ſelf.</note> as the living members can draw nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
from the ſtomach through the liver and veins;
yet the Sun and heaven hath influence in all actings of
nature; the neceſſity of actual grace doth not remove any
of the vertue and power of the habit of grace: ſo doth
the renewed heart lie fair to a Goſpel-command: and as
actions vital are immanent, and received often on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſo here, the heart renewed can work upon the heart.
Prov. 23. 19. <hi>Hear thou my ſon and be wiſe, and guide thine
heart in the way:</hi> it's grace that guides the heart in the
way, but the graced heart alſo guides it ſelf, in its manner
of working, in the way of God. 1 Tim. 5. 22. <hi>Keep thy ſelf
pure.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15. <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved unto God.</hi>
Jude v. 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God.</hi> So 1 Joh. 3. 3.
<hi>Every man that hath this hope purifieth himſelf, even as he
is pure.</hi> The ſea purgeth it ſelf of mire and dirt, and new
wine caſteth out the ſcum and refuſe, and gold melted ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
and caſts out its droſs, and the ſuperfluity of the
mettal; far more doth the renewed heart keep it ſelf by
a lively power againſt every power contrary to it ſelf:
only the heart cannot plow the heart, and remove its
rockineſs, the Lord by an omnipotent infuſion of a new
ſpirit doth that. Ezech. 36. 26. <hi>I will take away the ſtony
heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi>

of innocent blood. Now grace is not given to the
child of God as a piece of overguilded copper to a child
to play withal, as if he needed not to trade with it, nor to
put it to the bank.</p>
               <p>3. The unrenewed man is under the debt of Goſpel-obedience
to Chriſt: a deep habitual ſleepineſs on the
ſluggard frees him neither from an obligation to the duty
of plowing, nor from that juſtice of God which cloathes

the Lords juſtice goes no farther then the obſtinacy of men,

it's juſt providence in the Gardiner to cut down and throw

coming to the nick of a gracious receiving of Chriſt, and
having done all requiſite to a profeſſor until it come to the
breaking forth of the new birth, he there only fails; for
many ſins and degrees of failing againſt that Covenant
(however it be called) go before that, by reaſon whereof
men are ſaid not to believe in the Son of God, and upon
which account they remain under wrath, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for non-believing: he who will not hear of the

               <p>Yet withal here we would beware of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s order
of ſetting repentance and works of new obedience before

               <p>3. So muſt men ſweet and repent of their life before

and juſtification the Scripture is ſilent: it cruſhes
joy, peace, hope, liberty ſpiritual, for if men earn not
out their repentance, they may and do loſe their labour

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119064:188"/>
nor does the man accept Chriſt as Lord in a naked inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſerve him; for ſo ſaving faith includes in its nature
an intention of new obedience to God: but a man cannot
be ſaid to have his reward of pardon, becauſe he hath
wrought his work, or reformed his life only in his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or becauſe he intends to work his work, Scripture
ſhould here ſpeak.</p>
               <p>4. Why doth not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay right down, <hi>tacienti
quod in ſe eſt Deus non denegat gratiam?</hi> The Lord hath
made the covenant of grace with all mankind, <hi>Americans,
Braſilians,</hi> with theſe of <hi>Chinah,</hi> and it hath theſe two halfs:
1. Do and live the life of grace and of faith. 2. Do and live
the life of glory. So that the Goſpel and pardon, and the
life of grace are promiſed to the <hi>Americans,</hi> ſo they trade
well with nature, or a general grace of Chriſt crucified,
they know not whom, and they never heard of; ſhew ſuch
a covenant made in Scripture, and made with the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's true, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>repent for remiſſion,</hi> and
<hi>repent, that your ſins may be blotted out, Acts 2. 37, 38. Acts</hi>
3. 19. But truth ſuffers here. <hi>Antinomians</hi> to exclude ſtrict
walking, make repentance to be nothing but faith. So
Mr. <hi>Denne, Hobſon. &amp;c.</hi> Again, <hi>Socinians,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
a man of a ſtrong wit, on the other extream to exclude
the looſe faith of many, make Goſpel-faith to be nothing
but repentance and new obedience. But the place <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
can no more prove that repentance, and a fixed walk in
good works, is ſuch a part of the new Covenant, as this,
<hi>do and live the life of faith, and be pardoned,</hi> then that
Baptiſm, which is in the text joyned with repentance, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
required before pardon; whereas both repentance,
faith, baptiſm, new obedience, are the way to the poſſeſſion
of the crown; not cauſes, not the price, not the ranſome
of the right and title to the crown, and both as conditions
of pardon and title to the crown and the place. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19.
ſpeaks of repentance continued all the life (for ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance

ſaith <hi>Diodati.</hi> But let it ſtand, <hi>repent, that you

and a way, and a means of remiſſion of ſins: it ſhall not
hold up the fabrick of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> juſtification by inherent

who continues in his ſinful way, but he that repents and

and to others, is the only juſtified man of all thoſe
that are adult and come to age. For the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts 2. 3.
John Baptiſt, Matth.</hi> 3. having to do with looſe profeſſors
and hypocrites, who ſought righteouſneſs by law-works,
and yet ſlighted Law and all Law-works, do urge firſt
repentance ſincere. 2. Continuing to the end. 3. Viſible
to themſelves and others; nor do we bid proud and whole
Phariſees, and men going on ſecurely, and workers of
iniquity, as ſuch, immediately lay hold on Chriſt as their
Saviour: and it's true, the motive of Gods abundant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning,
and ſo the faith of pardoning mercy leads to
repentance, <hi>Iſa. 55. 6, 7. let the wicked return, for he will
abundantly pardon;</hi> and therefore faith goeth before
repentance as touching ſome acts. In theſe <hi>Matth. 6. 14, 15.
If ye forgive not, your father will not forgive you.</hi> Chriſt
ſpeaks not of the order, as if we muſt firſt love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and our enemies as our ſelves before we be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
nor is the holy Ghoſt upon order, 1 <hi>John 1. 19.
Prov. 28. 13. Romans</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10, 13. as if penitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of ſin to Chriſt, forſaking of all ſin, and ſound and

but the Lord deſigns the perſons pardoned, that
they muſt be ſuch as forgive their enemies, forſake their
ſins; becauſe men are ready to ſooth themſelves, as if

I believe that by the new law of grace, or the promiſe, God
hath delivered all men (in the tenour of the promiſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation
reaches not to all) from the guilt of ſin, and as
to the deſtructive puniſhment, on condition they will accept of
Chriſt and life; and no man is accepted out of this promiſe
(till they remedieſly reject it) but it is ſo general, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
will have Chriſt, may have him (on his terms) though
none will have him till Gods ſpecial grace make them willing,
yet whoſoever will is called to drink of the water of life.</p>
               <p>My doubts are ſhortly theſe, 1. What Scripture ſaith

1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. the ſame ranſome is payed to ſave from

               <p>2. How is it not a ſcenical and a poor delivery, and
ſatisfaction and ranſome paid to juſtice, if juſtice inflict

millions of this huge (all) muſt then be the covenanted

               <p>3. Can a promiſe of God never promulgated, never by
fame or ſound of words reaching the ears of theſe to whom
the promiſe is made, be either promiſe or obliging Law?
the Lord's will to do good is but a meer decree, never a
promiſe till it be ſpoken; was there ſuch a thing from
eternity as a promiſe of God to make the world? a decree
there was, never a promiſe. God ſaid never in Old or

               <p>5. How can this promiſe be ſo wide and general, as
none are excepted? for either Chriſt dyed not for Infants,
and ſo no Infants are redeemed, nor waſhed in the blood

Chriſt and life, and for wilful <hi>and remedileſſe rejecting of

               <p>There is 1. little Remedy for clearing the glory of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
juſtice, to make their furnace hotter in Hell for a
Chymerical and imaginary ſin of which their conſcience
cannot accuſe them; for how can they be guilty in reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
a Chriſt they never heard of, and by no ſuperable
providence could hear? in that the Goſpel came neither
by Angels, nor by Men gifted with tongues, nor by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to their knowledge; and this darkens the glory of
God's juſtice. Its true, <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and others
may be plagued for ſins they actually know not; but light
of conſcience teacheth that Adultery and Oppreſſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

that <hi>Braſilians, Indians,</hi> or the wiſeſt of Heathen, <hi>Socrates,
Plato, Cicero,</hi> and the moſt tender of them, die with any
ſuch challenge? ah, we ſinned againſt the blood of the Son

               <p>3. As no reprobate can be guilty of love of Election to
glory from eternity (ſuppone ſuch a love had been in the

to them: So if there be ſuch a law of grace and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-promiſe,

Now this is but a moral work to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to cauſe a dead

and deadneſs in the ſoul, but only moral dimneſs

of the Goſpel, which wakens the ſtupid will, as <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi>
and <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay, perfects the whole work of the
new-birth, and grace is nothing but the letter of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;
and the ſtrongeſt operation of this grace is onely
moral ſwaſion and counſel: as if by Rhetorick, and good
words, the mid-wife could bring forth the birth; and this
remedy that Chriſt brings to <hi>Braſilians,</hi> is at beſt, the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of man dead and rotten in the grave, by blowing a
Trumpet beſide him, and by making a perſwaſive oration
over his dead corps: if ſo, the man ſo raiſed was never dead:
Nor is the <hi>remedying Law</hi> ſo much; for a preaching of the
Goſpel comes never to the ears of millions, with whom this
remedying Covenant is made: and it were a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement,
as any can be, to move <hi>Braſilians, Americans,</hi>
thoſe of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Turkey,</hi> to receive the Goſpel, to ſhew
them Chriſt by the blood of his Croſſe hath <hi>made peace
between God and you: ye are all of you, old and young,
bought with a price, ranſomed by the blood of God: ye are
not your own, Chriſt hath taken away your ſins, and does
now begin upon a new ſcore;</hi> God hath expreſt the greateſt
love imaginable, he hath redeemed you his <hi>enemies:</hi> this in
the Old or New Teſtament is never told them; for
then the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould find all the <hi>Pagans</hi>
a Church, bought with the blood of Chriſt, and the reality
of a Church ſhould be in all ſocieties of the earth. But
ſuch glad news are preached to the choſen in the viſible
Church only; never to <hi>Braſilians: Paul</hi> preaches at <hi>Athens,
Acts</hi> 17. Creation, not one word of Redemption: as alſo
<hi>Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> and others ſhould beget over again to God
Creator all their diſciples, whom they find rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and infuſe by moral ſwaſion and teaching a new life
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:119064:192"/>
of learning: and all rude and ignorant men before they
be taught Methaphyſick, Mathematicks, ſhould be dead in
ignorance, enemies in their heart to knowledge and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy:
and the ſame ground ſhould make Miniſters ſuppoſe
there were no learning, and teaching of the Father in
drawing of men to Chriſt, by that Omnipotency, which
raiſed Chriſt from the dead and created the world, <hi>John
6. 44, 45. Epheſ. 1. 17, 18. 19. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 4. as true real Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the new-birth, by only the letter of the Goſpel, as
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> are fathers to beget Philoſophy in men.
Now for any remedying Goſpel-promiſe that is made to
<hi>Braſilians</hi> to purchaſe by way of merit, we ſhall believe it,
when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhall prove that to <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Braſilians,</hi>
who lived and dyed without the ſound of the leaſt notice,
or rumour of the Goſpel, Chriſt hath purchaſed and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
grace to believe the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>2. That Chriſt by the blood of his Croſſe hath made
peace betwixt God and the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> who ſo lived and
dyed without the Goſpel; that Chriſt hath ſatisfied upon
the Croſſe for their ſins againſt the Law, and born their
fins in his own body on the tree; that <hi>Braſilians</hi> being
dead to ſins ſhould live unto righteouſneſs, by whoſe ſtripes
<hi>Braſilians</hi> are healed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. that Chriſt ſuffered for
<hi>Braſilians</hi> to bring them to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. that Chriſt
bought <hi>Braſilians</hi> from their vain converſation with his

conditional intention in the Father giving his Son to death,
and of the Son's giving himſelf to death for all theſe poor
ſavages to whom he would never ſend the air of a rumour

               <p>There are two extremities here we love on the one hand;<note place="margin">Our formality in praying and in going about other means.</note>
the barbarous <hi>opus operatum,</hi> the literal deed done in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the charm of the external work is by hand, if God
ſell not the bleſſing: yet I have blown words of praying
up to Heaven, and told down the price: It's heavenly
wiſedom to go about praying and other means not as acts
of trading for our nigheſt ends, but as acts of ſerving and
glorifying of God, though no thing ſhould redound to us:
but we uſe praying, and hearing, as a man doth his horſe, or
his ſhip, all for ſelf-uſe and ſelf-ends. Ah, can the man
charm the bleſſing of the Holy Ghoſt with bare words,
when ſcarce the literal attention goes along? and here our
Idolatrry ſaith, <hi>I buy, and God will not ſell; I plow, and
God binds up the clouds: the Lord pays not the reward of a
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:119064:194"/>
rich harveſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and the ſpirit acteth on, and with our literal acting.</note> 
                  <hi>to the merit of plowing on the other hand:</hi> let or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
reading, praying, and hearing of the Bible ſleep
until the ſpirit blow: and we forget it is not the Spirit of the
Father, which works without the word and the teſtimonies,
the tools of the Father; is this God's Spirit or a deluſion?
plow not, ſow not until it be firſt harveſt; blow not at the
fire until it firſt flame boldly: pray not until the Spirit
breath ſtrongly, but firſt give words, I pray you, to be a
lodging to the ſpirit to breath in: Let nature ſtir firſt in
the uſing of means; Firſt bow the knee, ſtretch out the
hands; ſhould the Spirit from above firſt bow the knee?
and firſt phyſically act upon the hands to lift them up?
nay, nature begins in its order before the heat and fire of
the ſpirit come; flaming goes not before ſmoking, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
ſmoking leads the way to flaming: the flaming of
faith, of love, of paining deſires in their ſpiritual vigour, go
not before ſtirring of the lips, and lifting of the eyes to
Heaven to pray: that is no more true then refreſhing
and cooling of the heart go before eating and drinking:
will ye ſay, I will not pray, while firſt the ſpirit flame, I
will not hear, while firſt I believe, and I will not lay up the
promiſes in the heart, while firſt the heart burns in heat of
love with the promiſes: You then ſay, <hi>I will not throw
about the key until the door be firſt opened; I will not hear the
word until the Lord give me faith;</hi> whereas the way of God
is, that faith as the end, comes by hearing, as the means
leading to the end; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and <hi>Gal. 3. Ye received the
Spirit by the hearing of faith;</hi> then of neceſſity our hearing
and lending attention to Chriſt, by the outer entry the
ear, muſt go before faith as the mean before the end,
whereas faith comes by hearing: as vital heat is ſtirred up
by running, ſo it is true, ſome inward burnings and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
of ſpirit begin like ſmoking before flaming, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.
1. <hi>Pſal. 45. 1. Acts</hi> 17. and then follows ſpiritual acting of
praiſing, preaching, praying, in which caſe there is, as it
were, in the ſoul a fever, and an inward boyling of a pot
that muſt run over, or new wine that muſt break the veſſel,
and force vent, ſo that ſilence or no acting muſt torment
and pain the poor man: but that is not ordinary; for the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:119064:194"/>
ſet way is that we ſet to acting, and the ſpirit ſtrikes in as
he thinks fit, and the believer is to blow and ſtir the fire
under the aſhes, as if he were ſeeking the wind, and muſt
ſtir and dig ſome fire and warmneſſe out of the letter, and
let the ſpirit blow and flame as he will. If any ſay a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of the heart goes well before acting, that is true alſo;
if any ſay God commands not ſimple hearing, but hearing
mixt with faith, what ever truth were in that, as hearing
without faith is ſinful formality, yet he commands in a
divine order, that we ſhould hear to the end we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
and the Lord commands not that we may believe,
that we may hear, as nature ordains not growing and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing,
that the living creature may eat, and ſleep; but by
the contrary, nature appointeth eating and ſleeping that
we may grow, and be nouriſhed. If any ſay the Lord
commands not hearing as to the ſubſtance of the act, but
ſaving,<note place="margin">Some truth we muſt firſt phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally hear and conſider before we believe.</note> ſpiritual, and humble trembling at the Word, and
hearing in faith; and this he commands to be done in
believing and trembling at the Word, in the ſame act, in
which he commands hearing. It ſhall be denyed that in
the order of begetting faith, this is neceſſary, that they
ever be on and the ſame act: the Lord preached to <hi>Adam,</hi>
Gen. 3. 15. <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the head of the
ſerpent: Adam</hi> by the Law of God, of nature, was firſt to
hear and conſider this firſt Goſpel-truth, and then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, and receive it in faith: he was a rational and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
agent in believing, and was not obliged in one and the
ſame to hear and believe, but as a rational agent he was
firſt to hear, and then to believe, after conſideration of the
Goſpel now heard and received in the ear and mind.
And the like may be ſaid of <hi>Pagans</hi> at the firſt hearing of
the Goſpel, they muſt hear and literally conſider the letter
of the Goſpel before they believe. As for the Lord's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
to believe, to pray, to read, to praiſe, ſure we are
to begin our duty of natural ſtirring in theſe acts, though
in another kind of cauſe, God muſt firſt act us thereunto:

to pray for his drawing that we may run: but yet by order
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:119064:195"/>
of nature, we are to doe our parts firſt in our phyſical way
before we feel the ſtirring of divine influences.</p>

might excuſe himſelf before the tribunal of Chriſt; Lord, thou

but I could not; I would have been humbled and reformed

               <p>
                  <hi>Hence faithful Mr.</hi> Fenner <hi>pag.</hi> 8. the (<hi>moral and faulty</hi>)

becauſe they will not. <hi>His reaſons are,</hi>

1. The wicked think they have power, and yet they will not
doe according to their thoughts; what is the reaſon they hope
to repent on their dead beds, but becauſe they think they have
power? or at leaſt they are able to beg power of Jeſus Chriſt.
Now by their own thoughts, God will convince them that they
do not give over their ſins.</p>
               <p>2. Thou doſt not ſo much as try whether thou canſt doe or
not: when a Maſter bids a Servant carry a ſack of corn to
the Mill, I cannot, ſays he; but cannot you try, ſays his maſter,
cannot you go about it? no, he will not try; why, then he is
wilfull: if his maſter ſhould ſee him ſweating and ſtriving to
carry it, it were ſomething, then he will ſay he ſtuck at a
<hi>cannot;</hi> but when he will not be at the pains to try, he ſticks at
<hi>a will not; pag.</hi> 10. God offers the good motions of power, I
will help thee, and I will enable thee, and thou wilt not be
helped. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 17. Hearken to the ſound of the trumpet, but
they ſaid, they will not hearken.—O, ſaiſt thou, I do
hear the word, and I cannot hear it better; I do pray
dayly, and I cannot pray better; thus thou retorteſt upon
God, as the unprofitable ſervant, Lo, here thou haſt what is
thine; lo, here is the beſt faith thy ſpirit helps me to, here is
the beſt obedience, that thy power enabled me to doe, &amp;c.
lo, there thou hast that is thine, thou helpeſt me with no
more.</p>
               <p>3. God gives thee a talent, a new power: hath God given thee
eyes, thou haſt more power to glorifie him, then he that hath
none—give account for thy wit; Lord I have contrived buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and bargains with it, I have jeſted, quirped, been
merry with it; but why wouldſt thou not be witty for God, and
for the good of thy ſoul?</p>
               <p>4. The more power thou haſt to repent, the more thy will is
againſt it;—the more your righteouſneſs ſhould encreaſe, it
goes the more away:<note place="margin">The ſinful <hi>cannot.</hi>
                  </note> like the dew, the more the Sun riſeth,

               <p>5. Thy <hi>cannot</hi> is a voluntary <hi>cannot.</hi> I cannot give to the

thy luſt, and thou art contented with this</hi> cannot; <hi>nay, thou
wouldſt not be able—my people love to have it ſo,</hi> Jer. 5. 31,
&amp;c. A man can doe more good then then he does, though
not in a gracious manner; yea, and there be degrees
more or leſſe in both matter and manner: yea, and this
<hi>cannot</hi> is the natural <hi>cannot</hi> of a broken will; <hi>Lot</hi> preached
to <hi>Sodome,</hi> and they repent not; <hi>Jonas</hi> preached to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi>
and they repent, though not ſoundly; <hi>Chriſt</hi> a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then <hi>Jonah</hi> preacheth to the Phariſees, and they repent
neither ſoundly, nor any other way. Sure more might
be done in uſing of means, though not without ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grace: but ſo long as wicked <hi>will</hi> hath a neareſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
in all ſinful omiſſions and tranſgreſſions, there is no
place left to this; <hi>O God give me no power, nor habits, nor influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;</hi>
but would ye have done all required to be done with
power, habits, and influences, by your poor wicked wills?
Nay, there is a wicked <hi>will not</hi> which is a pull-back, and a
ſinful obſtruction to gracious actings. But to ſay nothing
of this more; may not believers ſo far command influences
of grace, as that they have in their power far off or near
hand, <hi>in potentiâ proximâ vel remotâ,</hi> ſufficient grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and be ſaved? See <hi>Cornelius Janſenius, tom. 3. de

diſp. 97. Suarez, lib. 4. de praedeſt. c. 3. num.</hi> 19, 20. But
it is required that the party, <hi>non ponat obicem,</hi> lay not a
block in the way of the Lord calling him: and if he doe
not, God ſhall undoubtedly convert him, ſay theſe men;
For if God ſhould deny ſufficient help of grace, eſpecially
to Infants upon an intention to damn them, (ſaith <hi>Theo.
Smizing. tom. 2. tract. 3. diſp. 6. de provid. num.</hi> 179.)
ſuch a denyal ſhould be againſt the Covenant, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

death of the Son for the reconciliation of all mankind,<note place="margin">School-men make conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Chriſt the purchaſe of free will, the abſurdity thereof.</note> and
their redemption, none excepted; And therefore he ſhould</p>
               <p>1. Doe a wrong to Chriſt. And 2. to all mankind, and
ſin againſt the juſtice of his fidelity, if he ſhould deny ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:119064:196"/>
3. Such a ſufficient grace is due to us, not of our ſelves,
but in Chriſt; yea, but by this Chriſt hath merited ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
grace to all; and why not pardon of original ſin to
all? and life eternal to all? ſhould it not be a wrong to all,
and a wrong to Jeſus Chriſt, and a wrong to free will, if
ſuch a meritorious purchaſe of grace be made to all? why
are they called by nature the heirs of wrath? for by this,
all the Pagans, and Heathens by grace, are alſo the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
heirs of glory, the ranſomed of the Lord.</p>
               <p>2. Why doe not the Apoſtles firſt reveal the drawing and
heart-breaking motive of obedience? Chriſt hath dyed for
you all, and reconciled you to God from the womb.</p>
               <p>3. What news are theſe? you all are in that bleſſed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
paſſed betwixt the Father and the Son, and Chriſt
hath given a dear ranſome of blood to purchaſe grace to
carry you either to Heaven or Hell: but he hath purchaſed
for you no glory, except by the ſweating of free will you
make it your actual purchaſe.</p>
               <p>4. The Scripture tells us no where that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> dyed
to break the Decrees of Election and Reprobation; and
that Chriſt hath obtained that no man ſhould be damned
for Original ſin, as many as die in <hi>Adam, Rom.</hi> 5. as many
are juſtified and live in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both the life of grace and of
glory.</p>
               <p>5. This is the far more wide and broad covenant of
grace, that the Goſpel if men uſe the light of nature well,
(who are, and ever hath been in all ages ſince the creation
the greateſt part of mankind) ſhall be ſent to them, and all
ſhall be put in ſuch a capacity to be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
in him, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in, to be juſtified and ſaved by
the works of the Law.</p>
               <p>6. Why doth ſin original brook the name of ſin, of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
tranſgreſſion, and a ſin for which all die, as <hi>Pſal.
51. 5. Rom. 5. Rom. 7. Rom. 8. Heb.</hi> 12. &amp;c. which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

and which brings damnation to no man; for in juſtice,

from the Lord Jeſus as the meritorious cauſe, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. Gal.
1. Franſ. Cumel. diſp. 2. ar. in primam 2. concl. 5. pag.</hi> 244.
teſtifies that the beſt of them is like a ſharp briar; for he
with others holds, that grace is given to them who lay no
impediment in the way of God's effectual calling, and he
hath it in his power to lay no impediment, becauſe he can
eſchew all ſins againſt the Law of nature, and ſuch ſins are
the only impediments that hinder the effectual calling
of God.</p>
               <p>But 1. he makes no mention of Chriſt, his death and
merit, which is the only meritorious cauſe of effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the choſen. A ſpiritual ſoul loves the ſtrongly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
power of Chriſt's calling, the more ſtrongly that it
is a work of ſaving grace, and of the grace of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi>
3. 14.</p>
               <p>2. The man is equally Lord of heaven and hell who
hath ſalvation in his power by this way, as men have by
the Jeſuits way; but all men by this way have in their
power this prevening grace: for if they do what in them is,
and eſchew ſins, againſt the law of nature, which <hi>Cumel</hi>
ſaith they may do, (for ſuch ſins are the only impediment
of grace) they may be ſaved; not by merit, as the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
ſay, but by free-grace, as <hi>Dominicans</hi> ſay: but as to the
matter <hi>Cumel</hi> conſpires with the Jeſuits; call it merit, or
give it another name, it's againſt the Scriptures to teach
that all the <hi>Americans, Braſilians</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> have the
prevening grace of God and ſalvation in their power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:119064:197"/>
And 2. That though all men may lay an impediment to
the prevening grace of God, yet they may fulfil the law
of nature, and eſchew all mortal ſin, which if they do, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
the Lord beſtows prevening grace upon the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans;</hi>
for the Scripture ſaith, We are dead in ſins and
treſpaſſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. that we cannot come <hi>to Chriſt except the
Father draw us,</hi> Joh. 6. 44. that the wiſedom of the fleſh is
<hi>neither ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi>
Rom. 8. 7. and that we by nature cannot underſtand the
things of God, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 13, 14. Matth.</hi> 16. 16, 17. nor think a
good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. as of our ſelves; nor ſpeak a good
word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. nor bring forth good fruit, do any good,
more then a branch can bring forth fruit being cut off the
tree, <hi>John</hi> 15. 4, 5. or thn men can gather wine-grapes of
thorns, or figs of thiſtles, <hi>Matth. 7. 16, 17, 18. Luke</hi> 6. 43, 44.
and therefore far leſs can Heathens earn by their ſweating
and labouring effectual calling and ſalvation: Sure then
ſalvation and prevening grace of God ſhould be in him
that wills and runs, and not in God that ſhews mercy; and
it is but an oyling of <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> to tell that
ſalvation is not in him that runs by way of merit, yet it is
in him, and ſhall infallibly be given to the runner and
willer, who by free-will may purchaſe both; and all <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi>
have in them to run and will. <hi>Dominicans</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this darken free-grace as much as <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> when
they tell us, men are ſaved not by the merit of free-will,
yet it is in the power of the free-will of <hi>Heathens</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
influences of ſaving grace; to put <hi>Heathens</hi> and
<hi>Indians,</hi> and all men ſafe at heavens gates, what is this
but to ſay, The King hath made no covenant that all his
Courtiers ſhall be made Kings, yet he hath paſſed his royal
word that if they bring him a flowr in <hi>May</hi> (which they
may eaſily do) they ſhall, <hi>vere,</hi> truly receive a Kingdom?
this is as great an advancing of free will, and an abuſing
of free grace, as <hi>Pelagians</hi> ever dreamed of. For <hi>Proſper</hi>

                  <p>Of the impediments of heavenly influences upon the

               <p>IT is not to be thought that influences, being acts of om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,
can properly be hindered; but by way of
promiſe and judicial threatning, he hath revealed in his
word that he will give grace to the humble, and reſiſt
the proud, <hi>James 4. 6. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 5. and that he will guide
and teach the meek and lowly, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25. 9. he certainly
promiſeth influence of grace to the meek. Hence</p>

               <p>2. Whether men can hinder the holy influences of God?</p>

their cures with them.</p>
               <p>4. What are the impediments in ſpecial, and their cures.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe four, the following concluſions
may be conſidered.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Concl.</hi> Often God reveals himſelf. 1. To <hi>Moſes</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his herding, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. he appears to him in the buſh:
he reveals Chriſt to the Diſciples while they are mending
their nets: the Angels declare to the ſhepheards the
birth of Chriſt while they attend their flocks, yet is
there no neceſſary connexion betweene the one
and the other. But could we in conſcience, and in
reference to God, while we are yet in the ſtate of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed

in the Holy Ghoſt and believing, and applying Chriſt

and make the proud to tremble. Then the ſpirit muſt uſe
divers inſtruments, and ſhoot arrowes and influences of
law and wrath, and wound the heart with arrows of love:
as the Artiſt, the Carpenter uſeth ſundry tools according
to the diverſity of timber that he works on, and the Lord
here accommodates his influences according to the nature
of the ſoyl. It's like Chriſts ſpirit made ſhorter and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite
work on the hearts of <hi>James</hi> &amp; <hi>John;</hi> for when Chriſt

                  <hi>he
took up his bed, and went forth before them all:</hi> It's like
<hi>Matthew</hi>'s converſion is of the ſame nature, <hi>Matth. 9. 9.
Luke</hi> 5. 27, 28. in which the Lord gives proof, that as ſome
Caſtles fall at the firſt ſhooting of the Canon, ſo there is no
ſtanding out, nor reſiſting of Chriſt; for when he adds
ſtrength of omnipotency, the work of humiliation, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
of ſaving faith, or repenting, are all quickly done:
as if tilling, ſowing, and harveſt were all in one day, or
one hour.</p>
               <p>2. We ſee alſo that gracious influences are threeded
(as it were) upon gracious influences;<note place="margin">A confluence of heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences at one time and in one work.</note> every beating of the

on the Spirit in his perſon, or in his ſeveral operations of

               <p>2. His gracious dealing of his will of pleaſure, is brought
in as an argument to ingage the heart to pray for grace to
a duty of the holy will of command. 73. <hi>Thy hands have

the temptation, broken by going on a duty. Hence a
temptation; 23. <hi>Princes did ſit and ſpeake againſt me:</hi> but
an influence of grace to do the duty broke the temptation.
<hi>But thy ſervant did meditate in thy ſtatutes. 69. The proud

and there is no danger of miſcarrying and ſhipwrack.</p>
               <p>2. Being once by grace breathed on, we are to hold the
wheels a going: grace puts the believer in a holy circle;
and running begets more running, and the motion ends at
us and begins at free grace.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The neareſt purchaſer of influences is prayer.</hi> ver. 35.
Make me to go in the path of thy Commandments. 36. Incline

               <p>4. Grace given is a ſtrong argument to get more grace;
as gold buyes more gold.</p>
               <p>5. Though grace begin and prevene us, yet the Lord

all which hold forth, if you would have ſhowrs of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

plentifully in you; for look as influences of vigour and
life, and heat upon roſes, flowrs, herbs, graſſe, apple-trees,
vines, corn, go along with light and ſhining of the Sun,
ſo do the influences of the ſpirit: and the ſpirit in his lively
actings delights to be carried in the chariot of the Word,
Cant. 4. 11. <hi>Thy lips, O my ſoul, drop as the honey-comb: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

<hi>Jude v. 19. ſenſual, not having the ſpirit.</hi> The more

which muſt ſpeak much ſpiritual mindedneſs, and mighty

calls ſome ſwine, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. ſome other dogs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15.
Does the holy Spirit dwell and breath in and through a
prophane and unclean man, ſuch as are ſwine and dogs?
It's ſtrange that the preaching of the Goſpel and Satan
lodge together in <hi>Judas; Have not I choſen you twelve, and

               </p>
               <p>2. Influences of grace, ſpiritual joy, perſevering to the

and rocks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20, 21. though there be a receiving
of the word with joy and delight, that joy is but falſe met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
The only cure of this is, if we would have our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

This is one of the firſt works of the Spirit, to convincethe
conſcience of unbelief, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8, 9. and when the Spirit
hath taken that caſtle, and brought the ſoul to be ſenſible
of unbelief, he can eaſily take in the reſt of the works;
frequent caſting to of new oyl to the lamp, keeps it ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and new fewel cauſes the fire to flame. Frequent
repeated acts of believing bring the diſciples to get the

to give the Spirit, as a Father is to give bread to his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry

11, 12, 13. It is not ſo in nature, the husbandmans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
faith, that it ſhall be a ſweet, warm, fruitful Summer,
makes not a fruitful Summer: The Sea-mans natural
faith, believing fair winds, and no ſtorms at all, makes it
not to be ſo; for often faith here is but fancy, but
faith acting dayly upon the precious promiſes of the word,
brings ſtrong gales, and ſummer-influences of heart
warmneſs of the Spirit, and in a manner creates new
blowings of the North and South-wind, fainting under

wind and breathings of the ſpirit, as it doth the mighty
actings of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. An unbeliever, as touching
his ſtate is a Pagan, and doth the holy ſpirit dwell in an
Heathen? Lively hope (for there is a dead and withered
hope) is no leſs a fruit of the ſpirit then faith. This is a
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:119064:225"/>
ſpecifick difference between an unconverted Pagan who
wants the ſpirit, and a convert who hath the ſpirit. The
former is one who has <hi>no hope, and ſo is without God, and
without Chriſt, and without the Spirit of God in the world,</hi>
and ſo is not capable of influences, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14. and
<hi>one whom the Lord according to his abundant mercy hath

                  <hi>The ſound of muſick</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cajetan) makes an

it is, as when blood runs out at mouth or noſe, the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

and cauſes it run in its right channel. The ſweetneſs of
muſick drawes the ſoul to a bended attention to conſider
the harmony, that it may the more greedily drink in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation.
<hi>Peter Martyr</hi> on the place ſaith, As <hi>David</hi> by
ſinging a ſpiritual ſong chaſed away the evil ſpirit from
<hi>Saul,</hi> ſo would <hi>Eliſha</hi> waken up the good ſpirit by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Pſalmes, as the ſounding of a Trumpet hath influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

Pſalmes to God (and it's like <hi>Eliſha</hi> called for ſome of the

               <p>2. That being done, the ſoul is ſetled, and the blood;
for the Phyſical definition of anger is a <hi>kindling of the
blood about the heart,</hi> the moral deſcription of it being a
deſire of revenge to hold off a contrary, and to preſerve
nature; and when the blood is ſetled and fallen from the
heart, the organs of prophecying are in a little better
frame then when the ſoul and heart is boyling like a pot in
heat and flaming of anger.</p>
               <p>3. By bending of the mind to a ſpiritual object the

on our part, <hi>and that the pure in ſpirit ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5. and
that grace keeps the ſoul like a calm ſea, without ſtorm

him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37. 1, 2, 3, 4. There may be an earthquake in

               <p>The 6th. impediment of heavenly influences is from fear,

               <p>IT is eaſier here to know what is not to be ſaid, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 1. Common moral influences that goes along

Then the reprobate may and doe reſiſt the immediately

that word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. and the aſſiſting ſpirit alſo in

               <p>2. Influences proper to the Elect, are ſo alſo to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

out of the graves, elſe Ile not enlive you. Nay he did
the work firſt, and firſt gave us life, and then ſought and
obtained our after-conſent. As a Prince, who by ſtrong
hand conquers a people, never treats with them whether
he ſhall be their King or not, till he firſt ſubdue them, take
their forts and caſtles, diſarm the inhabitants, and then
he offers them good conditions, and gains their after-good
will that he rule over them. And we are tranſlated
and in Chriſt's bounds, and have laid down arms, before
ever we yield a ſpiritual, vital, lively, and ſincere amen
and cloſing with Chriſt, that he, and none but he onely
ſhall reign over us. And it's admirable what branches of
freedome are here. As</p>

2. No excellency of meanes, were it an Angel, and the
man Chriſt preaching, ſo <hi>as all bear him witneſs, and are
aſtoniſhed at the gracious words that proceed out of his
mouth,</hi> Luke 4. 22. can create ſaving influences; but by
the contrary, influences of hell fill them with wrath, that
they would caſt Chriſt over the hill, and break his bones,
<hi>Luke</hi> 4. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>3. Fectleſs objects fetch influences from hell: as King
<hi>Herod</hi> and all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with him are quaking for fear, at
the birth of a weeping babe in cradle. Can an infant
riſe out of his ſwadling cloaths and cut the Kings throat,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 9. and with fire and ſword deſtroy all <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi>
or can a dead corps in the grave riſe and ſlay the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>4. For the external calling, many are called, and hear
40, 50, 60, 70. yeares, and yet no influences of grace fall
on them, as if men (ah if it were not ſo) were the curſed
ground and blaſted fig-tree: yea contrary to influences,
he blaſts the roſes by withdrawing ſap from them, burnes
the earth, and turns hearts into iron, by forbidding the
clouds to rain on them.</p>
               <p>5. In a moment he ſends flowing ſhowrs upon the thief
crucified with Chriſt, and he preacheth Chriſt a King on
the croſs.</p>
               <p>6. Who knows not the celerity and ſwiftneſs of the love-viſits
of Chriſt, coming leaping over the mountaines, and
skipping over the hills? When the man is going down to
the pit, the influence that a found ranſome it accepted
for him, makes him revive ſo that his fleſh ſhall be freſher
then a childs, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 23, 24, 25. and <hi>v. 26. He ſhall pray
unto God, and he will be favourable unto him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. There is a great difference here betwixt Sun-influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and the influences of grace. The apple on the ſame
tree which are neareſt to the Suns ſhining, are moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
and delicious; they are rawer and ſourer, though
upon the ſame ſtock, that are long in the morning ere the
Sun-influences fall on them, and are ſoon under the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon-ſhadow;
but the diſciples, ſhined upon by the
influences of the glory of the transfiguration near Chriſt,

and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> ſpake they knew not what, and that
carnally, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 5, 6. And who can think there is hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Divinity ſo near heaven as now the Apoſtles were?
So doth <hi>John</hi> fall dead at the feet of Chriſt when he is in

free grace we are maried here before we ſpiritually yield
that Chriſt be our husband. We are created of new to
be his holy frame and workmanſhip, and then hardly can
we but conſent; nor bought we his love-influences. Yea
nor is the Lord obliged to give the Sun-influences for ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

hath interpoſed his Soveraignty in the contrary when he
pleaſed, <hi>Joſh. 10. 13. Iſa. 38. 8. Dan.</hi> 3. 27. to teach that
Heaven and Earth have their Charters and their Writs of

               <p>3. For the third Conſideration, the Lord is the cauſe of
his own influences. Of our actings. 2. The efficacious,
domineering, inſuperable cauſe. 3. How the effects are
aſcribed to him principally. To prove the firſt I need
not goe back to prove the neceſſity of divine influences,
and that he works all our works in us. The ſecond is

               </p>
               <p>This is moſt untrue; for the phyſical and moral influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

the one exceeds the other in degrees of neceſſity, nor

                  <hi>If any object,</hi> He who inſuperably moves free-wil to act,

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The propoſition is falſe. 1. The Lord by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an ague of love-ſickneſs in the ſoul, moves the free-wil
of the Spouſe, and of the Martyrs to die for Chriſt, rather
then deny him, becauſe love of it ſelf conſidered as ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Lords phyſical motions on the ſoul, works
upon the will more ſtrongly and inſuperably, then many
floods upon a fire, and is hard <gap reason="foreign">

8. 6. yet love infers no violence to the will.</p>
               <p>2. Commands the Sun and it riſeth not, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 7. and
commandeth the Sun and it riſeth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 104. 19, 22. And
the Sun cannot but obey him; for all creatures are his

act, and ſo to act inſuperably, and yet he doth no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the natures of Sun, fire, and ſecond cauſes, in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them.</p>
               <p>He <hi>who contributes an inſuperable influence with free-will.</hi>
if that influence be contemperated and ſweetly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
to the nature, and elective, and rational way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of free-wil acting out of judgment, as our free-wil
acts here.</p>
               <p>He <hi>is not a cauſe inferring violence to free-will.</hi> Should
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:119064:231"/>
he indeed over-drive and over-act the free inclination,
contrary to the reaſon, light, and judgment of the mind,
and to the moral and free elective inclination of the will,
he ſhould conſtrain and force free-will: But this he does
not, but inclines the heart of <hi>David</hi> to the Lords teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
ſweetly, ſtrongly, inſuperably; and this <hi>David</hi> prays
for, <hi>Pſalm 119. Pſalm 5. Pſalm</hi> 19. and the Saints in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places; and neither <hi>David</hi> nor the Saints in ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſuit of God to deſtroy free-will: alſo the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and not the Lords influence, is our rule of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But ſince we know not the Lords actual denying
of his influence, becauſe we are willing he ſhould deny it,
our ſinful non-acting is no leſs our guiltineſs, then if we
had the dominion and commandment of the Lords influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in our power. A Maſter commands his ſervant to
come to ſuch a place where his Maſter uſeth to be, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the Maſter obliged to be in the place <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi>
neither paſſes he any promiſe to be there: if the ſervant
come not to that place, and willingly abſent himſelf, and
willingly conſent that the Maſter be not in the place, the
ſervants not coming is a manifeſt contravening of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
command. So the Lord commanding me to pray,
though he concur not by his Spirit interceding to help
me as he uſeth to doe, my not praying is a contravening
of his command, who calls to me, pray <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> under
this trouble: For,</p>
               <p>1. The Spirits helping, or not helping me to pray is
not my rule, but the commandement is my rule.</p>
               <p>2. The Spirit is not obliged <hi>hic &amp; nunc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. I pray not.</p>
               <p>4.<note place="margin">We are inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our duty, though the Lord deny his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary influence.</note> My willing not praying is a ſinful virtual conſent
to want the help of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Then ſhould the Suns not moving, but ſtanding ſtill
in the firmament, be a contravening of the command of God
given in the Creation, when he gave to the Sun a power to
move.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No ropes of Logick can draw the concluſion and
antecedent together: The Lords command to the Sun is
not moral, but natural.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:119064:231"/>
2. It's not abſolute. The power of moving in the Sun
is not to be acted, but according to the ſoveraignty of
God, concurring or not concurring with the Sun, ſo as
the Sun is under onely (to ſpeak ſo) a phyſical mandate of
omnipotency, not under an Ethical, Moral, Legal, or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential
commandement, to move, or to ſhine, under peril
of ſin and puniſhment, as man is, by the holy moral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
and commandement of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> A free cauſe hath more liberty not to act, or to act,
then the Sunne hath to give light, and the fire to give heat:
Therefore the Lord muſt have given to free-will a power of
nilling and willing, and muſt tie his influences to await and
be ready, concur or not concur, as free-will ſhall think
fit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The free will of Angels or men hath no more
freedome and exemption from the dominion of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
then the Sun or the fire hath, but all cauſes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or free, are equally under the Lords dominion.</p>
               <p>2. Free will hath no more a dominion over the Lords
dominion and his influences, that are given out, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
according to this ſoveraign dominion, then the Sun
or the piſmire. Yea free-wil is under his dominion, and
alſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. all the free actings of the creature, as well
as the neceſſary actings of Sun and fire, as is proved. Free-will
hath indeed a more dominion over its own acts, being
a rational and free agent, then the Sun over its acts.</p>
               <p>3. This is conſiderably comfortable, that the Lord is
chief Maſter of work: <hi>Not ye, but your Fathers Spirit ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in you,</hi> Matth. 10. 19. <hi>Not I, but the grace of God in
me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>I live not, but Chriſt lives in me,</hi> Gal. 2.
20. And yet <hi>Paul</hi> lives, <hi>Paul</hi> labours, but let God reign
in us.</p>
               <p>4. The actings of God in all created effects, eſpecially
his influences of grace are letten out immediately,<note place="margin">God acts in all both by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his power, and of his pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

concurring of his power and vertue, and by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal

works not in us to will and to doe by a Deputy or Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
as a King rules and governs another Kingdome, not
by himſelf in perſon, but by a Deputy, who repreſents

               <p>For God is ſaid to be with <hi>Moſes</hi> mouth, not onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

unto the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The Spirit acts in his own,</hi> John 14. 17. He dwels
with you, and ſhall be in you. <hi>v.</hi> 26. He ſhall teach you all
things. <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. He will guide you in all truth.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Pſal. 73. 24. Thou wilt guide me with thy counſel.</hi> He may
doe that though abſent, by infuſing into the Prophet the
habit of wiſedome: nay he is nearer hand, <hi>v. 2. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
I am continually with thee, thou haſt holden me by my
right hand.</hi> That is more then power.</p>
               <p>4. The action of leading that is aſcribed to God, is his
only action. <hi>Deut. 32. 12. So the Lord alone led Jacob, and
there was no ſtrange God with him.</hi> Now the eyes, legs,
wiſedome and will of the guide and leader are the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119064:232"/>
It's true,<note place="margin">The Lord particularly leads his own.</note> he led them by right hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
but who then ſhall lead <hi>Moſes?</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi> needed a guide
as they, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 12. Yea but he was leader in perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<hi>He led them through the deep as an horſe in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

                     </gap>umble.</hi> Now a horſe is not led,
by giving him power to guide himſelf, but the leader
holds the bridle, and directs the way to the horſe. So
the Lords Chriſt's gentle driving of the ewes with lamb,
and Chriſt's carrying the lambs in his boſome, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 11.
is an action immediate of Chriſt and his Spirit. The
warmneſs of life that comes from Chriſt's own boſom, and
from the Spirit ſpreading warm love abroad in the heart,
ſpeaks the perſonal acting of the Son and Spirit. So draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>John 6. 44. Cant.</hi> 1. 4. ſpeaks the nearneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Chriſt, and of Chriſt in his acting.</p>
               <p>5. This is to be conſidered. There are two ſorts of
cauſes:<note place="margin">Two ſorts of cauſes, one <hi>in fieri,</hi> for the producing of, and giving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a thing, another in <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto eſſe,</hi> for the preſerving of the ſame thing in being. God is both wayes the cauſe of gracious act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> on <hi>in fieri,</hi> another <hi>in facto eſſe.</hi> The Creator in a
manner is but half a cauſe: the father begets a ſon: the
carpenter builds a ſhip: the Maſon raiſes up the frame of
a goodly houſe: But the ſon lives when the father is dead;
the ſhip ſailes thouſands of miles; and the houſe ſtands
hundreds of years, when the carpenter and the maſon are
far from them: for they are cauſes <hi>in fieri,</hi> onely the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of houſes and ſhips.</p>
               <p>But there are ſome cauſes doe more. The ſoul is a cauſe
of the living man; and when the ſoul is removed, the man
dies: the face looking on the glaſs is the cauſe of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
both in its production and conſervation: remove
the face, and the image vaniſheth away: the Sunne is the
cauſe of day-light, which is transfuſed through the aire,
from the Eaſt to the Weſt. When the Sun goes down to
another Horizon, day-light vaniſheth away, becauſe the
Sun not by a deputy, and by vertue communicated to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
is the cauſe of the aires enlightning, but is the
cauſe of day-light, both as touching the creating of it <hi>in fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
and as touching the preſerving of it, or <hi>in conſervari &amp;
facto eſſe.</hi> So is God the cauſe of all creatures, both as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
being, and continuation being; the Lord made all
things, and when they are made, the houſe of heaven and
earth ſhould return to nothing, if the Lord ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw

his cauſative influence. But in a ſpecial manner the

                  </gap> the cauſe of grace, of our ſpiritual life,
and of all our actings of grace. The new life ſhould turn
to nothing, if Chriſt withdraw his gracious influence, and
it is that our poor little image and ſpiritual breaths are in
his hand, both touching production and conſervation by
his graces breathing. Hence if the Angel of his preſence
goe with us, his hand in our right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 23. let us

Ah, who refuſe a journey except God goe with him, and

It is good.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſparrow and the raven, the lyon and the
wolf, cannot ſtir without Gods influences of nature. Ah,
that is poor and hungry. Many have no more help of God
to be lead in eating and drinking for God, then the raven
and the lyon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I cannot pray nor hear without the influences of
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ah, you miſs influences of God, as concurring
with a gift; but ye miſs not his gracious and ſaving influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to pray and hear in faith and feeling to concur with
the Spirit of grace.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Judas</hi> the traitor cannot preach and caſt out devils,
without a common influence of a God with his gift; and
that is all your miſſing. The renewed man miſſes that
which (in a manner is his due) as a renewed man; and
that is the preſence of the ſpirit of grace in his acting.
If a horſe want a leg, he ſhall ſoon miſs it when he comes
to running,; for four legs are due to him by nature, but
the horſe in running miſſeth not the wings of an eagle;
for wings are not due to him. Gracious influences are
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:119064:233"/>
not due to a <hi>Judas,</hi> nor ſuch a guide as the Spirit to any
reprobate man; therefore they cannot miſſe ſuch a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
guide.</p>
               <p>2. It teaches us to be willing to be led as to 1. Deny
our will and wiſedome; as the blind man ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with his leader and guide, as if he did ſee better
then his guide. Slack your high-bended will, and deny
it, and cavil not with the Spirit, this way I muſt goe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my guide will or not: Let your will be as dead, and
no will at all; and let the Spirit in his will and wiſedome
reign in you.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">The giving of the heart to God.</note> Spread out the ſails and give them to the wind;
reſign the heart to the Spirit: obey that, <hi>My ſon, give me
thy heart.</hi> Give Chriſt your loves, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 12. Keep
none of your heart or love to your ſelf, but quit fully
both to the leading Spirit of Jeſus. Your love and your
heart, according to the Goſpel-diſpenſation, is not your
own, or at your diſpoſing, whatever property naturall by
law you have over your ſelf;<note place="margin">We are more our own by law, and leſſe our own by the Goſpel.</note> for the law buyes you not.
We are leſs our own, and more Chriſts by the Goſpel, and
more our own by the Law.</p>
               <p>Many profeſs themſelves ſons, and ſo to be led by the
Spirit, yet they have not given eyes, wiſedome, will and
love to the Spirit: they keep a great piece of their heart
and their love to themſelves, and have an inward relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy
and wreſtling againſt the wayes of the Spirit, as yet
remaining debtors to the fleſh, to pay the debt of ſervice
to the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>5. This is comfortable, that Chriſt makes it the travail
of his ſoul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. and his ſoul-ſatisfaction <hi>to ſee his
ſeed,</hi> and to <hi>bring many children to glory,</hi> Heb. 2. 10. So
his ſoules work is upon keeping ſuch as are given to him,
and guiding on his flock, <hi>John</hi> 10. 3, 4. in going before his
own ſheep, in calling them by name, and in leading
them.</p>
               <p>2. He keeps ſuch as come, and <hi>raiſeth them up at the
laſt day,</hi> John 6. 37, 40.</p>
               <p>3. He guides them with prayers, <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. intercedes
for them, to reduce them when they goe out of the way,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1, 2. and all this with ſoul-ſatisfaction and delight,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:119064:234"/>
to get all his off-ſpring and children which the Lord hath
given to him, fairly landed, and ſet in the other ſide of
the ſea, beyond temptations and hazards, beyond ſin and
death, as he hath a fellow-feeling and compaſſion, his
bowels being moved, even now, in heaven with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14, 15. ſo far as is ſuitable to his glorified
ſtate, as our great <hi>High-Prieſt, which hath paſſed into the
heavens.</hi> So his other affections of deſire, as our head, and
natural and kindly care to have all his members guided
ſafe in at the gates of heaven: and he muſt have much
ſoul delight and ſatisfaction, that his own be led with his
holy arm, and gathered in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>We have a looſe faith, the head ſhall care and watch
for us, though we ſleep; that is, Chriſt is graciouſly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to give influences, whether we ſleep or wake, pray or
pray not:<note place="margin">Chriſt cares more for his own body, then the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers care for themſelves.</note> our care can adde nothing to his care; if he
will fail in his truſt, and ſleep, and let us periſh, let him ſee
to his own glory; two cares, one in the head, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the members, are needleſs: nay, but his love and
care, as head, ſends down influences of godly fear and
trembling to the members, that they may work with him,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40.</p>
               <p>2. Our weakneſs of faith errs in the other extremity.
Ah, can my deadneſs and hardneſs be ever ſubdued! If
Chriſt once ſighed for the hardneſs of ſinners hearts,<note place="margin">Chriſts care is now rather more when he is glorified, then leſs.</note> and
wept over the ſlain of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and counted it meat and
drink to bring in the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 4.
34. Now when Chriſt is glorified, and the affections of
love, compaſſion, care, are perfected in glory not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſhould our unbelief ſay he now cares not for the hard
heart and obſtinacy of his redeemed ones? If thy unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
muſt take all the care off Chriſt, and our unbelieving
care muſt doe all, let Chriſt ſleep.</p>
               <p>3. There is a proportion betwixt head and members,
the ſoul-travel of the head in heaven, and the ſoul-travel
of the members on earth in the uſe of all meanes,

and ſleeping members are unſutable. He watches prays,
