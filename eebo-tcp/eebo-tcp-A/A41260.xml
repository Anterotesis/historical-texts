            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Severall Obſervations in Drawing a Head after the Life.</head>
               <p>Therefore if you will draw any Face after the Life, that it may reſemble the Party you Draw it after; take notice in the firſt place of the Phyſiognomy or circumference of the Face, whither it be round or long, fat or leane, big or little; ſo that in the firſt place you muſt be ſure to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57103:5"/>
take the right Phyſiognomy and bigneſs of the Face, and in caſe it be a fat Face you will perceive the Cheeks to make the ſide of the Face ſwell out, add ſo make the Face look as if it were ſquare; and if it be neither too fat nor too leane, it will be round for the moſt part; but if it be a leane Face the Jaw-bones will ſtick out, and the Cheeks fall in, and the Face will be long and ſlender. Obſerve when you Draw the outmoſt circumferences of a Face, to take the Head and all with it, or otherwiſe you may be deceived in Drawing the true bigneſs of a Face, then you muſt diligently and judiciouſly obſerve and diſcerne all the Gentlemaſter touches, which gives the ſpirit and life to a Face, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the graces or diſpoſition of the mind, wherein lyeth the whole grace of the work, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Artiſt, you may eaſily diſcerne a ſmiling countenance in the corners of the mouth when they turn up alittle; you may beſt diſcerne a ſtaid and ſober countenance in the eye, when the upper eye-lid comes ſomewhat over the Ball of the Eye; but a frowning countenance is eaſily diſcerned in the Forehead by the bending of the Eyebrowes, and ſome few wrinckles about the top of the Noſe between the two Eyebrowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a laughing Countenance is eaſily diſcerned all over the Face; but an angry Countenance is diſcerned by extraordinary frownings; there are alſo ſome touches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Eye and Mouth which you muſt diligently obſerve, which gives the ſpirit and life to a Face.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Some generall Rules to be Obſerved in Drawing the Figure of a Naked Man after the Life.</head>
               <p>A ſtanding Figure from the top of the head to the bottome of the feet is eight times the length of the Head, and becauſe you ought to be moſt exact in Drawing the Head, becauſe the whole body muſt be proportioned correſpondently to the Head; therefore I ſhall give you in ſhort ſome ſeverall Rules and Obſervations to Draw a foreright Head. Firſt, Draw an Ovale, then devide that Ovale into four equall parts; the firſt is for the Hair, the ſecond for the Forehead and Browes; the third for the Noſe, the fourth for the Mouth and Chin, as afore written in the Book of Fielettoe. But when you Draw after the life, you are not to follow this Rule exactly, becauſe ſome Men have a long Noſe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57103:5"/>
and another a ſhort; one a high forehead, another a low forehead; Therefore if you look upon a hundred Mens Faces that they all differ one from another, the eyes muſt be placed juſt the length of one eye the one from the other. Then having Drawn the Head, you meaſure out eight times the length of the Head, then the Head is reckoned one of the eight parts; then you muſt Draw a ſtraight Line from the top of the Head to the ſole of the Foote, one Heads length from the Chin, you muſt Draw the Breſts the third length reacheth to the Navell, the fourth to the privities, the fifth reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth juſt to the middle of the Thigh, and the ſixt to the lower part of the Knee, the ſeaventh to the ſmall of the Legg, and the eighth to the Heel and ſole of the Foot: But obſerve as you Draw down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the Head to place the Muſcles in their right places according to nature; and becauſe there are no certain Rules for Drawing the Muſcles but only to obſerve them exactly as they are in the Life. The breadth of the Shoulders containeth two meaſures of the Head, the breadth of the Hipps two meaſures of the Face, and the Armes ſtretched out are eight meaſures of the Head, and if the Breſts be reckoned unto them, ſo the Armes without the Breſts are but ſix meaſures. And note that when an Arme hangeth ſtraight down it reacheth within a ſpan of the Knee: a Hand muſt be no longer then the length of the Face, that when the Hand is ſpread abroad, it muſt as it were cover the Face and no more; It is very neceſſary for one that intends to practiſe to Draw Naked Figures to Draw after good Anatomies of Plaiſter, and when you have practiſed a while, it will learn you to place all your Muſcles according to Nature or Art. There are alſo good Books of Anatomies with Prints and inſtructions to them, which are very uſefull for one that intends to draw a good Naked Figure, which you can never be eminent at, without you underſtand the Anatomy and uſe to Draw after the Life very much.</p>

               <head>Some further Obſervations in Drawing a Naked Figure.</head>
               <p>Whatſoever you Draw, Draw it at firſt very lightly with a Cole, becauſe if it be out of proportion you can the eaſier mend it, and rub it out, and Draw it again anew: but note, that you muſt finiſh
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57103:6"/>
nothing with your Cole, before you ſee every thing is placed right according to Art and proportion and then finiſh it the one after the other as exactly and curiouſly as you can poſſibly in the Drawing a Naked Figure. Obſerve firſt that you draw the Head very exactly, and next the Shoulders in their juſt breadth, as before mentioned, containing two meaſures of the Head; Then you Draw the Trunck of the Body beginning juſt at the Arm-pits, and you may leave the Armes to finiſh till afterwards, and then you proceed to Draw down to the Hipps on both ſides, but be ſure that you exactly obſerve the breadth of the Waſt; and when you have done this, then Draw that Leg firſt which the Body ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth firmeſt upon, then Draw the other which ſtandeth looſer of the two, but be ſure to place that Leg which the Figure ſtands upon firmely and right, upon the ſtraight Line which cometh down from the Head, or elſe the Figure may ſeem to yield one way or the other, and as it were fall; and laſtly you muſt proceed to Draw the Armes and Hands.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>A further Obſervation.</head>
               <p>When you Draw a Naked Figure you muſt judiciouſly and exactly obſerve to place the Joynts and Sinews and Muſcles in their naturall places, according to their proportion, and obſerve that one Joynt be not higher or lower then the other; otherwiſe the Figure will ſeem to be crooked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and out of proportion to the judicious eye; ſee that every parallel Joynt muſt bend moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to Nature, and anſwer the other which is oppoſite to it; and note that the ſtraight ſtroake muſt be ſtruck according to the bending of the Body, ſo that if the Body bowe, the ſtroke muſt bowe alſo, and if the body ſtoope downwards a little, you muſt ſtrike your ſtroake ſloping ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; then make the Shoulder, which ought to ſtand ſtraight over one another, the one to be a little higher then the other, on that ſide which the body turns upon the Shoulders and the other Joynts, which otherwiſe ought to be placed one even againſt another; you muſt make them to yield ſomething lower then that ſide the Figure ſtands firmeſt upon, more or leſs, anſwerable to the ſtooping of the Body; and be ſure to be very exact and carefull in the Drawing your outmoſt circumferences,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57103:6"/>
and to be very carefull in Drawing your Muſcles and Joynts which are in the body; therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſhould place things in their right and natural places, you ſtrike the ſtraight Line from the Pit of the Throat ſtraight down, juſt in the middle of the Body, where you can diſcern the parting of the Ribs. From thence you muſt proceed with your Line quite down to the Feet, and be ſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the bowing and bendings of the Body, and to draw that part which is oppoſite to that which bendeth, to yield and bend accordingly with it: As for example, if one ſide of the Body doth yield or bend inwards, then you muſt make the other ſide for to ſtand out anſwerable, and according to the bending in of the otherſide; and obſerve whenſoever you draw the Back bending in, you muſt make the Belly to yield in according to it, ſo that when the Belly yields in, the Back muſt ſtick out according to proportion; and alſo if the Buttocks ſtick out, then that which is over in oppoſition to it muſt yield in equally. This is not only to be obſerved in theſe parts of the Body, but in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo; as when the Knees bend out, then the Hammes which anſwer to it muſt yield in according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore this Rule is very neceſſary to be obſerved very exactly in all the other Joynts; or elſe peradventure the Body will not have all the natural windings and yieldings, which give the greateſt looſeneſs to any Figure whatſoever. Withall be ſure to uſe your utmoſt endeavour to make things of an anſwerable and equall proportion and bigneſs according to Art, that is to ſay, not to make a Leg or an Arm or any other Joynt, not of an equall and ſuitable bigneſs, but to make one bigger then the other; therefore obſerve to make all the Joynts of an equall bigneſs, both of big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, length, and breadth, but according to proportion. But in caſe any part of the Body yield or turn ſomething away from the Eye, then you muſt decline that part which turneth according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; and likewiſe if any part of the Body do appear to the Eye to foreſhorten, as when it doth hinder the ſight of the full Latitude of that part of the Body: Therefore I ſay upon ſuch occaſions, the Body or part of the Body muſt be made to decline and foreſhorten, according to that proportion that the Eye doth gueſs of it; therefore be ſure to obſerve your exact diſtances one from another, how farre the one is diſtant from the other; you muſt obſerve alſo how much one part of the Body
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57103:7"/>
ſticks out beyond the other; be carefull when you draw a naked Figure to draw nothing hard, but to ſhadow it fine and ſoft as poſſible you can, and not to draw the out-Circumferences ſharp or ſtiff, but as looſe as poſſible.</p>

               <p>The dead-Colouring of a Face is to be done the rougheſt and boldeſt of all; having drawn your Face with Lake and white (as before) you muſt take to the ſaid Colour a little red Lead, tempering it to the Colour of the Cheeks, Lips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but very faintly, becauſe you cannot lighten a deep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, without hazard of ſpoiling the Picture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To begin to Paint</hi>] The firſt Colour to begin the Face with is the red of the Cheeks, and Lips, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrongly, the bottome of the Chin, if the Party be beardleſs; over under and about the Eyes, you will perceive a delicate and faint redneſs, and underneath the Eyes, inclineing to purple Colour, which in fair and beautifull Faces is uſuall, and muſt be obſerved; the tip of the Ear and the roots of the Hair are commonly of the ſame Colour.</p>
               <p>All this you muſt do after the manner of Hatching, with faint and gentle Stroaks, waſhing it all along. In ſhort, in your dead-Colouring you muſt cover your ground with the aforeſaid red, and the ſubſequent Shadows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi>] Be not too curious in your firſt working, but regard a good bold following of Nature, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſmooth Curioſity, the roughneſs of the Colour you may end at another Sitting.</p>

And in going over the Face, be ſure to mark out the hard Shadows in the dark ſide of the Face, under the Noſe, Chin, Eyebrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Light falls, and ſomewhat ſtrong touches in thoſe places. Bring up your work together in an equall roundneſs, not giving perfection to any particular part of the Face, but viſiting all the parts

               <p>You muſt at firſt only draw them with Colour as near as you can ſutable to the life, and after waſh them lightly at the firſt, and then once more peruſe your work, being carefull to fill up the void empty and bare places which are uncovered with Colour, and at laſt deepen it ſomewhat more ſtrongly then before in the deepeſt ſhady places, ſtill carefully obſerving the life.

To do this you muſt uſe the ſame Colour in the ſame places you did before, working, driving, and ſweeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Colours one into another, to the end that nothing be left in your work with a hard edge, uneven, or a lump together, but all ſo ſwept and driven one into another, with the point of ſomewhat a ſharper Pencil then you uſed at firſt as that your Shadows may lie ſoft and ſmooth, being diſperſed and gently extended into all, and towards the lighter parts of the Face, like air or a vapoury ſmoak; but before this you muſt carefully obſerve all the Shadows and Colours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ground behind the Picture</hi>] For the ground behind the Picture, it is commonly blew or crimſon, ſomewhat like a Satin or red Velvet Curtain: If blew you muſt lay it thus; your Biſe being pure and clear waſht, temper as much in a ſhell as will cover a Card, let it be all throughly moiſt and well bound with Gum, then with a ſmall Pencil go about with the ſame Colour the Porphile, that is the utmoſt Stroak, and ambient Superficies of the Picture; this done take a greater Pencil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

waſh over ſomewhat carefully the whole ground that you mean to cover with a blew, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thin and watriſh, and then with a reaſonable big Pencil full of Colour and flowing, lay over that place with a thick and ſubſtantial body of Colour, which before you had only waſht over. In the doing of this you muſt be very ſwift, keeping the Colour moiſt that you have laid, not permitting any part to dry till the whole be covered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Crimſon Ground</hi>] If you would have your ground Crimſon like Satin, you muſt with India-Lake mark out where and in what places you will have theſe ſtrong and hard Lights and Reflections to fall, which is ſeen in Satin or Velvet, there lay your Lights with a thin and watriſh Lake, and while it is yet wet with a ſtronger and darker Colour of Lake thick ground, lay the deepning and hard ſtrong Shadows cloſe by the other lights; your beſt way is to have a piece of Satin before you to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Hair</hi>] Next go over your Hair, heightning and deepning it as you ſhall ſee by the life, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Locks looſely over the ground, which would otherwiſe ſeem unpleaſant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Linnen Shade</hi>] To ſhadow Linnen uſe black, white, a little yellow, and leſs blew; the black muſt be deepned with Ivory-black, with which mix a little Lake, and Indico, or Litmus-blew. Thus much for the ſecond Sitting.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore that you begin to Etch upon Copper, it is very neceſſary to practiſe the Art of Drawing, till you be able if need require to Draw any Head after the Life, or to Draw a deſigne; Therefore if you intend to practiſe the Art of Etching, you will find it very profitable to Draw after good Prints, which are well deſigned and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and when you, have practiſed ſo long that you are able to Coppy any Print, or Drawing very exactly; then Draw after good Heads of Plaiſter or Figures, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your own fancy, which will learn you to ſhadow according to Art, if well obſerved; therefore be ſure when you Draw after Plaiſter, to obſerve very exactly to take the true out-lines or circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and then take notice how the ſhadow falls, then ſhadow it very faint and ſoft, where need requires accordingly. The Prints which I recommend unto you as abſolutely the beſt to learne to Etch after, be the Prints of <hi>Henry Goldſhis</hi> and <hi>Hermon Muller.</hi> Therefore it is very convenient to learn to hatch with the Pen exactly after either of the aforeſaid Prints of <hi>Goldſhis</hi> or <hi>Muller;</hi> and when you have brought it to that perfection, and can Draw very well after Plaiſter, you may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe to Draw after the Life; but before you Draw after the Life, you muſt be very exact and true in your out-lines or circumferences.</p>

               <p>The Copper Plate is the only Object to Etch upon; the Ground is to lay upon the Copper Plate, when they are both warmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Needles are to Hatch withall upon the Ground; the Pencill is to wipe away the bits of Ground, which riſe when you Hatch upon the Ground with your Needles; the Scraper is to ſcrape out any thing that is amiſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Poliſher is to make ſmooth any place that is rough, ſo that you can mend any place that is amiſs according to your own mind; the Gravers are to mend here and there a ſtroake where need requires. But Note, That your Gravers muſt be ground and whet very ſharp and ſmooth upon an Oyl ſtone before you uſe them. Your Compaſſes are of very little uſe in Etching, except it be to meaſure a diſtance, or ſtrike a Circle. The Ruler is uſed to Hatch all the ſtraight Hatches or Lines upon the Plate. The green Wax is uſed to make a Wall round about the edges of your Plate, to keep the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> from runing off from the Plate. The <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is the finiſher of the work, when you have Hatched the deſigne upon the Plate with your Needles. The white Lead is uſed to ſcrape upon the backſide of the Drawing or Print that you Etch after. The Stift is uſed to Draw thorow all the outmoſt Lines or circumferences of the Print or Drawing which you Etch after. The Oyl ſtone is to whet your Gravers upon. Having theſe things in readineſs, Note, that if it be a black Ground that lies upon the Plate, then you muſt take white Lead and rub it upon the backſide of the Print or Drawing which you intend to Etch after; but if it be a white Ground, then you muſt take black Lead, or a piece of Charchoale, and rub on the back of your Print as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>THe manner to make the upright Head by juſt and ſafe Rules without errour, is thus: Firſt form a perfect equall Triangle ſo as you ſee, in what poſition you will, having a reſpect to the Draughts I have preſented with the Lines that form with the Compaſſes a juſt Equilaterall Triangle, which is with 3. Lines juſt and equall every way, turning the Triangle to make the Face upon one of the 3. ſides, be it which you will, either upwards, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, higher or lower, dividing that ſide into 3. equall parts, as in the ſequent Figure. The 1. to ſerve from the lower part of the Hair, to the lower part of the Forehead: The 2. thence, to the under part of the Noſtrills: The 3. to the lower part of the Chin. Now having framed theſe 3. Lines, as I have ſhewed Number 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> draw a little crooked Stroke with a Cole or Chalk out of the right Line, that that may reach to the other point, and that will form the Forehead, From whence draw a waved ſlope Line bending at the end, to form the Noſe either long, ſhort, groſs, or thin, as you would have that; ending that at the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> point, where the Noſtrills end. Then ſubdivide the remaining 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part in the midſt, where the Mouth ſhall be placed, for the parting of the upper and under-Lips. Then frame the Chin, having a reſpect to the perpendicular Line, that that fall not out of the middle of the Chin; adjoyning thereto the under-Chin down to the Throat-pit. So with the other two dividing Lines, the one from the top of the Forehead downwards (and ends in the midſt of the back part of the Ear;) the other proceedeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the Chin, aſcending till that meet with the ſuperior deſcending Line, whoſe interſection directeth the Ear, that the Circumference thereof ſtretch not too far; which in the firſt Chapter I formed by the Rule of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Thus with your judgement take the upper part of the Forehead, and come to deſcribe a great Circular Line a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to form with that the roundneſs of the Head, unto the Nape of the Neck, keeping the proportion that Nature teacheth; and from thence downwards frame the reſt of the Neck, remembring that the tip of the Ear doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the lower part of the Noſtrill. So you may have the Head in what poſition you will, ſo this abandon not the two other Lines; each concurring in their due points.</p>

In the 1. is the Eyes to be placed; in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the Noſtrils: then the lower part divided; in the midſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt the Mouth be formed, as by the Figure may be conceived: alwayes remembring that the Eyes muſt be in the 1.

But to make the Ears in a foreright Face, the Ovall muſt be exceeding narrow, yet proportional; that is, that the Ears be drawn in, and be in height from the Noſtrils to the Eye-brows: and then adjoyn the Neck with the Hair, in ſuch ſort as may ſeem moſt pleaſing to the judicious Eye.</p>

               <p>HItherto have I treated of the Head, both foreright, and in other poſitions; but that you might know all that is needfull for the perfect underſtanding of this profeſſion, it is neceſſary that I ſpecifie the Manner how to draw the Face by an eaſie, abſolute, and fair way. Treating thus, I propound to you Methodicall meanes therein; becauſe my intent is to facilitate the matter in that manner, that without writing thereupon it may be intelligible: For a Draught well made hath that power, that it makes itſelf underſtood without any Diſcourſe of the Author thereon. But I alwayes obſerve both the one and the other alſo; inſtructing by the Draught the intelligence firſt, and afterward by Diſcourſe thereupon. I ſay then that the Foreſhortning which is made only with Frets, Grates, Squares, or with Geometricall inſtruments, breed only a confuſion of Lines, which is not the beſt principle of expert ingenuity; the reaſon whereof is, that it can hardly be meaſured by any Rule, unleſs the whole Body be framed together. Therefore I will ſhew an eaſie Rule, very like to that of the foreright Face; that is, to make a Circular Draught with aſpect upwards, or downwards, as in the foreright Head, where the Traverſe Lines are ſtraight; but theſe go Circularly, as in the Figures in the laſt Chapter going before may be ſeen. For if the Heads flye upwards, the Trace, Strokes, and the Diviſions, muſt be raiſed as I have ſhewed; with Caution that the Ears and Eyes fall not without their due points.</p>

               <p>BEing deſirous to make an upright Head or ſide-Face, without any Triangle or other Meaſure; you ſhall not need alwayes to make the Triangle, but with a little care and practice to form the Eye, which will ſerve for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſufficiently; becauſe the Head and other parts of the Body are to be proportionals, and made from Meaſures, it will eaſily follow, framing many with one and the ſame Stroke, you may not only facilitate it by the Eye and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo accommodate the Hand to trace and draw all things right; for it is true that the Eye will have his place. And I have proved, that having drawn certain Strokes and Draughts from the life of Nature, and reduced it with the Pen and Pencil into Oyl-Colours, I have found it to come off punctually right of a correſpondent bigneſs to that which I have imitated. So that having finiſhed my work, and meaſured it part by part, I have not found any thing diſproportioned, but have alwayes found it fall out right, as I would have it. Therefore I ſay that this Rule and Meaſure which I have ſet down, is not any hinderance to the excellency of the Art, nor will weaken your worth; but will ſerve as a general Advertiſement, being once poſſeſt therewith; and alſo become prevalent when occaſion will require, to make a Head ten times as big as the natural; for that with this Meaſure you ſhall readily frame it right by any great Head; and that becauſe the Underſtanding therein is equally extended; but the more the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is wanting, the more my labour will further, when need requireth. Theſe then I give as principal for the firſt Strokes, as in the next Figure may be perceived, which is from the Forehead, as I have already ſaid, for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Noſe; that is from the lower part of the Hair, to the hollowneſs of the Noſe and the Noſtrils, and from thence to the Chin. It will afterwards be neceſſary to proceed accordingly from Stroke to Stroke, by encreaſing the Strokes until you come to the Head, Number 10. and ſo make it to be divided into 3. parts by the Eye juſtly, without the help of Compaſſes or other Meaſures; and in ſo doing, you may eaſily accuſtome your hand, in ſuch ſort that you may draw all you would, without any labour at all.</p>

               <head>The Manner how to deſcribe a Head every way without Meaſure. <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT will not be needfull alwayes to ſet down the Meaſures which I have before preſcribed, becauſe it will be too troubleſome: But my intent is to ſhew how by an unuſuall manner by me invented, you may form in the Idea, the juſt Meaſures and Diſtances of all ſorts of Heads; and in all Poſitions, having the knowledge of this Rule; and afterwards making ſome Heads without any Triangle, or other manner of Demonſtration, knowing the errors of heights, lengths, and diviſions, into which you may otherwiſe run. Therefore I ſhew in this Figure an eaſie manner that muſt be held; and how with thoſe few Lines, to make the Head in what manner you will.</p>

               <head>Of Childrens Heads. <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT reſteth only for me to treat of the manner how to draw the Heads of Children, with a Rule, invented by me, and not yet by any put forth in writing. Being then deſirous to form the Heads of Children perfectly, and of what imaginable bigneſs you will; take a pair of Compaſſes, and make a perfect equilater-triangular Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and upon each point thereof by turning the Compaſſes round, make a Circle as you ſee, of that bigneſs that they may touch each other: The like done on each, you ſhall ſo have deſcribed 3. Circles, whereof 2. ſhall be even upon one ſide, and the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> behind them, joyned to them both. And this is the 1. demonſtration: In the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, upon that ſide which the two even Rounds are, the one of them ſhall ſerve for the Forehead, and the other for the Throat; and behind both where there is a ſpace, you ſhall make the Noſe, the Mouth, and ſome part of the Chin, with a Stroke near the Throat; afterwards adjoyning the Ear in the place which I ſhew, where we conclude the Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and under thoſe two Circles, joyn a little of the Nape and the Neck; and ſo will the Childes Head be finiſhed in the ſide Face porfill, with the Crown, as you ſee Number 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. In Number 4. I repreſent what force a real Rule and Reaſon hath in deſigning, as if in theſe 3. Circles I ſhould open the excellency of the Art; becauſe as you ſee, there is no point nor Circle but performeth his office, with that convenience that is poſſible; I make you 3. Heads in one Demonſtration, of which at your pleaſure you may leave away 2. and take the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, without danger of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any error therein. But as I uſe the Triangle in the upright or ſide-Head, ſo do I uſe the Square or Quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in the foreright Face; which being firſt deſcribed, will be a guide to place the Circles in their places; as in the 1. Draught I ſhew: In the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> falleth the Eye, the Noſe, and the Mouth: In the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> I finiſh all together, with the under-Chin, Hair, and other Circumſtances. But be alwayes adviſed in this Face, where and how to place the points and bigneſs of the Ear; and to ſituate the Eye, which I have made to avoid confuſion, obſerving the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in practice by the precedent Demonſtration: And ſo your work will come off with the greater life and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
