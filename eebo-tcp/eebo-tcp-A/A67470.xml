            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Did some years
past, present you
with a plain rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the life
of Mr <hi>Richard
Hooker,</hi> that humble man, to
whose memory, <hi>Princes</hi> and the
most <hi>learned of this Nation</hi> have
<pb facs="tcp:56222:3"/>
paid a reverence at the mention of
his name—And, now with Mr.
<hi>Hookers</hi> I present you also, the
life of that <hi>pattern of primitive
piety, Mr. George Herbert;</hi>
and, with his, the life of <hi>Doctor
Donne,</hi> and your friend <hi>Sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Wotton,</hi> all reprinted.—The
two first were written under your
roof: for which reason, if they
were worth it, you might just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
challenge a Dedication. And
indeed, so you might of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
Donnes,</hi> and <hi>Sir Henry
Wottons:</hi> because, if I had
been fit for this Undertaking, it
would not have been by acquir'd
Learning or Study, but by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of forty years friendship,
<pb facs="tcp:56222:3"/>
and thereby the hearing of and
discoursing with your Lordship,
which hath inabled me to make the
relation of these Lives passable in
an eloquent and captious age.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, my Lord, though,
these relations be well-meant Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to the Memory of these
Worthy men: yet, I have so little
Confidence in my performance, that
I beg pardon for superscribing
your name to them; And, desire
all that know your <hi>Lordship,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
this not as a Dedication,
(at least, by which you receive any
addition of honour;) but rather,
as an humble, and a more publick

                  <head>To the Reader.</head>
                  <p>THough, the several Introductions
to these several Lives, have part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared the reasons how, and
why I undertook them: yet, since they are
come to be <hi>review'd,</hi> and, <hi>augmented,</hi>
and <hi>reprinted:</hi> and, the four are become
one Book; I desire leave to inform you
that shall become my Reader, that when
I look back upon my mean abilities, 'tis
not without some little wonder at my self,
that I am come to be publickly in print.
And, though I have in those <hi>Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
declar'd some of the accidental
reasons: yet, let me add this to what is
there said: that, by my undertaking to
collect some notes for <hi>Sir Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
writing the life of <hi>Doctor Donne,</hi>
and <hi>Sir Henry's</hi> dying before he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
it, I became like those that enter
<pb facs="tcp:56222:5"/>
easily into a <hi>Law-sute,</hi> or a <hi>quarrel,</hi> and
having begun, cannot make a fair retreat
and be quiet, when they desire it. And
really, after such a manner, I became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,
into a necessity of writing the <hi>life</hi>
of <hi>Doctor Donne:</hi> Contrary, to my
first Intentions. And that begot a like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of writing the life of his and my
honoured friend, <hi>Sir Henry Wotton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, having writ these two lives; I
lay quiet twenty years, without a thought
of either troubling my self or others, by
any new ingagement in this kind. But,
about that time, <hi>Doct. Ga.</hi> (then Lo. B.
of <hi>Exeter</hi>) publisht <hi>the Life of Mr. Ric.
Hooker,</hi> (so he called it) with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dangerous mistakes, both of him
and <hi>his Books:</hi> that discoursing of
them with his <hi>Grace, Gilbert</hi> that now
is Lord Arch bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he
injoyned me to examine some Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and then rectifie the Bishops mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
by giving the World a truer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Mr. Hooker</hi> and his <hi>Books;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56222:5"/>
and I know I have done so. And, indeed,
till <hi>his Grace</hi> had laid this injunction
upon me, I could not admit a thought of
any fitness in me to undertake it: but
when he had twice injoyn'd me to it, <hi>I</hi>
then trusted his judgment, and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Commands; considering that
if <hi>I</hi> did not, I could not forbear accusing
my self of disobedience: And, indeed of
<hi>Ingratitude</hi> for his many favours. <hi>Thus
I became ingaged into the third
Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the life of <hi>Mr. George Herbert,</hi>
I profess it to be a <hi>Free-will-offering,</hi>
and writ, chiefly to please my self: but
not without some respect to posterity, for
though he was not a man that the next
age can forget, yet many of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
acts and vertues might have been
neglected, or lost, if I had not collected
and presented them to the Imitation of
those that shall succeed us: for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
writing to be both a safer and
truer preserver of mens Vertuous actions,
<pb facs="tcp:56222:6"/>
then tradition. I am to tell the Reader,
that though this life of <hi>Mr. Herbert</hi>
was not by me writ in haste, yet, I
intended it a Review, before it should be
made publick: but, that was not allowed
me, by reason of my absence from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
when 'twas printing; so that the
Reader may finde in it, some double ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and some not very proper, and
some that might have been contracted,
and, some faults that are not justly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
upon me but the Printer: and yet
I hope none so great, as may not by this
Confession purchase pardon, from a good
natur'd Reader.</p>
                  <p>And now, I wish that as <hi>Josephus</hi>
(that learned <hi>Jew</hi>) and others, so these
men had also writ their own lives:
and since 'tis not the fashion of these times;
that their friends would do it for them,
before delayes make it too difficult. And
I desire this the more: because 'tis an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due to the dead,</hi> and <hi>a debt due
to those that shall live, and succeed us.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56222:6"/>
For when the next age shall (<hi>as this do's</hi>)
admire the Learning and clear Reason
which <hi>Doctor Sanderson (the late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Lincoln</hi>) hath demonstrated in
his Sermons and other writings, who,
if they love vertue, would not rejoyce
to know that this good man was as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for the <hi>meekness and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of his life,</hi> as for his great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and as remarkable for his <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
in his long and <hi>patient</hi> suffering
(under them, that then call'd themselves
the Godly Party) for <hi>that Doctrine,</hi>
which he had <hi>preach'd and printed,</hi> in
the happy daies of the Nations and the
Churches peace? And, who would not be
content to have the like account of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
Field,</hi> and others of noted learning?
And though I cannot hope, that my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
or reason can perswade to this:
Yet, I please my self, that I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
my Preface, <hi>with wishing that it
were so.</hi>

                  <p>THough a Familiarity of more
then Forty years continuance,
and the constant experience
of your Love even in the
worst times, be sufficient to
indear our Friendship; yet, I
must confess my Affection much improved, not
onely by Evidences of private Respect to many
that know and love you, but by your new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of a publick Spirit, testified in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
true, and useful Collection of so many
Material Passages as you have now afforded me
in the Life of Venerable Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> of which,
since desired by such a Friend as your self, I
shall not deny to give the Testimony of what
I know concerning him and his learned Books:
but shall first here take a fair occasion to tell
you, that you have been happy in choosing to
write the Lives of three such Persons, as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
hath just cause to honour; which they
will do the more for the true Relation of them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56222:8"/>
by your happy Pen; of all which I shall give
you my unfeigned Censure.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin with my most dear and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Friend Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> late Dean of St.
<hi>Pauls</hi> Church, who not onely trusted me as his
Executor, but three days before his death deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into my hands those excellent Sermons
of his now made publick: professing before Dr.
<hi>Winniff,</hi> Dr. <hi>Monford,</hi> and, I think, your self
then present at his bed side, that it was by my
restless importunity, that he had prepared them
for the Press; together with which (as his best
Legacy) he gave me all his Sermon-Notes,
and his other Papers, containing an Extract of
near Fifteen hundred Authours. How these
were got out of my hands, you, who were the
Messenger for them, and how lost both to me
and your self, is not now seasonable to complain:
but, since they did miscarry, I am glad that the
general Demonstration of his Worth was so fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preserved, and represented to the World by
your Pen in the History of his Life; indeed so
well, that beside others, the best Critick of
our later time (Mr. <hi>John Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
affirm'd to me, <hi>He had not seen a Life
written with more advantage to the Subject, or
more reputation to the Writer, then that of Dr.</hi>
Donnes.</p>
                  <p>After the performance of this task for Dr.
<hi>Donne,</hi> you undertook the like office for our
Friend Sir <hi>Henry Wotton:</hi> betwixt which two
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56222:8"/>
there was a Friendship begun in <hi>Oxford,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in their various Travels, and more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the religious Friendship of Age: and
doubtless this excellent Person had writ the
Life of Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> if Death had not preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him; by which means his and your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collections
for that Work fell to the happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of your Pen: a Work which you would
have declined, if imperious Persuasions had not
been stronger then your modest Resolutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. And I am thus far glad, that the first
Life was so imposed upon you, because it gave
an unavoidable Cause of Writing the second;
if not? 'tis too probable, we had wanted both,
which had been a prejudice to all Lovers of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and ingenious Learning. And let me not
leave my Friend Sir <hi>Henry</hi> without this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
added to yours; That he was a Man of
as Florid a Wit and as Elegant a Pen, as any
former (or ours which in that kind is a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent)
Age hath ever produced.</p>
                  <p>And now having made this voluntary Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our two deceased Friends, I proceed
to satisfie your desire concerning what I know
and believe of the ever-memorable Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi>
who was <hi>Schismaticorum Mallcus,</hi> so great a
Champion for the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Rights
against the Factious Torrent of Separatists, that
then ran high against Church-Discipline: and
in his unanswerable Books continues to be so
against the unquiet Disciples of their Schism,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56222:9"/>
which now under other Names still carry on
their Design; and, who (as the proper Heirs of
Irrational Zeal) would again take into the scarce
closed Wounds of a newly bleeding State and
Church.</p>
                  <p>And first, though I dare not say that I knew
Mr. <hi>Hooker;</hi> yet, as our Ecclesiastical History
reports to the honour of S. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he
lived in the time of St. <hi>John,</hi> and had seen him
in his Childhood; so, I also joy that in my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
I have often seen Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> from
whom, and others, at that time, I have heard
most of the material passages which you relate
in the History of his Life, and from my Father
received such a Character of his <hi>Learning, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi>
and other Virtues, that like Jewels of
unvaluable price, they still cast such a lustre as
Envy or the Rust of Time shall never darken.</p>
                  <p>From my Father I have also heard all the
Circumstances of the Plot to defame him; and
how Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> outwitted his Accusers,
and gained their Confession; and I could give
an account of each particular of that Plot, but
that I judge it fitter to be forgotten, and rot in
the same grave with the malicious Authors.</p>
                  <p>I may not omit to declare, that my Fathers
Knowledge of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was occasioned by
the Learned Dr. <hi>John Spencer,</hi> who after the
Death of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was so careful to preserve
his unvaluable Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56222:9"/>
Books of <hi>ECCLESIASTICAL POLITY,</hi>
and his other Writings, that he procured <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Jackson,</hi> then of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge,
to transcribe for him all Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> remaining
written Papers, many of which were imperfect,
for his Study had been rifled, or worse used, by
Mr <hi>Chark,</hi> and another, of Principles too like his:
but, these Papers were endeavored to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
by his dear friend Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
them as a precious Legacy to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
after whose Death they rested in my hand,
till Dr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
commanded them out of my custody by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
Dr. <hi>John Barkcham</hi> to require, and bring
them to him to his Palace in <hi>Lambeth;</hi> at
which time, I have heard, they were put into
the Bishops Library, and that they remained
there till the Martyrdom of Archbishop <hi>Laud;</hi>
and, were then by the Brethren of that Faction
given with all the Library to <hi>Hugh Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ers,</hi> as
a Reward for his remarkable service in those sad
times of the Churches Confusion; and though
they could hardly fall into a fouler hand; yet
there wanted not other Endeavours to corrupt
and make them speak that Language for which
the Faction then fought, which, indeed was
<hi>To subject the Soveraign Power to the
People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I need not strive to vindicate Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
in this particular, his known Loyalty to his
Prince whilest he lived, the Sorrow expressed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56222:10"/>
by King <hi>James</hi> at his Death, the Value our
late Soveraign (of ever-blessed Memory) put
upon his Works, and now, the singular Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of his Worth by you given in the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of his Life, especially in your <hi>Appendix</hi> to
it, do sufficiently clear him from that Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and I am glad you mention how much
value <hi>Thomas Stapleton,</hi> Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII.
and other Eminent men of the Romish Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
have put upon his Books: having been told
the same in my Youth by Persons of worth that
have travelled <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, I must again congratulate this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
of yours, as now more proper to you
then any other person, by reason of your long
Knowledge and Alliance to the worthy Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Cranmers,</hi> (my old Friends also) who
have been men of noted Wisdom, especially
Mr. <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> whose Prudence added to
that of Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> proved very useful in
the Completing of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> matchless
Books; one of their Letters I herewith send
you, to make use of, if you think fit. And
let me say further; you merit much from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> best Friends then living,
namely, from the ever renowned Archbishop
<hi>Whitgift,</hi> of whose incomparable Worth, with
the Charact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Times, you have given
us a more short and significant Account then I
have received from any other Pen. You have
done much for Sir <hi>Henry Savile,</hi> his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56222:10"/>
and familiar Friend; amongst the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
Monuments of whose Learning (give
me leave to tell you so) two are omitted, his
Edition of <hi>Euclid</hi> but especially his Translation
of <hi>King James his Apology for the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi>
into elegant Latine; which flying in that
dress as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> was by the Pope and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave
sent to <hi>Salamanca</hi> unto <hi>Francisous Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi>
(then residing there as President of that
Colledge) with a Command to answer it.
When he had perfected the Work, which he
calls <hi>Defensio Fidei Catholicae,</hi> it was transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Rome</hi> for a view of the Inquisitors; who
according to their custom blotted out what
they pleased, and (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath been
used since his Death) added whatsoever might
advance the Popes Supremacy, or carry on their
own Interest, commonly coupling <hi>Deponere &amp;
Occidere,</hi> the Deposing and Killing of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
which cruel and unchristian Language
Mr. <hi>John Saltkel,</hi> his <hi>Amanuensis,</hi> when he
wrote at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> (but since a Convert,
living long in my Fathers house) often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
the good Old man (whose Piety and
Charity Mr. <hi>Saltkel</hi> magnified much) not
onely disavowed, but detested. Not to
trouble you further; your Reader (if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your desire, my Approbation of
your Work carries any weight) will here
find many just Reasons to thank you for it;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56222:11"/>
and for this Circumstance here mentioned
(not known to many) may happily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
one to thank him, who heartily wishes
your happiness, and is unfainedly,</p>

betwixt whom, and the Author, there was so mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
a knowledge, and such a friendship contracted
in their Youth, as nothing but death could force
a separation. And though their bodies were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
their affections were not: for, that learned
Knight's love followed his Friends fame beyond
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56222:12"/>
death and the forgetful grave; which he testified
by intreating me, whom he acquainted with his
designe, to inquire of some particulars that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd it;
not doubting but my knowledge of the
Author, and love to his memory, might make my
diligence useful: I did most gladly undertake the
employment, and continued it with great content
'till I had made my Collection ready to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and compleated by his curious Pen: but
then, Death prevented his intentions.</p>
                     <p>When I heard that sad news, and heard also
that these <hi>Sermons</hi> were to be printed, and want
the <hi>Authors Life,</hi> which I thought to be very
remarkable: Indignation or grief (indeed I
know not which) transperted me so far, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed
my forsaken Collections, and resolv'd the
World should see the best plain Picture of the
<hi>Authors Life</hi> that my artless Pensil, guided by
the hand of truth, could present to it.</p>
                     <p>And, if I shall now be demanded as once
<hi>Pompey's</hi> poor bondman was, <q>(The grateful
wretch had been left alone on the Sea-shore,
with the forsaken dead body of his once glorious
lord and master: and, was then gathering the
scatter'd pieces of an old broken boat to make a
funeral pile to burn it (which was the custom
of the Romans;)</q> 
                        <hi>who art thou that alone
hast the honour to bury the body of</hi> Pompey <hi>the
great?</hi> so, who I am that do thus officiously set
the Authors memorie on fire? I hope the question
will prove to have in it more of wonder then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56222:12"/>
But wonder indeed the Reader may, that I
who profess my self artless should presume with my
faint light to shew forth his Life whose very name
makes it illustrious! but be this to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of the person represented: Certain I
am, it is to the advantage of the beholder, who
shall here see the Authors Picture in a natural
dress, which ought to beget faith in what is spoken:
for, he that wants skill to deceive may safely be
trusted.</p>
                     <p>And if the Authors glorious spirit, which now
is in Heaven, can have the leasure to look down
and see me, the poorest, the meanest of all his
friends, in the midst of this officious dutie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
I am that he will not disdain this well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meant
sacrifice to his memory: for, whilst his
Conversation made me and many others happy
below, I know his Humility and Gentleness was
then eminent; and, I have heard Divines say,
those Vertues that were but sparks upon Earth,
become great and glorious flames in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceed further, I am to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Reader to take notice, that when
<hi>Doctor Donn's</hi> Sermons were first printed,
this was then my excuse for daring to
write his life; and, I dare not now appear
without it.</p>

                     <p>MAster <hi>John Donne</hi> was born
in <hi>London,</hi> of good and
vertuous Parents: and,
though his own Learning
and other multiplyed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
may justly appear suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to dignifie both
Himself and his Posteritie:
yet, the Reader may be pleased to know, that
his Father was masculinely and lineally descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from a very antient Family in <hi>Wales,</hi> where
many of his name now live, that deserve and
have great reputation in that Countrey.</p>
                     <p>By his Mother he was descended of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the famous and learned Sir <hi>Tho. Moor,</hi>
sometime Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> as also,
from that worthy and laborious <hi>Judge Rastall,</hi>
who left Posterity the vast Statutes of the Law
of this Nation most exactly abridged.</p>
                     <p>He had his first breeding in his Fathers
house, where a private Tutor had the care of
him, until the ninth year of his age; and, in
his tenth year was sent to the University of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> having at that time a good command
both of the French and Latine Tongue. This
and some other of his remarkable Abilities,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56222:13"/>
made one give this censure of him, <hi>That this
age had brought forth another Picus Mirandula</hi>;
of whom Story sayes, <hi>That he was rather born
than made wise by study.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There he remained in <hi>Hart-Hall,</hi> having for
the advancement of his studies Tutors of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sciences to attend and instruct him, till
time made him capable, and his learning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in publick exercises declared him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to receive his first degree in the Schools,
which he forbore by advice from his friends,
who being for their Religion of the Romish
perswasion, were <hi>conscionably</hi> averse to some
parts of the Oath that is always tendered at
those times; and, not to be refused by those
that expect the titulary honour of their
studies.</p>
                     <p>About the fourteenth year of his age he was
transplanted from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where,
that he might receive nourishment from both
Soils, he staid till his seventeenth year; all
which time he was a most laborious Student,
often changing his studies, but endeavouring
to take no degree, for the reasons formerly
mentioned.</p>
                     <p>About the seventeenth year of his age, he
was removed to <hi>London,</hi> and then admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> with an intent to study the
<hi>Law;</hi> where he gave great testimonies of his
Wit, his Learning, and of his Improvement in
that profession: which never served him for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56222:14"/>
other use than an Ornament and Self-satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>His Father died before his admission into
this Society; and being a Merchant left him
his portion in money (it was 3000 l.) His
Mother and those to whose care he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
were watchful to improve his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and to that end appointed him Tutors
in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and all the <hi>Liberal Sciences,</hi>
to attend him. But with these Arts they were
advised to instil particular Principles of the
<hi>Romish Church,</hi> of which those Tutors profest
(though secretly) themselves to be members.</p>
                     <p>They had almost obliged him to their faith;
having for their advantage (besides many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities)
the example of his dear and pious
Parents, which was a most powerful perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and did work much upon him, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
in his Preface to his <hi>Pseudo-Martyr;</hi> a
Book of which the Reader shall have some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in what follows.</p>
                     <p>He was now entered into the eighteenth
year of his age, and at that time had betrothed
himself to no Religion that might give him
any other denomination than a Christian. And
Reason and Piety had both perswaded him
that there could be no such sin as Schis me, if
an adherence to some visible Church were not
necessary.</p>
                     <p>He did therefore at his entrance into the
nineteenth year of his age (though his youth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56222:14"/>
and strength then promised him a long life) yet
being unresolved in his Religion, he thought
it necessary to rectifie all scruples that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
that: and therefore waving the Law,
and betrothing himself to no Art or Profession,
that might justly denominate him; he begun
to survey the Body of Divinity, as it was then
controverted betwixt the <hi>Reformed</hi> and the
<hi>Roman Church.</hi> And as <hi>Gods blessed Spirit did
then awaken him to the search, and in that industry
did never forsake him,</hi> (they be his own words<note n="*" place="margin">In his Preface to <hi>Pseudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Martyr.</hi>
                        </note>)
<hi>so he calls the same holy Spirit to witness this
Protestation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> that, in that disquisition and search,
he proceeded with humility and diffidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and, by that which he took to be the safest
way; namely, frequent Prayers, and an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
affection to both parties;</hi> and indeed truth
had too much light about her to be hid from so
sharp an Inquirer, and he had too much inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
not to acknowledge he had found
her.</p>
                     <p>Being to undertake this search, he believed
the <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine</hi> to be the best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
of the <hi>Roman cause,</hi> and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
himself to the examination of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
The Cause was weighty, and wilful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
had been inexcusable both towards God
and his own Conscience; he therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in this search with all moderate haste,
and before the twentieth year of his age, did
shew the then <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Gloucester</hi> (whose name
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56222:15"/>
my memory hath now lost) all the Cardinals
works marked with many weighty observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
under his own hand; which works were
bequeathed by him at his death as a Legacy
to a most dear Friend.</p>
                     <p>The year following he resolved to travel;
and the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> going first the <hi>Cales,</hi> and
after the <hi>Island voyages,</hi> he took the advantage
of those opportunities, waited upon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and was an eye-witness of those happy
and unhappy employments.</p>
                     <p>But he returned not back into <hi>England,</hi> till
he had staid some years first in <hi>Italy,</hi> and then
in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he made many useful observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of those Countreys, their Laws and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Government, and returned perfect in their
Languages.</p>
                     <p>The time that he spent in <hi>Spain</hi> was at his
first going into <hi>Italy</hi> designed for travelling the
<hi>Holy Land,</hi> and for viewing <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the
Sepulchre of our Saviour. But at his being in
the furthest parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> the disappointment
of Company, or of a safe Convoy, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of returns for Money into those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
parts, denied him that happiness which
he did often occasionally mention with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploration.</p>
                     <p>Not long after his return into <hi>England,</hi> that
exemplary Pattern of Gravity and Wisdom,
the Lord <hi>Elsemore,</hi> then Keeper of the Great
Seal, and <hi>Lord Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> taking
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56222:15"/>
notice of his Learning, Languages, and other
Abilities, and much affecting his Person and
Condition, took him to be his chief Secretary;
supposing and intending it to be an Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to some more weighty Employment in the
State; for which, his Lordship did often protest,
he thought him very fit.</p>
                     <p>Nor did his Lordship in this time of Master
<hi>Donne's</hi> attendance upon him, account him to
be so much his Servant, as to forget he was his
friend; and to testifie it, did always use him
with much courtesie, appointing him a place
at his own Table, to which he esteemed his
Company and Discourse a great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>He continued that employment for the
space of five years, being daily useful, and not
mercenary to his Friends. During which time
he (I dare not say unhappily) fell into such a
liking, as (with her approbation) increased
into a love with a young Gentlewoman that
lived in that Family, who was Niece to the
Lady <hi>Elsemore,</hi> and daughter to Sir <hi>George
Moor,</hi> then Chancellor of the Garter and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the Tower.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> had some intimation of it, and
knowing prevention to be a great part of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
did therefore remove her with much
haste from that to his own house at <hi>Lothesley,</hi> in
the County of <hi>Surry;</hi> but too late, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of some faithful promises which were so
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56222:16"/>
interchangeably passed, as never to be violated
by either party.</p>
                     <p>These promises were onely known to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seves,
and the friends of both parties used
much diligence, and many arguments to kill o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>
                        </hi> by his honorable
friend and neighbour <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland:</hi>
but it was to Sir <hi>George</hi> so immeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
unwelcome, and so transported him,
that as though his passion of anger and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
might exceed theirs of love and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
he presently engaged his Sister the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Elsemore,</hi> to joyn with him to procure her
Lord to discharge Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> of the place he
held under his Lordship. This request was
followed with violence; and though Sir
<hi>George</hi> were remembred, that Errors might be
overpunished, and desired therefore to forbear
till second considerations might clear some
scruples, yet he became restless until his suit
was granted, and the punishment executed.
And though the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> did not at
Mr. <hi>Donnes</hi> dismission, give him such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
as the great Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the
fifth, did of his Secretary <hi>Eraso,</hi> when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him to his Son and Successor <hi>Philip</hi> the
Second; saying, <hi>That in his</hi> Eraso, <hi>he gave to
him a greater gift then all his Estate, and all the
Kingdomes which he then resigned to him:</hi> yet
he said, <hi>He parted with a Friend, and such a
Secretary as was fitter to serve a King then a
subject.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet this Physick of Mr. <hi>Donnes</hi> dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was not strong enough to purge out all
Sir <hi>George's</hi> choler, for he was not satisfied
till Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> and his sometime Compupil
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56222:17"/>
in <hi>Cambridge</hi> that married him, namely, <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Brook</hi> (who was after Doctor in Divinity,
and Master of Trinity Colledge) and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mr. <hi>Christopher Brook,</hi> sometime Mr.
<hi>Donnes</hi> Chamber-fellow in <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> who
gave Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> his Wife, and witnessed the
marriage, were all committed, and to three
several prisons.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> was first enlarged, who neither
gave rest to his body or brain, nor to any friend
in whom he might hope to have an interest, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he had procured an enlargement for his two
imprisoned friends.</p>
                     <p>He was now at liberty, but his dayes were
still cloudy: and being past these troubles,
others did still multiply upon him; for his
wife was (to her extreme sorrow) detained from
him; and though with <hi>Jacob</hi> he endured not
an hard service for her, yet he lost a good one
and was forced to make good his title to her,
and to get possession of her by a long and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
suit in Law; which proved troublesom and
chargeable to him, whose youth, and travel,
and needless bounty, had brought his estate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a narrow compass.</p>
                     <p>It is observed, and most truly, that silence
and submission are charming qualities, and
work most upon passionate men; and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so with Sir <hi>George;</hi> for these and a general
report of Mr. <hi>Donnes</hi> merits, together with
his winning behaviour, (which when it would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56222:17"/>
intice, had a strange kind of elegant irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
art) these and time had so dispassionated
Sir <hi>George,</hi> that as the world had approved his
Daughters choice, so he also could not but
see a more then ordinary merit in his new
son: and this at last melted him into so much
remorse (for Love and Anger are so like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
as to have hot and cold fits; and love
in Parents, though it may be quenched, yet
is easily rekindled, and expires not, till death
denies mankind a natural heat) that he labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Sons restauration to his place; using
to that end both his own and his Sisters pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to her Lord; but with no success; for his
Answer was, <hi>That though he was unfeignedly
sorry for what he had done, yet it was inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with his place and credit, to discharge and
readmit servants at the request of passionate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Georges</hi> endeavour for Mr. <hi>Donnes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admission,
was by all means to be kept se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
(for men do more naturally reluct for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
then submit to put on those blemishes
that attend their visible acknowledgment.)
But however it was not long before Sir <hi>George</hi>
appeared to be so far reconciled, as to wish
their happiness, and not to deny them his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

any means that might conduce to their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood.</p>
                     <p>Mr <hi>Donnes</hi> estate was the greatest part spent
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56222:18"/>
in many and chargeable Travels, Books and
dear-bought Experience: he out of all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
that might yield a support for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and wife, who had been curiously and
plentifully educated; both their natures ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
and accustomed to conferr, and not to
receive Courtesies: These and other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
but chiefly that his wife was to bear
a part in his sufferings surrounded him with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sad thoughts, and some apparent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of want.</p>
                     <p>But his sorrows were lessened and his wants
prevented by the seasonable courtesie of their
noble kinsman Sir <hi>Francis Wolly</hi> of <hi>Pirford</hi> in
<hi>Surrie,</hi> who intreated them to a cohabitation
with him; where they remained with much
freedom to themselves, and equal content to
him for many years; and, as their charge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
(she had yearly a child) so did his love
and bounty.</p>
                     <p>It hath been observed by wise and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
men, that Wealth hath seldom been the
Portion, and never the Mark to discover good
People; but, that Almighty God, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
all things wisely, hath of his abundant
goodness denied it (he onely knows why) to
many, whose minds he hath enriched with the

whose necessary and daily expences were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

there was a most generous offer made him for
the moderating of his worldly cares; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of which shall be the next employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my Pen.</p>
                     <p>God hath been so good to his Church, as to
afford it in every age some such men to serve
at his Altar as have been piously ambitious of
doing good to mankind; a disposition that
is so like to God himself, that it owes it self
only to him who takes a pleasure to behold it
in his Creatures. These times he did bless with
many such; some of which still live to be Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
of Apostolical Charity, and of more
than Humane Patience. I have said this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have occasion to mention one of them
in my following discourse; namely, Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
the most laborious and learned Bishop of
<hi>Durham,</hi> one that God hath blessed with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
intellectuals, and a cheerful heart at the
age of 94 years (and is yet living:) one that
in his days of plenty had so large a heart as to
use his large Revenue to the encouragement of
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Vertue;</hi> and is now (be it spoken
with sorrow) reduced to a narrow estate, which
he embraces without repining; and still shews
the beauty of his mind by so liberal a hand, as
if this were an age in which <hi>to morrow were to
care for it self.</hi> I have taken a pleasure in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56222:19"/>
the Reader a short, but true character of
this good man, from whom I received this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
relation. He sent to Mr. <hi>Donne,</hi> and
intreated to borrow an hour of his time for a
Conference the next day. After their meeting
there was not many minutes passed before he
spake to Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> to this purpose; <q>Mr. <hi>Donne,</hi>
The occasion of sending for you is to propose
to you what I have often revolv'd in my own
thought since I last saw you: which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
I will not do but upon this condition,
that you shall not return me a present answer,
but forbear three days, and bestow some part
of that time in Fasting and Prayer; and after
a serious consideration of what I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
then return to me with your answer.
Deny me not, Mr. <hi>Donne,</hi> for it is the effect
of a true love, which I would gladly pay as a
debt due for yours to me.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This request being granted, the
Doctor exprest himself thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Mr. <hi>Donne,</hi> I know your Education and
Abilities; I know your expectation of a State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employment;
and I know your fitness for it;
and I know too the many delays and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
that attend Court-promises; and let
me tell you, my love begot by our long friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
our familiarity and your merits hath
prompted me to such an inquisition of your
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56222:19"/>
present temporal estate, as makes me no
stranger to your necessities, which are such as
your generous spirit could not bear, if it were
not supported with a pious Patience: you
know I have formerly perswaded you to wave
your Court-hopes, and enter into holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
which I now again perswade you to
embrace, with this reason added to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
request: The King hath yesterday made
me Dean of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and I am possessed of a
Benefice, the profits of which are equal to
those of my Deanry; I will think my Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
enough for my maintenance (who am and
resolve to die a single man) and will quit my
Benefice, and estate you in it, (which the
Patron is willing I shall do) if God shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
your heart to embrace this motion.
<hi>Remember,</hi> Mr. <hi>Donne,</hi> no mans Education or
Parts make him too good for this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>which is to be an Ambassadour for the
God of glorie, who by a vile death opened the
gates of life to mankind.</hi> Make me no present
answer, but remember your promise, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to me the third day with your Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the hearing of this, Mr. <hi>Donne's</hi> faint
breath and perplext countenance gave a visible
testimony of an inward conflict; but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his promise and departed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
an answer till the third day, and then
it was to this effect;</p>
                     <p>

                        <q>My most worthy and most dear friend,
since I saw you I have been faithful to my
promise, and have also meditated much of
your great kindness, which hath been such as
would exceed even my gratitude; but that
it cannot do; and more I cannot return you;
and I do that with an heart full of Humility
and Thanks, though I may not accept of
your offer; but, Sir, my refusal is not for
that I think my self too good for that calling,
for which Kings, if they think so, are not
good enough: nor for that my Education
and Learning, though not eminent, may not,
being assisted with God's Grace and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

have been so visible to some men, that
though I have, I thank God, made my peace
with him by penitential resolutions against
them, and by the assistance of his Grace ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
them my affections; yet this, which
God knows to be so, is not so visible to man,
as to free me from their censures, and it may
be that sacred calling from a dishonour. And
besides, whereas it is determined by the best
of <hi>Casuists,</hi> that <hi>God's Glory should be the first
end, and a maintenance the second motive to
embrace that calling;</hi> and though each man
may propose to himself both together; yet
the first may not be put last without a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56222:20"/>
of Conscience, which he that searches
the heart will judge. And truly my present
condition is such, that if I ask my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
whether it be reconcileable to that
rule, it is at this time so perplexed about it,
that I can neither give my self nor you an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
You know, Sir, who sayes, <hi>Happy is
that man whose Conscience doth not accuse him
for that thing which he does.</hi> To these I might
adde other reasons that disswade me; but I
crave your favour that I may forbear to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them, and thankfully decline your
offer.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was his present resolution, but the heart
of man is not in his own keeping; and he was
destined to this sacred service by an higher
hand; a hand so powerful, as at last forced him
to a compliance: of which I shall give the
Reader an account before I shall give a rest to
my Pen.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Donnne</hi> and his wife continued with Sir
<hi>Francis Wolly</hi> till his death: a little before
which time, Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was so happy as to
make a perfect reconciliation betwixt Sir
<hi>George</hi> and his forsaken son and daughter; Sir
<hi>George</hi> conditioning by bond, to pay to Mr.
<hi>Donne</hi> 800 l. at a certain day, as a portion
with his wife, or 20 l. quarterly for their
maintenance: as the interest for it, till the
said portion was paid.</p>
                     <p>Most of those years that he lived with Sir
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56222:21"/>
                        <hi>Francis,</hi> he studied the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Cannon Laws;</hi>
in which he acquired such a perfection, as was
judged to hold proportion with many who
had made that study the employment of their
whole life.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Francis</hi> being dead, and that happy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
dissolved, Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> took for himself an
house in <hi>Micham</hi> (near to <hi>Croydon</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi>) a
place noted for good air and choice company:
there his wife and children remained: and for
himself he took lodgings in <hi>London,</hi> near to
White-Hall, whither his friends and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
drew him very often, and where he
was as often visited by many of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and others of this Nation, who used him
in their Counsels of greatest considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Nor did our own Nobility onely value and
favour him, but his acquaintance and friendship
was sought for by most Ambassadours of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Nations, and by many other strangers,
whose learning or business occasioned their stay
in this Nation.</p>
                     <p>He was much importuned by many friends
to make his constant residence in <hi>London,</hi> but
he still denyed it, having setled his dear wife
and children at <hi>Micham,</hi> and near some friends
that were bountiful to them and him: for they,
God knows, needed it: and that you may the
better now judge of the then present Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his minde and fortune, I shall present

                           <p>—And the reason why I did not send an
answer to your last weeks letter, was, because it
found me under too great a sadness; and at present
'tis thus with me: There is not one person, but
my self, well of my family: I have already lost
half a Child, and with that mischance of hers,
my wife is fallen into such a discomposure, as
would afflict her too extremely, but that the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of all her children stupifies her: of one of
which, in good faith, I have not much hope:
and these meet with a fortune so ill provided for
Physick, and such relief, that if God should ease
us with burtals, I know not how to perfome even
that: but I flatter my self with this hope, that I
am dying too: for, I cannot waste faster then by
such griefs. As for,—</p>

                        <body>
                           <p>—For, we hardly discover a sin, when it
is but an omission of some good, and no accusing
act; with this or the former, I have often sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
my self to be overtaken; which is, with an
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56222:22"/>
over earnest desire of the next life: and though
I know it is not mearly a weariness of this, because
I had the same desire when I went with the tide,
and injoyed fairer hopes then I now doe: yet I
doubt worldly troubles have increased it: 'tis
now Spring, and all the pleasures of it displease
me; every other tree blossoms, and I wither: I
grow older and not better; my strength demini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
and my lode grows heavier; and yet, I
would fain be or do something; but that I cannot
tell what, is no wonder in this time of my sadness,
for, to chuse is to do, but to be no part of my body,
is as to be nothing, and so I am, and shall so judge
my self, unless I could be so incorporated into a
part of the world, as by business to contribute
some sustentation to the whole. This I made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
I began early when I understood the study
of our Laws: but was diverted by leaving that
and imbracing the worst voluptuousness, <hi>an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droptique
immoderate desire of humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and languages:</hi> Beautiful ornaments indeed
to men of great fortunes; but mine was grown
so low as to need an occupation: which I thought I
entered well into it, when I subjected my self to
such a service as I thought might exercise my poor
abilities: and there I stumbled, and fell too: and
now I am become so little, or such a nothing, that I
am not a subject good enough for one of my own
letters,—I fear my present discontent does
not proceed from a good root, that I am so well
content to be nothing, that is, dead. But, Sir,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56222:22"/>
though my fortune hath made me such, as that I
am rather a Sickness or a Disease of the world,
than any part of it, and therefore neither love it
nor life; yet I would gladly live to become some
such thing as you should not repent loving me:
Sir, your own Soul cannot be more zealous of your
good then I am, and, God who loves that zeal in
me, will not suffer you to doubt it: you would
pity me now, if you saw me write, for my pain
hath drawn my head so much awry, and holds it
so, that my eye cannot follow my pen. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
receive you into my Prayers with mine own
weary soul, and, Commend my self to yours. I
doubt not but next week will bring you good news,
for I have either mending or dying on my side:
but, If I do continue longer thus, I shall have
Comfort in this, That my blessed Saviour in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
his Justice upon my two worldly parts,
<hi>my Fortune</hi> and <hi>my Body,</hi> reserves all his
Mercy for that which most needs it, <hi>my Soul?</hi>
that is, I doubt, too like a Porter, which is very
often near the gate, and yet goes not out. Sir, I
profess to you truly, that my lothness to give over
writing now, seems to my self a sign that I shall
write no more—</p>

of his narrow fortune, and the perplexities of
his generous minde, and thus it continued
with him for about two years; all which time
his family remained constantly at <hi>Micham,</hi> and
to which place he often retir'd himself, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined
some dayes to a constant study of some
points of Controversy betwixt the <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Roman Church;</hi> and especially those of <hi>Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
and <hi>Allegiance:</hi> and, to that place and such
studies he could willingly have wedded himself
during his life: but the earnest perswasion of
friends became at last to be so powerful as to
cause the removal of himself and family to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where Sir <hi>Robert Drewry,</hi> a Gentleman of
very noble estate, and a more liberal mind, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
him a very choice and useful house rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free,
next to his own in <hi>Drewry-lane;</hi> and was
also a cherisher of his studies, and such a friend
as sympathized with him and his in all their joy
and sorrows.</p>
                     <p>Many of the Nobility were watchful and
solicitous to the King for some secular prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for him: His Majesty had formerly both
known and put a value upon his company, and
had also given him some hopes of a State-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
being alwayes much pleased when
Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> attended him, especially at his
meals, where there were usually many deep dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of general learning, and very often
friendly debates or disputes of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56222:23"/>
his Majesty and those Divines, whose
places required their attendance on him at those
times: particularly the Dean of the Chappel;
who then was Bishop <hi>Montague)</hi> the publisher of
the learned and eloquent Works of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty)
and the most reverend Doctor <hi>Andrews,</hi>
the late learned Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who then
was the Kings Almoner.</p>
                     <p>About this time there grew many disputes
that concerned the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi>
in which the King had appeared and
engaged himself by his publick writings now
extant: and his Majesty discoursing with Mr.
<hi>Donne</hi> concerning many of the reasons which
are usually urged against the taking of those
Oaths, apprehended such a validity and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in his stating the Questions, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to them, that his Majesty commanded
him to bestow some time in drawing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
into a method, and then write his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to them: and having done that, not to
send, but be his own messenger and bring them
to him. To this he presently applyed himself,
and within six weeks brought them to him
under his own hand-writing, as they be now
printed, the Book bearing the name of <hi>Pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-martyr.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the King had read and considered
that Book, he perswaded Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> to enter
into the Ministry; to which at that time he
was, and appeared very unwilling, apprehending
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56222:24"/>
it (such was his mistaking modesty) to be too
weighty for his Abilities; and though his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had promised him a favour, and many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of worth mediated with his Majesty for
some secular employment for him, to which his
Education had apted him, and particularly the

                        </gap>
then denyed not, yet he deferred it for almost
three years. All which time he applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to an incessant study of Textual Divinity,
and to the attainment of a greater perfection in
the learned Languages, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the first and most blessed times of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56222:24"/>
when the Clergy were look'd upon
with reverence, and deserved it, when they
overcame their opposers by high examples of
Vertue, by a blessed Patience and long Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
those onely were then judged worthy
the Ministry, whose quiet and meek spirits did
make them look upon that sacred calling with
an humble adoration and fear to undertake it;
which indeed requires such great degrees of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi>
and <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>care,</hi> that none but such
were then thought worthy of that celestial
dignity. And such onely were then sought out,
and solicited to undertake it. This I have
mentioned because forwardness and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
could not in Mr. <hi>Donne,</hi> as in many
others, be an argument of insufficiency or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitness
for he had considered long, and had
many strifes within himself concerning the
strictness of life and competency of learning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in such as enter into sacred Orders; and
doubtless, considering his own demerits, did
humbly ask God with St. <hi>Paul, Lord, who is
sufficient for these things?</hi> and, with meek
<hi>Moses, Lord, who am I?</hi> And sure, if he had
consulted with flesh and blood, he had not put
his hand to that holy lough. But, God who
is able to prevail, wrestled with him, as the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
did with <hi>Jacob, and marked him;</hi> mark'd
him for his own; mark'd him with a blessing;
a blessing of obedience to the motions of his
blessed Spirit. And then, as he had formerly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56222:25"/>
asked God with <hi>Moses, Who am I?</hi> So now
being inspired with an apprehension of Gods

joy, and a perswasion to be constant in his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
purpose, he proceeded with all conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
speed to ordain him both <hi>Deacon</hi> and
<hi>Priest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>English Church</hi> had gain'd a second
St. <hi>Austine,</hi> for, I think, none was so like him
before his Conversion: none so like St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
after it: and if his youth had the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the one, his age had the excellencies of
the other, the learning and holiness of both.</p>
                     <p>And now all his studies which had been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
diffused, were all concentred in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.
Now he had a new calling, new
thoughts, and a new imployment for his wit
and eloquence. Now all his earthly affections
were changed into divine love; and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of his own soul were ingaged in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of others: In preaching the glad tidings
of Remission to repenting Sinners; and peace to
each troubled soul. To these he app'yed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with all care and diligence; and now, such
a change was wrought in him, that he could
say with David, <hi>Oh how amiable are thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,
O Lord God of Hosts!</hi> Now he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
openly, <hi>that when he required a temporal,
God gave him a spiritual blessing.</hi> And that, <hi>he
was now gladder to be a door-keeper in the house
of God, then he could be to injoy the noblest of all
temporal imployments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Presently after he entred into his holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
the King sent for him, and made
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56222:26"/>
him his Chaplain in ordinary; and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to take a particular care for his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>And though his long familiarity with Scholars
and persons of greatest quality, was such as
might have given some men boldness enough
to have preached to any eminent Auditory, yet
his modesty in this imployment was such, that
he could not be perswaded to it, but went usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accompanied with some one friend, to
preach privately in some village, not far from
<hi>London:</hi> his first Sermon being preached at
<hi>Paddington.</hi> This he did, till His Majesty sent
and appointed him a day to preach to him at
<hi>White-hall,</hi> and, though much were expected
from him, both by His Majesty and others
yet he was so happy (which few are) as to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie

they will receive a double witness for what I
say, it being attested by a Gentleman of worth,

                     <p>That Summer, in the very same moneth in
which he entred into sacred Orders, and was
made the <hi>Kings Chaplain,</hi> His Majesty then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Progress, was intreated to receive an
entertainment in the University of <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
And Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> attending his Majesty, at
that time, his Majesty was pleased to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him to the University, to be made <hi>Doctor</hi>
in <hi>Divinity; Doctor Harsnet</hi> (after Archbishop
of <hi>York</hi>) was then <hi>Vice-Chancellour,</hi> who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be the Author of that learned
Book the <hi>Pseudo-Martyr,</hi> required no other
proof of his Abilities, but proposed it to the
<hi>University,</hi> who presently assented, and exprest
a gladness, that they had such an occasion to
intitle him to be theirs.</p>
                     <p>His Abilities and Industry in his Profession
were so eminent, and he so known and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by Persons of Quality, that within the
first year of his entring into sacred Orders, he
had fourteen Advowsons of several Benefices
presented to him: But they were in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and he could not leave his beloved <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to which place he had a natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
having received both his Birth and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in it, and, there contracted a friendship
with many, whose conversation multiplyed the
joyes of his life: But, an imployment that might
affixe him to that place would be welcome, for
he needed it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56222:27"/>Immediately after his return from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
his wife died, leaving him a man of an
unsetled estate, and (having buried five) the
careful father of seven children then living, to
whom he gave a voluntary assurance never to
bring them under the subjection of a step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother;
which promise he kept most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
burying with his tears all his earthly joyes
in his most dear and deserving wives grave; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
himself to a most retired and solitary
life.</p>
                     <p>In this retiredness which was often from the
sight of his dearest friends, he became <hi>crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the world,</hi> and all those vanities, those
imaginary pleasures that are dayly acted on
that restless stage; and, they crucified to him.
Nor is it hard to think (being passions may be
both changed and heightned by accidents) but
that that abundant affection which once was
betwixt him and her, who had long been the
delight of his eyes, the Companion of his
youth; her, with whom he had divided so
many pleasant sorrows and contented fears, as
Common-people are not capable of; She,
being now removed by death, a commeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grief took as full a possession of him as joy
had done; and so indeed it did: for, now his
very soul was elemented of nothing but sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
now grief took so full a possession of
his heart, as to leave no place for joy: If it did,
It was a joy to be alone, where like a <hi>Pelican in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56222:28"/>
the wilderness,</hi> he might bemoan himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
witness or restraint, and pour forth his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
like <hi>Job</hi> in the days of his affliction, <hi>Oh
that I might have the desire of my heart! Oh that
God would grant the thing that I long for!</hi> For
then, <hi>as the grave is become her house,</hi> so I would
hasten to make it mine also; <hi>that we two might
there make our beds together in the dark.</hi> Thus
as the <hi>Israelites</hi> sate mourning by the rivers
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when they remem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>red <hi>Sion;</hi> so
he gave some ease to his oppressed heart by
thus venting his sorrows: Thus he began the
day, and ended the night; ended the restless
night and began the weary day in <hi>Lamentations.</hi>
And, thus he continued till a consideration of
his new ingagements to God, and St. <hi>Pauls W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

is me, if I preach not the Gospel:</hi> disper'st those
sad clouds that had now benighted his hopes,
and forc'd him to behold the light.</p>
                     <p>His first motion from his house was to
preach, where his beloved wife lay buried (in
St <hi>Clements</hi> Church, near Temple-Bar <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)</hi>
and his Text was a part of the Prophet
<hi>Jeremy's</hi> Lamentation: <hi>Lo, I am the man that
have seen affliction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed, his very words and looks testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to be truly such a man; and they, with
the addition of his sighs and tears, exprest in
his Sermon, did so work upon the affections of
his hearers, as melted and moulded them into
a companionable sadness; and so they left the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56222:28"/>
Congregation; but then their houses presented
them with objects of diversion, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him with no diversions, but with fresh
objects of sorrow, in beholding many helpless
children, a narrow fortune, and, a considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the many cares and casualties that attend
their education.</p>
                     <p>In this time of sadness he was importuned by
the grave Benchers of <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> once the
friends of his youth, to accept of their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
which by reason of Dr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> removal
from thence was then void: of which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
being most glad to renew his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
friendship with those whom he so much
loved, and where he had been a <hi>Saul,</hi> though
not to persecute Christianity, or to deride it,
yet in his irregular youth to neglect the visible
practise of it: there to become a <hi>Paul,</hi> and
preach salvation to his beloved brethren.</p>
                     <p>And now his life was as a <hi>Shining light</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his old friends: now he gave an ocular
testimony of the strictness and regularity of it;
now he might say as St <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
Be ye followers of me, as I follow Christ,
and walk as yee have me for an example;</hi> not the
example of a busie-body; but, of a contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
a harmless, an humble and an holy life and
conversation.</p>
                     <p>The love of that noble society was expressed
to him many wayes: for, besides fair lodgings
that were set apart and newly furnished for him,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56222:29"/>
with all necessaries, other courteesies were
daily added; indeed so many and so freely, as
if they meant their gratitude should exceed his
merits; and, in this love-strife of desert and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality,
they continued for the space of two

which time the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> died,
and the Palsgrave, who had lately married the
Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Kings onely daugher, was
elected and crowned King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
beginning of many miseries in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>James,</hi> whose Motto (<hi>Beati pacifici)</hi>
did truly speak the very thoughts of his heart,
endeavoured first to prevent, and after to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the discords of that discomposed State;
and amongst other his endeavours did then send
the Lord <hi>Hay</hi> Earl of <hi>Doncaster</hi> his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
to those unsetled Princes; and by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
command from his Majesty Dr <hi>Donne</hi> was
appointed to assist and attend that employment
to the Princes of the Union: for which the
Earl was most glad, who had alwayes put a
great value on him, and taken a great pleasure
in his conversation and discourse: and his friends
of <hi>Lincolns Inne</hi> were as glad, for, they feared
that his immoderate study and sadness for his
wives death, would, as <hi>Jacob</hi> said, <hi>make his
daies few,</hi> and respecting his bodily health, <hi>evil</hi>
too: and of this there were some visible signs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56222:29"/>At his going he left his friends of <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi>
and they him with many reluctations:
for, though he could not say as S. <hi>Paul</hi> to his
<hi>Ephesians, Behold you to whom I have preached
the Kingdom of God, shall from henceforth see my
face no more;</hi> yet, he believing himself to be
in a Consumption, questioned, and they feared
it: all concluding that his troubled mind, with
the help of his unintermitted studies, hastened
the decays of his weak body: And God turned
it to the best; for this employment (to say
nothing of the event of it) did not onely divert
him from those too serious studies and sad
thoughts, but seemed to give him a new life
by a true occasion of joy, to be an eye-witness
of the health of his most dear and most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Mistress the Qu. of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in a forraign
Nation; and, to be a witness of that gladness
which she expressed to see him: Who, having
formerly known him a Courtier, was much
joyed to see him in a Canonical habit, and more
glad to be an ear-witness of his excellent and
powerful Preaching.</p>
                     <p>About fourteen moneths after his departure
out of <hi>England,</hi> he returned to his friends of
<hi>Lincolns-Inne</hi> with his sorrows moderated, and
his health improved; and there betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his constant course of Preaching.</p>
                     <p>About a year after his return out of <hi>Germany,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Cary</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and by
his removal the Deanry of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56222:30"/>
the King sent to Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to attend him at Dinner the next day.
When his Majesty was sate down, before he had
eat any meat, he said after his pleasant manner,
Dr. <hi>Donne, I have invited you to Dinner; and,
though you sit not down with me, yet I will carve
to you of a dish that I know you love well; for
knowing you love</hi> London, <hi>I do; therefore make
you Dean of</hi> Pauls; <hi>and when I have dined,
then do you take your beloved dish home to your
study; say grace there to your self, and much
good may it do you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Immediately after he came to his Deanry,
he employed work-men to repair and beautifie
the Chappel; suffering, as holy <hi>David</hi> once
vowed, <hi>his eyes and temples to take no rest, till he
had first beautified the house of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next quarter following, when his Father-in-law
Sir <hi>George Moor,</hi> (whom Time had made
a lover and admirer of him,) came to pay to
him the conditioned summe of twenty pounds;
he refused to receive it, and said (as good <hi>Jacob</hi>
did, when he heard his beloved son <hi>Joseph</hi> was
alive, <hi>It is enough,)</hi> You have been kind to me
and mine: I know your present condition is
such as not to abound: and I hope mine is
or will be such as not to need it: I will therefore
receive no more from you upon that contract;
and in testimony of it freely gave him up his
bond.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after his admission into his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56222:30"/>
Deanry, the Vicarage of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> in the
West, <hi>London,</hi> fell to him by the death of
Dr. <hi>White,</hi> the Advowson of it having been
given to him long before by his honourable
friend, <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorset,</hi> then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
and confirmed by his brother the late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
<hi>Edward,</hi> both of them men of much
honour.</p>
                     <p>By these and another Ecclesiastical endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which fell to him about the same time,
given to him formerly by the Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> he
was enabled to become charitable to the poor,
and kind to his friends, and to make such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for his children, that they were not left
scandalous, as relating to their or his Profession
and Quality.</p>
                     <p>The next <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was within that
present year, he was chosen <hi>Prolocutor</hi> to the
<hi>Convocation;</hi> and about that time was appointed
by his Majesty, his most gracious Master, to
preach very many occasional Sermons, as at
St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Cross, and other places. All which
employments he performed to the admiration
of the Representative Body of the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of this Nation.</p>
                     <p>He was once, and but once, clouded with the
Kings displeasure; and, it was about this
time; which was occasioned by some mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
whisperer, who had told his Majesty that
Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> had put on the general humour of
the Pulpits, and was become busie in insinuating
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56222:31"/>
a fear of the Kings inclining to <hi>Popery,</hi> and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of his Government: and particularly, for
his then turning the Evening Lectures into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techising,</hi>
and expounding the <hi>Prayer</hi> of our
<hi>Lord,</hi> and of the <hi>Belief,</hi> and <hi>Commandments.</hi>
His Majesty was the more inclineable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this, for that a Person of Nobility and
great note, betwixt whom and Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> there
had been a great friendship, was at this very
time discarded the Court (I shall forbear his
name, unless I had a fairer occasion) and justly
committed to prison; which begot many ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in the common people, who in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
think they are not wise, unless they be busie
about what they understand not: and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
about Religion.</p>
                     <p>The King received this news with so much
discontent and restlesness, that he would not
suffer the Sun to set and leave him under this
doubt; but sent for Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> and required
his answer to the Accusation; which was so
clear and satisfactory, that the King said <hi>he was
right glad he rested no longer under the suspicion.</hi>
When the King had said this, Doctor <hi>Donne</hi>
kneeled down and thanked his Majesty, and
protested his answer was faithful and free from
all collusion, and therefore <hi>desired that he might
not rise, till, as in like cases he always had from
God, so he might have from his Majesty, some as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that he stood clear and fair in his opinion.</hi>
Then the King raised him from his knees with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56222:31"/>
his own <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>protested he believ'd him: and
that he knew he was an honest man, and doubted
not but that he loved him truly.</hi> And, having
thus dismissed him, he called some Lords of his
Council into his Chamber, and said with much
earnestness, <hi>My Doctor is an honest man: and my
Lords, I was never better satisfied with an answer
then he hath now made me: and I always rejoyce
when I think that by my means he became a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was made Dean the fiftieth year of his
age; and in his fifty fourth year a dangerous
sickness seized him, which inclined him to a
Consumption. But God, as <hi>Job</hi> thankfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

intellectuals as clear and perfect, as when that
sickness first seized his body: but it continued
long and threatned him with death; which he
dreaded not.</p>
                     <p>In this distemper of body, his dear friend
Doctor <hi>Henry King</hi> (then chief Residenciary
of that Church, and late Bishop of <hi>Chich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>liging
nature, visited him daily; and observing that
his sickness rendred his recovery doubtful, he
chose a seasonable time to speak to him, to
this purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Mr. <hi>Dean,</hi> I am by your favour no stranger
to your temporal estate, and you are no
stranger to the offer lately made us, for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56222:32"/>
the renewing a Lease of the best Prebends
Corps belonging to our Church; and you
know, 'twas denied, for that our Tenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very rich, offered to fine at so low a rate
as held not proportion with his advantages:
but I will either raise him to an higher summe,
or procure that the other Residenciaries shall
joyn to accept of what was offered: one of
these I can and will by your favour do without
delay, and without any trouble either to your
body or mind; I beseech you to accept of my
offer, for I know it will be a considerable addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to your present estate, which I know
needs it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this, after a short pause, and raising him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon his bed, he made this reply.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>My most dear friend, I most humbly thank
you for your many favours, and this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
But, in my present condition, I shall not
accept of your proposal; for doubtless there
is such a Sin as <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> if there were not
it could not have a name in Scripture: And
the Primitive Clergy were watchful against
all appearances of that evil; and indeed the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
all Christians lookt upon it with horrour and
detestation: Judging it to be even an <hi>open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the Power and Providence of Almighty
God, and a sad presage of a declining Religion.</hi>
But in stead of such Christians, who had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
times set apart to fast and pray to God,
for a pious Clergy which they then did obey;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56222:32"/>
Our times abound with men that are busie
and litigious about trifles and Church-Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
and yet so far from scrupling <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
that they make not so much as a <hi>quaere</hi>
what it is: But, I thank God I have; and,
dare not now upon my sick-bed, when Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God hath made me useless to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Church, make any advantages out
of it. But, if he shall again restore me to such
a degree of health, as again to serve at his
<hi>Altar,</hi> I shall then gladly take the reward
which the bountiful Benefactours of this
Church have designed me; for God knows
my Children and Relations will need it. In
which number my Mother (whose Credulity
and Charity has contracted a very plentiful to
a very narrow estate) must not be forgotten:
But Doctor <hi>King,</hi> if I recover not, that little
worldly estate that I shall leave behind me,
(that very little, when divided into eight parts,)
must, if you deny me not so Charitable a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
fall into your hands as my most <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
friend</hi> and Executor; of whose Care and
Justice, I make no more doubt then of Gods
blessing on that which I have conscientiously
collected for them; but it shall not be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
on my sick-bed; and, this I declare
to be my unalterable resolution.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reply to this was only a promise to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his request.</p>
                     <p>Within a few days his distempers abated;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56222:33"/>
and as his strength increased, so did his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to Almighty God, testified in his most
excellent Book of <hi>Devotions,</hi> which he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
at his Recovery. In which the Reader
may see, the most secret thoughts that then
possest his Soul, Paraphrased and made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:
a book that may not unfitly be called a
a <hi>Sacred picture of Spiritual Extasies,</hi> occasioned
and applyable to the emergencies of that sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
which book being a composition of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
Disquisitions</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> he writ on his
sick-bed; herein imitating the Holy Patriarchs,
who were wont to build their Altars in that
place, where they had received their blessings.</p>
                     <p>This sickness brought him so near to the
gates of death, and he saw the grave so ready
to devour him, that he would often say his
recovery was supernatural: But that God that
then restored his health continued it to him, till
the fifty-ninth year of his life. And then in
<hi>August</hi> 1630. being with his eldest Daughter
Mrs. <hi>Harvy</hi> at Abury hatch in <hi>Essex,</hi> he there
fell into a fever, which with the help of his
constant infirmity (vapors from the spleen) haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him into so visible a Consumption, that his
beholders might say, as St <hi>Paul</hi> of himself, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
dayly;</hi> and he might say with <hi>Job, My
welfare passeth away as a cloud, the dayes of my
affliction have taken hold of me, and weary nights
are appointed for me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:56222:33"/>Reader, This sickness continued long, not
onely weakning but wearying him so much, that
my desire is, he may now take some rest: and
that before I speak of his death, thou wilt not
think it an impertinent digression to look back
with me, upon some observations of his life,
which, whilst a gentle slumber gives rest to
his spirits, may, I hope, not unfitly exercise
thy consideration.</p>
                     <p>His marriage was the remarkable errour of
his life; an errour which though he had a wit
able and very apt to maintain Paradoxes, yet,
he was very far from, justifying it: and though
his wives Competent years, and other reasons
might be justly urged to moderate severe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
yet he would occasionally condemn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for it: and doubtless it had been attended
with an heavy Repentance, if God had not blest
them with so mutual and cordial affections, as
in the midst of their sufferings made their bread
of sorrow taste more pleasantly then the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
of dull and low-spirited people.</p>
                     <p>The Recreations of his youth were <hi>Poetry,</hi>
in which he was so happy, as if nature and all
her varieties had been made onely to exercise his
sharp wit, and high facy; and in those pieces
which were facetiously Composed and carelesly
scattered (most of them being written before
the twentieth year of his age) it may appear by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56222:34"/>
his choice Metaphors, that both <hi>Nature</hi> and all
the <hi>Arts</hi> joyned to assist him with their utmost
skill.</p>
                     <p>It is a truth, that in his penitential
years, viewing some of those pieces too
loosely scattered in his youth, he wish't they
had been abortive, or so short liv'd that his
own eyes had witnessed their funerals: But,
though he was no friend to them, he was not so
fallen out with heavenly Poetry as to forsake
that: no not in his declining age; witnessed
then by many Divine Sonnets, and other high,
holy, and harmonious Composures. Yea, even
on his former sick-bed he wrote this heavenly
<hi>Hymne,</hi> expressing the great joy that then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
his soul in the Assurance of Gods favour
to him.</p>

                     <p>After this manner did the Disciples of our
Saviour, and the best of Christians in those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Church nearest to his time, offer
their praises to Almighty God. And the reader
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56222:35"/>
of St. <hi>Augustines</hi> life may there find, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his dissolution he wept abundantly, that
the enemies of Christianity had broke in upon
them, and prophaned and ruin'd their <hi>Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and because their <hi>Publick Hymns</hi> and
Lauds were lost out of their Churches. And
after this manner have many devout Souls lifted

the reader, that not long before his death
he caused to be drawn a figure of the Body of
Christ extended upon an Anchor, like those
which Painters draw when they would present
us with the picture of Christ crucified on the
Cross: his, varying no otherwise then to affix
him to an Anchor (the Emblem of hope) this
he caused to be drawn in little, and then many
of those figures thus drawn to be ingraven very
small in <hi>Helitropian</hi> Stones, and set in gold, and
of these he sent to many of his dearest friends to
be used as <hi>Seales,</hi> or <hi>Rings,</hi> and kept as memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of him, and of his affection to them.</p>
                     <p>His dear friends and benefactors, Sir <hi>Henry

                     <p>If these fall under the censure of a soul,
whose too much mixture with earth makes it
unfit to judge of these high raptures and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56222:37"/>
let him know that many holy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
men have thought the Soul of <hi>Prudentius</hi>
to be most refined, when not many dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death <hi>he charged it to present his God
each morning and evening with a new and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
song;</hi> justified by the example of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and the good King <hi>Hezekias,</hi> who upon
the renovation of his years paid his thankful
vowes to Almighty God in a <hi>royal Hymn,</hi> which
he concludes in these words, <hi>The Lord was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to save, therefore I will sing my songs to the
stringed instruments all the dayes of my life in the
temple of my God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The latter part of his life may be said to be a
continued study; for as he usually preached
once a week, if not oftner, so after his Sermon
he never gave his eyes rest, till he had chosen
out a new Text, and that night cast his Sermon
into a form, and his Text into divisions; and
the next day betook himself to consult the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and so commit his meditations to his
memory, which was excellent. But upon Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
he usually gave himself and his mind a rest
from the we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>y burthen of his weeks meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and usually spent that day in visitation of
friends, or some other diversions of his
thoughts; and would say, that <hi>he gave both his
body and mind that refreshment, that he might be
enabled to do the work of the day following, not
faintly, but with courage and chearfulness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor was his age onely so industrious, but in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56222:38"/>
the most unsetled dayes of his youth, his bed
was not able to detain him beyond the hour of
four in a morning: and it was no common bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
that drew him out of his chamber till past
ten. All which time was employed in study;
though he took great liberty after it: and if this
seem strange, it may gain a belief by the visible
fruits of his labours: some of which remain as
testimonies of what is here writen: for he left
the resultance of 1400. Authors, most of them
abridged and analysed with his own hand; he
left also sixscore of his Sermons, all written with
his own hand; also an exact and laborious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
concerning <hi>Self-murther,</hi> called <hi>Biathana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos;</hi>
wherein all the Laws violated by that Act
are diligently surveyed and judiciously censured:
a Treatise written in his younger dayes, which
alone might declare him then not onely perfect
in the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon Law,</hi> but in many other
such studies and arguments, as enter not into
the consideration of many that labour to be
thought great Clerks, and pretend to know all
things.</p>
                     <p>Nor were these onely found in his study; but
all businesses that past of any publick conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
either in this, or any of our neighbour
nations, he abbreviated either in Latine, or in
the Language of that Nation, and kept them
by him for useful memorials. So he did the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of divers Letters and cases of Conscience
that had concerned his friends, with his obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56222:38"/>
and solutions of them; and, divers
other businesses of importance; all particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and methodically digested by himself.</p>
                     <p>He did prepare to leave the world before life
left him, making his will when no faculty of his
soul was damp'd or made defective by pain or
sickness, or he surprized by a sudden apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of death: but it was made with mature
deliberation, expressing himself an impartial
father by making his childrens portions equal;
and a lover of his friends, whom he remembred
with Legacies fitly and discreetly chosen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed.
I cannot forbear a nomination of
some of them; for, methinks they be persons
that seem to challenge a recordation in this
place; as namely, to his Brother-in-law Sir <hi>Th.
Grimes,</hi> he gave that striking Clock which he
had long worn in his pocket—to his dear friend
and Executor Dr. <hi>King</hi> (late Bishop of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>)
that model of gold of the Synod of
<hi>Dcrt,</hi> with which the States presented him at
his last being at the <hi>Hague</hi>—and the two Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of <hi>Padre Paulo</hi> and <hi>Fulgentio,</hi> men of
his acquaintance when he travelled <hi>Italy,</hi> and of
great note in that Nation for their remarkable
learning.—To his ancient friend Dr. <hi>Brook,</hi>
(that married him) Master of <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi>
in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he gave the Picture of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgin and <hi>Joseph.</hi>—To Dr. <hi>Winniff</hi> (who
succeeded him in the Deanry) he gave a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
called the <hi>Sceleton.</hi>—To the succeeding
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56222:39"/>
Dean, who was not then known, he gave many
necessaries of worth, and useful for his house;
and also several Pictures and Ornaments for the
Chappel, with a desire that they might be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
and remain as a Legacy to his Successors.
—To the Earls of <hi>Dorset</hi> and of <hi>Carlile,</hi>
he gave several Pictures, and so he did to many
other friends; Legacies, given rather to express
his affection, than to make any addition to their
Estates: but unto the Poor he was full of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and unto many others, who by his constant
and long continued bounty might intitle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be his Alms-people; for all these he
made provision, and so largely, as having then six
children living, might to some appear more than
proportionable to his Estate. I forbear to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any more, lest the Reader may think I tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spass
upon his patience: but I will beg his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to present him with the beginning and end
of his Will.</p>

                     <p>Nor was this blessed sacrifice of Charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
onely at his death, but in his life also,
by a cheerful and frequent visitation of any
friend whose mind was dejected, or his fortune
necessitous; he was inquisitive after the wants
of Prisoners, and redeemed many from thence
that lay for their Fees or small Debts; he was
a continual Giver to poor Scholars, both of this
and foreign Nations. Besides what he gave
with his own hand, he usually sent a Servant, or
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56222:40"/>
a discreet and trusty Friend, to distribute his
Charity to all the Prisons in <hi>London</hi> at all the
Festival times of the year, especially at the
<hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Saviour. He gave
an hundred pounds at one time to an old Friend,
whom he had known live plentifully, and by a
too liberal heart and carelesness became decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Estate: and, when the receiving of it
was denied, by the Gentlemans saying, <hi>He
wanted not;</hi> for as there be some spirits so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
as to labour to conceal and endure a sad
poverty, rather than those blushes that attend
the confession of it; so there be others to
whom Nature and Grace have afforded such
sweet and compassionate souls, as to pity and
prevent the Distresses of Mankind; which I
have mentioned because of Dr. <hi>Donne's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
whose Answer was, <hi>I know you want not
what will sustain nature, for a little will do that;
but my desire is, that you who in the dayes of your
plenty have cheered and raised the hearts of so
many of your dejected friends, would now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this from me, and use it as a cordial for the
cheering of your own:</hi> and so it was received.
He was an happy reconciler of many differences
in the Families of his Friends and Kindred,
(which he never undertook faintly; for such
undertakings have usually faint effects;) and
they had such a faith in his judgement and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality,
that he never advised them to any
thing in vain. He was even to her death a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56222:40"/>
most dutiful Son to his Mother, careful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for her supportation, of which she had
been destitute, but that God raised him up to
prevent her necessities; who having sucked in
the Religion of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> with her
Mothers Milk, spent her Estate in foreign
Countreys, to enjoy a liberty in it, and died in
his house but three Moneths before him.</p>

left out of the Roll and number of Lent-Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
and there being then (in <hi>January</hi> 1630.)
a report brought to <hi>London,</hi> or raised there, that
Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> was dead: That report, gave him
occasion to write this following Letter to a dear
friend.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">

                           <p>This advantage you and my other friends
have by my frequent fevers, that I am so much
the oftner at the gates of Heaven; and this
advantage by the solitude and close imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that they reduce me to after, that I am
so much the oftner at my prayers, in which I
shall never leave out your happiness; and I
doubt not among his other blessings, God
will add some one to you for my prayers. A
man would almost be content to dye (if there
were no other benefit in death) to hear of so
much sorrow, and so much good testimony
from good men as I (God be blessed for it)
did upon the report of my death; yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it went not through all, for one writ to
me that some (and he said of my friends)
conceived I was not so ill as I pretended, but
withdrew my self to live at ease, discharged
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56222:42"/>
of preaching. It is an unfriendly, and God
knows an ill-grounded interpretation; for I
have alwayes been sorrier when I could not
preach, than any could be they could not hear
me. It hath been my desire, and God may be
pleased to grant it, that I might dye in the
Pulpit; if not that, yet, that I might take
my death in the Pulpit, that is, dye the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by occasion of those labours. Sir, I hope
to see you presently after <hi>Candlemas,</hi> about
which time will fall my <hi>Lent-Sermon at Court,</hi>
except my <hi>Lord Chamberlain</hi> believe me to be
dead, and so leave me out of the Roll; but as
long as I live, and am not speechless, I would
not willingly decline that service. I have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
leisure to write, than you to read; yet I
would not willingly oppress you with too
much Letter. God bless you and your Son as
I wish,</p>

                     <p>Before that month ended, he was appointed
to preach upon his old constant day, the first
<hi>Friday</hi> in <hi>Lent;</hi> he had notice of it, and had in
his sickness so prepared for that imployment,
that as he had long thirsted for it: so, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his weakness should not hinder his journey;
he came therefore to <hi>London,</hi> some few dayes
before his appointed day of preaching. At his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56222:42"/>
coming thither, many of his friends (who with
sorrow saw his sickness had left him onely so
much flesh as did onely cover his bones) doubted
his strength to perform that task, and, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
disswade him from undertaking it, assuring
him however, it was like to shorten his life; but,
he passionately denied their requests; saying, <hi>he
would not doubt that that God who in so many
weaknesses had assisted him with an unexpected
strength, would now withdraw it in his last employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
professing an holy ambition to perform that
sacred work.</hi> And, when to the amazement of
some beholders he appeared in the Pulpit, many
of them thought he presented himself not to
preach mortification by a living voice: but,
mortality by a decayed body and dying face.
And doubtless, many did secretly ask that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in <hi>Ezekiel;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Do these bones live? or, can that
soul organize that tongue, to speak so long time as
the sand in that glass will move towards its centre,
and measure out an hour of this dying mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spent
life?</hi> Doubtless it cannot; and yet, after
some faint pauses in his zealous prayer, his strong
desires enabled his weak body to discharge his
memory of his preconceived meditations, which
were of dying, the Text being, <hi>To God the Lord
belong the issues from death.</hi> Many that then saw
his tears, and heard his faint and hollow voice,
professing they thought the Text prophetically
chosen, and that <hi>Dr.</hi> Donne <hi>had preach't his own
funeral Sermon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56222:43"/>Being full of joy that God had enabled him
to perform this desired duty, he hastened to his
house, out of which he never moved, till like
St. <hi>Stephen, he was carried by devout men to his
Grave.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next day after his Sermon, his strength
being much wasted, and his spirits so spent, as
indisposed him to business, or to talk: A friend
that had often been a witness of his free and
facetious discourse, asked him, <hi>Why are you sad?</hi>
To whom he replied with a countenance so full
of cheerful gravity, as gave testimony of an
inward tranquillity of mind, and of a soul wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to take a farewell of this world. And
said,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I am not sad, but most of the night past I
have entertained my self with many thoughts
of several friends that have left me here, <hi>and
are gone to that place from which they shall not
return:</hi> And, that within a few dayes <hi>I also
shall go hence, and be no more seen.</hi> And, my
preparation for this change is become my
nightly meditation upon my bed, which my
infirmities have now made restless to me. But,
at this present time I was in a serious contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the providence and goodness of
God to me, who am less than the least of his
mercies; and looking back upon my life past,
I now plainly see it was his hand that prevented
me from all temporal employment; and, it
was his Will that I should never settle nor
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56222:43"/>
thrive till I entred into the Ministry; in which,
I have now liv'd almost twenty years (I hope
to his glory) and by which I most humbly
thank him, I have been enabled to require
most of those friends which shewed me kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
when my fortune was very low, as God
knows it was: and (as it hath occasioned the
expression of my gratitude) I thank God
most of them have stood in need of my requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
I have liv'd to be useful and comfortable
to my good Father-in-law Sir <hi>George Moore,</hi>
whose patience God hath been pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
with many temporal Crosses; I have
maintained my own Mother, whom it hath
pleased God after a plentiful fortune in her
younger dayes, to bring to a great decay in her
very old age. I have quieted the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of many that have groaned under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of a wounded spirit, whose prayers I
hope are available for me. I cannot plead inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of life, especially of my youth: But, I
am to be judged by a merciful God, <hi>who is not
willing to see what I have done amiss.</hi> And,
though of my self I have nothing to present to
him but sins and misery; yet, I know he looks
not upon me now as I am of my self, but as I
am in my Saviour, and hath given me even at
this time some testimonies by his Holy Spirit,
that I am of the number of his Elect: <hi>I
am therefore full of joy, and shall dye in
peace.</hi>
                        </q>

                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56222:44"/>I must here look so far back, as to tell the
Reader, that at his first return out of <hi>Essex</hi> to
preach his last Sermon, his old Friend and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,
Dr. <hi>Fox,</hi> a man of great worth, came to
him to consult his health; and that after a sight
of him, and some queries concerning his distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
he told him, <hi>That by Cordials, and drinking
milk twenty dayes together, there was a probability
of his restauration to health;</hi> but he passionately
denied to drink it. Nevertheless, Dr. <hi>Fox,</hi> who
loved him most intirely, wearied him with sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations,
till he yielded to take it for ten dayes;
at the end of which time, he told Dr. <hi>Fox, he
had drunk it more to satisfie him, than to recover
his health; and that he would not drink it ten
dayes longer upon the best moral assurance of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
twenty years added to his life, for he loved it
not; and that he was so far from fearing death,
which is the King of terrors, that he longed for the
day of his dissolution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is observed, that a desire of glory or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
is rooted in the very nature of man;
and, that those of the severest and most morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
lives, though they may become so humble
as to banish self-flattery, and such weeds as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
grow there; yet, they have not been
able to kill this desire of glory, but that like
our radical heat it will both live and dye with us;
and, many think it should do so; and, we want
not sacred examples to justifie the desire of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our memory to out-live our lives: which I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56222:44"/>
mention, because Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> by the persuasion
of Dr. <hi>Fox,</hi> easily yielded at this very time to
have a Monument made for him; but Dr. <hi>Fox</hi>
undertook not to persuade how or what it
should be; that was left to Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p>This being resolved upon, Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> sent for
a Carver to make for him in wood the figure of
an <hi>Urn,</hi> giving him directions for the compass
and height of it; and, to bring with it a board
of the height of his body. These being got,
then without delay a choice Painter was to be in
a readiness to draw his picture, which was taken
as followeth.—Several Charcole-fires being
first made in his large Study, he brought with
him into that place his winding-sheet in his
hand; and, having put off all his cloaths, had
this sheet put on him, and so tyed with knots at
his head and feet, and his hands so placed, as
dead bodies are usually fitted to be shrowded
and put into the grave. Upon this <hi>Urn</hi> he thus
stood with his eyes shut, and with so much of the
sheet turned aside as might shew his lean, pale,
and death-like face; which was purposely turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
toward the East, from whence he expected
the second coming of his and our Saviour. Thus
he was drawn at his just hèight; and when the
picture was fully finished, he caused it to be set
by his bed-side, where it continued, and became
his hourly object till his death: and, was then
given to his dearest friend and Executor Dr.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56222:45"/>
                        <hi>King,</hi> who caused him to be thus carved in one
entire piece of white Marble, as it now stands in
the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Pauls;</hi> and by Dr.
<hi>Donne's</hi> own appointment, these words were to
be affixed to it as his Epitaph:

                     </p>
                     <p>Upon <hi>Monday</hi> following, he took his last
leave of his beloved Study; and, being sensible
of his hourly decay, retired himself to his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber:
and, that week sent at several times
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56222:45"/>
for many of his most considerable friends, with
whom he took a solemn and deliberate farewell;
commending to their considerations some sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
useful for the regulation of their lives,
and then dismist them, as good <hi>Jacob</hi> did his
sons, with a spiritual benediction. The <hi>Sunday</hi>
following he appointed his servants, that if
there were any business undone that concerned
him or themselves, it should be prepared against
<hi>Saturday</hi> next; for, after that day he would not
mix his thoughts with any thing that concerned
this world; nor ever did: But, as <hi>Job,</hi> so he
<hi>waited for the appointed time of his dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now he had nothing to do but to dye;
to do which, he stood in need of no longer time,
for he had studied long, and to so happy a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that in a former sickness he called God
to witness<note n="*" place="margin">In his Book of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                        <hi>he was that minute ready to deliver
his soul into his hands, if that minute God would
determine his dissolution.</hi> In that sickness he
beg'd of God the constancy to be preserved in
that estate for ever; and his patient expectation
to have his immortal soul disrob'd from her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mortality, makes me confident he
now had a modest assurance that his Prayers
were then heard, and his Petition granted. He
lay fifteen dayes earnestly expecting his hourly
change; and, in the last hour of his last day, as
his body melted away and vapoured into spirit,
his soul having, I verily believe, some Revelation
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56222:46"/>
of the Beatifical Vision, he said, <hi>I were misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
if I might not dye;</hi> and after those words
closed many periods of his faint breath, by
saying often, <hi>Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be
done.</hi> His speech, which had long been his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and faithful servant, left him not till the last
minute of his life, and then forsook him; not
to serve another Master, but dyed before him;
for that it was become useless to him that now
conversed with God on earth, as Angels are said
to do in heaven, <hi>onely by thoughts and looks.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
speechless, he did as St. <hi>Stephen, look stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards heaven, till he saw the Son of God
standing at the right hand of his Father:</hi> and
being satisfied with this blessed sight, as his soul
ascended, and his last breath departed from him,
he closed his own eyes; and then, disposed his
hands and body into such a posture as required
not the least alteration by those that came to
shroud him.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>variable,</hi> thus <hi>vertuous</hi> was the Life;
thus <hi>excellent,</hi> thus <hi>exemplary</hi> was the Death
of this memorable man.</p>
                     <p>He was buried in that place of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
Church which he had appointed for that use
some years before his death; and, by which he
passed daily to pay his publick devotions to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God (who was then served twice a day
by a publick form of Prayer and Praises in that
place) but, he was not buried privately though
he desired it; for, beside an unnumbred num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56222:46"/>
of others, many persons of Nobility, and
of eminency for Learning, who did love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him in his life, did shew it at his death, by a
voluntary and sad attendance of his body to the
grave, where nothing was so remarkable as a
publick sorrow.</p>
                     <p>To which place of his Burial some mournful
Friend repaired, and, as <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> did
to the grave of the famous <hi>Achilles,</hi> so they
strewed his with an abundance of curious and
costly Flowers; which course they (who were
never yet known) continued morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for many dayes; not ceasing till the stones
that were taken up in that Church to give his
body admission into the cold earth (now his
bed of rest) were again by the Masons art so
levelled and firmed, as they had been formerly;
and, his place of Burial undistinguishable to
common view.</p>
                     <p>Nor was this all the Honour done to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Ashes; for, as there be some persons
that will not receive a reward for that for which
God accounts himself a Debtor: persons, that
dare trust God with their Charity, and without
a witness; so there was by some grateful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Friend, that thought Dr. <hi>Donnes</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
ought to be perpetuated, an hundred
Marks sent to his two faithful Friends<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>King</hi> and Dr. <hi>Monfort</hi>
                        </note> and
Executors, towards the making of his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It was not for many years known by
whom; but, after the death of Dr. <hi>Fox,</hi> it was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56222:47"/>
known that it was he that sent it; and he lived
to see as lively a representation of his dead
Friend, as Marble can express; a Statue indeed
so like Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> that (as his Friend Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Wotton</hi> hath expressed himself) <q>it seems to
breath faintly; and, Posterity shall look upon it as
a kind of artificial Miracle.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>He was of Stature moderately tall, of a strait
and equally proportioned body, to which all his
words and actions gave an unexpressible addition
of Comeliness.</p>
                        <p>The melancholy and pleasant humor were in him
so contempered, that each gave advantage to the
other, and made his Company one of the delights
of Mankind.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>His fancy</hi> was unimitably high, equalled onely
by his great wit, both being made useful by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
judgement.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>His aspect</hi> was chearful, and such as gave a
silent testimony of a clear knowing soul, and of a
Conscience at peace with it self.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>His melting eye</hi> shewed that he had a soft heart,
full of noble compassion; of too brave a soul to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
injuries, and too much a Christian not to pardon
them in others.</p>
                        <p>He did much contemplate (especially after he
entred into his Sacred Calling) the <hi>mercies</hi> of
Almighty God, the <hi>immortality of the Soul,</hi> and
the <hi>joyes of Heaven;</hi> and would often say, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be God that he is God divinely like himself.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56222:47"/>He was by nature highly passionate, but more apt
to reluct at the excesses of it. A great lover of the
offices of humanity, and of so merciful a spirit, that
<hi>he never beheld the miseries of Mankind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pity and relief.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He was earnest and unwearied in the search of
knowledge; with which his vigorous soul is now
satisfied, and employed in a continual praise of that
God that first breathed it into his active body; that
body which once was a <hi>Temple of the Holy
Ghost,</hi> and is now become a small quantity of
<hi>Christian dust:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I shall see it reanimated.</p>

LIFE
OF
Sir HENRY WOTTON.</head>
                  <p>SIR <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> (whose
Life, I now intend to
write) was born in the
year of our Redemption,
1568. in <hi>Bocton-hall,</hi>
(commonly called, <hi>Bocton,</hi>
or <hi>Bougton</hi> place) in the
Parish of <hi>Bocton Malherb,</hi>
in the fruitful Country of <hi>Kent: Bocton-hall</hi>
being an <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>goodly structure,</hi> beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and being beautified by the Parish Church
of <hi>Bocton Malherb</hi> adjoyning unto it: and,
both seated within a fair Park of the <hi>Wottons,</hi>
on the Brow of such a <hi>Hill,</hi> as gives the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a large Prospect, and of equal <hi>pleasure</hi>
to all Beholders.</p>
                  <p>But this House and Church, are not remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for any thing so much, as for that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Family of the <hi>Wottons</hi> have so long
inhabited the one, and now lie buried in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56222:54"/>
other, as appears by their many <hi>Monuments</hi> in
that Church; the <hi>Wottons</hi> being a Family, that
hath brought forth divers Persons eminent for
Wisdom and Valour, whose Heroick Acts, and
Noble Imployments, both in <hi>England</hi> and in
forraign parts, have adorn'd themselves, and
this Nation: which they have served abroad
faithfully, in the discharge of their great trust,
and prudently in their Negotiations with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Princes; and also serv'd it at home with much
Honour and Justice, in their wise managing a
great part of the publick affairs thereof, in the
various times both of War and Peace.</p>
                  <p>But, lest I should be thought by any, that
may incline, either to deny or doubt this Truth,
not to have observed <hi>Moderation</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of this Family; And also, for that I
believe the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> of such persons,
ought to be thankfully recorded; I shall offer to
the consideration of every Reader, out of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of their <hi>Pedegree,</hi> and our <hi>Chronicles,</hi> a
part (and but a part) of that just Commendation
which might be from thence enlarged, and shall
then leave the indifferent Reader to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my errour be an <hi>excess</hi> or <hi>defect</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Robert Wotton</hi> of <hi>Bocton Malherb</hi> Knight,
was born in the year of Christ 1463. He living
in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, was by
him trusted to be Lieutenant of <hi>Guisnes,</hi> to be
Knight Porter, and Comptroller of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais;</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56222:54"/>
where he dyed, and lies honourably bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Wotton</hi> of <hi>Bocton Malherb</hi> Knight,
(Son and Heir of the said Sir <hi>Robert</hi>) was born
in the year of Christ, 1489. in the Reign of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh. He was made Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer
of <hi>Callais,</hi> and of Privie-Councel to King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, who offered him to be Lord
Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> but (saith<note n="*" place="margin">In his Chronicle</note>
                     <hi>Hollin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi>)
out of a virtuous modesty he refused it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Wotton</hi> of <hi>Bocton Malherb</hi> Esquire,
Son and Heir of the said Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> (and the
Father of our Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> that occasions this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation)
was born in the year of Christ 1521.
He was a Gentleman excellently educated, and
studious in all the <hi>Liberal Arts;</hi> in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
whereof, he attained unto a great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who though he had (besides those abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
a very Noble, and plentiful estate, and the
ancient Interest of his <hi>Predecessors</hi>) many invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to change his
Country Recreations and Retirement for a
Court-Life, offering him a Knight-hood (she
was then with him at his <hi>Bocton-hall</hi>) and that
to be but as an earnest of some more honorable
and more profitable imployment under Her,
yet, he humbly refused both; being a man of
great modesty, of a most plain and single heart,
of an antient freedom, and integrity of mind.
A commendation which Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> took
occasion often to remember with great glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56222:55"/>
and thankfully to boast himself the Son
of such a Father: From whom indeed he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
that noble ingenuity that was alwayes
practised by himself, and which he ever both
commended and cherish'd in others. This
<hi>Thomas</hi> was also remarkable for Hospitality, a
great Lover, and much beloved of his Country;
to which may justly be added, that he was a
Cherisher of <hi>Learning,</hi> as appears by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Antiquary M. <hi>William Lambert,</hi> in his
perambulation of <hi>Kent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Thomas</hi> had four sons, Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> Sir
<hi>James,</hi> Sir <hi>John,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was Knighted by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and made Comptroller of Her Majesties
Houshould. He was (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) a man
remarkable for many and great Imployments
in the State, during her Reign, and sent seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times <hi>Ambassadour</hi> into Forraign Nations.
After her death, he was by King <hi>James</hi> made
Comptroller of his Houshold, and called to be
of his Privy-Councel, and by him advanced to
be <hi>Lord Wotton, Baron</hi> of <hi>Merley</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and
made Lord Lieutenant of that County.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>James</hi> (the second son) may be numbred
among the Martial men of his age, who was in
the 38 of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign (with <hi>Robert
Earl of Sussex, Count Lodowick of Nassaw, Don
Christophoro,</hi> son of <hi>Antonio</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and divers other Gentlemen of Nobleness and
Valour) Knighted in the Field near <hi>Cadiz</hi> in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56222:55"/>
                     <hi>Spain,</hi> after they had gotten great Honour and
Riches, besides a notable retaliation of Injuries
by taking that Town.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>John,</hi> being a Gentleman excellently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,
both by Learning and Travel, was
Knighted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and by her
look'd upon with more then ordinary favour,
and intentions of preferment; but Death, in
his younger years, put a period to his growing
hopes.</p>
                  <p>Of Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> my following discourse shall
give an account.</p>
                  <p>The descent of these fore-named <hi>Wottons,</hi>
were all in a direct Line; and most of them and
their actions, in the memory of those with whom
we have conversed: But, if I had look'd so far
back, as to Sir <hi>Nicolas Wotton,</hi> (who lived in
the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second;) or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, upon divers others of great note in
their several Ages, I might by some be thought
tedious; and yet others may more justly think
me negligent, if I omit to mention <hi>Nicholas
Wotton,</hi> the fourth Son of Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> whom I
first named.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Nicholas Wotton was Doctor of Law,</hi> and
sometime <hi>Dean of Canterbury:</hi> a man whom
God did not onely bless with a long life, but
with great abilities of mind, and an inclination
to imploy them in the service of his Country,
as is testified by his several Imployments;<note n="*" place="margin">Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>in his</hi> Britannia.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been sent nine times <hi>Ambassadour</hi> unto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56222:56"/>
Princes; and being a Privy-<hi>Councellor</hi> to
King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, to <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, to
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> who also,
after he had (during the Wars between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>France</hi>) been three several
times (and not unsuccessfully) imployed in
Committies for setling of peace betwixt this
and those Kingdomes, dyed (saith learned
<hi>Cambden</hi>) full of Commendations for Wisdom
and Piety. He was also by the Will of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, made one of his Executors,
and chief <hi>Secretary</hi> of State to his Son, that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth. Concerning
which <hi>Nicholas Wotton,</hi> I shall say but this little
more; That he refused (being offered it by
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) to be<note n="*" place="margin">Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> 
                     <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and that he dyed not rich, though he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that time of the dissolution of <hi>Abbeys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More might be added: but by this it may
appear, that Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> was a Branch of
such a kindred as left a Stock of Reputation to
their Posterity; such Reputation, as might
kindle a generous emulation in strangers, and
preserve a noble ambition in those of his name
and Family to perform Actions worthy of their
Ancestors.</p>
                  <p>And, that <hi>Sir Henry Wotton</hi> did so, might
appear more perfectly then my Pen can express it,
if of his many surviving friends, some one of
higher parts and imployment, had been pleased to
have commended his to Posterity; But, since some
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56222:56"/>
years are now past, and they have all (I know
not why) forborn to do it; my gratitude to the

of some<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nic. Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dert,</hi> and others.</note> that still live solicitous to see this
duty performed; these have had a power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
me to undertake it; which, truly, I have
not done, but with some distrust of mine own Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and yet so far from despair, that I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
confident my humble language shall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
because I present all Readers with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of truth, and <hi>Sir Henry Wotton's</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p>This being premised, I proceed to tell the
Reader, that the father of Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi>
was twice married, first to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the
Daughter of Sir <hi>John Rudstone</hi> Knight; after
whose death, though his inclination was averse
to all Contentions; yet, necessitated he was to
several Suits in Law: in the prosecution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
(which took up much of his time, and
were the occasion of many Discontents) he
was by divers of his friends earnestly perswaded
to a <hi>re-marriage;</hi> to whom he as often answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
That if ever he did put on a resolution to
marry, <hi>he was seriously resolved to avoid three
sorts of persons:</hi>
                     <list>
                        <label>namely, those</label>
                        <item>
                           <list>
                              <item>that had <hi>Children.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56222:57"/>And yet, following his own Law-suits, he
met in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> with one Mistress <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
Widow to <hi>Morton</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> Esquire:
who was also engaged in several suits in Law,
and, he observing her Comportment at the time
of hearing one of her Causes before the Judges,
could not but at the same time, both compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
her Condition, and yet, so affect her
Person, that although there were in her a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of all those accidents, against which
he had so seriously resolved; yet his affection
to her grew then so strong, that he resolved to
solicite her for a Wife; and did; and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her.</p>
                  <p>By her (who was the Daughter of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Finch</hi> of <hi>Eastwell</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi>) he had <hi>Henry</hi>
his youngest son. His Mother undertook to
be Tutoress unto him during much of his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
for whose care and pains, he paid her
each day with such visible signes of future per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in Learning, as turned her imployment
into a pleasing-trouble: which she was content
to continue, till his Father took him into his
own particular care, and disposed of him to a
Tutor in his own House at <hi>Bocton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, when time and diligent instruction, had
made him fit for a removal to an higher Form,
(which was very early) he was sent to <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-School:</hi>
a place of strict Discipline and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
that so, he might in his youth be mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a Method of living by Rule; which his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56222:57"/>
wise Father knew to be the most necessary way,
to make the future part of his life, both happy
to himself, and useful for the discharge of all bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
whether publick or private.</p>
                  <p>And, that he might be confirmed in this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,</hi>
he was at a fit age removed from that
<hi>School,</hi> to <hi>New-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> both being
founded by <hi>William Wickham</hi> Bishop of <hi>VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There he continued, till about the eighteenth
year of his Age: and was then transplanted into
<hi>Queens-Colledge;</hi> where within that year, he
was by the chief of that Colledge, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
injoyned to write a play for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
use: (it was the Tragedy of <hi>Tancredo</hi>)
which was so interwoven with Sentences, and
for the Method and exact personating those
humours, passions, and dispositions, which he
proposed to represent, so performed; that
the gravest of that society declared, he had in
a sleight imployment, given an early, and a solid
testimony of his future abilities. And, though
there may be some sower dispositions, which
may think this not worth a <hi>memorial;</hi> yet, that
wise Knight <hi>Baptista Guarini</hi> (whom learned
<hi>Italy</hi> accounts one of her ornaments) thought it
neither an uncomely, nor an unprofitable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
for his Age.</p>
                  <p>But I pass to what will be thought more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p>About the nineteenth year of his Age, he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56222:58"/>
proceeded Master of <hi>Arts;</hi> and at that time
read in Latine three Lectures <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

he having described the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Motion,</hi>
the curious <hi>composure</hi> of the <hi>Eye;</hi> and, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
how of those very many, every <hi>humour</hi>
and <hi>nerve</hi> performs its distinct Office, so as the
God of Order hath appointed, without mixture
or confusion; and all this, to the advantage of
man, to whom it is given; not onely as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
guide: but, whereas all other of his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
require time to inform the Soul: this, in
an instant apprehends and warns him of <hi>danger;</hi>
teaching him in the very <hi>eyes</hi> of others to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>wit, folly, love,</hi> and <hi>hatred.</hi> After these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
he fell to dispute this Optique que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>VVhether we see by the Emission of the
Beams from within; or Reception of the Species
from without?</hi> and after that, and many other
like learned disquisitions, in the Conclusion of
his <hi>Lectures,</hi> he took a fair occasion to beautifie
his discourse with a Commendation of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and benefit of <hi>Seeing:</hi> By which, we do
not only discover <hi>Natures Secrets:</hi> but, with a
continued content (for the eye is never weary
of seeing) behold the great <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>VVorld,</hi>
and by it discover the Fabrick of the <hi>Heavens,</hi>
and both the Order and Motion of the <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Orbs;</hi> nay, that if the <hi>eye</hi> look but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
it may rejoyce to behold the bosome
of the <hi>Earth,</hi> our common Mother, <hi>embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi>
and <hi>adorned</hi> with numberless and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56222:58"/>
                     <hi>Flowers,</hi> which man sees daily grow up to
perfection; and then, silently moralize his own
condition, who in a short time (like those
very <hi>Flowers) decayes, withers,</hi> and quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
again to that <hi>Earth,</hi> from which both had
thei first being.</p>
                  <p>These were so exactly debated, and so Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically
heightned, as, among other admirers,
caused that learned <hi>Italian, Albericus Gentilis</hi>
(then Professor of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi>)
to call him <hi>Henrice mi ocelle;</hi> which dear expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his, was also used by divers of Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi>
dearest Friends, and by many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Note, during his stay in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
                  <p>But his stay there was not long; at least, not
so long as his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>riends once intended: for, the
year after Sir <hi>Henry</hi> proceeded Master of Arts,
his father (whom Sir <hi>Henry</hi> did never mention
without this, or some like reverential expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as, <hi>That good man my father;</hi> or, <hi>My father
the best of men:</hi>) about that time, this good
man changed this for a better life; leaving to
Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> as to his other younger sons, a rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of an hundred Mark a year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to be paid
for ever, out of some one of his Mannors of a
much greater value.</p>
                  <p>And here, though this good man be dead, yet
I wish a Circumstance or two that concern him,
may not be buried without a Relation; which I
shall undertake to do, for that I suppose, they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56222:59"/>
may so much concern the Reader to know, that
I may promise my self a pardon for a short Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</p>
                  <p>IN the year of our Redemption, 1553. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Wotton</hi> Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (whom I
formerly mentioned) being then Ambassador
in <hi>France,</hi> dream'd, that his Nephew, this <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Wotton,</hi> was inclined to be a party in such a
project, as, if he were not suddenly prevented,
would turn both to the loss of his life, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of his <hi>Family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doubtless, the good Dean did well know,
that common Dreams are but a senseless para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
on our waking thoughts; or, of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of the day past; or, are the result of our
over ingaged affections, when we betake our
selves to rest; and, that the observation of
them, may turn to silly Superstitions, as they too
often do: But, though he might know this,
and, might also believe that Prophesies are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
yet, doubtless he could not but consider,
that all Dreams are not to be neglected or cast
away; and did therefore rather lay this Dream
aside, than intend totally to lose it; for that
dreaming the same again the Night following,
when it became a double Dream; like that of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> (of which dreams, the learned have made
many observations) and that, it had no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n is waking thoughts, much less on the
desires of his heart; then, he did more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56222:59"/>
consider it, and remembred that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God was pleased in a Dream to reveal
and to assure<note n="*" place="margin">St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin's <hi>confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Monica</hi> the Mother of St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
that he, her son (for whom she wept so bitterly,
and prayed so much) should at last become a
Christian: This the good Dean considered;
and, considering also, that Almighty God
(though the causes of Dreams be often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known)
hath even in these latter times, by a
certain <hi>illumination</hi> of the soul in sleep, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
many things that humane wisdom could
not foresee: Upon these considerations, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to use so prudent a remedy by way of
prevention, as might introduce no great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
to either party. And to that end, he
wrote to the <hi>Queen</hi> ('twas Queen <hi>Mary</hi>) and
besought her, <hi>That she would cause his Nephew</hi>
Thomas Wotton, <hi>to be sent for out of</hi> Kent: <hi>and,
that the Lords of her Council might interrogate
him in some such feigned questions, as might give
a colour for his Commitment into a favourable</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<hi>declaring, that he would acquaint her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
with the true reason of his request, when he
should next become so happy as to see, and speak
to her Majesty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twas done as the <hi>Dean</hi> desired: and in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
I must leave Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> till I have told the
Reader what followed.</p>
                  <p>At this time a Marriage was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> and <hi>Philip King</hi> of
<hi>Spain:</hi> And though this was concluded with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56222:60"/>
the advice, if not by the persuasion of her
Privy Council, as having many probabilities of
advantage to this Nation: yet, divers persons
of a contrary perswasion, did not onely declare
against it, but also raised Forces to oppose it;
believing (as they said) it would be a means to
bring <hi>England</hi> under subjection to <hi>Spain,</hi> and
make those of this Nation slaves to <hi>stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of this number Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> of <hi>Box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-Abby</hi>
in <hi>Kent</hi> (betwixt whose Family, and
the Family of the <hi>Wottons,</hi> there had been an
ancient and intire friendship) was the principal
Actor; who having perswaded many of the
Nobility and Gentry (especially of <hi>Kent</hi>) to
side with him; and, being defeated, and taken
Prisoner, was legally arraigned, condemned, and
lost his life: So did the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and
divers others, especially many of the Gentry of
<hi>Kent,</hi> who were there in several places executed
as <hi>Wyats</hi> assistants.</p>
                  <p>And of this number, in all probability, had
Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> been, if he had not been confin'd:
for, though he was not ignorant that another
mans Treason, makes it mine by concealing it;
yet, he durst confess to his Uncle, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into <hi>England,</hi> and came to visit him in
Prison, that he had more than an intimation of
<hi>Wyats</hi> intentions; and, thought he had not
continued actually <hi>innocent,</hi> if his Uncle had
not so happily dream'd him into a <hi>Prison;</hi> out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56222:60"/>
of which place, when he was delivered by the
same hand that caused his Commitment, they
both considered the Dream more seriously; and
then, both joyned in praising God for it; <hi>That
God, who tyes himself to no Rules, either in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
of evil, or in shewing of mercy to those,
whom of his good pleasure he hath chosen to
love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Dream was the more considerable,
because many of the Dreams of this <hi>Thomas
Wotton</hi> did most usually prove ture, both in
foretelling things to come, and discovering
things past: of which I will give the Reader but
one particular more, namely this; This <hi>Thomas,</hi>
a little before his death, dream'd that the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
Treasury</hi> was robbed by <hi>Townsmen,</hi> and
poor <hi>Scholars;</hi> and, that the number was five:
And being that day to write to his Son <hi>Henry</hi>
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he thought it worth so much pains, as
by a Postscript in his Letter, to make a slight
inquiry of it; the Letter (which was writ out
of <hi>Kent,</hi>and dated three dayes before) came
to his Sons hands the very morning after the
night in which the Robbery was committed;
and when the City and University were both in
a perplext Enquest of the Thieves, then did Sir
<hi>H. Wotton</hi> shew his fathers Letter, and by it such
<hi>light</hi> was given of this work of <hi>darkness,</hi> that
the five guilty persons were presently discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and apprehended, without putting the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesity</hi>
to so much trouble, as the casting of a
<hi>Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56222:61"/>And it may yet be more considerable, that
this <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Thomas Wotton</hi> should both
(being men of holy lives, of even tempers,
and much given to fasting and prayer) foresee
and foretell the very dayes of their own death:
<hi>Nicholas</hi> did so, being then Seventy years of
age, and in perfect health. <hi>Thomas</hi> did the like
in the 65 year of his age; who being then in
<hi>London</hi> (where he dyed) and foreseeing his
death there, gave direction that his Body should
be carried to <hi>Bocton;</hi> and though he thought
his Uncle <hi>Nicholas</hi> worthy of that noble Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he built for him in the <hi>Cathedral
Church</hi> of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> yet, this humble man
gave direction concerning himself, to be buried
privately, and especially without any pomp at
his Funeral.</p>
                  <p>BUt it may now seem more then time that I
return to Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> at <hi>Oxford;</hi>
where, after his optick Lecture, he was taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a bosom friendship with the learned <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bericus
Gentilis</hi> (whom I formerly named) that
if it had been possible, <hi>Gentilis</hi> would have brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
all his excellent knowledge both of the
<hi>Mathematicks</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> into the breast of his
dear <hi>Harry</hi> (for so <hi>Gentilis</hi> used to call him:)
and though he was not able to do that, yet, there
was in Sir <hi>Henry</hi> such a propenfity and connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralness
to the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, and those Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
whereof <hi>Gentilis</hi> was a great Master, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56222:61"/>
this friendship between them did daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and proved daily advantagious to
Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> for the improvement of him in
several Sciences, during his stay in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.</p>
                  <p>From which place, before I shall invite the
Reader to follow him into a forreign Nation,
though I must omit to mention divers persons
that were then in <hi>Oxford,</hi> of memorable note
for Learning, and Friends to Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi>
yet I must not omit the mention of a love that
was there begun betwixt him and Dr. <hi>Donne</hi>
(sometimes Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>) a man, of whose
abilities I shall forbear to say any thing, because
he who is of this <hi>Nation,</hi> that pretends to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Ingenuity, and is ignorant of Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi>
deserves not to know him. The friendship of
these two, I must not omit to mention, being
such a friendship as was generously elemented:
And as it was begun in their Youth, and in
an University, and there maintained by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent
Inclinations and Studies, so it
lasted till Age and Death forced a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Oxford</hi> he stayed till about two years after
his fathers death: at which time, he was about
the two and twentieth year of his Age; and
having to his great Wit, added the ballast of
Learning, and knowledge of the Arts, he then
laid aside his Books, and betook himself to the
useful Library of Travel, and a more general
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56222:62"/>
Conversation with Mankind, employing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
part of his Youth, his industry and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to adorn his mind, and to purchase the rich
treasure of forreign knowledge; of which, both
for the secrets of Nature, the dispositions of
many Nations, their several Laws and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
he was the possessor in a very large measure,
as I shall faithfully make to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my Pen from the following Narration of his
Life.</p>
                  <p>In his Travels, which was almost nine years
before his return into <hi>England,</hi> he stayed but
one year in <hi>France,</hi> and most of that in <hi>Geneva;</hi>
where he became acquainted with <hi>Theodor Bez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
(then very aged) and with <hi>Isaac Causabon,</hi> in
whose fathers house (if I be rightly informed)
Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> was lodged, and there contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a most worthy friendship with him and his
most learned Son.</p>
                  <p>Three of the remaining eight years, were
spent in <hi>Germany,</hi> the other five in <hi>Italy</hi> (the
Stage on which God appointed he should act a
great part of his life) where both in <hi>Rome,
Venice,</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> he became acquainted with
the most eminent men for Learning, and all
manner of Arts, as <hi>Picture, Sculpture, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry,
Architecture,</hi> and divers other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Arts; even Arts of inferiour nature;
of all which, he was a most dear Lover, and a
most excellent Judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56222:62"/>He returned out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>England</hi> about
the Thirtieth year of his Age, being then noted
by many, both for his person and comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for indeed he was of a choice shape, tall
of stature, and of a most perswasive behaviour;

Civilities, as gained him much love from all

                  <p>And whereas he was noted in his Youth to
have a sharp wit, and apt to jest; that by Time,

made so useful, that his company seemed to be
one of the delights of Mankind; insomuch, as
<hi>Robert Earl of Essex</hi> (then one of the darlings
of fortune, and in greatest favour with <hi>Queen
Elizabeth</hi>) invited him first into a friendship,
and after a knowledge of his great abilities, to
be one of his Secretaries; the other being Mr.
<hi>Henry Cuffe,</hi> sometimes of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge in
<hi>Oxford</hi> (and there also the acquaintance of Sir
<hi>Henry Wotton</hi> in his Youth) Mr. <hi>Cuffe</hi> being
then a man of no common note in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
for his Learning; nor after his removal
from that place, for the great abilities of
his mind; nor indeed, for the <hi>fatalness</hi> of his
end.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> being now taken into a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
friendship with the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> did
personally attend his Counsels and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in two Voyages at Sea against the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56222:63"/>
and also in that (which was the Earls last)
into <hi>Ireland</hi>; that Voyage wherein he did so
much provoke the Queen to anger then, and
worse at his return into <hi>England</hi>; upon whose
immovable favour he had built such sandy
hopes, as incouraged him to those underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
which (with the help of a contrary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
suddenly caused his Commitment to the
Tower.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> observing this, though he
was not of that Faction (for the <hi>Earls</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
were also divided into their several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests)
which incouraged the <hi>Earl</hi> to those
undertakings which proved so fatal to him, and
divers of his Confederation: yet, knowing
<hi>Treason</hi> to be so comprehensive, as to take in
even Circumstances, and out of them to make
such Conclusions as subtle States-men shall
project, either for their revenge or safety; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
this, he thought prevention by absence
out of <hi>England,</hi> a better security than to stay in
it, and plead his innocency in a <hi>Prison.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did he, so soon as the Earl was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
very quickly, and as privately glide through
<hi>Kent</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> without so much as looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his native and beloved <hi>Bocton</hi>; and was by
the help of favourable winds, and liberal pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
within Sixteen hours after his departure
from <hi>London,</hi> set upon the <hi>French</hi> shore; where
he heard shortly after, that the <hi>Earl</hi> was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd,
Condemned, and Beheaded; that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56222:63"/>
his Friend Mr. <hi>Cuffe</hi> was hang'd, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other persons of Eminent Quality exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
                  <p>The Times did not look so favourably upon
Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> as to invite his return into
<hi>England</hi>; having therefore procured of his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother (the Lord <hi>Wotton</hi>) an assurance
that his Annuity should be paid him in <hi>Italy,</hi>
thither he went, happily renewing his intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
friendship and interest, and indeed, his great
content, in a new conversation with his old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
in that Nation; and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in <hi>Florence,</hi> which City is not more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for the great Dukes Court, then for the
great recourse of men of choicest note for
Learning and Arts; in which number he there
met with his old Friend, Seignior <hi>Vietta,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>After some stay in <hi>Florence,</hi> he went the 4th
time to visit <hi>Rome,</hi> where in the <hi>English Colledge</hi>
he had very many Friends (their humanity made
them really so, though they knew him to be a
dissenter from many of their Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;)
and having enjoyed their company, and
satisfied himself concerning some Curiosities
that did partly occasion his Journey thither, he
returned back to <hi>Florence,</hi> where a most notable
accident befell him; an accident, that did not
onely find new employment for his choice
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56222:64"/>
Abilities, but introduce him a knowledge and
an interest with our King <hi>James,</hi> then King
of <hi>Scotland</hi>; which I shall proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
                  <p>But first, I am to tell the Reader, That
though Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (or she and her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil)
were never willing to declare her <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>;
yet, <hi>James</hi> then King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> was
confidently believed by most to be the man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom the sweet trouble of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be imposed; and the <hi>Queen</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
very fast, both by age, and visible infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
those that were of the <hi>Romish</hi> perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in point of Religion (even <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and
those of this Nation) knowing that the death
of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the establishing of her <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,</hi>
were taken to be <hi>critical</hi> dayes for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
or establishing the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion in
this Nation, did therefore improve all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
for preventing a Protestant Prince to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
Her. And, as the <hi>Pope's</hi> Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> had both by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and practice of the Jesuited Papist, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Her to be warrantably destroyed; so

                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56222:64"/>Immediately after Sir <hi>Henry Wotton's</hi> return
from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Florence</hi> (which was about a
year before the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>)
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
certain Letters that discovered a design
to take away the life of the then King of <hi>Scots.</hi>
The Duke abhorring the Fact, and resolving to
endeavour a prevention of it, advised with his

be best given to that King; and after conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it was resolved to be done by Sir <hi>Henry

                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was gladly called by his Friend
<hi>Vietta</hi> to the <hi>Duke,</hi> who after much profession

which was promised, and really perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

(which was about three Months) all which
time was spent with much pleasantness to the
King, and, with as much to <hi>Octavio Baldi</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as that Countrey could afford; from
which he departed as true an <hi>Italian</hi> as he
came thither.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Duke</hi> at <hi>Florence</hi> he return'd with a
fair and grateful account of his employment,
and within some few Months after his return,
there came certain News to <hi>Florence,</hi> that
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was dead, and <hi>James</hi> King
of the <hi>Scots</hi> proclaimed King of <hi>England.</hi> The
Duke knowing travel and business to be the
best Schools of wisdom, and that Sir <hi>Henry
Wotton</hi> had been tutor'd in both, advis'd him
to return presently to <hi>England,</hi> and joy the
King with his new and better Title, and
there wait upon Fortune for a better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                  <p>When King <hi>James</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> he
found, amongst other of the late Queens Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
the Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> Comptroller of the
House, of whom he demanded, <hi>If he knew one</hi>
Henry Wotton, <hi>that had spent much time in
forreign Travel</hi>? The Lord replied, he knew
him well, and that he was his Brother; then the
<hi>King</hi> asking where he then was, was answered,
at <hi>Venice,</hi> or <hi>Florence</hi>; but by late Letters from
thence, he understood, he would suddenly be at
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56222:66"/>
                     <hi>Paris. Send for him, said the King, and when he
shall come into</hi> England, <hi>bid him repair to me.</hi> The
Lord <hi>Wotton</hi> after a little wonder, asked the
King, If he knew him? to which the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>You must rest unsatisfied of that, till you
bring the Gentleman to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not many Months after this Discourse, the
Lord <hi>Wotton</hi> brought his brother to attend the
King, who took him in His Arms, <hi>and bade
him welcome by the name of</hi> Octavio Baldi, <hi>say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he was the most honest, and therefore the best
Dissembler that ever he met with</hi>: And said, <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I know you neither want Learning, Travel, nor
Experience, and that I have had so real a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your faithfulness and abilities to manage an
Embassage, I have sent for you to declare my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
which is, to make use of you in that kind
hereafter</hi>: And indeed the King did so most of
those two and twenty years of his Raign; but
before he dismist <hi>Octavio Baldi</hi> from his present
attendance upon him, he restored him to his old
name of <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> by which he then knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this, the King having resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
according to his Motto (<hi>Beati pacifici</hi>) to
have a friendship with his Neighbour Kingdoms
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and also for divers weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reasons, to enter into an Alliance with the
State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and to that end to send Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to those several places, did propose the
choice of these Employments to Sir <hi>Henry
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56222:66"/>
Wotton</hi>; who considering the smallness of his
own Estate (which he never took care to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and knowing the Courts of great
Princes to be sumptuous, and necessarily expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
inclined most to that of <hi>Venice,</hi> as being a
place of more retirement, and best suiting with
his <hi>Genius,</hi> who did ever love to joyn with Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Study, and a tryal of natural Experiments;
for both which fruitful <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Darling of
Nature, and Cherisher of all Arts, is so justly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in all parts of the Christian World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> having after some short time and
consideration, resolved upon <hi>Venice,</hi> and a large
allowance being appointed by the <hi>King</hi> for his
voyage thither, and a setled maintenance during
his stay there, he left <hi>England,</hi> nobly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
through <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> by Gentlemen of
the best families and breeding that this Nation
afforded; they were too many to name, but
these two, for following reasons may not be
omitted; Sir <hi>Albertus Morton</hi> his Nephew, who
went his Secretary, and <hi>William Bedel,</hi> a man of
choice Learning, and sanctified Wisdom, who
went his Chaplain. And, though his dear friend
Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> (then a private Gentleman) was
not one of that Number that did personally
accompany him in this Voyage, yet the reading
of this following Letter sent by him to Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56222:68"/>SIR <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> was received by the State
of <hi>Venice,</hi> with much honour and gladness,
both for that he delivered his Embassage most
elegantly in the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, and came
also in such a Juncture of time, as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
friendship seem'd useful for that Republick:
the time of his coming thither was about the
year 1604. <hi>Leonardo Donato</hi> being then Duke;
a wise and resolv'd man, and to all purposes
such (Sir <hi>Henry VVotton</hi> would often say it)
as the State of <hi>Venice</hi> could not then have
wanted; there having been formerly in the
time of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the eighth, some contests
about the priviledges of Church-men, and the
power of the Civil Magistrate; of which, for
the information of common Readers, I shall say
a little, because it may give light to some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
that follow.</p>
                  <p>About the year 1603. the Republick of
<hi>Venice</hi> made several Injunctions against Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persons
giving Lands or Goods to the Church,
without Licence from the Civil-Magistrate;
and in that inhibition, they exprest their reasons
to be, <hi>For that when it once came into the hands
of the Ecclesiasticks, it was not subject to aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
by reason whereof, (the lay people being at
their death charitable even to excess) the Clergy
grew every day more numerous, and, pretending
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56222:68"/>
exemption from all publick service and taxes, the
burthen did grow too heavy to be born by the
Laity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another occasion of difference was, That
about this time complaints were justly made by
the <hi>Venetians</hi> against two Clergy-men, the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of Nervesa,</hi> and a <hi>Canon of Vicenza,</hi> for
committing such sins, as I think not fit to
name; nor are these mentioned with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to fix a Scandal upon any Calling; (for
holiness is not tyed to Ecclesiastical Orders, and
<hi>Italy</hi> is observed to breed the most vertuous,
and most vicious men of any Nation) these
two having been long complained of at <hi>Rome</hi> in
the name of the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
being given to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their persons, and committed them to
prison.</p>
                  <p>The justice, or injustice of such power, then
used by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> had formerly had some
calm debates betwixt the present Pope <hi>Clement</hi>
the Eighth, and that <hi>Republick</hi>: for he did
not excommunicate them; considering (as I
conceive) that in the late <hi>Council of Trent</hi> it
was at last (after many Politique disturbances,
and delayes, and indeavours to preserve the
Popes present power) declar'd, in order to a
general reformation of those many Errours
which were in time crept into the Church:
that though <hi>Discipline,</hi> and especial <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi>
be one of the chief sinews of Church
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56222:69"/>
government; and intended to keep men in
obedience to it: for which end, it was declar'd
to be very profitable; yet it was also declar'd,
and advised to be used with great sobriety and
care: because experience had informed them,
that when it was pronounced unadvisedly, or
rashly, it became more <hi>contemn'd</hi> then <hi>fear'd.</hi>
And, though this was the advice of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at the Conclusion of it, which was not many
years before this quarrel with the <hi>Venetians</hi>: yet
this prudent, patient Pope <hi>Clement</hi> dying: <hi>Pope
Paul</hi> the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, who succeeded him, being a man
of a much hotter temper, brought this difference
with the <hi>Venetians</hi> to a much higher Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
objecting those late acts of that State, to
be a diminution of his just power, and limited a
time for their revocation; threatning, if he were
not obeyed, to proceed to excommunication of
the <hi>Republick</hi>; who still offered to shew both
reason and ancient custom to warrant their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But this <hi>Pope,</hi> contrary to his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
moderation, required absolute obedience
without disputes.</p>
                  <p>Thus it continued for about a year; the Pope
still threatning Excommunication, and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
still answering him with fair speeches,
and no performance, till at last, the Popes zeal
to the <hi>Apostolick Sea,</hi> did make him to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the <hi>Duke,</hi> the whole <hi>Senate,</hi> and all
their Dominions; and then shut up all their
<hi>Churches</hi>; charging the whole Clergy to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56222:69"/>
all sacred Offices to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> till
their Obedience should render them capable of
<hi>Absolution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this act of the Popes</hi> did the more confirm
the <hi>Venetians</hi> in their resolution not to obey
him; <hi>And to that end, upon the hearing of his
Interdict, they presently</hi> published by sound <hi>of
Trumpet, a Proclamation to this effect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That whosoever hath received from <hi>Rome</hi>
any Copy of a Papal interdict, publish'd there,
well against the Law of God, as against the
Honour of this Nation, shall presently ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it to the Councel of <hi>Ten,</hi> upon pain of
death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then was the <hi>Inquisition</hi> presently suspended
by Order of the State; and the Flood-gates
being thus set open, any pleasant or scoffing
wit might safely vent it self against the <hi>Pope,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by free speaking, or in Print.</p>
                  <p>Matters thus heightned, the State advised
with Father <hi>Paul,</hi> a holy and Learned Fryer
(the Authour of the <hi>History of the Council of
Trent</hi>) whose advice was, <hi>Neither to Provoke
the Pope, nor lose their own Right</hi>; he declaring
publickly in Print, in the name of the State,
<hi>That the Pope was trusted to keep two Keyes; one
of</hi> Prudence, <hi>and the other of</hi> Power; <hi>And that
if they were not both used together,</hi> Power <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56222:70"/>
is not effectual in an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus it continued, till a report was
blown abroad, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> were all turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Protestants</hi>: which was believed by many,
for that it was observ'd, the <hi>English</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
was so often in conference with the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
aud his Chaplain Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> more often
with Father <hi>Paul</hi>: And also, for that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi>
of <hi>Venice</hi> was known to give Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on
to <hi>Gregory Justiniano,</hi> then their Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
in <hi>England,</hi> to make all these proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
known to the King, and to crave a Promise
of his assistance, if need should require: and in
the mean time, the <hi>King's</hi> advice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which was the same that he gave to
<hi>Pope Clement</hi> at his first coming to the Crown
of <hi>England</hi>; (that Pope then moving him to an
Union with the <hi>Roman Church</hi>) namely; <hi>To
endeavour the calling of a free Council, for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of peace in Christendom: And that he
doubed not, but that the French King, and divers
other Princes would joyn to assist in so good a work;
and in the mean time, the sin of this Breach, both
with his, and the</hi> Venetians <hi>Dominions, must of
necessity lie at the</hi> Pope's <hi>door.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this contention (which lasted several
years) the <hi>Pope</hi> grew still higher, and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
more resolv'd and careless; still ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
King <hi>James</hi> with their proceedings,
which was done by the help of Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56222:70"/>
Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> and <hi>Padre Paulo,</hi> whom the
<hi>Venetians</hi> did then call to be one of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultors
of State, and with his Pen to defend
their Cause: which was by him so performed,
that the <hi>Pope</hi> saw plainly, he had weakned his
Power by exceeding it, and offered the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
Absolution upon very easie terms; which
the <hi>Venetians</hi> still slighting did at last obtain, by
that which was scarce so much as a shew of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
it: For they made an order, that
in that day, in which they were absolv'd, there
should be no publick rejoycing: nor any <hi>Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires</hi>
that night; lest the Common people
might judg they were absolved for committing
a fault.</p>
                  <p>These Contests were the occasion of <hi>Padre
Paulo</hi> his knowledge and interest with King
<hi>James,</hi> for whose sake principally <hi>Padre Paul</hi>
compiled that eminent History of the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Council of <hi>Trent</hi>; which History was, as
fast as it was written, sent in several sheets in
Letters by Sir <hi>Henry VVotton,</hi> Mr <hi>Bedel,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> and others, unto King <hi>James,</hi> and
the then Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; and
there first made publick both in <hi>English</hi>; and in
the universal Language.</p>
                  <p>For eight years after Sir <hi>Henry Wottons</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Italy,</hi> he stood fair, and highly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Kings opinion, but at last became
much clouded by an accident, which I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to relate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56222:71"/>At his first going Embassadour into <hi>Italy</hi>; as
he passed through <hi>Germany,</hi> he stayed some
dayes at <hi>Augusta</hi>; where having been in his
former Travels, well known by many of the
best note for Learning and Ingeniousness, (those
that are esteemed the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> of that Nation)
with whom he passing an evening in merriments,
was requested by <hi>Christopher Flecamore</hi> to write
some Sentence in his <hi>Albo</hi>; (a Book of white
paper, which, for that purpose many of the
<hi>German</hi> Gentry usually carry about then.) and
Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> consenting to the motion,
took an occasion from some accidental discourse
of the present Company, to write a pleasant
definition of an Embassadour, in these very
words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Legatus est vir bonus peregre mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missus

causâ.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Which Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> could have been
content should have been thus Englished:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>An Ambassadour is an honest man,
sent to lie abroad for the good of
his Country.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>But the word for <hi>lye</hi> being the hinge upon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56222:71"/>
which the Conceit was to turn) was not so
expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s'd in Latine as would admit (in the hands
of an enemy especially) so fair a constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as Sir <hi>Henry</hi> thought in <hi>English.</hi> Yet as
it was, it slept quietly among other Sentences
in this <hi>Albo,</hi> almost <hi>eight years,</hi> till by accident
it fell into the hands of <hi>Jasper Scioppius</hi>; a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist,
a man of a restless spirit, and a malicious
Pen: who with Books against King <hi>James,</hi>
prints this as a Principle of that Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by the King and his Embassadour Sir
<hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> then at <hi>Venice</hi>; and in <hi>Venice</hi>
it was presently after written in several Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Windowes,
and spitefully declared to be Sir
<hi>Henry VVottons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This coming to the knowledge of King
<hi>James,</hi> he apprehended it to be such an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
such a weakness, or worse, in Sir <hi>Henry
VVotton,</hi> as caused the King to express much
wrath against him; and this caused Sir <hi>Henry
VVotton</hi> to write two Apologies, one to <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serus</hi>
(one of the Chiefs of <hi>Augusta</hi>) in the
Universal Language, which he caus'd to be
printed, and given, and scattered in the most
remarkable places both of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
as an Antidote against the venemous books of
<hi>Scioppius</hi>: and another Apology to King <hi>James,</hi>
which were both so ingenious, so clear, and so
choicely Eloquent, that his Majesty (who was
a pure Judge of it) could not forbear at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
thereof, to declare publickly, <hi>That Sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56222:72"/>
VVotton had commuted sufficiently for a greater
offence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, as broken bones well set become
stronger; so Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
but was much more confirmed in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
estimation and favour then formerly he
had been.</p>
                  <p>And as that man (his friend) of great wit
and useful fancy, gave in a Will<note n="*" place="margin">

of conceits</hi>) his <hi>Reputation</hi> to his <hi>Friends,</hi> and his
<hi>Industry</hi> to his <hi>Foes,</hi> because from thence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
both: so those friends, that in this time
of tryal labored to excuse this facetious freedom
of Sir <hi>Henry Wottons,</hi> were to him more dear,
and by him more highly valued; and those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
that urged this as an advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: caused him by this errour, to grow
both more wise, and which is the best fruit er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
can bring forth) for the future to become
more industriously watchful over his tongue and
pen.</p>
                  <p>I have told you a part of his imployment in
<hi>Italy,</hi> where (notwithstanding the accusation
of <hi>Scioppius</hi>) his interest still increas'd with
this Duke <hi>Leonardo Donato</hi>; after whose
death (as though it had been an intail'd love)
it was still found living in the succeeding Dukes,
during all the time of his imployment to that
State: (which was almost Twenty years.) All
which time he studied the dispositions of those
<hi>Dukes,</hi> and the other <hi>Consultors</hi> of State; well
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56222:72"/>
knowing, that he who negotiates a continued
business, and neglects the study of dispositions,
usually fails in his proposed ends: But this Sir
<hi>Henry Wotton</hi> did not, for by a fine sorting of
fit Presents, curious, and not costly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
alwayes sweetned by various and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
discourse; with which, and his choice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of stories, and his so elegant deliver'd
of all these, even in their <hi>Italian</hi> Language, he
first got, and still preserv'd such interest in the
State of <hi>Venice,</hi> that it was observ'd (such
was either his merit or his modesty) they never
denyed him any request.</p>
                  <p>But all this shewes but his abilities, and his
fitness for that Imployment: 'Twill therefore
be needful to tell the Reader, what use he made
of the Interest which these procured him; and
that indeed was, rather to oblige others, then
to enrich himself; he still endeavouring that
the reputation of the <hi>English</hi> might be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
both in the <hi>German</hi> Empire, and in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>;
where many Gentlemen, whom Travel
had invited into that Nation, received from
him chearfull Entertainments, advice for their
behaviour, and shelter, or deliverance from
those accidental storms of adversity, which usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
attend upon Travel.</p>
                  <p>And because these things may appear to the
Reader to be but Generals, I shall acquaint
him with two particular Examples; one, of his
merciful disposition, and one, of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56222:73"/>
of his Mind: which shall follow.</p>
                  <p>There had been many <hi>English</hi> Souldiers
brought by Commanders of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to serve the <hi>Uenetians</hi> for pay against the
<hi>Turk</hi>: and those <hi>English,</hi> having by Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or Improvidence, brought themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
several Gallies and Prisons, Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
became a Petitioner to that State for their
Lives, and Inlargement; and his request was
granted; so that those (which were many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,
and there made the sad Examples of
humane misery, by hard imprisonment, and
unpitied poverty in a strange Nation) were
by his means released, relieved, and in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Condition sent to thank God and him
for their Lives and Libertyes, in their own
Country.</p>
                  <p>And this I have observed as one testimony
of the compassionate Nature of him, who was
(during his stay in those parts) as a City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for the Distressed of this and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>And for that which I offer as a Testimony of
the Nobleness of his mind: I shall make way to
the Readers clearer understanding of it, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him that Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> was sent thrice
Embassadour to the Republick of <hi>Uenice</hi>; and
that at his second going thither, he was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Embassador to several of the <hi>German</hi> Princes,
and to the Emperour <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the second;
and, that his employment to him, and those
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56222:73"/>
Princes, was to incline them to equitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
for the restauration of the Queen of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi>
and her Descendents to their Patrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Inheritance of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was by his eight months constant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and attendance upon the <hi>Emperour,</hi> his
Court and Counsel) brought to the probability
of a succesful Conclusion without bloodshed,
there being at that time two opposite armies in
the field but, as they were treating, the Armies
met; and there was a battle fought, the managery
whereof was so full of miserable errours on the
one side (so Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> expresses it in
a dispatch to the King) and so advantagious to
the Emperour, as put an end to all Hopes of a
succcessful Treaty: so that <hi>Sir Henry</hi> seeing the
face of Peace altered by that Victory, prepared
for a Removal from that Court; and at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from the <hi>Emperour,</hi> was so bold as to
remember him, <hi>That the Events of every Battel
move <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the unseen wheels of Fortune, which are
this moment up, and down the next; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
humbly advised him to use his Victory so
soberly, as still to put on thoughts of Peace.</hi>
Which advice, though it seemed to be spoke
with some Passion, his dear Mistress the
<hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> being concerned in it, was yet
taken in good part, by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who
was much pleased with his carriage, all the
time that he resided in his Court; and said,
<hi>That the King his Master was look'd on as an
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56222:74"/>
Abettor of his Enemy the Palsgrave,</hi> but yet,
he took him to be a Person of much <hi>Honour</hi>
and <hi>Merit,</hi> and did therefore desire him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of that <hi>Jewel,</hi> as a Testimony of his
good opinion of him; which was a <hi>Jewel</hi> of
Diamonds, of more value then a thousand
pounds.</p>
                  <p>This was received with all Circumstances
and terms of Honour, by Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi>;
but the next morning, at his departing from
<hi>Vienna,</hi> at his taking leave of the Countess
of <hi>Sabrina</hi> (an <hi>Italian</hi> Lady) in whose House
the Emperour had appointed him to be lodg'd,
and honourably entertained: <hi>He acknowledged
her Merits, and besought her to accept of that
Jewel, as a testimony of his gratitude for her
Civilities</hi>: presenting her with the same that
was given him by the <hi>Emperour</hi>; which being
suddenly discovered by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> was by
him taken for a high affront, and Sir <hi>Henry
Wotton</hi> told so: To which he replyed, <hi>That
though he received it with thankfulness; yet he
found in himself an indisposition to be the better
for any gift that came from an Enemy to his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Mistress the Queen of Bohemia,</hi> for so she was
pleased, he should alwayes call her.</p>
                  <p>Many other of his services to his Prince,
and this Nation, might be insisted upon, as
namely his procuration of Priviledges, and
courtesies with the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and the
Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> for the <hi>English</hi> Merchants,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56222:74"/>
and what he did by direction of <hi>King James</hi>
with the <hi>Venetian</hi> State, concerning the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Spalato's</hi> return to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
But for the particulars of these, and many
more, that I mean to make known; I want a
view of some papers that might inform me,
(his late Majesties <hi>Letter-Office</hi> having suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a strange alienation) and, indeed I want
time too; for, the Printers Press-stayes; so
that I must haste to bring Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> in
an instant from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> leaving the
Reader to make up what is defective in this
place, by this small supplement of the inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption

those houses where he rested, or lodged,
when he returned from his last Embassie into

                  <p>To <hi>London</hi> he came that year in which
King <hi>James</hi> dyed; who having for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of his forreign service, promised him
the reversion of an Office which was fit
to be turned into present money, for a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of his present necessities, and also grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him the reversion of the <hi>Master of the Rolls</hi>
place, if he out-lived charitable Sir <hi>Julius
Caesar,</hi> who then possessed it: and then, grown
so old, that he was said to be kept alive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Natures Course, by the prayers of those
many poor which he daily relieved.</p>
                  <p>But, these were but in hope; and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
required a present support: For in the
beginning of these imployments he sold to his
elder brother the Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> the Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
left by his good Father, and (which
is worse) was now at his return indebted to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56222:75"/>
several persons, whom he was not able to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
but by the Kings payment of his Arrears
due for his forreign Imployments: He had
brought into <hi>England</hi> many servants, of which
some were <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Artists; this
was part of his condition, who had many times
hardly sufficient to supply the occasions of the
day. (For it may by no means be said of his
providence, as himself said of Sir <hi>Philip Sidney's</hi>
wit, <hi>That it was the very measure of congruity</hi>)
He being alwayes so careless of money, as
though our Saviours wores, <hi>Care not for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
were to be literally understood.</p>
                  <p>But it pleased God, that in this juncture of
time, the Provostship of His Majesties Colledge
of <hi>Eaton</hi> became void by the death of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Murray,</hi>
for which there were (as the place deserv'd)
many earnest and powerful Suiters to the <hi>King.</hi>
Sir <hi>Henry</hi> who had for many years (like <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>)
rolled the restless stone of a State im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
and knowing experimentally, that
the great blessing of sweet content was not to
be found in multitudes of men or business; and,
that a <hi>Colledge</hi> was the fittest place to nourish
<hi>holy thoughts,</hi> and to afford rest both to his body
and mind, which his age (being now almost
threescore years) seemed to require, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
use his own, and the interest of all his friends
to procure it. By which means, and quitting the
King of his promised reversionary Offices, and
a piece of honest policy (which I have not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56222:76"/>
time to relate) he got a Grant of it from His
Majesty.</p>
                  <p>And this was a fair settlement for his <hi>mind</hi>:
but <hi>money</hi> was wanting to furnish him with
those necessaries which attend removes, and a
settlement in such a place; and to procure that,
he wrote to his old friend Mr. <hi>Nicholas Pey,</hi> for
his assistance; of which <hi>Nicholas Pey,</hi> I shall
here say a little, for the clearing of something
that I shall say hereafter.</p>
                  <p>He was in his youth a Clerk, or in some such
way, a servant to the Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry's</hi>
brother; and by him, when he was Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Kings Houshold, was made a great
Officer in His Majesties house. This, and other
favours being conferred upon Mr. <hi>Pey</hi> (in whom
was a radical honesty) were alwayes thankfully
acknowledged by him, and his gratitude exprest
by a willing and unwearied serviceableness to
that Family even till his death. To him

writ over his <hi>Study</hi> door.</p>
                  <p>This money, being part of his Arrears, was
by his own, and the help of honest <hi>Nicholas
Pey's</hi> interest in Court, quickly procured him;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56222:76"/>
and he as quickly in the <hi>Colledge,</hi> the place where
indeed his happiness then seemed to have its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
the <hi>Colledge</hi> being to his mind, as a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Harbor to a Sea-faring-man after a tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
voyage; where, by the bounty of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Founder, his very <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Rayment</hi> were
plentifully provided for him in kind; where
he was freed from all corroding cares, and seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on such a Rock, as the waves of want could
not probably shake, where he might sit in a
<hi>Calm,</hi> and looking down, behold the busie mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
turmoyl'd and tossed in a tempestuous
Sea of dangers! And (as Sir <hi>William Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
has happily exprest the like of another
person)</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Laugh at the graver business of the State,</l>
                     <l>Which speaks men rather wise than fortunate.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Being thus setled according to the desires of
his <hi>heart,</hi> his first <hi>study</hi> was the Statutes of the
<hi>Colledge</hi>: by which, he conceiv'd himself bound
to enter into <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> which he did; being
made <hi>Deacon</hi> with convenient speed, shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as he came in his <hi>Surplice</hi> from the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service,</hi>
an old Friend, a person of Quality, met
him so attired, and joyed him of his new habit;
to whom Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> replied, <hi>I thank</hi> God
<hi>and the</hi> King, <hi>by whose goodness I now am in this
condition; a condition, which that Emperor</hi> Charles
<hi>the Fifth, seem'd to approve: who, after so many
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56222:77"/>
remarkable Victories, when his glory was great in
the eyes of all men, freely gave up his</hi> Crown, <hi>and
the many cares that attended it, to</hi> Philip <hi>his son,
making a holy retreat to a Cloysteral life, where he
might by devout</hi> meditations <hi>consult with</hi>God,
(which the rich or busie men seldom do) <hi>and
have leisure both to examine the errors of his life
past, and prepare for that great day, wherein all
flesh must make an account of their actions: And
after a kind of tempestuous life, I now have the
like advantage from him,</hi> that makes the out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the morning to praise him; <hi>even from
my</hi> God, <hi>whom I daily magnifie for this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
mercy, of an exemption from business, a quiet
mind, and a liberal maintenance, even in this part
of my life, when my</hi> age <hi>and</hi> infirmities <hi>seem to
sound me a retreat from the pleasures of this world,
and invite me to contemplation, in which I have
ever taken the greatest felicity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now to speak a little of the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his <hi>time</hi>: After his customary publick
Devotions, his use was to retire into his <hi>Study,</hi>
and there to spend some hours in reading the
Bible, and Authors in Divinity, closing up his
meditations with private prayer; this was, for
the most part, his employment in the Forenoon:
But, when he was once sate to Dinner, then
nothing but chearful thoughts possess'd his
mind; and, those still increased by constant
company at his Table, of such persons as brought
thither additions both of Learning and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56222:77"/>
but some part of most dayes was usually
spent in <hi>Philosophical Conclusions.</hi> Nor did he
forget his innate pleasure of <hi>Angling,</hi> which he
would usually call, <hi>his idle time, not idely spent</hi>;
saying, he would rather live five <hi>May-months,</hi>
than <hi>forty Decembers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was a great lover of his Neighbours, and
a bountiful entertainer of them very often at his
Table, where his meat was choice, and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
better.</p>
                  <p>He was a constant Cherisher of all those
youths in that School, in whom he found either
a constant diligence, or a <hi>genius</hi> that prompted
them to Learning; for whose encouragement,
he was (beside many other things of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and beauty) at the charge of setting up in
it two rowes of <hi>Pillars,</hi> on which he caused to
be choicely drawn, the pictures of divers of the
most famous <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Historians, Poets,</hi>
and <hi>Orators</hi>; perswading them not to neglect
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> because <hi>Almighty God has left Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
affections to be wrought upon</hi>: And he would
often say, <hi>That none despised Eloquence, but such
dull souls as were not capable of it.</hi> He would
also often make choice of some Observations
out of those <hi>Historians</hi> and <hi>Poets</hi>: and would
never leave the School, without dropping some
choice <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin Apothegm</hi> or sentence,
that might be worthy of a room in the memory
of a growing Scholar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56222:78"/>He was pleased constantly to breed up one or
more hopeful Youths, which he picked out of
the <hi>School,</hi> and took into his own Domestick
care, and to attend him at his Meals; out of
whose <hi>Discourse</hi> and <hi>Behaviour,</hi> he gathered
observations for the better compleating of his
intended work of <hi>Education</hi>: of which, by
his still striving to make the whole better, he
lived to leave but part to Posterity.</p>
                  <p>He was a great Enemy to <hi>wrangling Disputes</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> concerning which I shall say a little,
both to testifie that, and to shew the readiness of
his Wit.</p>
                  <p>Having in <hi>Rome</hi> made acquaintance with a
pleasant <hi>Priest,</hi> who invited him one Evening to
hear their Vesper <hi>Musick</hi> at <hi>Church</hi>; the Priest
seeing Sir <hi>Henry</hi> stand obscurely in a corner, sends
to him by a Boy of the Quire this question, writ
in a small piece of paper, <hi>Where was your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

                  <p>The next Vesper, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> went purposely
to the same Church, and sent one of the Quire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes
with this Question, to his honest, pleasant
friend, the Priest; <hi>Do you believe all those many

                  </p>
                  <p>To one that asked him, <hi>Whether a Papist may
be saved</hi>? he replyed, <hi>You may be saved without
knowing that.</hi> Look to your self.</p>
                  <p>To another, whose earnestness exceeded his
knowledge, and was still railing again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
he gave this advice, <hi>Pray Sir forbear, till
you have studied the Points better; for the wise</hi>
Italians <hi>have this Proverb, He that understands
amiss, concludes worse</hi>: And take heed of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>The farther you go from the Church of</hi> Rome,
<hi>the nearer you are to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to another that spake indiscreet, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
words against <hi>Arminius,</hi> I heard him reply to
this purpose:</p>
                  <p>In my travel towards <hi>Venice,</hi> as I past through
<hi>Germany,</hi> I rested almost a year at <hi>Leyden,</hi> where
I entred into an acquaintance with <hi>Arminius</hi> (then
the Professor of <hi>Divinity</hi> in that University) a
man much talk'd of in this Age, which is made up
of opposition and <hi>Controversie</hi>: And indeed, if
I mistake not <hi>Arminius</hi> in his expressions (as so
weak a brain as mine is may easily do) then I know
I differ from him in some points; yet, I profess
my judgement of him to be, that he was a man of
most rare Learning, and I knew him to be of a most
strict life, and of a most meck spirit. And that he
was so mild, appears by his Proposals to our Master
<hi>Perkins</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> from whose Book, <hi>of the
Order and Causes of Salvation</hi> (which was first
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56222:79"/>
writ in Latin) <hi>Arminius</hi> took the occasion of
writing some <hi>Queries</hi> to him concerning the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> intending them ('tis said)
to come privately to Mr. <hi>Perkin's</hi> own hands, and
to receive from him, a like private, and a like lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Answer</hi>: But, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> dyed before those
<hi>Queries</hi> came to him; and 'tis thought <hi>Arminius</hi>
meant them to dye with him; for though he lived
long after, I have heard he forbore to publish them,
(but since his death, his sons did not:) And 'tis
pity (if God had been so pleased) that Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
did not live to see, consider, and answer those
proposals himself; for he was also of a most meek
<hi>spirit,</hi> and of great and sanctified <hi>Learning</hi>: And
though since their deaths, many (of high parts and
piety) have undertaken to clear the Controversie;
yet, for the most part, they have rather satisfied
themselves, than convinced the dissenting party.
And doubtless, many middle-witted men (which
yet may mean well) many Scholars that are not in
the highest Form for Learning (which yet may
preach well) men that shall never know, till they
come to Heaven, where the questions stick betwixt
<hi>Arminius</hi> and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will yet in
this world be tampering with, and thereby perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Controversie,</hi> and do therefore justly fall
under the reproof of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> for being <hi>Busie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies,</hi>
and for <hi>medling with things they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here it offers it self (I think not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
to tell the Reader, that a friend of Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56222:79"/>
Woltons,</hi> being designed for the imployment
of an <hi>Ambassador,</hi> came to <hi>Eaton,</hi> and requested
from him some experimental Rules for his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and safe carriage in his Negotiations; to
whom he smilingly gave this for an infallible
<hi>Aphorism; That, to be in safety himself, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to his</hi> Countrey, <hi>he should alwayes, and
upon all occasions speak the</hi> truth (<hi>it seems a</hi> State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Paradox)
<hi>for, sayes Sir</hi> Henry Wotton, <hi>you shall
never be believed; and by this means, your truth
will secure your self, if you shall ever be called to
any account; and 'twill also put your Adversaries
(who will still hunt counter) to a loss in all their
disquisitions, and undertakings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many more of this nature might be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but they must be laid aside; for I shall
here make a little stop, and invite the Reader to
look back with me, whil'st (according to my
promise) I shall say a little of Sir <hi>Albertus Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>William Bedel,</hi> whom I formerly
mentioned.</p>
                  <p>I have told you that are the Readers, that at
Sir <hi>Henry Wottons</hi> first going Ambassador into
<hi>Italy,</hi> his Cosin, Sir <hi>Albert Morton,</hi> went his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary;
and am next to tell you, that Sir <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi>
dyed, <hi>Secretary of State</hi> to our late
King; but cannot, am not able to express the
sorrow that possest Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> at his first
hearing the news that Sir <hi>Albertus</hi> was by death
lost to him and this world; and yet, the Reader
may partly guess by these following expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56222:80"/>
The first in a Letter to his <hi>Nicholas Pey,</hi> of
which this that followeth is a part.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>—And <hi>My dear Nick,</hi> When I had been here
almost a fortnight, in the midst of my great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
I received notice of Sir <hi>Albertus Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
his departure out of this World, who was dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to me, than mine own being in it; what a wound
it is to my heart, you that knew him, and knew me,
will easily believe: but, our Creators Will must be
done, and unrepiningly received by his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who is the Lord of all Nature, and of all
Fortune, when he taketh to himself now one, and
then another, till that expected day, wherein it shall
please him to dissolve the whole, and wrap up even
the Heaven it self as a Scrole of parchment: This
is the last <hi>Philosophy</hi> that we must study upon
Earth; let us therefore that yet remain here, as
our dayes and friends waste, reinforce our love to
each other; which of all vertues, both <hi>spiritual</hi>
and <hi>moral,</hi> hath the highest <hi>priviledge,</hi> because
death it self cannot end it. And my good <hi>Nick,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is a part of his sorrow thus exprest to
his <hi>Nick Pey</hi>; the other part is in this following
Elogy, of which the Reader may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
'twas too hearty to be dissembled.</p>

                  <p>And for what I shall say concerning Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Bedel,</hi> I must prepare the Reader, by telling
him, That when King <hi>James</hi> sent Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
Ambassador to the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> he sent
also an Ambassador to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and
another to the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
of <hi>France,</hi> went <hi>Joseph Hall</hi> (late <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
of <hi>Norwich</hi>) whose many and useful works,
speak his great merit; with the Ambassador of

Wotton</hi> went <hi>William Bedel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These three Chaplains, to these three Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
were all bred in one University, all of

                     </gap>e Friends: But in
<hi>Spain,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> met with temptations, or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56222:81"/>
reasons, such as were so powerful, as to perswade
him (who of the three, was formerly observ'd
to be the most averse to that Religion that calls
itself <hi>Catholick</hi>) to disclaim himself a Member
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and declare himself
for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> discharging himself
of his attendance on the Ambassador, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
himself to a Monasterial life; in which
he lived very regularly, and so dyed.</p>
                  <p>When Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> (the late <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi>)
came into <hi>England,</hi> he wrote to Mr. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi>
('tis the first Epistle in his printed Decads) to
perswade his return, or the reason of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie;
the Letter seemed to have in it many
sweet expressions of love, and yet, there was
something in it that was so unpleasant to Mr.
<hi>Wadsworth,</hi> that he chose rather to acquaint his
old friend Mr. <hi>Bedel</hi> with his motives; by which
means, there past betwixt Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Wadsworth</hi> very many Letters, which be extant
in Print, and did well deserve it; for in them
there seems to be a controversie, not of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on only, but, who should answer each other with
most love and meekness; which I mention the
rather, because it seldom falls out so in a Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>War.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a little more to be said of Mr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi>

                  <p>TO this Letter, I shall add this; That he
was (to the great joy of Sir <hi>Henry
Wotton</hi>) made Governor of the said Colledge;
and that after a fair discharge of his duty and
trust there, he was thence removed to be <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Kilmore</hi>: In both which places, his life was
so holy, as seemed to equal the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
for as they, so he kept all the <hi>Ember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeks,</hi>
observed (besides his private devotions)
the <hi>Canonical</hi> hours of Prayer very strictly; and
so he did all the Feasts, and Fast-dayes of his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56222:83"/>
Mother, the Church of <hi>England</hi>; his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Charity were both such, as shewed his
affections were set upon <hi>things that are above</hi>;
for indeed his whole life brought forth the <hi>fruits
of the Spirit</hi>; there being in him such a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
meekness, that as St.<hi>Paul</hi> advised his <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
in the Election of a <hi>Bishop,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>That he have
a good report of those that be without</hi>; so had he:
<hi>for those that were without,</hi> even those that in
point of Religion, were of the <hi>Roman</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(of which there were very many in
his Diocess) did yet ever look upon him with
respect and reverence; and, testified it, by a
concealing, and safe protecting him, in the late
horrid Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when the fury of the
wild <hi>Irish</hi> knew no distinction of persons; and
yet there, and then, he was protected and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
by those of a contrary perswasion; and
there, and then he dyed, though not by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
And with him was lost many of his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Writings, which were thought worthy of
preservation; and amongst the rest, was lost
the <hi>Bible,</hi> which by many years labour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and study, he had translated into the
<hi>Irish</hi> Tongue, with an intent to have printed it
for publick use.</p>
                  <p>More might be said of Mr.<hi>Bedel,</hi> who (I
told the Reader) was Sir <hi>Henry Wottons</hi> first
Chaplain; and much of his second Chaplain,
<hi>Isaac Bargrave,</hi> Doctor in <hi>Divinity,</hi> and the late
learned and hospitable Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56222:83"/>
also, of the Merit of many others, that had the
happiness to attend Sir <hi>Henry</hi> in his forreign im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments:
But, the Reader may think that in
this digression, I have already carried him too far
from <hi>Eaton-Colledge,</hi> and therefore I shall lead
him back as gently, and as orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sir <hi>Henry Wotton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> had propos'd to himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he entred into his Collegiate life, to write
the life of <hi>Martin Luther</hi>; and in it, the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Reformation, as it was carried on in
<hi>Germany</hi>: For the doing of which, he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
advantages by his several Embassies into
those parts, and his interest in the several Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the <hi>Empire</hi>; by whose means he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to the Records of all the <hi>Hans Towns,</hi> and
the knowledge of many secret passages that fell
not under common view; and in these he had
made a happy progress, as is well known to his
worthy friend Dr. <hi>Duppa,</hi> the late Reverend
Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>; but in the midst of this
design, His late Majesty (King <hi>Charles</hi>) that
knew the value of Sir <hi>Henry Wottons</hi> Pen) did
by a perswasive loving violence (to which may
be added a promise of 500 <hi>l.</hi> a year) force him
to lay <hi>Luther</hi> aside, and betake himself to write
the History of <hi>England</hi>; in which he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to write some short Characters of a few
Kings, as a foundation upon which he meant to
build; but, for the present, meant to be more
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56222:84"/>
large in the story of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>sixth,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that Colledge, in which he then enjoy'd
all the worldly happiness of his present being;
but Sir <hi>Henry</hi> dyed in the midst of this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and the footsteps of his labours are not
recoverable by a more than common dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                  <p>This is some account both of his inclination,
and the employment of his time in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
where he seemed to have his <hi>Youth</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
by a continual conversation with that
Learned Society, and a daily recourse of other
Friends of choicest breeding and parts, by

best satisfied by the knowledge of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,</hi>
I think fit to declare, that every one
that was named in his Will, did gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Legacies; by which, and his most
just and passionate desires for the payment of
his debts, they joyned in assisting the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers
of his Will; and by their joynt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to the King (then whom none was
more willing) conscionable satisfaction was
given for his just debts.</p>
                  <p>The next thing wherewith I shall acquaint
the Reader, is, That he went usually once a
year, if not oftner, to the beloved <hi>Bocton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
where he would say, he found both cure
for all cares, by the company (which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the living furniture) of that place: and,
a restorative of his strength, by the Connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralness
of that, which he called his <hi>genial</hi>
aire.</p>
                  <p>He yearly went also to <hi>Oxford.</hi> But the
Summer before his death he changed that
for a journey to <hi>Winchester</hi>- Colledge; to
which School he was first removed from <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton.</hi>
And as he returned from <hi>Winchester,</hi>
towards <hi>Eaton</hi> Colledge, said to a friend, his
Companion in that Journey; <q>How usefull
was that advice of a Holy <hi>Monk,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56222:89"/>
his friend to perform his Customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
devotions in a constant place; because in
that place, we usually meet with those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thoughts which possessed us at our last
being there; And I find it thus far expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
true; that, at my now being in
that School, and seeing that very place
where I sate when I was a boy, occasioned
me to remember those very thoughts of
my youth which then possessed me; sweet
thoughts indeed, that promised my grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
years numerous pleasures, without
mixtures of cares; and those to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
when time (which I therefore
thought slow pac'd) had changed my <hi>youth</hi>
into <hi>manhood.</hi> But age and experience
have taught me, that those were but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
hopes. And though my dayes have
been many, and those mixt with more
pleasures, than the sons of men do usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoy: yet, I have alw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

possessed me. Thus one generation succeeds

took up their constant habitations with him,
still weakning his body; of which he grew

                     <p>I Have been perswaded, by a Friend
whom I reverence, and ought to obey,
to write <hi>The Life of RICHARD
HOOKER,</hi> the happy Author of
Five (if not more) of the Eight learned Books
of <hi>the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity.</hi> And,
though I have undertaken it, yet it hath been with
some unwillingness; because I foresee that it must
prove to me, and especially at this time of my Age,
a work of much labour to enquire, consider, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>search,
and determine what is needful to be known
concerning him: For, I knew him not in his Life,
and must therefore not only look back to his Death,
now <hi>64</hi> years past; but, almost <hi>50</hi> years beyond
that, even to his Childhood and Youth, and gather
thence such Observations and Prognosticks, as may
at least adorn, if not prove necessary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of what I have undertaken.</p>
                     <p>This trouble I foresee; and foresee also, that it
is impossible to escape Censures; against which I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56222:96"/>
will not hope my well-meaning and diligence can
protect me (for I consider the Age in which I live)
and shall therefore but intreat of my Reader a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of them, till I have made known unto him
some Reasons, which I my self would now fain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
do make me in some measure fit for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking:
and, if these Reasons shall not acquit
me from all Censures, they may at least abate of
their severity, and this is all I can probably hope
for.</p>
                     <p>My Reasons follow.</p>
                     <p>About forty years past (for I am now past the
Seventy of my Age) I began a happy affinity with
<hi>William Cranmer</hi> (now with God) grand Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
unto the great Archbishop of that name, a
Family of noted prudence and resolution; with him
and two of his Sisters, I had an entire and free
friendship: one of them was the Wife of Doctor
<hi>Spencer,</hi> a Bosom-friend, and sometime Com-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil
with Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in <hi>Corpus-Christi Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and after President of the same.
I name them here, for that I shall have occasion to
mention them in this following Discourse; as also
<hi>George Cranmer</hi> their Brother, of whose useful
abilities my Reader may have a more authentick
Testimony, than my Pen can purchase for him, by
that of our learned <hi>Cambden,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>William Cranmer,</hi> and his two forenamed
Sisters, had some affinity, and a most familiar
friendship with M. <hi>Hooker</hi>; and, had had some part
of their Education with him in his house, when he
was Parson of <hi>Bishops-Borne</hi> near <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56222:96"/>
which City their good father then lived. They had
(I say) a part of their Education with him, as
my self since that time a happy Cohabitatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with
them; and having some years before read part of
Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Works with great liking and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
my affection to them made me a diligent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor
into many things that concerned him; as
namely, of his Person, his Nature, the management
of his Time his Wife, his Family, and the Fortune
of him and his. Which inquiry hath given me
much advantage in the knowledge of what is now
under my consideration, and intended for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of my Reader.</p>
                     <p>I had also a friendship with the Reverend Dr.
<hi>Usher,</hi> the late learned Archbishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and
with Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> the late learned and charitable
Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>; as also with the learned <hi>John
Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton-Colledge</hi>; and with them also
(who loved the very name of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>) I have
had many discourses concerning him: and from
them, and many others that have now put off Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
I might have had more Informations, if I
could then have admitted a thought of any fitness
for what by perswasion I have now undertaken. But,
though that full Harvest be irrecoverably lost, yet,
my Memory hath preserved some gleanings, and my
Diligence made such additions to them, as I hope
will prove useful to the completing of what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
In the discovery of which I shall be faithful,
and with this assurance put a period to my Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>

                     <p>IT is not to be doubted but that <hi>Richard
Hooker</hi> was born at <hi>Heavy-tree</hi> near or
within the Precincts, or in the City of
<hi>Exeter</hi>; a City which may justly boast,
that it was the Birth place of him, and
Sir <hi>Tho. Bodley</hi>; as indeed the County may in
which it stands, that it hath furnished this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Sir
<hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and many others, memorable
for their Valour and Learning. He was born
about the Year of our Redemption 1553, and
of Parents that were not so remarkable for
their Extraction or Riches, as for their Virtue
and Industry, and Gods blessing upon both; by
which they were enabled to educate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in some degree of Learning, of which our
<hi>Richard Hooker</hi> may appear to be one fair testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
and that Nature is not so partial, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to give the great blessings of Wisdom
and Learning, and with them the greater bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of Virtue and Government, to those on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that are of a more high and honourable
Birth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56222:97"/>His Complexion (if we may guess by him
at the age of Forty) was Sanguine, with a
mixture of Choler; and yet, his Motion was
slow even in his Youth, and so was his Speech,
never expressing an Earnestness in either of
them, but a Gravity sutable to the Aged. And
'tis observed (so far as Inquiry is able to look
back at this distance of Time) that at his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a School-boy he was an early Questionist,
quietly inquisitive <hi>Why this was, and that was
not, to be remembred? Why this was granted and
that denied?</hi> This being mixt with a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Modesty, and a sweet serene quietness of
Nature, and with them a quick apprehension
of many perplext part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of Learning imposed
then upon him as a Scholar, made his Master
and others to believe him to have an inward
blessed Divine Light, and therefore to consider
him to a little wonder. For in that, Children
were less pregnant, less confident, and more
malleable, than in this wiser, but not better,
Age.</p>
                     <p>This Meekness and conjuncture of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
with Modesty in his Conversation, being
observed by his Schoolmaster, caused him to
perswade his Parents (who intended him for an
Apprentice) to continue him at School, till he
could find out some means, by perswading his
rich Uncle, or some other charitable person, to
ease them of a part of their care and charge;
assuring them, that their son was so enriched
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56222:98"/>
with the blessings of Nature and Grace, that
God seemed to single him out as a special In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of his Glory. And the good man
told them also, that he would double his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in instructing him, and would neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
nor receive any other Reward, than the
content of so hopeful and happy an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>This was not unwelcome News, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to his Mother, to whom he was a dutiful
and dear Child; and all Parties were so pleased
with this proposal, that it was resolved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o it
should be. And in the mean time his Parents
and Master laid a foundation for his future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
by instilling into his Soul <hi>the seeds of
Piety,</hi> those conscientious principles of <hi>loving
and fearing God; of an early belief that he knows
the very secrets of our Souls; That he punisheth
our Vices, and rewards our Innocence; That we
should be free from hypocrisie, and appear to man
what we are to God, because first or last the crafty
man is catch't in his own snare.</hi> These seeds of
Piety were so seasonably planted, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
watered with the daily dew of Gods
blessed Spirit, that his Infant vertues grew into
such holy habits, as did make him grow daily
into more and more favour both with God and
man, which with the great Learning that he did
attain to, hath made <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> honour'd in
this<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and will continue him to be so to succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Generations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56222:98"/>This good Schoolmaster, whose Name I am
not able to recover (and am sorry, for that I
would have given him a better memorial in this
humble Monument, dedicated to the memory
of his Scholar) was very sollicitous with <hi>John
Hooker,</hi> then Chamberlain of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and Uncle
to our <hi>Richard,</hi> to take his Nephew into his
care, and to maintain him for one Year in the
University, and in the mean time to use his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to procure an admission for him into
some Colledge; still urging and assuring him,
that his Charge would not continue long, for
the Lads Learning and Manners were both so
remarkable, that they must of necessity be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of; and that doubtless God would
provide him some second Patron, that would
free him and his Parents from their future care
and charge.</p>
                     <p>These Reasons, with the affectionate Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
of his good Master, and Gods blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both, procured from his Uncle a faithful
promise, that he wou'd take him into his care
and charge before the expiration of the Year
following, which was performed by the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Learned <hi>John Jewell,</hi> who left, or
was about the first of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
out of <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi>
(of which he was a Fellow) for adhering to
the Truth of those Principles of Religion, to
which he had assented in the dayes of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Predecessor <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56222:99"/>
he having now a just cause to fear a more heavy
punishment than Expulsion, was forced, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing
this, to seek safety in another Nation;
and, with that safety the enjoyment of that
Doctrine and Worship, for which he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd.</p>
                     <p>But the Cloud of that Persecution and Fear
ending with the Life of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Church and State did then look
more clear and comfortable; so that he, and
with him many others of the same judgement,
made a happy return into <hi>England</hi> about the first
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; in which Year, this <hi>John
Jewell</hi> was sent a Commissioner or Visitor of
the Churches of the Western parts of this
Kingdom, and especially of those in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
in which County he was born, and then
and there he contracted a friendship with <hi>John
Hooker,</hi> the Uncle of our <hi>Richard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the second or third Year of her Reign, this
<hi>John Jewell</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and
there being alwayes observed in him a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to do good, and to obliege his Friends, and
now a power added to it, <hi>John Hooker</hi> gave him
a Visit in <hi>Salisbury, and be sought him for Charity's
sake to look favourably upon a poor Nephew of his,
whom Nature had fitted for a Scholar, but the
Estate of his Parents was so narrow, that they were
unable to give him the advantage of Learning;
and that the Bishop would therefore become his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
and prevent him from being a Tradesman;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56222:99"/>
for he was a Boy of remarkable hopes.</hi> And
though the Bishop knew men do not usually
look with an indifferent eye upon their own
Children and Relations yet he assented so far to
<hi>John Hooker,</hi> that he appointed the Boy and his
Schoolmaster should attend him about <hi>Easter</hi>
next following at that place, which was done
accordingly; and then after some Questions
and observations of the Boyes learning and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and behaviour, the Bishop gave his School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
a reward, and took order for an annual
Pension for the Boyes Parents<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> promising also
to take him into his care for a future preferment,
which was performed; for about the Fifteenth
Year of his age, which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1567, he was
by the Bishop appointed to remove to <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and there to attend Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi> then President of
<hi>Corpus-Christi</hi> Colledge. Which he did; and
Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> had (according to a promise made to
the Bishop) provided for him both a Tutor
(which was said to be the learned Dr. <hi>John Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi>)
and a Clerks place in that Colledge:
which place, though it were not a full mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
yet with the contribution of his Uncle,
and the continued Pension of his Patron the
good Bishop, gave him a comfortable subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And in this condition he continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Eighteenth Year of his age, still increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in Learning and Prudence, and so much in
Humility and Piety, that he seemed to be filled
with the Holy Ghost, and even like St. <hi>John
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56222:100"/>
Baptist,</hi> to be sanctified from his Mothers womb,
who did often bless the day in which she bare
him.</p>
                     <p>About this time of his age he fell into a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Sickness, which lasted two Months; all
which tim his Mother, having notice of it, did
in her hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly prayers as earnestly beg his life of
God, as the Mother of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> did that
he might become a true Christian; and their
prayers were both so heard as to be granted.
Which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> would often mention with
much joy, <hi>and as often pray that he might never
live to occasion any sorrow to so good a Mother, of
whom he would often say, he loved her so dearly, that
he would endeavour to be good even as much for
hers, as for his own sake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As soon as he was perfectly recovered from
this Sic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ness, he took a j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urney from <hi>Oxford</hi> to
<hi>Exeter,</hi> to satisfie and see his good Mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accompanied with a Countreyman and
Companion of his own Colledge, and both on
foot; which was then either more in fashion, or
want of money, or their humility made it so:
But on foot they went, and took <hi>Salisbury</hi> in
their way, purposely to see the good Bishop,
who made Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and his Companion dine
with him at his own Table; which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
boasted of with much joy and gratitude when
he saw his Mother and Friends: And at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
parting with him, the Bishop gave him
good Counsel, and his Benediction, but forgot
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56222:100"/>
to give him money; which when the Bishop had
considered, he sent a Servant in all haste to call
<hi>Richard</hi> back to him, and at <hi>Richards</hi> return, the
Bishop said to him, <hi>Richard, I sent for you back
to lend you a Horse, which hath carried me many
a Mile, and I thank God with much ease</hi>; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
delivered into his hand a Walking-staff,
with which he professed he had travelled
through many parts of <hi>Germany</hi>; and he said,
<hi>Richard, I do not give, but lend you my Horse; be
sure you be honest, and bring my Horse back to me
at your return this way to</hi> Oxford. <hi>And I do now
give you Ten Groats to bear your charges to</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<hi>and here is Ten Groats more, which I charge
you to deliver to your Mother, and tell her, I send
her a Bishops Benediction with it, and beg the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of her prayers for me. And if you bring
my Horse back to me, I will give you Ten Groats
more to carry you on foot to the Colledge, and so God
bless you, good</hi> Richard.</p>
                     <p>And this, you may believe, was performed by
both Parties. But, alas! the next News that
followed Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> was, that his
learned and charitable Patron had changed this
for a better life. Which may be believed, for
that as he lived, so he dyed, in devout medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and prayer; and in both so zealously, that
it became a religious question, Whether his last
Ej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>culations, or his Soul, did first enter into
Heaven?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56222:101"/>And now Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> became a man of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and fear; of sorrow, for the loss of so dear
and comfortable a Patron; and of fear, for his
future subsistence: But Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> raised his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
from this dejection, by bidding him go
chearfully to his Studies, and assuring him he
should neither want food nor rayment (which
was the utmost of his hopes) for he would
become his Patron.</p>
                     <p>And so he was for about nine months, and
not longer; for about that time, this following
accident did befall Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> (then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and
after Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>) had also been in the
dayes of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> forced, by forsaking this,
to seek safety in another Nation; where for
some Years Bishop <hi>Jewell</hi> and he were Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
at Bed and Board in <hi>Germany,</hi> and where
in this their Exile they did often eat the bread
of sorrow; and by that means they there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
such a friendship, as lasted till the death of
Bishop <hi>Jewell,</hi> which was in <hi>September</hi> 1571.
A little before which time, the two Bishops
meeting, <hi>Jewell</hi> began a story of his <hi>Richard
Hooker,</hi> and in it gave such a Character of his
Learning and Manners, that though Bishop
<hi>Sandys</hi> was educated in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he
had oblieged and had many Friends; yet his
resolution was, that his Son <hi>Edwin</hi> should
be sent to <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and by all means be Pupil to Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> though
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56222:101"/>
his Son <hi>Edwin</hi> was not then much yonger: for,
the Bishop said, <hi>I will have a Tutor for my Son
that shall teach him Learning by Instruction, and
Vertue by Example; and my greatest care shall
be of the last, and (God willing) this</hi> Richard
Hooker <hi>shall be the Man into whose hands I will
commit my</hi> Edwin. And the Bishop did so about
twelve moneths, or not much longer after this
resolution.</p>
                     <p>And doubtless as to these two a better
choice could not be made; for Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was
now in the nineteenth year of his age, had
spent five in the University, and had by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
unwearied diligence attained unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in all the learned Languages; by the
help of which, an excellent Tutor, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intermitted
Study, he had made the subtilty
of all the Arts easie and familiar to him, and
usefull for the discovery of such Learning as lay
hid from common Searchers; so that by these
added to his great Reason, and his Industry
added to both, <hi>He did not onely know more, of
Causes and effects, but what he knew, he knew
better then other men.</hi> And with this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he had a most blessed and clear Method
of Demonstrating what he knew, to the great
advantage of all his Pupils, (which in time
were many) but especially to his two first,
his dear <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> and his as dear <hi>George
Cranmer,</hi> of which there will be a fair Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the ensuing Relation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56222:102"/>This for his Learning. And for his Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
amongst other Testimonies this still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of him, That in four years, he was but
twice absent from the Chappel prayers; and
that his Behaviour there was such as shewed
an awful reverence of that God which he then
worshipped and prayed to; giving all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
testimonies that his Affections were set
on heavenly things. This was his Behaviour
towards God; and for that to Man, it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
that he was never known to be angry, or
passionate, or extream in any of his Desires;
never heard to repine or dispure with Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but by a quiet gentle submission and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of his will to the Wisdome of his
Creator, bore the burthen of the day with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
never heard to utter an uncomly word:
and by this and a grave Behaviour, which is a
Divine Charm, he begot an early Reverence
unto his Person, even from those that at other
times, and in other companies, took a liberty
to cast off that strictness of Behaviour and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
that is required in a Collegiate Life.
And when he took any liberty to be pleasant,
his Wit was never blemisht with Scoffing, or
the utterance of any Conceit that border'd
upon, or might beget a thought of Looseness
in his hearers. Thus milde, thus innocent and
exemplary was his Behaviour in his Colledge,
and thus this good man continued till his death,
still increasing in Learning in Patience, and Piety.</p>

<hi>Thomas Jackson</hi> of that Foundation: The

<hi>Harding.</hi> The Second, for the learned
and wise Menage of a publique Dispute with
<hi>John Hart</hi> (of the <hi>Romish</hi> perswasion) about
the Head and Faith of the Church, and then
printed by consent of both parties. And, the
Third, for his most excellent Exposition of the
Creed, and other Treatises: All such as have
given greatest satisfaction to men of the greatest
Learning. Nor was this man more Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
for his Learning, than for his strict and

Doctor <hi>Herbert Westphaling,</hi> a man of note for

Learning, being then Vice-chancellour. And
the Act following he was compleated Master,
which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1577. his Patron Doctor <hi>Cole</hi>
being Vice-chancellour that year, and his dear
friend <hi>Henry Savill</hi> of <hi>Merton Colledge</hi> being
then one of the Proctors. 'Twas that <hi>Henry
Savill,</hi> that was after Sir <hi>Henry Savill,</hi> Warden
of <hi>Merton Colledge,</hi> and Provost of <hi>Eaton</hi>: He
which founded in <hi>Oxford</hi> two famous Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and endowed them with liberal main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                     <p>'Twas that Sir <hi>Henry Savil,</hi> that translated
and enlightned the History of <hi>Cornelius Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
with a most excellent Comment; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
the world by his laborious and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
collecting the scattered pieces of S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi>
and the publication of them in one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Body in Greek; in which Language he
was a most judicious Critick. 'Twas this Sir

Contemporary, and familiar friend to Mr. <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>;
and let Posterity know it.</p>
                     <p>And in this year of 1577. He was admitted
Fellow of the Colledge; happy also in being
the Contemporary and Friend of Dr. <hi>John Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
of whom I have lately spoken; and of
Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi>: both which were after, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,
made Presidents of <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi>

                     <p>Nor was Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> more happy in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56222:103"/>
of his Time and Colledge, than
in the Pupillage and Friendship of his <hi>Edwin
Sandys</hi> and <hi>George Cranmer</hi>; of whom my
Reader may note, that this <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> was
after Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> and as famous for his
<hi>Speculum Europae,</hi> as his brother <hi>George</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Posterity beholden to his Pen by a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Relation and Comment on his dangerous
and remarkable <hi>Travels</hi>; and for his harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Translation of the <hi>Psalms of David,</hi> the

for <hi>Cranmer,</hi> his other Pupil, I shall refer my

others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>This <hi>Cranmer,</hi> whose Christen name was
<hi>George,</hi> was a Gentleman of singular hopes,
the eldest Son of <hi>Thomas Cranmer,</hi> Son of
<hi>Edmund Cranmer,</hi> the Archbishops brother:
he spent much of his youth in <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi>
Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he continued
Master of Arts for many years before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and then betook himself to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
accompanying that worthy Gentleman
Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> into <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and
<hi>Italy,</hi> for the space of three years; and after
their happy return he betook himself to an
Imployment under a Privy Counsellour of
note, for an unhappy undertaking, after
whose Fall, he went in place of Secretary
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56222:104"/>
with Sir <hi>Henry Killegrew</hi> in his Embassage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France:</hi> and after his death he was sought
after by the most Noble Lord <hi>Mount-Joy,</hi>
with whom he went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he
remained untill in a battel against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
near <hi>Carlingford,</hi> an unfortunate wound
put an end both to his Life, and the great
Hopes that were conceived of him: he being
then but in the 36 year of his age.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Betwixt Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and these his two Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils,
there was a sacred Friendship, a Friendship
made up of Religious Principles, which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
dayly by a similitude of Inclinations to the
same Recreations and Studies; a Friendship
elemented in Youth, and in an University,
free from self-ends, which the Friendships of
Age usually are not: and in this sweet, this
blessed, this spiritual Amity they went on for
many years; and as the Holy Prophet saith,
so <hi>they took sweet counsel together, and walked in
the House of God as Friends.</hi> By which means
they improved it to such a degree of Amity as
as bordered upon Heaven; a Friendship so
sacred, that when it ended in this world, it
began in the next, where it shall have no
end.</p>
                     <p>And, though this world cannot give any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Pleasure equal to such a Friendship: yet,
Obedience to Parents, and a desire to know the
Affairs, Manners, Lawes, and Learning of
other Nations, that they might thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56222:104"/>
the more serviceable unto their own, made
them put off their Gowns, and leave the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> to his Studies, in which
he was daily more assiduous still: enriching his
quiet and capacious Soul with the precious Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Philosophers, Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ists, and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and with them the foundation and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of all Laws, both Sacred and Civil: and
with such other Learning as lay most remote
from the track of common Studies. And as he
was diligent in these, so he seemed restless in
searching the scope and intention of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
revealed to Mankind in the Sacred Scripture:
for the understanding of which, he seemed to be
assisted by the same Spirit with which they were
written: He <hi>that regardeth truth in the inward
parts,</hi> making him to understand <hi>wisdom secretly:</hi>
And the good man would often say, that the
Scripture was not writ to beget <hi>Disputations,</hi>
and <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Opposition</hi> to <hi>Government;</hi> but,
<hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Humility, Moderation, Obedience</hi> to
<hi>Authority,</hi> and peace to Mankind: of which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
no man did ever repent himself at his
death. And, that this was really his judgment,
did appear in his future writings, and in all the
actions of his life: Nor was this excellent man a
stranger to the more light and airy parts of
Learning, as <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi>; all which he
had digested, and made useful: and of all which,
the Reader will have a fair testimony, in what
will follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:56222:105"/>In the Year 1579. the Chancellor of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity
was given to understand, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>Hebrew Lecture</hi> was not read according to
the Statutes; nor could be, by reason of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
that had seiz'd the brain of Mr. <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill,</hi>
who was to read it; so that, it lay long
unread, to the great detriment of those that
were studious of that language: Therefore, the
<hi>Chancellor</hi> writ to his <hi>Vice-chancellor,</hi> and the
<hi>University,</hi> that he had heard such commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the excellent knowledge of Mr. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Hooker</hi> in that tongue, that he desired he
might be procured to read it: And he did, and
continued to do so, till he left <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Within three months after his undertaking
this Lecture (namely in <hi>October</hi> 1579.) he was
with Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and others expell'd his <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>;
and this Letter transcrib'd from Dr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi>
his own hand, may give some account
of it.</p>

                     <p>This Expulsion was by Dr. <hi>John Barfoote,</hi>
Chaplain to <hi>Ambrose</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and then
Vice-president of the Colledge: I cannot learn
the pretended cause; but, that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
the same Month is most certain.</p>
                     <p>I return to Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Colledge,</hi> where
he continued his studies with all quietness, for
the space of three years; about which time, he
enter'd into Sacred Orders, and was made Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
and Priest; and, not long after, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to preach at St. <hi>Pauls Cross.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56222:106"/>In order to which Sermon, to <hi>London</hi> he came,
and immediately to the <hi>Shunamites house</hi>; which
is a House so called, for that, besides the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
paid the Preacher, there is provision made
also for his Lodging and Dyet two days before,
and one day after his Sermon; this house was
then kept by <hi>John Churchman,</hi> sometimes a
Draper of good Note in <hi>Watling-street,</hi> upon
whom Poverty had at last come like an armed
man, and brought him into a necessitous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which, though it be a punishment, is not
alwayes an argument of Gods disfavour, for he
was a vertuous man: I shall not yet give the
like testimony of his Wife, but leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to judge by what follows. But to this house
Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> came so wet, so weary, and weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten,
that he was never known to express
more passion, than against a Friend that dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him from footing it to <hi>London,</hi> and for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him no easier an Horse; supposing the
Horse trotted, when he did not: And at this
time also, such a faintness and fear possest him,
that he would not be perswaded two dayes qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness,
or any other means could be used to
make him able to preach his Sundayes Sermon;
but a warm Bed, and Rest, and Drink, proper
for a Cold, given him by Mrs. <hi>Churchman,</hi> and
her diligent attendance added unto it, enabled
him to perform the office of the day, which was
in or about the Year 1581.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:56222:106"/>And in this first publick appearance to the
World, he was not so happy as to be free from
Exceptions against a point of Doctrine deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Sermon, which was, <hi>That in God there
were two Wills, an Antecedent, and a Consequent
Will; his first Will, that all Mankind should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
but his second Will was, that those only
should be saved, that did live answerable to that
degree of Grace which he had offered, or afforded
them.</hi> This seemed to cross a late Opinion of
Mr. <hi>Calvins,</hi> and then taken for granted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that had not a capacity to examine it, as it
had been by him, and hath been since by Dr.
<hi>Jackson,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and others of great
Learning, who believe that a contrary Opinion
trenches upon the Honour and Justice of our
merciful God. How he justified this, I will not
undertake to declare, but it was not excepted
against (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> declares in an Orational
Answer to Mr. <hi>Travers</hi>) by <hi>John Elmer,</hi> then
Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> at this time one of his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and at last one of his Advocates too, when
Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was accused for it.</p>
                     <p>But the justifying of this Doctrine did not
prove of so bad consequence, as the kindness of
Mrs. <hi>Churchmans</hi> curing him of his late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
and Cold; for that was so gratefully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> that he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
bound in conscience to believe all that she
said; so that the good man came to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by her, <hi>that he was a man of a tender consti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56222:107"/>
and <hi>that it was best for him to have a Wife,
that might prove a Nurse to him</hi>; such an one as
<hi>might both prolong his life, and make it more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable;
and such a one she could and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for him, if he thought fit to marry.</hi> And he
not considering, that <hi>the children of this world
are wiser in their generation, than the children of
light</hi>; but, like a true <hi>Nathanael,</hi> fearing no
guile, because he meant none, did give her such
a power as <hi>Eleazar</hi> was trusted with, when he
was sent to choose a Wife for <hi>Isaac</hi>; for even
so he trusted her to choose for him, promising
upon a fair Summons to return to <hi>London,</hi> and
accept of her choice; and he did so in that or
the year following. Now the Wife provided
for him, was her Daughter <hi>Joan,</hi> who brought
him neither Beauty nor Portion; and for her
Conditions, they were too like that Wife's
which is by <hi>Solomon</hi> compar'd to a <hi>dripping
house</hi>; so that he had no reason to <hi>rejoyce in the
Wife of his Youth,</hi> but too just cause to say with
the holy Prophet, <hi>Woe is me that I am constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have my habitation in the tents of Kedar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This choice of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> (if it were his
choice) may be wondred at; but let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> sayes, <hi>There is a
wheel within a wheel,</hi> a secret Sacred wheel of
Providence (especially in Marriages) guided
by his hand, that <hi>allows not the race to the swift,</hi>
nor <hi>bread to the wise,</hi> nor good wives to good
men: and he that can bring good out of evil,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56222:107"/>
(for Mortals are blind to this Reason) only
knows why this blessing was denied to patient
<hi>Job,</hi> to meek <hi>Moses,</hi> and to our as meek and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi> But so it was; and, let the
Reader cease to wonder, for <hi>Affliction is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
dyet,</hi> which though it be not pleasing to
Mankind, yet Almighty God hath often, very
often imposed it as good, though bitter Physick
to those children whose Souls are dearest to
him.</p>
                     <p>And by this means the good man was drawn
from the tranquillity of his Colledge, from that
Garden of Piety, of Pleasure, of Peace, and a
sweet Conversation, into the thorny Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a busie World, into those corroding
cares that attend a married Priest, and a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Parsonage, which was <hi>Draiton Beauchamp</hi>
in <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> not far from <hi>Alesbury,</hi> and
in the Diocese of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> to which he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by <hi>John Cheny</hi> Esquire, then Patron of it,
the 9<hi>th of December</hi> 1584. where he behaved
himself so as to give no occasion of evil, but
(as St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth a Minister of God) <hi>in
much patience, in afflictions, in anguishes, in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities;
in poverty, and no doubt in long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
yet troubling no man with his discontents
and wants.</p>
                     <p>And in this condition he continued about a
year, in which time his two Pupils, <hi>Edwin San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys</hi>
and <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> took a journey to see
their Tutor, where they found him with a Book
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56222:108"/>
in his hand (it was the <hi>Odes</hi> of <hi>Horace</hi>) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then like humble and innocent <hi>Abel,</hi> tending
his small allotment of sheep in a common field,
which he told his Pupils he was forced to do
then, for that his servant was gone home to
Dine, and assist his Wife to do some necessary
houshold business. When his servant returned
and released him, his two Pupils attended him
unto his house, where their best entertainment
was his quiet company, which was presently
denied them, for <hi>Richard was call'd to rock the
Cradle</hi>; and the rest of their welcome was so
like this, that they staid but till next morning,
which was time enough to discover and pity
their Tutors condition; and having in that time
remembred and paraphrased on many of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
recreations of their younger dayes, and
other like diversions, given him as much present
comfort as they were able, they were forced to
leave him to the company of his wife <hi>Joan,</hi> and
seek themselves a quieter Lodging: But at their
parting from him, Mr. <hi>Cranmer</hi> said, <hi>Good Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
I am sorry your lot is fall'n in no better ground
as to your Parsonage; and, more sorry that your
Wife proves not a more comfortable Companion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you have wearied your self in your restless stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
To whom the good man replied, <hi>My dear</hi>
George, <hi>If Saints have usually a double share in
the miseries of this life, I that am none, ought not
to repine at what my wise Creator hath appointed
for me, but labour, as indeed I do daily, to submit
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56222:108"/>
mine to his Will, and possess my soul in patience,
and peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At their return to <hi>London, Edwin Sandys</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
his father<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> who was then Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and after Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> with his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
sad condition, and sollicits for his removal
to some Benefice that might give him a more
comfortable subsistence; which his father did
most willingly grant him, when it should next
fall into his power. And not long after this
time, which was in the year 1585, Mr. <hi>Alvie</hi>
(Master of the Temple) dyed, who was <hi>a man
of a strict Life, of great Learning, and of so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Behaviour, as to gain so high a degree of
love and reverence from all men, that he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
known by the name of</hi> Father Alvie. At
the Temple-Reading, next after the death of
this <hi>Father Alvie,</hi> he the said Archbishop of
<hi>York</hi> being then at Dinner with the <hi>Judges,</hi> the
<hi>Reader,</hi> and <hi>Benchers</hi> of that Society, met with
a Condolement for the death of <hi>Father Alvie,</hi>
an high commendation of his Saint-like life, and
of his great merit both to God and man: and as
they bewail'd his death, so they wish't for a like
pattern of Virtue and Learning to succeed him.
And here came in a fair occasion for the Bishop
to commend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> to <hi>Father Alvies</hi> place,
which he did with so effectual an earnestness,
and that seconded with so many other Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56222:109"/>
the Mastership of the Temple proposed unto
him by the Bishop, as a greater freedom from his
Countrey cares, and the advantage of a better
Society, and a more liberal Pension than his
Countrey Parsonage did afford him. But these
Reasons were not powerful enough to incline
him to a willing acceptance of it; his wish was
rather to gain a better Countrey living, where
he might <hi>see Gods blessings spring out of the
Earth, and be free from Noise</hi> (so he exprest the
desire of his heart) <hi>and eat that bread which he
might more properly call his own in privacy and

                     <p>And, here I shall make a stop; and, that the
Reader may the better judge of what follows,
give him a character of the Times, and Temper
of the people of this Nation, when Mr. <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
had his admission into this place, a place
which he accepted, rather than desired; and
yet here he promised himself a virtuous quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56222:109"/>
that blessed Tranquillity which he alwayes
prayed and labour'd for; that so he might in
peace bring forth the fruits of peace, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God by uninterrupted prayers and praises:
for this he alwayes thirsted, and yet this was
denied him. For his admission into this place,
was the very beginning of those oppositions
and anxieties, which till then this good man was
a stranger to, and of which the Reader may
guess by what follows.</p>
                     <p>In this character of the Times, I shall, by the
Readers favour, and for his information, look so
far back as to the beginning of the Reign of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a time in which <hi>the many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Titles to the Crown, the frequent Treasons,
the Doubts of her Successor, the late Civil War,
and the sharp Persecution that raged to the effusion
of so much blood in the Reign of Queen</hi> Mary,
were fresh in the memory of all men; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
fears in the most pious and wisest of this
Nation, lest the like dayes should return again to
them, or their present posterity. And the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of these dangers, begot a hearty
desire of a settlement in the Church and State,
believing there was no other probable way left
to make them sit quietly under their own Vines
and Fig-trees, and enjoy the desired fruit of their
Labours. But, <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<hi>Self-ends,</hi> and these begot <hi>Animosities, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Opposition,</hi> and <hi>Unthankfulness</hi> for those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
blessings for which they lately thirsted, being
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56222:110"/>
then the very utmost of their desires, and even
beyond their hopes.</p>
                     <p>This was the temper of the Times in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of her Reign, and thus it continued too
long; for those very people that had enjoyed
the desires of their hearts in a Reformation from
<hi>Rome,</hi> became at last so like the grave, as never
to be satisfied; but were still thirsting for more
and more, neglecting to pay that Obedience, and
perform those Vows which they made in their
dayes of adversities and fear: so that in short
time, there appeared three several Interests,
each of them fearless and restless in the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their designs; they may for distinction
be called, The active <hi>Romanists,</hi> The restless
<hi>Non-conformists</hi> (of which there were many
sorts) and, The passive <hi>peaceable Protestant.</hi>
The Counsels of the first considered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
on in <hi>Rome:</hi> the second in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in
<hi>Geneva,</hi> and in divers selected, secret, dangerous
Conventicles, both there, and within the bosom
of our own Nation: the third pleaded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
their Cause by establisht Laws, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
and Civil; and if they were active,
it was to prevent the other two from destroying
what was by those known Laws happily esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht
to them and their Posterity.</p>
                     <p>I shall forbear to mention the very many and
dangerous Plots of the Romanists against the
Church and State, because what is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in this digression, is an account of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56222:110"/>
Opinions and Activity of the Non-conformists;
against whose judgement and practice, Mr. <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
became at last, but most unwillingly, to be
ingaged in a Book-war; a War, which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
not as against an Enemy, but with the
spirit of meekness and reason.</p>
                     <p>In which number of Non-conformists, though
some might be sincere, well-meaning men, whose
<hi>indiscreet Zeal</hi> might be so like <hi>Charity,</hi> as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to cover a multitude of their Errours; yet,
of this party, there were many that were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
with a high degree of <hi>spiritual wickedness,</hi>
I mean, with an innate restless <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>malice.</hi>
I do not mean the visible carnal sins of <hi>Gluttony,</hi>
and <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> and the like (from which
good Lord deliver us) but, sins of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
because they are more unlike God, who is
the God of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi>;
and more like the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is not a <hi>Glutton,</hi>
nor can be <hi>drunk,</hi> and yet is a Devil; but I mean
those spiritual wickednesses of <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi>
and an <hi>opposition</hi> to <hi>Government.</hi> Men
that joyed to be the Authors of misery, which
is properly his work that is <hi>the enemy and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Mankind</hi>; and, greater sins than <hi>Gluttony</hi>
or <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> though some will not believe it.
And of this party, there were also many, whom
prejudice and a furious Zeal had so blinded, as to
make them neither to hear reason, nor adhere to
the wayes of peace. Men, that were the dregs
of Mankind, whom <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-conceit,</hi> had
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56222:111"/>
made to overvalue their own pitiful, crooked
wisdom so much, as not to be asham'd to hold
foolish and unmannerly Disputes against those
men whom they ought to reverence; and, those
Laws which they ought to obey. Men, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
and joyed to find out the faults, and to
speak evil of Government; and then, to be the
Authors of Confusion. Men, whom Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and Conversation, and Custom, had at last so
blinded, and made so insensible that these were
sins; that, like those that perisht in the <hi>gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying
of Core,</hi> so these dyed without repenting
of these <hi>spiritual wickednesses:</hi> of which the
practises of <hi>Copinger,</hi> and <hi>Hacket</hi> in their lives;
and the death of them and their adherents, are
God knows too sad examples; and, ought to be
cautions to those men that are inclin'd to the
like <hi>spiritual wickednesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in these Times which tended thus to
Confusion, there were also many others that
pretended a tenderness of Conscience, refusing
to take an Oath before a lawful Magistrate; and
yet these men, in their secret Conventicles, did
covenant and swear to each other, to be assidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and faithful in using their best endeavours to
set up the <hi>Presbyterian Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi>;
and, both in such a manner as they themselves
had not yet agreed on. To which end, there
were many that wandred up and down, and were
active in sowing Discontents and Sedition, by
venemous and secret murmurings, and a disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56222:111"/>
of scurrilous Pamphlets and Libels against
the Church and State, but especially against the
Bishops; by which means, together with indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Sermons, the common people became so
phanatick, as to believe <hi>the Bishops to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
and the only obstructers of Gods Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
and then given over to such a desperate
delusion, as to find out a Text in the <hi>Revelation</hi>
of <hi>St. John,</hi> that <hi>Antichrist was to be overcome
by the Sword.</hi> So that those very men, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
with tender and <hi>meek Petitions,</hi> proceeded
to <hi>Admonitions,</hi> then to <hi>Satyrical Remonstrances</hi>;
and at last, having numbred who was not, and
who was, for their Cause, they got a supposed
certainty of so great a Party, that they durst
threaten <hi>first the Bishops,</hi> then <hi>the Queen and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>;
to all which they were secretly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by the <hi>Earl of Leicester,</hi> then in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with Her Majesty, and the reputed Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risher
and Patron general of these pretenders to
Tenderness of Conscience; his design being, by
their means, to bring such an <hi>odium</hi> upon the
<hi>Bishops,</hi> as to procure an Alienation of their
Lands, and a large proportion of them for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
which avaritious desire had so blinded his
reason, that his ambitious and greedy hopes had
almost put him into a present possession of <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-house.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to these undertakings, the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
of this Nation were much encouraged and
heightned by a Correspondence and Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56222:112"/>
with that Brotherhood in <hi>Scotland</hi>; so that
here they became so bold, that<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Dering.</note> one told the
Queen openly in a Sermon, <hi>She was like an unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Heyfer, that would not be ruled by Gods people,
but obstructed his Discipline.</hi> And in <hi>Scotland</hi> they
were more confident, for there<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Bishop <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> History of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </note> they declared
Her an <hi>Atheist,</hi> and grew to such an height, as
not to be accountable for any thing spoken
against Her, <hi>nor for Treason against their own
King, if spoken in the Pulpit</hi>; shewing at last
such a disobedience to Him, that His Mother
being in <hi>England,</hi> and then in distress, and in
prison, and in danger of death, the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the King their prayers for her: and at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time, when He had appointed a day of
Feasting; the Church declared for a general Fast,
in opposition to His Authority.</p>
                     <p>To this height they were grown in both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and by these means there was distill'd into
the minds of the common people such other
venemous and turbulent principles, as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the safety of the Church and
State: and these vented so daringly, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the loss of life and limbs, they were forced
to use such other severities as will not admit of
an excuse, if it had not been to prevent Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the perillous consequences of it;
which, without such prevention, would have
been Ruine and Misery to this numerous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56222:112"/>These Errours and Animosities were so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that they begot wonder in an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Italian,</hi> who being about this time come
newly into this Nation, writ scoffingly to a
friend in his own Countrey, to this purpose, <hi>That
the Common people of</hi> England <hi>were wiser than
the wisest of his wiser Nation; for, here the very
Women and Shop-keepers, were able to judge of
Predestination, and determine what Laws were fit
to be made concerning Church-government; and
then, what were fit to be obeyed or abolisht. That
they were more able (or at least thought so) to raise
and determine perplext Cases of Conscience, than
the wisest of the most learned Colledges in</hi> Italy.
<hi>That men of the slightest Learning, and the most
ignorant of the Common people, were mad for a new
or</hi> Super- <hi>or</hi> Re-reformation <hi>of Religion; and
that in this</hi> they appeared like that man, who
would never cease to whet and whet his knife,
till there was no steel left to make it useful. And
he concluded his Letter with this observation,
<hi>That those very men that were most busie in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
and Disputations, and Controversies, of
finding out the faults of their Governors, had usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the least of</hi> Humility <hi>and</hi> Mortification, <hi>or of
the</hi> power <hi>of</hi> Godliness.</p>
                     <p>And to heighten all these Discontents and
Dangers, there was also sprung up a generation
of Godless men; men that had so long given
way to their own lust of delusion, and so highly
opposed the blessed motions of his Spirit, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56222:113"/>
the inward light of their own Consciences, that
they had thereby sinned themselves into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
which they would, but could not believe;
into a belief which is repugnant even to humane
Natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e (for the Heathens believe that there
are many gods) but these had sin'd themselves
into a belief that there was no God, so finding
nothing in themselves but what was worse than
nothing, began to wish what they were not able
to hope for, that they should be like the beasts
that perish: And wicked company, which is the
Atheists Sanctuary, were so bold as to say so,
though the worst of Mankind when he is left
alone at midnight, may wish, but cannot then
think it a belief that there is no God. Into this
wretched, this reprobate condition, many had
then sinned themselves.</p>
                     <p>And now when the Church was pestered with
them, and with all these other Irregularities;
when her Lands were in danger of Alienation,
her Power at least neglected, and her Peace torn
to pieces by several Schisms, and such Heresies
as do usually attend that sin (for Heresies do
usually out-live their first Authors) when the
Common people seemed ambitious of doing
those very things that were attended with most
dangers, that thereby they might be punish'd,
and then applauded and pitied; when they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Spirit of opposition a Tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouce,
and complained of persecution, because
they wanted power to persecute others; when
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56222:113"/>
the giddy multitude raged, and became restless
to find out misery for themselves and others;
and the Rabble would herd themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and endeavour to govern and act in spight
of Authority. In this extremity of fear, and
danger of the Church and State, when to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the growing evils of both, they needed a
man of prudence and piety, and of an high and
fearless fortitude, they were blest in all by <hi>John
Whitgift</hi> his being made Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>;
of whom Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> (that knew
him well, for he was his Pupil) gives this true
Character: <hi>That he was a man of Reverend and
Sacred memory; and, of the primitive temper;
such a temper, as when the Church by lowliness of
Spirit did flourish in highest examples of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though I dare not undertake to add to
this excellent and true character of Sir <hi>Henry
Wotton,</hi> yet I shall neither do right to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
nor to my Reader, if I forbear to give
him a further and short account of the life and
manners of this excellent man; and it shall be
short, for I long to end this digression, that I may
lead my Reader back to Mr.<hi>Hooker,</hi> where we
left him at the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John Whitgift</hi> was born in the County of
<hi>Lincoln,</hi> of a Family that was ancient, and noted
to be both prudent, and affable, and Gentile by
nature; he was educated in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> much
of his Learning was acquired in <hi>Pembroke-Hall,</hi>

(where Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> the Martyr was his Tutor)
from thence he was remov'd to <hi>Peter-house,</hi> from
thence to be Master of <hi>Pembroke Hall,</hi> and from
thence to the Mastership of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge:
About which time, the Queen made him Her

                        </gap> upon him with much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and favour, gave him a fair testimony of
both, by giving him the Bishoprick of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
and (which was not a usual favour) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
him his First-fruits; then by constituting
him Vice-president of the principality of <hi>Wales.</hi>
And having experimented his Wisdom, his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Moderation in the menage of Her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
in both these places; She, in the 26<hi>th</hi> of
Her Reign, made him Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and not long after of Her Privy Council,
and trusted him to manage all Her Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Affairs and Preferments. In all which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves,
he was like the Ark, which left a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon the place where it rested; and in all
his Imployments was like <hi>Jchoida,</hi> that did good
unto <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These were the steps of this Bishops ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to this place of dignity and cares; in which
place (to speak Mr. <hi>Cambdens</hi> very words in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>od of his Church.</hi> And yet in this place he
met with many oppositions in the regulation of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56222:114"/>
Church-affairs, which were much disordered at
his entrance, by reason of the age and remisness
of Bishop <hi>Grindall,</hi> his immediate Predecessor,
the activity of the Non-consormists, and their
chief assistant the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and indeed
by too many others of the like Sacrilegious
principles. With these he was to encounter;
and, though he wanted neither courage, nor a
good cause, yet he foresaw, that without a great
measure of the Queens favour, it was impossible
to stand in the breach that was made into the
Lands and Immunities of the Church, or to
maintain the remaining rights of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by justifiable sacred Insinuations such as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Agrippa (Agrippa, believest thou? I
know thou believest</hi>) he wrought himself into
so great a degree of favour with Her, as by
his pious use of it, hath got both of them
a great degree of Fame in this World, and
of Glory in that into which they are now
entred.</p>
                     <p>His merits to the Queen, and Her favours to
him were such, that <hi>She called him Her little
black Husband,</hi> and <hi>called his Servants Her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:</hi>
and She saw so visible and blessed a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
shine in all his cares and endeavours for
the Churches, and for Her good, that She was
supposed to trust him with the very secrets of
Her Soul, and to make him Her Confessor; of
which She gave many fair testimonies, and of
which one was, that <hi>She would never eat Flesh
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56222:115"/>
in Lent without obtaining a Licence from her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
black Husband:</hi> and would often say, <hi>She
pitied him because She trusted him, and had eased
Her self, by laying the burthen of all Her Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cares
upon his shoulders, which he managed with
prudence and piety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall not keep my self within the promised
Rules of brevity in this account of his Interest
with Her Majesty, and his care of the Churches
Rights, if in this digression I should enlarge to
particulars; and therefore my desire is, that one
Example may serve for a Testimony of both.
And that the Reader may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it, he may take notice, that not many
years before his being made Archbishop, there
passed an Act or Acts of Parliament, intending
the better preservation of Church-lands, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling
a power which was vested in others to
Sell or Lease them, by lodging and trusting the
future care and protection of them only in the
Crown: And amongst many that made a bad
use of this power or trust of the Queens, the
<hi>Earl of Leicester</hi> was one; and the Bishop having
by his Interest with Her Majesty, put a stop to the
Earls sacrilegious designs, they two fell to a open
opposition before Her; after which they both
quitted the Room, not friends in appearance;
but the Bishop made a sudden and a seasonable
return to Her Majesty (for he found Her alone)
and spake to Her with great humility and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and to this purpose.</p>
                     <q>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56222:115"/>
                        <p>I Beseech Your Majesty to hear me with patience,
and to believe that Yours, and the Churches
safety, are dearer to me than my Life; but, my
Conscience dearer than both: and therefore give
me leave to do my Duty, and tell You, <hi>that Princes
are deputed Nursing Fathers of the Church,
and owe it a protection</hi>; and therefore God forbid
that You should be so much as Passive in her Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
when You may prevent it; or that I should
behold it without horrour and detestation, or should
forbear to tell Your Majesty of the sin and danger
of <hi>Sacriledge:</hi> And, though You and my self were
born in an Age of Frailties, when the primitive
piety and care of the Churches Lands and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
are much decayed; yet (Madam) let me
beg that you would first consider that there are such
sins as <hi>Prophaneness</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge</hi>; and, that
if there were not, they could not have names in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Writ, and particularly in the New Testament.
And I beseech You to consider, that though our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
said. <hi>He judged no man</hi>; and to testifie it,
would not judge nor divide the inheritance betwixt
the two Brethren; nor would judge the Woman ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in Adultery: yet, in this point of the Churches
Rights he was so zealous, that he made himself both
the <hi>Accuser,</hi> and the <hi>Judge,</hi> and the <hi>Executioner</hi>
too, to punish these sins; witnessed, in that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
made the Whip to drive the Prophaners out of
the <hi>Temple,</hi> overthrew the Tables of the <hi>Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers,</hi>
and drove them out of it. And consider
that it was St. <hi>Paul</hi> that said to those Christians of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56222:116"/>
his time that were offended with Idolatry, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>Sacriledge; Thou that abhorrest Idols,
dost thou commit Sacriledge?</hi> Supposing (I think)
Sacriledge the greater sin. This may occasion Your
Majesty to consider that there is such a <hi>sin as Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi>;
and to incline You to prevent the Curse that
will follow it, I beseech You also to consider, that
<hi>Constantine</hi> the first Christian Emperour, and
<hi>Helena</hi> his Mother; that King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Confessor,</hi> and indeed many others of
Your Predecessors, and many private Christians,
have also given to God, and to his Church, much
Land, and many Immunities, which they might
have given to those of their own Families, and did
not: but, gave them as <hi>an absolute Right and
Sacrifice to God:</hi> And, with these Immunities
and Lands <hi>they have entail'd a Curse upon the
Alienators of them</hi>; God prevent Your Majesty
from being liable to that Curse.</p>
                        <p>And, to make You that are trusted with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
the better to understand the danger of it,
I beseech You forget not, that, besides these Curses,
the Churches Land and Power have been also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to be preserved, as far as Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the Law of this Nation have been able to
preserve them, by an immediate and most sacred
Obligation on the Consciences of the Princes of this
Realm. For, they that consult <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> shall
find, that as all Your Predecessors were at their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation
so You also were sworn before all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Bishops then present, and in the presence
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56222:116"/>
of God, and in his stead to him that anointed You,
<hi>To maintain the Church-lands, and the Rights
belonging to it</hi>; and this testified openly at the
holy Altar, by laying Your hands on the Bible then
lying upon it. And not only <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> but
many modern Statutes have denounced a Curse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those that break <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> A Curse like
the <hi>Leprosie,</hi> that was intail'd on the <hi>Jews</hi>; for,
as that, so these Curses have and will cleave to the
very stones of those buildings that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to God; and, the fathers sin of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
will prove to be intail'd on his Son and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
And now what account can be given for the
breach of this Oath at the last great day, either by
Your Majesty, or by me, if it be wilfully, or but
negligently violated, I know not?</p>
                        <p>And therefore, good Madam, let not the late
Lords Exceptions against the failings of some few
Clergy-men, prevail with You to punish Posterity,
for the Errors of this present Age; let particular
men suffer for their particular Errors, but let God
and his Church have their right: And though I
pretend not to Prophesie, yet I beg Posterity to take
notice of what is already become visible in many
Families, <hi>That Church-land added to an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Inheritance, hath proved like a Moth fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Garment, and secretly consumed both: <hi>Or</hi>
like the Eagle that stole a coal from the Altar,
and thereby set her Nest on fire, which consumed
both her young Eagles, and her self that stole it.</hi>
And though I shall forbear to speak reproachfully of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56222:117"/>
Your Father, yet I beg You to take notice, that a part
of the Churches Rights, added to the vast Treasure
left him by his Father, hath been conceived to bring
an unavoidable Consumption upon both, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all his diligence to preserve them.</p>
                        <p>And consider that after the violation of those
Laws, to which he had sworn in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
God did so far deny him his restraining Grace, that
as King <hi>Saul</hi> after he was forsaken of God, fell
from one sin to another; so he, till at last he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
greater sins than I am willing to mention. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Religion is the Foundation and Cement of
humane Societies:</hi> and when they that serve at
Gods Altar, shall be exposed to Poverty, then, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it self will be exposed to scorn, and become
contemptible, as You may already observe in too
many poor Vicaridges in this Nation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as You are by a late Act or Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
entrusted with a great power to preserve or
waste the Churches Lands; yet, dispose of them
<hi>for Jesus sake, as the Dono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(I beseech You) and to the approaching Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of his Church, as You expect comfort at the

this affectionate plainness, my most dear Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,

                        </gap>, and her future Care to preserve
the Churches Rights, which till then had been
neglected, may appear a fair Testimony, that
he made hers and the Churches Good the
chiefest of his Cares, and that she also thought
so. And of this there were such daily testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
given, as begot betwixt them so mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
a joy and confidence, that they seemed
born to believe and do good to each other; she
not doubting his Piety to be more than all his
Opposers, which were many; nor his Prudence
equal to the chiefest of her Council, who were
then as remarkable for active Wisdome, as
those dangerous Times did require, or this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did ever enjoy. And in this condition he
continued twenty years; in which time he saw
some Flowings, but many more Ebbings of
her Favour towards all men that opposed him,
especially the <hi>Earl of Leicester:</hi> so that God
seemed still to keep him in her Favour, that
he might preserve the remaining Church Lands
and Immunities from Sacrilegious Alienations.
And this Good man deserved all the Honour
and Power with which she trusted him; for he
was a pious man, and naturally of Noble and
Grateful Principles: he eased her of all her
Church-cares by his wise Menage of them;
he gave her faithful and prudent Counsels in all
the Extremities and Dangers of her Temporal
Affairs, which were many; he lived to be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56222:118"/>
the Chief Comfort of her Life in her Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
age, to be then most frequently with her,
and her Assistant at her private Devotions, to
be the greatest Comfort of her Soul upon her
Death-bed, to be present at the Expiration of
her last Breath, and to behold the closing of
those Eyes that had long looked upon him
with Reverence and Affection. And let this
also be added, that he was the Chief Mourner
at her sad Funeral; nor let this be forgotten,
that within a few hours after her death, he
was the happy Proclaimer, that King <hi>James</hi>
(her peaceful Successour) was Heir to the
Crown.</p>
                     <p>Let me beg of my Reader to allow me to
say a little, and but a little, more of this good
Bishop, and I shall then presently lead him back
to Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>; and, because I would hasten, I
will mention but one part of the Bishops Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Humility, but this of both: He built
a large Almes-house near to his own Palace at
<hi>Croyden</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> and endowed it with Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for a Master and twenty eight poor
Men and Women; which he visited so often,
that he knew their Names and Dispositions,
and was so truly humble, that he called them
Brothers and Sisters: and whensoever the
Queen descended to that lowlines to dine with
him at his Palace in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> (which was very
often) he would usually the next day shew the
like lowliness to his poor Brothers and Sisters
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56222:118"/>
at <hi>Croydon,</hi> and dine with them at his Hospital;
at which time, you may believe, there was Joy
at the Table. And at this place he built also a
fair Free-School, with a good Accommodation
and Maintenance for the Master and Scholars;
Which gave just occasion for <hi>Boyse Sisi,</hi> then
Embassadour for the French King, and Resident
here, at the Bishops death to say, <hi>The Bishop
had published many learned Books, but a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>school
to train up Youth, and an Hospital to lodge
and maintain aged and poor People, were the best
Evidences of Christian Learning that a Bishop
could leave to Posterity.</hi> This good Bishop lived
to see King <hi>James</hi> settled in Peace, and then
fell sick at his Palace in <hi>Lambeth</hi>; of which
when the King had notice, he went to visit him,
and found him in his Bed in a declining conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and very weak; and after some short dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
betwixt them, the King, at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
assured him, <hi>He had a great Affection for
him, and a very high value for his Prudence and
Vertues, and would indeavour to beg his life of
God.</hi> To which the good Bishop replied, <hi>Pro
Ecclesia Dei, Pro Ecclesia Dei:</hi> which were the
last words he ever spake; therein testifying,
that as in his Life, so at his Death, his chiefest
care was of Gods Church.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>John Whitgift</hi> was made Archbishop in
the year 1583. In which busie place, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
twenty years and some moneths; and in
which time, you may believe, he had many Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56222:119"/>
of his Courage and Patience; but his Motto
was, <hi>Vincit, qui patitur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he made it good. Many of his many
Trials were occasioned by the then powerful
<hi>Earl of Leicester,</hi> who did still (but secretly)
raise and cherish a Faction of Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
to oppose him; especially one <hi>Thomas
Cartwright,</hi> a man of noted Learning, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Contemporary with the Bishop in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
and of the same Colledge, of which
the Bishop had been Master; in which place
there began some Emulations (the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
I forbear) and at last open and high Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
betwixt them; and in which you
may believe Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> was most faulty, if
his Expulsion out of the University can incline
you to it.</p>
                     <p>And in this discontent after the Earls death
(which was 1588) Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> appeared
a chief Cherisher of a Party that were for the
<hi>Geneva</hi> Church-government; and to effect
it, he ran himself into many dangers both of
Liberty and Life; appearing at the last to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
himself and his Party in many Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances,
which he caused to be printed, and
to which the Bishop made a first Answer, and
<hi>Cartwright</hi> replyed upon him; and then the
Bishop having rejoyned to his first Reply, Mr.
<hi>Cartwright</hi> either was, or was perswaded to be,
satisfied: for he wrote no more, but left<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the
Reader to be judge which had maintained their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56222:119"/>
Cause with most Charity and Reason. After
some silence, Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> received from
the Bishop many personal Favours, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himself to a more private Living, which
was at <hi>Warwick,</hi> where he was made Master of
an Hospital, and lived quietly, and grew rich,
and where the Bishop gave him a Licence to
Preach, upon promises not to meddle with
Controversies, but incline his Hearers to Piety
and Moderation; and this Promise he kept du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Life, which ended 1602, the Bishop
surviving him but some few moneths: each,
ending his daies in perfect Charity with the
other.</p>
                     <p>And now after this long Digression made for
the Information of my Reader concerning
what follows, I bring him back to venerable
Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> where we left him in the <hi>Temple,</hi>
and where we shall find him as deeply engaged
in a Controversie with <hi>Walter Trevers,</hi> a Friend
and Favorite of Mr. <hi>Cartwrights,</hi> as the Bishop
had ever been with Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> himself;
and of which I shall proceed to give this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
account.</p>
                     <p>And first this; That though the Pens of
Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the Bishop were now at
rest, yet there was sprung up a new Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of restless men, that by Company and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
became possest of a Faith which they
ought to have kept to themselves, but could
not; men that were become positive in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56222:120"/>
                        <hi>That a Papest cannot be saved:</hi> insomuch
that about this time, at the Execution of the
Queen of Scots, the Bishop that preached her
Funeral Sermon (which was Doctor <hi>Howland,</hi>
then Bishop of <hi>Peterborough</hi>) was reviled for
not being positive for her Damnation. And
beside this Boldness of their becoming Gods,
so far as to set limits to his Mercies; there was
not onely one <hi>Martin Mar-prelate,</hi> but other
venemous Books daily printed and dispersed;
Books that were so absurd and scurrilous, that
the graver Divines disdained them an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
And yet these were grown into high
esteem with the Common people, till <hi>Tom
Nash</hi> appeared against them all, who was a
man of a sharp wit, and the Master of a scoffing
Satyrical merry Pen, which he imployed to
discover the Absurdities of those blind maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sensless Pamphlets, and Sermons as sensless
as they; <hi>Nash</hi> his Answer being like his
Books, which bore these Titles, <hi>An Almond
for a Parrot. A Fig for my God-son. Come
crack me this Nut,</hi> and the like: so that his
merry Wit made such a discovery of their
Absurdities, as (which is strange) he put
a greater stop to these malicious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
than a much wiser man had been
able.</p>
                     <p>And now the Reader is to take notice, That
at the Death of <hi>Father Alvie,</hi> who was Master
of the <hi>Temple,</hi> this <hi>Walter Travers</hi> was Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56222:120"/>
there for the Evening Sermons, which he
preach'd with great approbation, especially of
the younger Gentlemen of that Society; and
for the most part approved by Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in the midst of their oppositions. For he
continued Lecturer a part of his time, Mr. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
being indeed a man of a Competent
Learning, of a winning Behaviour, and of a
blameless Life. But he had taken Orders by
the Presbytery in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> (and with them some
opinions, that could never be eradicated) and
if in any thing he was transported, it was in an
extreme desire to set up that Government in
this Nation: For the promoting of which, he
had a correspondence with <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
and others in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s one of
the chiefest assistants to Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> in that
Design.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> had also a particular hope to
set up this Government in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and to
that end used his endeavours to be Master of
it, and his being disappointed by Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi>
admittance, proved some occasion of oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt them, in their Sermons. Many
of which were concerning the Doctrine, and
Ceremonies of this Church: Insomuch that,
as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> withstood Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to his face,
So did they, for as one hath pleasantly exprest
it, <hi>The Forenoon Sermon upake Canterbury, and
the Afternoons, Geneva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In these Sermons there was little of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56222:121"/>
but each party brought all the Reasons
he was able to prove his Adversaries Opinion
erroneous. And thus it continued a long time,
till the Oppositions became so visible, and the
Consequences so dangerous, especially in that
place, that the prudent Archbishop put a stop
to Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> his Preaching by a positive
Prohibition: Against which Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd
and Petition'd Her Majesties Privy
Council to have it recalled: and where he
met with many assisting Friends; but they
were not able to prevail with or against the
Arch-bishop, whom the Queen had intrusted
with all Church-power: and he had received so
fair a Testimony of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Principles, and
of his Learning and Moderation, that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
all Sollicitations. But the denying this
Petition of Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> was unpleasant to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of his Party; and, the Reasonableness of
it became at last to be so magnified by them
and many others of that party, as never to be
answered; so that intending the Bishops and
Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> disgrace, they procured it to be
privately printed, and scattered abroad: and
then Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was forced to appear publickly,
which he did, and Dedicated it to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop;
and it proved so full an Answer, an
answer that had in it so much of clear Reason,
and writ with so much Meekness and Majesty
of Style, that the Bishop began to wonder at
the Man, to rejoyce that he had appeared in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56222:121"/>
his Cause, and disdained not earnestly to beg
his Friendship, even a familiar Friendship, with a
man of so much <hi>quiet Learning</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To enumerate the many particular points, in
which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> dissented,
(all or most of which, I have seen written) would
prove at least tedious; and therefore, I shall
impose upon my Reader no more then two,
which shall immediately follow, and by which
he may judge of the rest.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> excepted against Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi>
for that in one of his Sermons he declared, <hi>That
the assurance of what we believe by the Word of
God, is not to us so certain as that which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by sense.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> confesseth he
said so; and endeavours to justifie it by the
Reasons following.</p>
                     <p>First, I taught, That the things which God
promises in his Word are surer than what we touch,
handle, or see; but are we so sure and certain of
them? if we be, why doth God so often prove his
Promises to us, as he doth, by Arguments drawn
from our sensible Experience? For <hi>we must be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of the Proof than of the things Proved; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is no Proof. For Example:</hi> How is it that
many men looking on the Moon at the same time;
every one knoweth it to be the Moon, as certainly
as the other doth: but many believing one and
the same Promise, have not all one and the same
Fulness of Perswasion? For how falleth it out,
that men being assured of any thing by Sense, can
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56222:122"/>
be no surer of it than they are; when as the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in Faith that liveth upon the Earth, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
need to labour, strive and pray, that his
Assurance concerning Heavenly and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
things may grow, increase, and be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Sermon that gave him the cause of this
his Justification makes the Case more plain, by
declaring</hi> that there is besides this Certainty of
Evidence, a Certainty of Adherence: <hi>in which
having most excellently demonstrated what the</hi>
Certainty of Adherence <hi>is, he makes this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
use of it,</hi> Comfortable <hi>(he sayes)</hi> as to
weak Believers, who suppose themselves to be
faithless, not to believe, when notwithstanding
they have their <hi>Adherence</hi>; the Holy Spirit hath
his <hi>private operations,</hi> and worketh secretly in
them, and effectually too, though they want the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Testimony of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tell this to a man that hath a mind too
much dejected by a sad sense of his sin; to one
that by a too severe judging of himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
that he wants Faith, because he wants
the comfortable Assurance of it; and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
will be,</hi> Do not perswade me against my
knowledge, against what I finde and feel in my
self; <hi>I do not, I know, I</hi> do not believe. <hi>(Mr.</hi>
Hookers <hi>own words follow)</hi> Well then, to favour
such men a little in their weakness, Let that be
granted which they do imagine; be it that they
adhere not to Gods Promises, but are faithless and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56222:122"/>
without belief; but are they not grieved for their
unbelief? they confess they are; do they not wish
it might, and also strive that it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes?
we know they do; whence cometh this,
but from a secret Love and Liking that they have
of those things believed? For, <hi>no man can love
those things which in his own opinion are not</hi>;
and, if they think those things to be, which they
shew they love when they desire to believe them;
then must it be that by desiring to believe, they
prove themselves true believers; For, <hi>without
Faith no man thinketh that things believed
are:</hi> which argument all the Subtilties of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

is an abridgement of part of the Reasons he
gives for his Justification of this his Opinion
for which he was excepted against by Mr.</hi>
Travers.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was also accused by Mr. <hi>Travers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi>
for that he in one of his Sermons had declared,
that <hi>he doubted not but that God was merciful to
many of our fore-fathers living in Popish Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
for as much as they Sinned ignorantly:</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his answer professeth it to be
his Judgment, and declares his Reasons for this
Charitable opinion to be as followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But first he states the question about</hi> Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<hi>and</hi> Works, <hi>and how the</hi> Foundation of
Faith is overthrown; <hi>and then he proceeds to
discover that way which</hi> Natural men <hi>and some
others have mistaken to be the way by which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56222:123"/>
they hope to attain true and everlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and having discovered the mistaken, he
proceeds to direct to that True way, by which
and no other, everlasting life and blessedness is
attainable; and, these two wayes he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
thus: (they be his own words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low)</hi>
                        <q>That, the way of Nature, This, the way
of Grace; the end of that way, Salvation me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited,
presupposing the righteousness of mens
works; their Righteousness, a Natural ability
to do them; that ability, the goodness of God
which created them in such perfection. <hi>But</hi> the
end of this way, Salvation bestowed upon men
as a gift: presupposing not their righteousness,
but the forgiveness of their Unrighteousness,
Justification; their Justification, not their
Natural ability to do good, but their hearty
Sorrow for not doing, and unfeigned belief in
him for whose sake not doers are accepted, <hi>which
is their vocation</hi>; their Vocation, the Election
of God, taking them out of the number of lost
Children; their Election a Mediator in whom
to be elected; this mediation inexplicable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
this mercy, supposing their misery for whom
he vouchsafed to dye, and make himself a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he also declareth, <hi>There is no meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cause for our Justification but Christ, no effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
but his Mercy</hi>; and sayes also, <hi>We deny the
Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we abuse, disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul,
and annihilate the benefit of his Passion, if
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56222:123"/>
by a proud imagination we believe we can merit
everlasting life, or can be worthy of it.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
(he declareth) is to destroy the very es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of our Justification, and he makes all
opinions that border upon this, to be very
dangerous. <hi>Yet nevertheless,</hi> (and for this he
was accused) <q>
                           <hi>Considering how many vertuous
and just men, how many Saints and Martyrs
have had their dangerous opinions, amongst
which this was one, that they hoped to make God
some part of amends by voluntary punishments
which they laid upon themselves</hi>; because by
this or the like erroneous opinions which do
by consequence overthrow the merits of
Christ, shall man be so bold as to write on
their Graves, <hi>such men are demned, there is for
them no Salvation?</hi> St. Austin saies, <hi>errare pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,
Haereticus esse nolo.</hi> And except we put
a difference betwixt them that err Ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and them that Obstinately persist in it,
how is it possible that any man should hope to
be saved; give me a Pope or a Cardinal,
whom great afflictions have made to know
himself, whose heart God hath touched with
true sorrow for all his Sins, and filled with a
Love of Christ and his Gospel, whose eyes
are willingly open to see the truth, and his
mouth ready to renounce all errour, this one
opinion of merit excepted, which he thinketh
God will require at his hands, and because he
wanteth, trembleth, and is discouraged, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56222:124"/>
yet can say, <hi>Lord cleanse me from all my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
sins,</hi> shall I think because of this or a like
errour such men touch not so much as the
Hem of Christs Garment; if they do, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should I doubt but that vertue may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from Christ to save them? no, I will not
be afraid to say to such a one, <hi>you err in your

in any degree, overthroweth the foundation, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from the hope of mercy, from all possibility
of Salvation. (<hi>And now Mr.</hi> Hookers <hi>own
words follow.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>What though they hold the truth sincerely
in all other parts of Christian Faith; although
they have in some measure all the Vertues and
Graces of the Spirit? although they have
all other tokens of Gods Children in them; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be far from having any proud o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that they shall be saved by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of their deeds; although the onely
thing that troubleth and molesteth them be
a little too much dejection, somewhat too
great a fear arising from an erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that God will require a worthiness in
them, which they are grieved to finde want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in themselves? although they be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56222:124"/>
in this opinion? although they be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and would be glad to forsake it, if any one
reason were brought sufficient to disprove it?
although the onely cause why they do not
forsake it ere they dye, be their Ignorance
of that means by which it might be disproved?
although the cause why the Ignorance in this
point is not removed, be the want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in such as should be able, and are not
to remove it;</q> 
                        <hi>Let me dye</hi> (sayes Mr. <hi>Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
if it be ever proved, that simply an Errour
doth exclude a Pope or Cardinal in such a case ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
from hope of life.</hi> Surely I must confess,
that if it be an Errour to think that God may be
mercifull to save men even when they err; my
greatest comfort is my error: were it not for
the love I bear to this error, I would never wish
to speak or to live.</p>
                     <p>I was willing to take notice of these two
points, as supposing them to be very material;
and that as they are thus contracted, they may
prove useful to my Reader; as also for that the
answers be arguments of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> great and
clear reason, and equal Charity. Other exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
were also made against him, as, <hi>That he
prayed before and not after his Sermons; that in
his Prayers he named Bishops; that he kneeled both
when he prayed and when he received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and (sayes Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his defence) <hi>other
exceptions so like these, as but to name, I should
have thought a greater fault then to commit them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:56222:125"/>And 'tis not unworthy the noting, that in
the manage of so great a controversie, a shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
reproof than this, and one like it, did never
fall from the happy pen of this Humble man.
That like it was upon a like occasion of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to which his answer was, <hi>Your next ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
consists of railing and of reasons; to your
Railing, I say nothing, to your Reasons, I say
what follows.</hi> And I am glad of this fair occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to testifie the Dove-like temper of this
meek, this matchless man; and doubtless if
Almighty God had blest the Dissenters from
the Ceremonies and Discipline of this Church,
with a like measure of Wisdom and Humility,
instead of their pertinacious zeal, then Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Truth had kissed each other; then
Peace and Piety had flourished in our Nation,
and this Church and state had been blest like
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> that is at unity with it self; But this
can never be expected, till God shall bless the
common people with a belief that Schism is a
Sin, and <hi>That there may be offences taken which
are not given,</hi> and, <hi>That Laws are not made for
private men to dispute, but to Obey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this also may be worthy of noting,
That these Exceptions of Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> against
Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> were the cause of his Transcribing
several of his Sermons, which we now see prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his Books; of his Answer to Mr.
<hi>Travers,</hi> his Supplication, and of his most
learned and useful discourse of <hi>Justification</hi> of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56222:125"/>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works;</hi> and by their Transcription
they fell into the hands of others, and have
been thereby preserved from being lost, as too
many of his other matchless writings were, and
from these I have gathered many observations
in this Discourse of his Life.</p>
                     <p>After the publication of his Answer to the
Petiton of Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> grew dayly
into greater repute with the most learned and
wise of the Nation; but it had a contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in very many of the Temple that were
zealous for Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> and for his Church
Discipline: insomuch that though Mr. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
left the place, yet the seeds of Discontent
could not be rooted out of that Society, by the
great Reason, and as great Meekness of this
humble man: for though the chief Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
gave him much Reverence and Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
yet he there met with many neglects
and oppositions by those of Master <hi>Travers</hi>
Judgment; in so much that it turned to his
extreme grief and that he might unbeguile and
win them, he designed to write a deliberate
sober Treatise of the Churches power to make
Canons for the use of Ceremonies, and by
Law to impose an obedience to them, as
upon her Children; and this he proposed to
do in <hi>eight Books of the Laws of Ecclesiastical
Polity;</hi> intending therein to shew such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as should force an assent from all
men, if Reason, delivered in sweet Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56222:126"/>
and void of any provocation, were able
to do it; And that he might prevent all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
he wrote before it a large Preface or
Epistle to the <hi>Dissenting Brethren,</hi> wherein
there were such Bowels of Love, and such a
Commixture of that <hi>Love</hi> with <hi>Reason,</hi> as was
never exceeded but in Holy Writ, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
by that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to his dear Brother
and fellow Labourer <hi>Philemon,</hi> than which
none ever was more like this Epistle of Mr.
<hi>Hookers;</hi> so that his dear friend and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his Studies Doctor <hi>Spenser</hi> might after
his death justly say, <hi>What admirable height of
Learning and depth of Judgment dwelt in the
lowly mind of this truly humble man, great in
all wise mens eyes except his own; with what
gravity and Majesty of speech his Tongue and
Pen uttered Heavenly Mysteries; whose eyes in
the Humility of his Heart were alwayes cast down
to the ground; how all things that proceeded
from him were breathed as from the Spirit of
Love, as if he, like the Bird of the Holy Ghost,
the Dove, had wanted Gall, let those that knew
him not in his Person, judge by these living Images
of his soul, his Writings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The foundation of these Books was laid in
the Temple; but he found it no fit place to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
what he had there designed; and therefore
solicited the Arch-Bishop for a remove, to
whom he spake to this purpose, My Lord,</hi>
When I lost the freedom of my Cell, which was my
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56222:126"/>
Colledge, yet I found some degree of it in my quiet
Country Parsonage: but I am weary of the noise
and oppositions of this place; and indeed, God and
Nature did not intend me for Contentions, but for
Study and quietness: <hi>My Lord,</hi> My particular
contests with Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> here, have proved the
more unpleasant to me, because I believe him a
good man, and that belief hath occasioned me to
examine mine own Conscience concerning his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and to satisfie that, I have consulted the
Scripture, and other laws both humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
whether the Conscience of him and others
of his judgment ought to be so farr complyed with
as to alter our frame of Church Government, our
manner of Gods worship, our praising and praying
to him, and our established Ceremonies as often as
their tender Consciences shall require us, and in
this examination, I have not onely satisfyed my
self, but have begun a treatise, in which I intend
the Justification of our Laws of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I shall never be able to finish it, but
where I may Study, and pray for Gods blessing upon
my indeavours, and keep my self in Peace and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy,
and behold Gods blessing spring out of my
Mother Earth, and eat my own bread without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
and therefore if your Grace can Judge
me worthy such a favonr, let me beg it, that I
may perfect what I have begun.</p>
                     <p>About this time the Parsonage or Rectory
of <hi>Boscum,</hi> in the Diocess of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and six
miles from that City, became void. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56222:127"/>
of <hi>Sarum</hi> is Patron of it, but in the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of that See (which was three years betwixt
the Translation of Bishop <hi>Peirce</hi> to the See of
<hi>York,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Caldwells</hi> admission into it)
the disposal of that and all Benefices belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that See, during this said vacancy, came
to be disposed of by the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and he presented <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> to it, in
the year 1591. And <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> was also
in the said year Instituted, <hi>July</hi> 17. to be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
Prebend of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the Corps to it being
<hi>Nether-Havin,</hi> about ten miles from that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which Prebend was of no great value, but
intended chiefly to make him capable of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preferment in that Church. In this <hi>Boscum</hi>
he continued till he had finished four of his
eight proposed Books of the Laws of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Polity, and these were entered into the
register Book in Stationers Hall, the 9. of
<hi>March</hi> 1592. but not published till the year
1594. and then with the before-mentioned
large and affectionate Preface, which he directs
<hi>to them that seek (as they term it) the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the laws and orders Ecclesiastical in
the Church of England;</hi> of which Books I
shall yet say nothing more, but that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his laborious diligence to finish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
four during his life (of all which more
properly hereafter) but at <hi>Boscum</hi> he finisht and
publisht but onely the first four; being then in
the 39<hi>th</hi> year of his Age.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56222:127"/>He left <hi>Boscum</hi> in the year 1595. by a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of it into the hands of Bishop <hi>Caldwell,</hi>
and he presented <hi>Benjamin Russel,</hi> who was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
into it the 23. of <hi>June</hi> in the same
year.</p>
                     <p>The Parsonage of <hi>Bishops Borne</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi>
three miles from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> is in that Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
gift, but in the latter end of the year
1594. Doctor <hi>William Redman</hi> the Rector of
it was made <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> by which means
the power of presenting to it was <hi>pro ea vice</hi> in
the Queen; and she presented <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi>
whom she loved well, to this good living of
<hi>Borne</hi> the 7. of <hi>July</hi> 1595. in which living he
continued till his Death, without any addition
of Dignity or Profit.</p>
                     <p>And now having brought our <hi>Richard Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
from his Birth place to this where he found
a Grave, I shall onely give some account of his
Books, and of his behaviour in this Parsonage
of <hi>Borne,</hi> and then give a rest both to my self
and my Reader.</p>
                     <p>His first four Books and large Epistle have
been declared to be printed at his being at
<hi>Boscum, Anno</hi> 1594. Next I am to tell that
at the end of these four Books there is print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Advertisement to the Reader. <q>I have
for some causes thought it at this time more
fit to let go these first four Books by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
than to stay both them and the rest,
till the whole might together be published.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56222:128"/>
Such generalities of the cause in question
as are here handled, it will be perhaps not
amiss to consider apart, by way of Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto the Books that are to follow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
particulars, in the mean time the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is requested to mend the Printers errours, as
noted underneath.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I am next to declare that his fifth
Book (which is larger than his first four) was
first also printed by it self <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. and
dedicated to his Patron (for till then he chose
none) the Archbishop. These Books were
read with an admiration of their excellency in
This, and their just fame spread it self into fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Nations. And I have been told more
than forty years past, that either Cardinal <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
or learned Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> (both English
men, and in <hi>Italy</hi> about the time when <hi>Hookers</hi>
four Books were first printed: meeting with
this general fame of them, were desirous to
read an Authour that both the Reformed and
the learned of their own Church did so much
magnifie, and therefore caused them to be sent
for; and after reading them, boasted to the
Pope (which then was <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth)
<hi>that though he had lately said he never met with
an English Book whose Writer deserved the name
of Author;</hi> yet there now appear'd a wonder
to them, and it would be so to his Holiness, if
it were in Latin, for <hi>a poor obscure English Priest
had writ four such Books of Laws, and Church
Polity, and in a Style that exprest so Grave
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56222:128"/>
and such Humble Majesty with clear demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Reason, that in all their readings they
had not met with any that exceeded him</hi>; and
this begot in the Pope an earnest desire that
Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> should bring the said four
Books, and looking on the English read a part
of them to him in Latin, which Doctor <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi>
did, to the end of the first Book; at the
conclusion of which, the Pope spake to this
purpose; <hi>There is no Learning that this man
hath not searcht into, nothing too hard for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:
this man indeed deserves the name of
an Authour; his books will get reverence by Age,
for there is in them such seeds of Eternity, that
if the rest be like this, they shall last till the last
fire shall consume all Learning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nor was this high, the onely testimony and
commendations given to his Books; for at the
first coming of king</hi> James <hi>into this Kingdom,
he inquired of the Archbishop</hi> Whitgift <hi>for his
friend Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>that writ the Books of Church
Polity; to which the answer was, that he dyed a
year before Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>who received the
sad news of his Death with very much Sorrow;
to which the King replyed,</hi> and I receive it with
no less, that I shall want the desired happiness
of seeing and discoursing with that man, from
whose Books I have received such satisfaction: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
my Lord, I have received more satisfaction in
reading a leaf, or paragragh in <hi>Mr.</hi> Hooker, <hi>though
it were but about the</hi> fashion <hi>of</hi> Churches, <hi>or</hi>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:56222:129"/>
Church musick, <hi>or the like, but especially</hi> of the
Sacraments, than I have had in the reading parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
large Treatises written but of one of those
Subjects by others, though very learned men; <hi>and,
I observe</hi> there is in Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> no affected lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
but a grave, comprehensive, clear mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of Reason, and that back't with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Fathers and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and</hi> with all <hi>Law</hi> both <hi>Sacred and Civil.</hi>
And though many others write well, yet in the
next age they will be forgotten; but doubtless there
is in every page of <hi>Mr. Hookers Book</hi> the picture
of a Divine Soul, such Pictures of <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Reason,</hi> and drawn in so sacred Colours, that they
shall never fade, but give an immortal memory to
the Author. <hi>And it is so truly true, that the
King thought what he spake, that as the most
learned of the Nation have and still do mention

taken to speak of his Books, which none
ever did, or can commend too much, but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
them, and hasten to an account of his
Christian behaviour and death at <hi>Borne,</hi> in which
place he continued his customary Rules of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and Self-denial; was much in Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
frequent in Meditation and Prayers, enjoying
those blessed returns, which only men of strict
lives feel and know, and of which men of loose
and godless lives, cannot be made sensible, for
spiritual things are spiritually discern'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:56222:130"/>At his entrance into this place, his friendship
was much sought for by Dr.<hi>Hadrian Saravia,</hi>
then or about that time made one of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a German by Birth, and
sometimes a Pastor both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where he had studied and well considered
the controverted points concerning Episcopacy
and Sacriledge; and, in <hi>England</hi> had a just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to declare his judgment concerning both,
unto his Brethren Ministers of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
which was excepted against by <hi>Theodor
Beza,</hi> and others; against whose exceptions, he
rejoyned, and thereby became the happy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of many learned Tracts, writ in Latin, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of three; one, of the <hi>Degrees of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi>
and <hi>of the Bishops superiority above the
Presbytery;</hi> a second against <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> and, a
third of <hi>Christian Obedience to Princes;</hi> the last
being occasioned by <hi>Gretzerus</hi> the Jesuite. And
it is observable, that when in a time of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumults,
<hi>Beza</hi> gave his reasons to the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the abrogation of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in that Nation, partly by Letters, and more
fully in a Treatise of a threefold Episcopacy
(which he calls <hi>Divine, Humane,</hi> and <hi>Satanical</hi>)
this Dr.<hi>Saravia</hi> had by the help of Bishop
<hi>Whitgift</hi> made such an early discovery of their
intentions, that he had almost as soon answered
that Treatise as it became publick; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
discovered how <hi>Beza's</hi> opinion did contradict
that of <hi>Calvins,</hi> and his adherents, leaving
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56222:130"/>
them to interfere with themselves in point of
<hi>Episcopacy;</hi> but of these Tracts it will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
me to say more, than that they were most
of them dedicated to his and the Church of
<hi>Englands</hi> watchful Patron <hi>John Whitgift</hi> the
Archbishop, and printed about the time in which
Mr.<hi>Hooker</hi> also appeared first to the World in
the publication of his first four Books of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Polity.</p>
                     <p>This friendship being sought for by this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctor, you may believe was not denied by
Mr.<hi>Hooker,</hi> who was by fortune so like him, as
to be engaged against Mr.<hi>Travers,</hi> Mr.<hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi>
and others of their judgement, in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
too like Dr.<hi>Saravia's;</hi> so that in this
year of 1595, and in this place of <hi>Borne,</hi> these
two excellent persons began a holy friendship,
increasing daily to so high and mutual affections,
that their two wills seemed to be but one and
the same, and their designs both for the glory of
God, and peace of the Church, still assisting and
improving each others vertues, and the desired
comforts of a peaceable piety which I have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
mentioned, because it gives a foundation
to some things that follow.</p>
                     <p>This Parsonage of <hi>Borne</hi> is from <hi>Canterbury</hi>
three miles, and near to the common Road that
leads from that City to <hi>Dover,</hi> in which Parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
Mr.<hi>Hooker</hi> had not been Twelve months,
but his Books, and the innocency and sanctity
of his life became so remarkable, that many
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56222:131"/>
turn'd out of the Road, and others (Scholars
especially) went purposely to see the man,
whose life and learning were so much admired;
and alas, as our Saviour said of St.<hi>John Baptist,
What went they out to see, a man cloathed in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and fine linnen?</hi> no indeed, but an <hi>obscure,
harmless man, a man in poor Cloaths, his Loyns
usually girt in a course Gown, or Canonical Coat;
of a mean stature, and stooping, and yet more low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the thoughts of his Soul; his Body worn out,
not with Age, but Study, and Holy Mortifications;
his Face full of Heat-pimples, begot by his unacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and sedentary life.</hi> And to this true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of his person, let me add this of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and behaviour; God and Nature blest
with so blessed a bashfulness, that as in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
dayes his Pupils might easily look him out
of countenance; so neither then, nor in his age,
<hi>did he ever willingly look any man in the face; and
was of so mild and humble a nature, that his poor
Parish Clerk and he did never talk but with both
their Hats on, or both off at the same time:</hi> And
to this may be added, that though he was not
purblind, yet he was short or weak-sighted; and
where he fixt his eyes at the beginning of his
Sermon, there they continued till it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and the Reader has a liberty to believe
that his modesty and dim-sight, were some of
the reasons why he trusted Mrs.<hi>Churchman</hi> to
choose his Wife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:56222:131"/>This Parish-Clerk lived till the third or
fourth year of the late Long Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
which time and Mr.<hi>Hookers</hi> death, there
had come many to see the place of his Burial,
and the Monument dedicated to his memory by
Sir <hi>William Cooper</hi> (who still lives) and the
poor Clerk had many rewards for shewing Mr.
<hi>Hookers</hi> Grave-place, and his said Monument,
and did alwayes hear Mr.<hi>Hooker</hi> mentioned with
commendations and reverence, to all which he
added his own knowledge and observations of
his humility and holiness; and in all which Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
the poor man was still more confirm'd
in his opinion of Mr.<hi>Hookers</hi> vertues and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but it so fell out, that about the said third
or fourth year of the Long Parliament, the then
present Parson of <hi>Borne</hi> was Sequestred (you
may guess why) and a <hi>Genevian</hi> Minister put
into his good Living; this, and other like Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrations,
made the Clerk express himself in
a wonder, and say, <hi>They had Sequestred so many
good men, that he doubted if his good Master Mr.</hi>
Hooker <hi>had lived till now, they would have Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred
him too.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was not long, before this intruding Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
had made a Party in and about the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
that were desirous to receive the Sacrament
as in <hi>Geneva;</hi> to which end, the day was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for a select Company, and Forms and
Stools set about the Altar or Communion-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for them to sit and eat, and drink; but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56222:132"/>
when they went about this work, there was a
want of some Joint-stools, which the Minister
sent the Clerk to fetch, and then to fetch Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions;
when the Clerk saw them begin to sit
down, he began to wonder, but the Minister
bad him <hi>cease wondering, and lock the Church-door;</hi>
to whom he replied, <hi>Pray take you the
Keyes, and lock me out, I will never come more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Church; for all men will say, my Master</hi>
Hooker <hi>was a good Man, and a good Scholar, and
I am sure it was not used to be thus in his dayes:</hi>
And the report says, the old man went present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
home, and dyed; I do not say dyed immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but within a few dayes after.</p>
                     <p>But let us leave this grateful Clerk in his qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Grave, and return to Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
our observations of his Christian beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in this place, where he gave a holy Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to all the pleasures and allurements of
Earth, possessing his Soul in a vertuous quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which he maintained by constant Study,
Prayers, and Meditations; his use was to preach
once every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and he or his Curate to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techise
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter the second Lesson in the Evening
Prayer; his Sermons were neither long nor ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
but uttered with a grave zeal, and an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
voice; his eyes alwayes fixt on one place to
prevent his imagination from wandring, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that he seem'd to study as he spake; the
design of his Sermons (as indeed of all his
Discourses) was to shew Reasons for what he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56222:132"/>
spake; and with these Reasons, such a kind of
Rhetorick, as did rather convince and perswade,
than frighten men into piety; studying not so
much for matter (which he never wanted) as
for apt illustrations to inform and teach his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
Hearers by familiar Examples, and then
make them better by convincing Applications;
never labouring by hard words, and then by
needless distinctions and sub-distinctions, to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse</hi>
his Hearers, and get glory to himself; but
glory only to God. Which intention, he would
often say, was as discernable in a Preacher, <hi>as
an Artificial, from a Natural beauty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He never failed the <hi>Sunday</hi> before every <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-week,</hi>
to give notice of it to his Parishioners,
perswading them both to fast, and then to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
their devotions for a learned and pious Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
but especially the last, saying often, <hi>That the
life of a pious Clergy-man was visible Rhetorick,
and so Convincing, that the most Godless men,
(though they would not deny themselves the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their present lusts) did yet secretly wish
themselves like those of the strictest lives:</hi> And
to what he perswaded others, he added his own
example of Fasting and Prayer; and did usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
every <hi>Ember-week,</hi> take from the Parish-Clerk
the Key of the Church-door; into which
place he retir'd every day, and lockt himself up
for many hours; and did the like most <hi>Frydayes,</hi>
and other dayes of Fasting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56222:133"/>He would by no means omit the customary
time of Procession, perswading all both rich
and poor, if they desired the preservation of
Love, and their Parish Rights and Liberties to
accompany him in his Perambulation, and most
did so; in which Perambulation, he would usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
express more pleasant Discourse than at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times, and would then alwayes drop some
loving and facetious observations to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
against the next year, especially by the
boyes and young people; still inclining them
and all his present Parishioners, to meekness, and
mutual kindnesses, and love; because <hi>Love
thinks not evil, but covers a multitude of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was diligent to inquire who of his Parish
were sick, or any wayes distrest, and would often
visit them, unsent for; supposing, that the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
time to discover those Errors to which
health and prosperity had blinded them; and
having by pious reasons and prayers, moulded
them into holy resolutions for the time to come,
he would incline them to confession, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
their sins, with purpose to forsake them,
and then to receive the Communion, both
as a strengthning of those holy resolutions,
and as a seal betwixt God and them of his
Mercies to their Souls, in case that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
sicknesse did put a period to their
lives.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56222:133"/>And as he was thus watchful and charitable
to the sick, so he was as diligent to prevent
Law-sutes, still urging his Parishioners and
Neighbours, to bear with each others infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and live in love, because (as St. <hi>John</hi>
sayes) <hi>he that lives in love, lives in God, for
God is love.</hi> And to maintain this holy fire of
love constantly burning on the Altar of a pure
heart, his advice was to watch and pray, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
keep themselves fit to receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
and then to receive it often, for it
was both a confirming and a strengthning of
their graces; this was his advice: And at his
entrance or departure out of any house, he would
usually speak to the whole Family, and bless
them by name; insomuch, that as he seem'd in
his youth to be taught of God, so he seem'd in
this place to teach his precepts, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did by
walking with him, in all holiness and humility,
making each day a step towards a blessed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.
And though in this weak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
Age of the World, such Examples
are become barren, and almost incredible,
yet let his memory be blest with this true
Recordation, because he that praises <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Hooker,</hi> praises God, who hath given
such gifts to men; and let this humble and
affectionate Relation of him, become such a
pattern, as may invite Posterity to imitate
his vertues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56222:134"/>This was his constant behaviour at <hi>Borne,</hi> so
he walk't with God; thus he did tread in the
footsteps of primitive piety; and yet, as that
great example of meekness and purity, even our
blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> was not free from false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
no more was this Disciple of his, this most
humble, most innocent holy man; his was a
slander parallel to that of chaste <hi>Susannah's</hi> by
the wicked Elders, or that against St. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
as it is recorded in his life, for that holy
man had heretical enemies, and which this Age
calls <hi>Trepanning;</hi> the particulars need not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition;
and that it was false, needs no other
Testimony than the publick punishment of his
Accusers, and their open confession of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency;
'twas said that the accusation was
contrived by a dissenting Brother, one that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
not Church-Ceremonies, hating him for
his Books sake, which he was not able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
and his name hath been told me, but I
have not so much confidence in the relation, as
to make my Pen fix a scandal on him to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
I shall rather leave it doubtful till the great
day of Revelation: But this is certain, that he
lay under the great charge, and the anxiety of
this accusation, and kept it secret to himself for
many months; and being a helpless man, had
lain long under this heavy burthen, but that the
protector of the innocent gave such an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
occasion as forced him to make it known to
his two dearest friends, <hi>Edwyn Sandys,</hi> and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56222:134"/>
                        <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> who were so sensible of their
Tutors sufferings, that they gave themselves no
rest, till by their disquisitions and diligence they
had found out the fraud, and brought him the
welcome News, that his Accusers did confess
they had wrong'd him, and beg'd his pardon:
To which, the good mans reply was to this
purpose, <hi>The Lord forgive them,</hi> and <hi>the Lord
bless you for this comfortable News:</hi> Now I have
a just occasion to say with <hi>Solomon, Friends are
born for the dayes of adversity,</hi> and such you
have prov'd to me; and to my God I say, as did
the mother of St. <hi>John Baptist, Thus hath the
Lord dealt with me, in the day wherein he looked
upon me, to take away my reproach among men:
And, oh my God, neither my life, nor my reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are safe in mine own keeping, but in thine, who
didst take care of me, when I yet hanged upon my
mothers breast; blessed are they, that put their
trust in thee O Lord; for when false Witnesses
were risen up against me, when shame was ready to
cover my face, when I was bowed down with an
horrible dread, and went mourning all the day long,
when my nights were restless, and my sleeps broken
with a fear worse than death, when my Soul thirsted
for a deliverance, as the Hart panteth after the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of waters, then thou Lord didst hear my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
pity my condition, and art now become my
deliverer; and as long as I live I will hold up my
hands in this manner, and magnifie thy mercies,
who didst not give me over as a prey to mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56222:135"/>
Oh blessed are they that put their trust in
thee; and no prosperity shall make me forget those
dayes of sorrows, or to perform those vows that I
have made to thee in the dayes of my affliction;
for with such Sacrifices, thou, O God, art well
pleased, and I will pay them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus did the joy and gratitude of this good
mans heart break forth; and 'tis observable,
that as the invitation to this slander was his
meek behaviour and Dove-like simplicity, for
which he was remarkable; so his Christian
charity ought to be imitated: for, though the
spirit of revenge is so pleasing to Mankind, that
it is never conquered but by a supernatural
grace, being indeed so deeply rooted in humane
Nature, that to prevent the excesses of it (for
men would not know Moderation) Almighty
God allows not any degree of it to any man, but
sayes, <hi>Vengeance is mine.</hi> And, though this be
said by God himself, yet this revenge is so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
that man is hardly perswaded to submit the
menage of it to the Time, and Justice, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his Creator, but would hasten to be his
own Executioner of it. And yet nevertheless,
if any man ever did wholly decline, and leave
this pleasing passion to the time and measure of
God alone, it was this <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> of whom
I write; for when his Slanderers were to suffer,
he laboured to procure their pardon; and when
that was denied him, his Reply was, <hi>That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he would fast and pray, that God would give
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56222:135"/>
them repentance, and patience to undergo their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi>
And his prayers were so far returned
into his own bosom, that the first was granted,
if we may believe a penitent behaviour, and an
open confession. And 'tis observable, that after
this time he would often say to Dr. <hi>Saravia, Oh
with what quietness did I enjoy my Soul after I was
free from the fears of my Slander! and how much
more after a conflict and victory over my desires of
Revenge!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the Year 1600, and of his Age 46,
he fell into a long and sharp sickness, occasioned
by a cold taken in his passage betwixt <hi>London</hi>
and <hi>Gravesend,</hi> from the malignity of which he
was never recovered; for, till his death he was
not free from thoughtful Dayes, and restless
Nights; but a submission to his Will that
makes the sick mans Bed easie by giving rest to
his Soul, made his very languishment comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
and yet all this time he was sollicitous in
his Study, and said often to Dr. <hi>Saravia</hi> (who
saw him daily, and was the chief comfort of his
life) <hi>That he did not beg a long life of God, for
any other reason, but to live to finish his three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Books of POLITY; and then, Lord,
let thy servant depart in peace,</hi> which was his usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
expression. And God heard his prayers, though
he denied the Church the benefit of them, as
compleated by himself; and 'tis thought he
hastened his own death, by hastening to give life
to his Books: But this is certain, that the nearer
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56222:136"/>
he was to his death, the more he grew in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi>
in <hi>Holy Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Resolutions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About a month before his death, this good
man, that never knew, or at least never consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the pleasures of the Palate, became first
to lose his appetite, then to have an aversness to
all food; insomuch, that he seem'd to live some
intermitted weeks by the smell of meat only,
and yet still studied and writ. And now his guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Angel seem'd to foretell him, that the day
of his dissolution drew near, for which his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Soul appear'd to thirst. In this time of
his Sickness, and not many dayes before his
Death, his House was rob'd; of which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
notice, his Question was, <hi>Are my Books and
written Papers safe?</hi> And being answered, <hi>That
they were;</hi> his Reply was, <hi>then it matters not, for
no other loss can trouble me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About one day before his Death, Dr. <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
who knew the very secrets of his Soul,
(for they were supposed to be Confessors to
each other) came to him, and after a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Benefit, the Necessity, and Safety
of the Churches Absolution, it was resolved
the Doctor should give him both that and the
Sacrament the day following. To which end,
the Doctor came, and after a short retirement
and privacy, they return'd to the company, and
then the Doctor gave him, and some of those
friends which were with him, the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the body and blood of our Jesus.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56222:136"/>
Which being performed, the Doctor thought
he saw a reverend gaity and joy in his face; but
it lasted not long, for his bodily Infirmities did
return suddenly, and became more visible, in so
much that the Doctor apprehended Death rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to seize him; yet, after some amendment,
left him at Night, with a promise to return early
the day following, which he did, and then found
him in better appearance, deep in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
and not inclinable to Discourse;
which gave the Doctor occasion to require
his present Thoughts: to which he replied,
<hi>That he was meditating the number and nature of
Angels, and their blessed obedience and order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, peace could not be in Heaven; and oh
that it might be so on Earth.</hi> After which words
he said, <hi>I have lived to see this world is made up of
perturbations, and I have been long preparing to
leave it, and gathering comfort for the dreadful
hour of making my account with God, which I now
apprehend to be near; and though I have by his
grace lov'd him in my youth, and fear'd him in
mine age, and labour'd to have a conscience void of
offence to him, and to all men; yet, if thou, O Lord,
be extreme to mark what I have done amiss, who
can abide it? and therefore, where I have failed,
Lord shew mercy to me, for I plead not my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
but, the forgiveness of my unrighteousness,
for his merits who dyed to purchase pardon for peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
sinners; and since I owe thee a death, Lord let
it not be terrible, and then take thine own time, I
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56222:137"/>
submit to it; let not mine, O Lord, but let thy
Will be done;</hi> with which expression he fell into
a dangerous slumber, dangerous as to his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
yet recover he did, but it was to speak only
these few words, <hi>Good Doctor, God hath heard my
daily petitions, for I am at peace with all men, and
he is at peace with me; and from that blessed as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
I feel that inward joy, which this world can
neither give nor take from me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> More he would
have spoken, but his spirits failed him; and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a short conflict betwixt Nature and Death,
a quiet Sigh put a period to his last breath, and
so he fell asleep.</p>
                     <p>And here I draw his Curtain, till with the
most glorious company of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and
<hi>Apostles,</hi> the most Noble Army of <hi>Martyrs</hi> and
<hi>Confessors,</hi> this most learned, most humble, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Tranquillity, and with it a greater degree of
Glory than common Christians shall be made
partakers of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the mean time, bless O Lord! Lord bless his

endeavours to attain, if not to his great
learning, yet to his</hi> remarkable meekness, <hi>his</hi>

<hi>for, these bring peace at the last: And,
Lord! let his most excellent Writings be blest
with what he design'd, when he undertook them:

APPENDIX
To the LIFE of
Mr. RICH. HOOKER.</head>
                     <p>ANd now having by a long and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
search satisfied my self,
and I hope my Reader, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
to him the true Relation
of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Life: I am desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
also to acquaint him with some observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that relate to it, and which could not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall to be spoken till after his death, of which
my Reader may expect a brief and true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the following Appendix.</p>
                     <p>And first it is not to be doubted, but that he
dyed in the Forty-seventh, if not in the Forty-sixth
year of his Age; which I mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many have believed him to be more aged;
but I have so examined it, as to be confident I
mistake not; and for the year of his death, Mr.
<hi>Cambden,</hi> who in his Annals of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
1599. mentions him with a high commendation
of his life and learning, declares him to dye in
the year 1599. and yet in that Inscription of his
Monument set up at the charge of Sir <hi>William
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56222:138"/>
Cooper</hi> in <hi>Borne Church,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was
buried, his death is said to be in <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. but
doubtless both mistaken; for I have it attested
under the hand of <hi>William Somner</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
Register for the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
that <hi>Richard Hookers</hi> Will bears date <hi>Octob.</hi> 26.
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. and that it was prov'd the third

                     </p>
                     <p>And that at his death he left four Daughters,
<hi>Alice, Cicily, Jane</hi> and <hi>Margaret,</hi> that he gave
to each of them an hundred pound; that he
left <hi>Jone</hi> his Wife his sole Executrix, and that
by his Inventory, his Estate (a great part of it
being in Books) came to 1092 <hi>l.</hi> 9 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi>
which was much more than he thought himself
worth; and, which was not got by his care,
much less by the good huswifery of his Wife,
but saved by his trusty servant <hi>Thomas Lane,</hi>
that was wiser than his Master in getting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for him, and more frugal than his Mistress in
keeping of it; of which Will I shall say no
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56222:139"/>
more, but that his dear friend <hi>Thomas,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> of whom I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and shall have occasion to say more, was
one of the witnesses to it.</p>
                     <p>One of his elder Daughters was married to
one <hi>Chalinor,</hi> sometime a School-master in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
and both dead long since, <hi>Margaret</hi> his
youngest Daughter was married unto <hi>Ezekiel
Chark,</hi> Batchelor in Divinity, and Rector of St.
<hi>Nicholas</hi> in <hi>Harble down</hi> near <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who
dyed about 16 years past, and had a son <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
now living, and in Sacred Orders, being at
this time Rector of <hi>Waldron</hi> in <hi>Sussex;</hi> she
left also a Daughter, with both whom I have
spoken not many months past, and find her to
be a Widow in a condition that wants not, but
far from abounding; and these two attested
unto me, that <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> their Grandfather
had a Sister, by name <hi>Elizabeth Harvey,</hi> that
liv'd to the Age of 121 Years, and dyed in the
month of <hi>September,</hi> 1663.</p>
                     <p>For his other two Daughters I can learn lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
certainty, but have heard they both dyed
before they were marriageable; and for his
Wife, she was so unlike <hi>Jeptha's</hi> Daughter, that
she staid not a comely time to bewail her Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-hood;
nor liv'd long enough to repent her
second Marriage, for which doubtless she would
have found cause, if there had been but four
months betwixt Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> and her death:
But she is dead, and let her other infirmities be
buried with her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56222:139"/>Thus much briefly for his Age, the Year of
his Death, his Estate, his Wife, and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
I am next to speak of his Books, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, I shall have a necessity of being
longer, or shall neither do right to my self, or
my Reader, which is chiefly intended in this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</p>
                     <p>I have declared in his Life, that he proposed
eight Books, and that his first four were printed
<hi>Anno</hi> 1594. and his fifth Book first printed, and
alone, <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. and that he liv'd to finish
the remaining three of the proposed eight, but
whether we have the last three as finish't by
himself, is a just and material Question; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which I do declare, that I have been told
almost 40 Years past, by one that very well
knew Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and the affairs of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that about a month after the death of Mr.
<hi>Hooker,</hi> Bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> then Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> sent one of his Chaplains to enquire
of Mrs. <hi>Hooker,</hi> for the three remaining Books
of Polity, writ by her Husband, of which she
would not, or could not give any account; and
that about three months after, the Bishop pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
her to be sent for to <hi>London,</hi> and then by
his procurement she was to be examined, by
some of Her Majesties Council, concerning the
disposal of those Books, but by way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the next dayes examination, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
invited her to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and, after some
friendly questions, she confessed to him, <hi>That one
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56222:140"/>
Mr.</hi> Charke, <hi>and another Minister that dwelt near</hi>
Canterbury, <hi>came to her, and desired that they
might go into her Husbands Study, and look upon
some of his Writings; and that there they two
burnt and tore many of them, assuring her, that
they were Writings not fit to be seen, and that she
knew nothing more concerning them.</hi> Her lodging
was then in <hi>King-street</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> where she
was found next morning dead in her Bed, and
her new Husband suspected and questioned for
it, but declared innocent of her death.</p>
                     <p>And I declare also, that Dr. <hi>John Spencer</hi>
(mentioned in the life of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>) who was
of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Colledge, and of his time there,
and betwixt whom there was so friendly a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that they continually advised together in
all their Studies, and particularly in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
these Books of Polity: This Dr. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
the three perfect Books being lost, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into his hands (I think by Bishop <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi>)
the imperfect Books, or first rough
draughts of them, to be made as perfect as they
might be, by him, who both knew Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi>
hand writing, and was best acquainted with his
intentions. And a fair Testimony of this may
appear by an Epistle first and usually printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> five Books (but omitted, I
know not why, in the last impression of the
eight printed together in <hi>Anno 1662.</hi> in which
the Publishers seem to impose the three doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as the undoubted Books of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>)
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56222:140"/>
with these two Letters <hi>J. S.</hi> at the end of the
said Epistle, which was meant for this <hi>John
spencer,</hi> in which Epistle the Reader may find
these words, which may give some Authority
to what I have here written.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>And though Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> hastened his own death
by hastening to give life to his Books, yet he held out
with his eyes to behold these <hi>Benjamins,</hi> these sons
of his right hand, though to him they prov'd <hi>Beno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
sons of pain and sorrow. But some evil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
minds, whether of malice, or covetousness, or
wicked blind zeal, it is uncertain, as soon as they
were born, and their father dead, smother'd them,
and, by conveying the perfect Copies, left unto us
nothing but the old imperfect mangled draughts
dismembred into pieces; no favour, no grace, not
the shadow of themselves remaining in them; had
the father lived to behold them thus defaced, he
might rightly have named them <hi>Benonies,</hi> the sons
of sorrow; but being the learned will not suffer
them to dye and be buried, it is intended the world
shall see them as they are; the learned will find in
them some shadows and resemblances of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
face. God grant, that as they were with their
Brethren dedicated to the Church for messengers of
peace; so, in the strength of that little breath of
life that remaineth in them, they may prosper in
their work, and by satisfying the doubts of such as
are willing to learn, they may help to give an end
to the calamities of these our Civil Wars.</p>

Epistle of Dr. <hi>Spencers,</hi> was writ and first print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within four years after the death of Mr. <hi>Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
in which time all diligent search had been
made for the perfect Copies; and, then granted
not recoverable, and therefore endeavoured to
be compleated out of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> rough
draughts, as is exprest by the said Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi>
since whose death it is now 50 Years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I do profess by the faith of a Christian,
that Dr.</hi> Spencers <hi>Wife (who was my Aunt
and Sister to</hi> George Cranmer, <hi>of whom I have
spoken) told me forty Years since, in these, or
in words to this purpose,</hi> That her Husband had
made up, or finish't Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> last three Books;
and that upon her Husbands Death-bed, or in his
Last Sickness, he gave them into her hand, with a
charge they should not be seen by any man, but be by
her delivered into the hands of the then Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which was Dr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> or
unto Dr. <hi>King</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and that
she did as he injoin'd her.</p>
                     <p>I do conceive, that from Dr. <hi>Spencers,</hi> and no
other Copy, there have been divers Transcripts,
and were to be found in several places, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Sir <hi>Thomas Bodlies</hi> Library, in that of Dr.
<hi>Andrews,</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Winton,</hi> in the late
Lord <hi>Conwayes,</hi> in the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and in the Bishop of <hi>Armaghs,</hi> and in many
others, and most of these pretended to be the
Authors own hand, but much disagreeing, being
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56222:141"/>
indeed altered and diminisht, as men have
thought fittest to make Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> judgement
suit with their fancies, or give authority to their
corrupt designs; and for proof of a part of this,
take these following Testimonies.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Barnard,</hi> sometime Chaplain to Dr. <hi>Ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
late Lord Archbishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
in a late Book called <hi>Clavi Trebales,</hi> print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Richard Hodgkinson, Anno 1661.</hi> that in
his search and examination of the said Bishops
Manuscripts, he found the three written Books
which were supposed the 6, 7, and 8, of Mr.
<hi>Hookers</hi> Books of Ecclesiastical Polity; and that
in the said three Books (now printed as Mr.
<hi>Hookers</hi>) there are so many omissions, that they
amount to many Paragraphs, and which cause
many incoherencies; the omissions are by him
set down at large in the said printed Book, to
which I refer the Reader for the whole; but
think fit in this place to insert this following
short part of them.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>First, as there could be in Natural Bodies no
Motion of any thing, unless there were some first
which moved all things, and continued unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
even so in Politick Societies, there must be
some unpunishable, or else no man shall suffer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for sith punishments proceed alwayes from
Superiors, to whom the administration of justice
belongeth, which administration must have neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
a fountain that deriveth it to all others, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56222:142"/>
receiveth not from any, because otherwise the course
of justice should go infinitely in a Circle, every Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
having his Superior without end, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be; therefore, a Well-spring, it followeth, there
is, a Supreme head of Justice whereunto all are
subject, but it self in subjection to none. Which
kind of preheminency if some ought to have in a
Kingdom, who but the King shall have it? Kings
therefore, or no man can have lawful power to
judge.</p>
                           <p>If private men offend, there is the Magistrate
over them which judgeth; if Magistrates, they
have their Prince; if Princes, there is Heaven,
a Tribunal, before which they shall appear; on
Earth they are not accomptable to any. <hi>Here, sayes
the Doctor, it breaks off abruptly.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>And I have these words also attested under
the hand of Mr.</hi> Fabian Philips, <hi>a man of Note
for his useful Books.</hi> I will make Oath, if I
shall be required, that Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> the late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> did a little before his death, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
to me, he had seen a Manuscript, affirmed to
him to be the hand-writing of Mr. <hi>Richard Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
in which there was no mention made of the King
or Supreme Governours being accomptable to the
People; this I will make Oath that that good man
attested to me.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <signed>Fabian Philips.</signed>
                           </closer>
                        </body>

                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:56222:142"/>
So that there appears to be both Omissions
and Additions in the said last three printed
Books; and this may probably be one reason
why Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> the said learned Bishop
(whose Writings are so highly and justly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued)
gave a strict charge near the time of his
Death, or in his last Will, <hi>That nothing of his
that was not already printed, should be printed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is well known how high a value our learned
King <hi>James</hi> put upon the Books writ by Mr.
<hi>Hooker,</hi> as also that our late King <hi>Charles</hi> (the
Martyr for the Church) valued them the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of all Books, testified by his commending
them to the reading of his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> that
now is our gracious King; and you may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that this <hi>Charles</hi> the First, was not a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the pretended three Books, because in a
Discourse with the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> when the said
Lord required the King to grant the truth of his
Argument, because it was the judgement of Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> (quoting him in one of the three writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Books) the King replied, <hi>They were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be Mr.</hi> Hookers <hi>Books;</hi> but, however
<hi>he would allow them to be Mr.</hi> Hookers, <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to what his Lordship proposed to prove out of
those doubtful Books, if he would but consent to
the Judgement of Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>in the other
five that were the undoubted Books of Mr.</hi>
Hooker.</p>

In this relation concerning these three doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Books of Mr. <hi>Hookers,</hi> my purpose was to
enquire, then set down what I observ'd and
know, which I have done, not as an engaged
person, but indifferently; and now leave my
Reader to give sentence, for their legitimation,
as to himself, but so, as to leave others the same
liberty of believing, or disbelieving them to be
Mr. <hi>Hookers;</hi> and 'tis observable, that as Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> advis'd with Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> in the design
and manage of these Books, so also, and chiefly
with his dear Pupils <hi>George Cranmer</hi> (whose
Sister was the Wife of Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi>) of which
this following Letter may be a Testimony, and
doth also give Authority to some things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
both in this Appendix, and in the Life of
Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and is therefore added.</p>

LETTER unto
Mr. Richard Hooker.
February 1598.</head>
                     <p>WHat Posterity is likely to judge of these
matters concerning Church-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
we may the better conjecture,
if we call to mind what our own
Age, within few years, upon better Experience;
hath already judged concerning the same. It
may be remembred, that at first the greatest
part of the Learned in the Land, were either ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
affected, or favourably inclined that way.
The Books then written for the most part, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
of the Disciplinary stile; it sounded
everywhere in Pulpits, and in common phrase of
mens speech: the contrary part began to fear
they had taken a wrong course, many which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned
the Discipline, yet so impugned it, not
as not being the better Form of Government,
but as not being so convenient for our State, in
regard of dangerous Innovations thereby like
to grow;<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>John Whitgift</hi> the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</note> one man alone there was, to speak
of (whom let no suspition of flattery deprive
of his deserved commendation) who in the
defiance of the one part, and courage of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56222:144"/>
other, stood in the gap, and gave others respite
to prepare themselves to the defence, which by
the sudden eagerness and violence of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
had otherwise been prevented, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God hath made good unto him his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
<hi>Vincit qui patitur</hi>; for what contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
indignities he hath at their hands sustained,
the World is witness; and what reward of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
above his Adversaries God hath bestowed
upon him, themselves (though nothing glad
thereof) must needs confess. Now of late years
the heat of men towards the Discipline is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decayed, their judgements begin to sway on
the other side: the Learned have weighed it,
and found it light; wise men conceive some
fear, left it prove not only not the best kind of
Government, but the very bane and destruction
of all Government. The cause of this change
in mens Opinions, may be drawn from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
nature of Error, disguised and cloathed with
the name of Truth; which did mightily and
violently possess men at first, but afterwards, the
weakness thereof being by time discovered, it
lost that reputation, which before it had gained;
as by the outside of an house the passers by, are
oftentimes deceived, till they see the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Rooms within: so by the very name
of <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> men were drawn
at first to cast a fancy towards it, but, now they
have not contented themselves only to pass by
and behold afar off the Fore-front of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56222:144"/>
house, they have entered in, even at
the special request of Master-workmen and
chief builders thereof: thy have perused the
Roomes, the Lights, the Conveniencies, and
they finde them not answerable to that report
which was made of them, not to that opinion
which upon report they had conceived: So as
now, the Discipline which at first triumphed
over all, being unmasked, beginneth to droop
and hang down her head.</p>
                     <p>This cause of change in opinion concerning
the Discipline, is proper to the Learned, or to
such as by them have been instructed; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause there is more open, and more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to the view of all, namely, the course of
Practice, which the Reformers have had with
us from the beginning; the first degree was
onely some small difference about the <hi>Cap</hi> and
<hi>Surplice,</hi> but not such as either bred division
in the Church, or tended to the ruine of the
Government established. This was peaceable;
the next degree more stirring. <hi>Admonitions</hi>
were directed to the Parliament in perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sort against our whole Form of Regiment;
in defence of them, Volumes were published
in English, and in Latin; yet, this was no more
than writing. Devices were set on foot to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Practice of the Discipline without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
yet, herein some regard of Modesty,
some moderation was used; Behold, at length
it brake forth into open outrage, first in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56222:145"/>
by <hi>Martin,</hi> in whose kind of dealing these
things may be observed; first, that whereas
<hi>T. C.</hi> and others his great Masters had always
before set out the Discipline as a Queen, and
as the Daughter of God; He contrarywise, to
make her more acceptable to the people,
brought her forth as a Vice upon the Stage.
2. This conceit of his was grounded (as may
be supposed) upon this rare policy, that seing
the Discipline was by writing refuted, in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
rejected, in secret corners hunted out
and deciyed, it was imagined that by open
rayling (which to the Vulgar is commonly
most plausible) the State Ecclesiastical might
have been drawn into such contempt and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
as the overthrow thereof should have
been most grateful to all men, and in a manner
desired by all the Common people. 3. It may
be noted (and this I know my self to be true)
how some of them, although they could not
for shame approve so lewd an Action: yet,
were content to lay hold on it to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their cause, by acknowledging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the secret Judgments of God against the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
and hoping that some good might be
wrought thereby for his Church; as, indeed
there was, though not according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
For, 4. contrary to their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that railing Spirit did not only not further,
but extremely disgrace and prejudice their
Cause, when it was once perceived from how
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56222:145"/>
low degrees of contradiction, at first, to what
outrage of Contumely and Slander they were
at length proceeded; and were also likely to
proceed further.</p>
                     <p>A further degree of outrage was also in Fact;
Certain<note n="*" place="margin">Hacket and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger.</note> Prophets did arise, who deeming it
not possible that God should suffer that to be
undone, which they did so fiercely desire to
have done, Namely, that his holy Saints, the
favourers and Fathers of the Discipline, should
be enlarged, and delivered from persecution;
and seeing no means of Deliverance Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
were fain to persuade themselves that
God must need raise some extraordinary
means; and being persuaded of none so well
as of themselves, they forth with must needs be
the instruments of this great work. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they framed unto themselves an assured
hope that upon their Preaching out of a Pease
Cart, all the multitude would have present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyned unto them; and, in amazement
of mind have asked them, <hi>Viri fratres, quid
agimus?</hi> whereunto it is likely they would
have returned an answer far unlike to that of
St. Peter, <hi>Such and such are men unworthy to
govern, pluck them down; Such and such are
the dear Children of God, let them be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of two of these men it is meet to speak with
all Commiseration: yet so, that others by
their example may receive instruction, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56222:146"/>
withall some light may appear, what stirring
affections the Discipline is like to inspire, if
it light upon apt and prepared minds.</p>
                     <p>Now if any man doubt of what Society they
were? or, if the Reformers disclaim them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
that by them they were condemned;
let these points be considered. <hi>1. Whose asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
were they before they entered into this fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Passion? whose Sermons did they frequent?
whom did they admire? 2. Even when they
were entering into it, whose advice did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire?</hi>
and when they were in, <hi>whose approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
whom advertised they of their purpose? whose
assistance by Prayer did they request?</hi> But we
deal injuriously with them to lay this to their
charge; for they reproved and condemned it.
How? did they disclose it to the Magistrate,
that it might be suppressed? or were they not
rather content to stand aloof of, and see the
end of it, as being loath to quench that Spirit,
No doubt these mad practitioners were of their
society, with whom before, and in the practise
of their madness they had most affinity. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
read Dr. <hi>Bancrofts</hi> Book.</p>
                     <p>A third inducement may be to dislike of the
Discipline, if we consider not only how far the
Reformers themselves have proceeded, but
what others upon their Foundations have
built. Here come the <hi>Brownists</hi> in the first
rank: their lineal descendants: who have sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon a number of strange opinions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56222:146"/>
although their Ancestors, the Reformers,
were never actually possessed, yet by right and
interest from them derived, the <hi>Brownists</hi> and
<hi>Barrowists</hi> have taken possession of them; for,
if the positions of the Reformers be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ue, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see how the main and general Conclusions
of <hi>Brownism</hi> should be false; for, upon these
two points, as I conceive, they stand.</p>
                     <p>1. That because we have no Church, they
are to sever themselves from us. 2. That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Civil Authority they are to erect a Church
of their own. And if the former of these be
true, the latter, I suppose will follow; for if
above all things, men be to regard their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, if out of the Church, there be no
Salvation; it followeth, that if we have no
Church, we have no means of Salvation; and
therefore Separation from us, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
is both lawfull and necessary; as also
that men so separated from the false and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Church, are to associate themselves unto
some Church; not to ours; to the Popish
much less; therefore to one of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Now the grownd of all these Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being this, (<hi>That in our Church there is no
means of Salvation</hi>) is out of the Reformers
Principles most clearly to be proved. For,
wheresoever any matter of Faith unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
necessary is denyed, there can be no means
of Salvation; But in the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
the Discipline (by them accounted a matter of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56222:147"/>
Faith,) and, necessary to Salvation, is not
onely denyed, but impugned, and the Professors
thereof oppressed. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, (but this reason perhaps is weak) E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
true Church of Christ acknowledgeth the
whole Gospel of Christ: The Discipline, in
their opinion, is a part of the Gospel, and yet by
our Church resisted. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, the Discipline is essentially united to
the Church: by which term <hi>Essentially,</hi> they
must mean either an essential part, or an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
property. Both which wayes it must needs
be, that where that essential Discipline is not,
neither is there any Church. If therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and the <hi>Brownists,</hi> there should be
appointed a Solemn disputation, whereof with
us they have been oftentimes so earnest Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengers:
it doth not yet appear what other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
they could possibly frame to these and the
like arguments, wherewith they may be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but fairly to deny the Conclusion (for all
the Premisses are their own) or rather ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to reverse their own Principles before
laid, whereon so foul absurdities have been so
firmly built. What further proofs you can
bring out of their high words, magnifying the
Discipline, I leave to your better remembrance:
but above all points, I am desirous this one
should be strongly inforced against them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it wringeth them most of all, and is of all
other (for ought I see) the most unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56222:147"/>
you may notwithstanding say, that you
would be heartily glad these their positions
might be salved as the Brownists might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have issued out of their Loynes: but
untill that be done, they must give us le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve to
think that <hi>they have cast the Seed whereout these
tares are grown.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another sort of men there are, which have
been content to run on with the Reformers for a
time and to make them poor instruments of
their own designs: These are a sort of <hi>Godless
Politicks,</hi> who perceiving the Plot of <hi>Discipline</hi>
to consist of these two parts, the overthrow of
Episcopal, and erections of Presbyterial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and that this latter can take no place
till the former be removed, are content to joyn
with them in the Destructive part of Discipline,
bearing them in hand, that in the other also
they shall find them as ready. But when time
shall come, it may be they would be as loath
to be yoaked with that kind of Regiment, as
now they are willing to be released from this;
These mens ends in all their actions, is Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
their pretence and colour, Reformation.
Those things which under this colour they have
effected to their own good, are, 1. By main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a contrary faction, they have kept the
Clergy alwayes in Aw; and thereby, made
them more pliable and willing to buy their
peace. 2. By maintaining an Opinion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
among Ministers, they have made way
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56222:148"/>
to their own purposes for devouring Cathedral
Churches, and Bishops livings. 3. By exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
against abuses in the Church, they
have carried their own corrupt dealings in
the Civil State more covertly; for such is the
Nature of the multitude, that they are not able
to apprehend many things at once: so as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
possessed with a dislike or liking of any one
thing, many other in the mean time, may escape
them without being perceived. 4. They have
sought to disgrace the Clergy, in entertaining
a conceit in mens minds, and confirming it by
continual practise, <hi>That men of Learning, and
specially of the Clergy, which are imployed in the
chiefest kind of Learning are not to be admitted or
sparingly admitted to matters of State</hi>; contrary
to the practice of all well-governed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,
and of our own till these late
years.</p>
                     <p>A third sort of men there are, though not
descended from the Reformers, yet in part rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and greatly Strengthned by them; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>cursed crew of Atheists.</hi> This also is one
of those points, which I am desirous you should
handle most effectually, and strain your self
therein to all points of motion and affection;
as in that of the <hi>Brownists,</hi> to all strength and
sinews of Reason. This is a sort mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and yet by the general suspition of the
world at this day most common. The causes
of it, which are in the parties themselves, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56222:148"/>
you handle in the beginning of the fifth
Book,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> yet here again they may be touched;
but the occasions of help and furtherance, which
by the Reformers have been yielded unto
them, are, as I conceive, two; namely, <hi>Sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Preaching,</hi> and <hi>disgracing of the Ministry</hi>;
for how should not men dare to impugn that,
which neither by force of Reason, nor by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Persons is maintained; But in the
parties themselves these two causes I conceive
of Atheism, 1. more aboundance of Wit then
Judgment, and of Witty than Judicious Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
whereby, they are more inclined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
any thing, than willing to be informed
of the Truth. They are not therefore, men
of sound Learning for the most part, but Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers;
neither is their kind of Dispute so much
by force of Argument, as by Scoffing; which
humour of scoffing, and turning matters most
serious into merriment, is now become so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
as we are not to marvail what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
means by the <hi>Seat of Scorners,</hi> nor what
the Apostles by foretelling of <hi>Scorners to come</hi>;
for our own age hath verified their speech unto
us; which also may be an Argument against
these Scoffers and Atheists themselves, seeing it
hath been so many ages ago foretold, that such
men the later dayes of the world should afford:
which, could not be done by any other Spirit,
save that whereunto <hi>things future and present
are alike.</hi> And even for the main question of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56222:149"/>
the Resurrection, whereat they stick so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily!
was it not plainly foretold, that men
should in the latter times say, <hi>Where is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of his Coming</hi>? Against the Creation, the
Ark, and divers other points, exceptions are said
to be taken; the ground whereof is superfluity
of Wit, without ground of Learning and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
A second cause of Atheism is <hi>Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
which maketh men desirous to remove all
stops and impediments of their wicked life;
among which, because Religion is the chiefest,
so as neither in this life without shame they can
persist therein, nor (if that be true) without
Torment in the life to come: they therefore
whet their wits to annihilate the joys of Heaven,
wherein they see (if any such be) they can have
no part, and likewise the pains of Hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their portion must needs be very great. They
labour therefore, not that they may not deserve
those pains, but that deserving them, there
may be no such pains to seize upon them; But,
what conceit can be imagined more base, than
that man should strive to persuade himself even
against the secret Instinct (no doubt) of his
own Mind, that his Soul is as the Soul of a
Beast, mortal and corruptible with the Body?
Against which barbarous Opinion, their own
Atheism is a very strong Argument. For were
not the Soul a Nature separable from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
how could it enter into discourse of things
meerly Spiritual, and nothing at all pertaining
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56222:149"/>
to the Body? Surely the Soul were not able
to conceive any thing of Heaven, no not so
much as to dispute against Heaven and against
God, if there were not in it somewhat Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and derived from God.</p>
                     <p>The last which have received strength and
encouragement from the Reformers are <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>;
against whom although they are most
bitter Enemies, yet unwittingly they have given
them great advantage. For, what can any Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
rather desire than the Breach and Dissention
of those which are Confederates against him?
Wherein they are to remember, that if our
Communion with Papists in some few Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
do so much strengthen them as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how much more doth this Division and
Rent among our selves, especially seeing it is
maintained to be, not in light matters onely,
but even in matter of Faith and Salvation?
Which over-reaching Speech of theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is so open an advantage for the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowist</hi>
and the <hi>Papist,</hi> we are to wish and hope
for, that they will acknowledge it to have been
spoken rather in heat of Affection, than with
soundness of Judgment; and that though their
exceeding love to that Creature of <hi>Discipline</hi>
which themselves have bred, nourished, and
maintained, their mouth in commendation of
her did so often overflow.</p>
                     <p>From hence you may proceed (but the means
of connexion I leave to your self) to another
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56222:150"/>
discourse, which I think very meet to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
either here or elsewhere at large; the parts
whereof may be these. 1. That in this cause
between them and us, men are to sever the
proper and essential points and controversy,
from those which are accidental. The most
essential and proper are these two: overthrow
of Episcopal, and erection of Presbyterial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
But in these two points whosoever
joyneth with them is accounted of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
whosoever in all other points agreeth with
them, yet thinketh the Authority of Bishops
not unlawful, and of Elders not necessary, may
justly be severed from their retinue. Those
things therefore, which either in the Persons,
or in the Laws and Orders themselves are faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
may be complained on, acknowledged and
amended; yet they no whit the nearer their
main purpose; for what if all errours by
them supposed in our Liturgy were amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
even according to their own hearts desire?
if <hi>Non-residence, Pluralities,</hi> and the like, were
utterly taken away? are their <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
presently Authorized? or their Soveraign
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction established?</p>
                     <p>But even in their complaining against the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and accidental matters in Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
they are many wayes faulty: 1. In
their end which they propose to themselves.
For in Declaming against Abuses, their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not to have them redressed, but by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56222:150"/>
the present State, to make way for
their own Discipline. As therefore in <hi>Venice,</hi>
if any Senatour should discouse against the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of their Senate, as being either <hi>too Soveraign,</hi>
or <hi>too weak</hi> in Government, with purpose to
draw their Authority to a Moderation, it might
well be suffered; but not so, if it should appear
he spake with purpose to induce another State
by depraving the present: So, in all Causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
either to Church or Commonwealth,
we are to have regard what mind the Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part doth bear, whether of Amendment or
Innovation; and, accordingly either to suffer or
suppress it. Their Objection therefore is frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<hi>Why may not men speak against Abuses?</hi>
Yes; but with desire to <hi>cure the part affected,
not to destroy the whole.</hi> 2. A second fault is in
their Manner of Complaining, not only because
it is for the most part in bitter and reproachful
Terms, but also it is to the Common people,
who are Judges incompetent and insufficient,
both to determine any thing amiss, and for
want of Skill and Authority to amend it. Which
also discovereth their Intent and Purpose to be
rather Destructive than Corrective. 3. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those very exceptions which they take are
frivolous and impertinent: Some things indeed
they accuse as impious, which if they may appear
to be such, God forbid they should be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>Against the rest it is only alledged, that they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56222:151"/>
are Idle Ceremonies without use, and that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more profitable might be devised.
Wherein they are doubly deceived; for neither
is it a sufficient Plea to say, This must give
place, because a Better may be devised; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in our Judgments of Better and Worse,
we oftentimes conceive amiss, when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
those things which are in Devise, with
those which are in Practice; <hi>for the Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the one are hid, till by Time and Trial they
be discovered:</hi> The others are already manifest
and open to all. But last of all (which is a
Point in my Opinion of great regard, and which
I am desirous to have enlarg'd) they do not see
that for the most part when they strike at the
State Ecclesiastical, they secretly wound the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
State: for Personal faults, <hi>What can be said
against the Church, which may not also agree to the
Commonwealth</hi>? In both States Men have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
been, and will be alwayes, Men; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
blinded with Errour, most commonly
perverted by Passions: many Unworthy have
been and are advanced in both, many Worthy
not regarded. And as for Abuses which they
pretend to be in the Laws themselves, when
they inveigh against <hi>Non-residence,</hi> do they
take it a matter lawful or expedient in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
State for a man to have a great and gainful
Office in the North, himself continually remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the South? <hi>He that hath an Office, let him
attend his office.</hi> When they condemn <hi>Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:56222:151"/>
of Livings Spirtual to the pit of Hell, what
think they of the Infinite of Temporal Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
By the great Philosopher, <hi>Pol. lib. 2.
c. 9.</hi> it is forbidden as a thing most dangerous
to Commonwealths, that by the same man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Offices should be exercised. When
they deride our Ceremonies as vain and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
were it hard to apply their Exceptions
even to those Civil Ceremonies, which at the
Coronation, in Parliament, and all Courts of
Justice, are used; Were it hard to argue
even against Circumcision, the Ordinance
of God, as being a cruel Ceremony? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Passeover, as being ridiculous?
should be girt, a Staff in their hand, to eat
a Lamb.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; you may exhort the Clergy, (or
what if you direct your Conclusion not to the
Clergy in general, but only to the Learned in or
of both Universities?) you may exhort them to
a due Consideration of all things, and to a right
Esteem and Valuing of each thing in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
wherein it ought to stand. For it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
falleth out, that what Men have either
devised themselves, or greatly delighted in, the
Price and the Excellency thereof they do admire
above desert. The chiefest Labour of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
should be to know; of a Minister, to preach
Christ crucified: in regard whereof, not onely
Worldly things, but things otherwise precious,
even the Discipline it self is vile and base:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56222:152"/>
Whereas now by the heat of Contention, and
violence of Affection, the Zeal of men towards
the one hath greatly decayed their Love to the
other. Hereunto therefore they are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted,
to <hi>Preach Christ crucified,</hi> the <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the Renewing of the <hi>Spirit</hi>; not
those things which in time of Strife seem preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but (Passions being allayed) are vain and
childish.</p>

Introduction.</head>
                     <p>IN a late retreat from the business of this
World, and those many little cares with
which I have too often incumbred my
self, I fell into a Contemplation of some
of those Historical passages that are recorded in
<hi>Sacred Story;</hi> and, more particularly, of what
had past betwixt our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> and that
wonder of Women, and Sinners, and Mourners,
<hi>Saint Mary Magdalen.</hi> I call her <hi>Saint,</hi> because
I did not then, nor do now consider her, as when she
was possest with seven Devils; not as when her
wanton Eyes, and dissheveld Hair, were designed
and manag'd, to charm and insnare amorous Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders:
But, I did then, and do now consider
her as after she had exprest a visible and sacred sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for her sensualities; as, after those Eyes had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56222:156"/>
wept such a flood of penitential tears as did wash,
and that hair had wip't, and she most passionately
kist the feet of hers, and our blessed <hi>Jesus.</hi> And,
I do now consider, that because she lov'd much, not
only much was forgiven her: but that, beside that
blessed blessing of having her sins pardoned, she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
had from him a testimony, that her alablaster box
of precious oyntment poured on his head and feet,
and that Spikenard, and those Spices that were
by her dedicated to embalm and preserve his sacred
body from putrefaction, should so far preserve her
own memory, that these demonstrations of her san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
love, and of her officious, and generous gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
should be recorded and mentioned whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Gospel should be read; intending thereby,
that as his, so her name should also live to succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
generations, even till time shall be no more.</p>
                     <p>Upon occasion of which fair example, I did
lately look back, and not without some content <hi>(at
least to my self)</hi> that I have endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the love, and preserve the memory of my
two deceased friends, Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry
Wotton,</hi> by declaring the various employments
and accidents of their Lives: And, though Mr.
<hi>George Herbert (whose Life I now intend to
write)</hi> were to me a stranger as to his person: yet,
since he was, and was worthy, to be their friend;
and, very many of his have been mine, I judge it
may not be unacceptable to those<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>The Life.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GEorge Herbert</hi> was born the Third
day of <hi>April,</hi> in the Year of our
Redemption 1593. The place of
his Birth was near to the Town
of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and in that <hi>Castle</hi>
that did then bear the name of that Town and
County; that <hi>Castle</hi> was then a place of state
and strength, and had been successively happy
in the Family of the <hi>Herberts,</hi> who had long
possest it: and, with it, a plentiful Estate, and
hearts as liberal to their poor Neighbours. A
Family, that hath been blest with men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
wisdom, and with a willingness to
serve their Countrey, and indeed, to do good to
all Mankind; for which, they were eminent:
But alas! this Family did in the late Rebellion
suffer extremely in their Estates; and the Heirs
of that <hi>Castle,</hi> saw it laid level with that earth
that was too good to bury those Wretches that
were the cause of it.</p>
                     <p>The Father of our <hi>George,</hi> was <hi>Richard Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
the Son of <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> Knight, the
Son of <hi>Richard Herbert</hi> Knight, the Son of the
famous Sir <hi>Richard Herbert</hi> of <hi>Colebrook</hi> in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56222:158"/>
County of <hi>Monmouth</hi> Banneret, who was the
youngest Brother of that memorable <hi>William
Herbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> that liv'd in the
Reign of our King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth.</p>
                     <p>His Mother was <hi>Magdalen Newport,</hi> the
youngest Daughter of Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> and Sister to
Sir <hi>Francis Newport</hi> of <hi>High Arkall</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Salop</hi> Knight, and Grand-father of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
Lord <hi>Newport,</hi> now Comptroller of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Houshold. A Family, that for their
Loyalty, have suffered much in their Estates, and
seen the ruine of that excellent Structure, where
their Ancestors have long liv'd, and been memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for their Hospitality.</p>
                     <p>This Mother of <hi>George Herbert</hi> (of whose
person, and wisdom, and vertue, I intend to give
a true account in a seasonable place) was the
happy Mother of seven Sons, and three Daught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which she would often say, was <hi>Jobs</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and as often bless God, that they were
neither defective in their shapes, or in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and, often reprove them that did not
praise God for so great a blessing. I shall give
the Reader a short accompt of their names, and
not say much of their Fortunes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Edward</hi> the eldest was first made Knight of
the <hi>Bath,</hi> at that glorious time of our late
Prince <hi>Henries</hi> being install'd Knight of the
Garter; and after many years useful travel, and
the attainment of many Languages, he was by
King <hi>James</hi> sent Ambassador Resident to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56222:158"/>
then French King, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth. There,
he continued about two Years; but, he could
not subject himself to a compliance with the
humors of the Duke <hi>de Luines,</hi> who was then the
great and powerful Favourite at Court: so that
upon a complaint to our King, he was call'd
back into <hi>England</hi> in some displeasure; but at
his return he gave such an honourable account
of his employment, and so justified his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
to the Duke, and all the Court, that
he was suddenly sent back upon the same Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie,
from which he return'd in the beginning
of the Reign of our good King <hi>Charles</hi> the first,
who made him first Baron of <hi>Castle-Island</hi>; and
not long after of <hi>Cherberie</hi> in the County of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop:
He was a man of great learning and reason,
as appears by his printed Book</hi> de veritate; <hi>and, by
his History of the Reign of King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eight,
and by several other Tracts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second and third Brothers were <hi>Richard</hi>
and <hi>William,</hi> who ventur'd their lives to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
Honour in the Wars of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi>
and dyed Officers in that employment. <hi>Charles</hi>
was the fourth, and dyed Fellow of <hi>New-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
in <hi>Oxford. Henry</hi> was the sixth, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a menial servant to the Crown in the dayes
of King <hi>James,</hi> and hath continued to be so for
fifty years: during all which time he hath been
Master of the Revels; a place, that requires
a diligent wisdome, with which God hath
blest him. The seventh Son was <hi>Thomas,</hi> who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56222:159"/>
being made Captain of a Ship in that Fleet
with which Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi> was sent against
<hi>Algiers,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>id there shew a fortunate and true
English valor. Of the three Sisters, I need not
say more, then that they were all married to
persons of worth, and plentiful fortunes; and,
liv'd to be examples of <hi>vertue,</hi> and to do good
in their generations.</p>
                     <p>I now come to give my intended account of
<hi>George,</hi> who was the fifth of those seven Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>George Herbert</hi> spent much of his Childhood
in a sweet content under the eye and care of his
prudent mother, and the tuition of a Chaplain
or Tutor to him, and two of his Brothers in her
own Family (for she was then a Widow) where
he continued, till about the age of twelve
years; and being at that time well instructed in
the Rules of Grammar, he was not long after
commended to the care of Dr. <hi>Neale,</hi> who was
then Dean of <hi>Westminster</hi>; and by him to the
care of Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was then chief Master
of that School; where the beauties of his pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
behaviour and wit, shin'd and became so
eminent and lovely in this his innocent age, that
he seem'd to be marked out for piety, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the care of Heaven, and of a particular
Angel to guard and guide him. And thus, he
continued in that School, till he came to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the learned Languages, and especially in
the Greek Tongue, in which he after prov'd an
excellent Critick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56222:159"/>About the age of Fifteen, he, being then a
Kings Scholar, was elected out of that School
for <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to which
place he was transplanted about the year 1608.
And his prudent mother well knowing, that he
might easily lose, or lessen that virtue and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
which her advice and example had plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his mind; did therefore procure the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and liberal Dr. <hi>Nevil,</hi> who was then Dean
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Master of that Colledge, to
take him into his particular care, and provide
him a Tutor; which he did most gladly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
for he knew the excellencies of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and how to value such a friendship.</p>
                     <p>This was the method of his Education, till
he was setled in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where we will leave
him in his Study, till I have paid my promis'd
account of his excellent mother, and I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make it short.</p>
                     <p>I have told her birth, her Marriage, and the
Number of her Children, and, have given some
short account of them: I shall next tell the
Reader, that her husband dyed when our <hi>George</hi>
was about the Age of four years: and that she
continued twelve years a Widow: that she then
maried hapily to a Noble Gentleman, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Heir of the Lord <hi>Danvers</hi> Earl of
<hi>Danby,</hi> who did highly value both her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and most excellent endowments of her
mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56222:160"/>In this time of her Widowhood, she being
desirous to give <hi>Edward</hi> her eldest son, such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of Learning, and other education as
might suit his birth and fortune: and thereby
make him the more fit for the service of his
Country: did at his being of a fit age, remove
from <hi>Montgomery Castle</hi> with him, and some
of her yonger sons to <hi>Oxford</hi>; and, having
entred <hi>Edward</hi> into <hi>Queens Colledge,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
him a fit <hi>Tutor,</hi> she commended him to
his Care; yet, she continued there with him,
and still kept him in a moderate awe of herself:
and so much under her own eye, as to see and
converse with him dayly; but she managed this
power over him without any such rigid sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as might make her company a torment to
her Child, but, with such a sweetness and
complyance with the recreations and pleasure
of youth, as did incline him willingly to spend
much of his time in the company of his dear
and careful mother: which was to her great
content; for, she would often say, <hi>That as our
bodies take a nourishment sutable to the meat on
which we feed: so, our souls do as insensibly take
in vice by the example or Conversation with wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked
Company:</hi> and, would therefore, as often
say, <hi>That ignorance of Vice was the best preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Vertue:</hi> and, that <hi>the very knowledge
of wickedness was as tinder to inflame and kindle
sin, and to keep it burning:</hi> For these reasons,
she indeared him to her own Company: and,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56222:160"/>
continued with him in <hi>Oxford</hi> four years: in
which time, her <hi>great</hi> and <hi>harmless wit,</hi> her
<hi>chearful gravity,</hi> and her <hi>oblieging behaviour,</hi>
gain'd her an acquaintance and friendship with
most of any eminent worth or learning, that
were at that time in or near that University: and
particularly, with Mr. <hi>John Donne,</hi> who then
came accidentally to that place, in this time of
her being there: it was that <hi>John Done</hi> who
was after <hi>Doctor Donne,</hi> and Dean of <hi>Saint
Pauls London:</hi> and he at his leaving <hi>Oxford,</hi>
writ and left there a Character of the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of her body, and minde; of the first, he
sayes,
<q>
                           <l>No <hi>Spring</hi> nor <hi>Summer-Beauty,</hi> has such grace</l>
                           <l>As I have seen in an <hi>Autumnal</hi> face.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the latter he sayes,
<q>
                           <l>In all her words to every hearer fit</l>
                           <l>You may at <hi>Revels,</hi> or at <hi>Council</hi> sit.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The rest of her Character, may be read in
his printed Poems, in that Elegy which bears
the name of the <hi>Autumnal Beauty.</hi> For both
he and she were then past the meridian of mans
life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56222:161"/>This Amity begun at this time, and place,
was not <hi>Amity</hi> that polluted their Souls; but,
an <hi>Amity</hi> made up of a chain of sutable incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and vertues; an <hi>Amity,</hi> like that of St.
<hi>Chrysostoms</hi> to his dear and vertuous <hi>Olimpias</hi>;
whom, in his Letters, he calls his <hi>Saint:</hi> Or, an
<hi>Amity</hi> indeed more like that of St.<hi>Hierom</hi> to
his <hi>Paula</hi>; whose affection to her was such, that
he turn'd Poet in his old Age, and then made
her <hi>Epitaph</hi>; wishing, all his Body were turn'd
into Tongues, that he might declare her just
praises to posterity. And this <hi>Amity</hi> betwixt
her and Mr. <hi>Donne,</hi> was begun in a happy time
for him, he being then about the Fortieth year
of his Age (which was some years before he
entred into Sacred Orders:) A time, when his
necessities needed a daily supply for the support
of his Wife, seven Children, and a Family:
And in this time she prov'd one of his most
bountiful Benefactors; and he, as grateful an
acknowledger of it. You may take one testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of what I have said of them, from this
following <hi>Letter,</hi> and <hi>Sonnet.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And in <hi>Cambridge</hi> we may find our <hi>George
Herberts</hi> behaviour to be such, that we may
conclude, he consecrated the first fruits of his
early age to vertue, and a serious study of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And that he did so, this following Letter
and Sonnet which were in the first year of his
going to <hi>Cambridge</hi> sent his dear Mother for a
New-years gift, may appear to be some testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>—But I fear the heat of my late <hi>Ague</hi> hath
dryed up those springs, by which Scholars say, the
Muses use to take up their habitations. However,
I need not their help, to reprove the vanity of those
many Love-poems, that are daily writ and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to <hi>Venus</hi>; nor to bewail that so few are
writ, that look towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven.</hi> For
my own part, my meaning (<hi>dear Mother</hi>) is in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56222:163"/>
these Sonnets, to declare my resolution to be, that
my poor Abilities in <hi>Poetry,</hi> shall be all, and ever
consecrated to Gods glory. And—</p>
                        <lg>
                           <l>MY God, where is that ancient heat towards thee,</l>

                     </q>
                     <p>This was his resolution at the sending this
Letter to his dear Mother; about which time,
he was in the Seventeenth year of his Age;
and, as he grew older, so he grew in learning, and
more and more in favour both with God and
man: insomuch, that in this morning of that
short day of his life, he seem'd to be mark'd out
for vertue, and to become the care of Heaven;
for God still kept his soul in so holy a frame, that
he may, and ought to be a pattern of vertue
to all posterity; and especially, to his Brethren
of the Clergy, of which the Reader may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a more exact account in what will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>I need not declare that he was a strict Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
because, that he was so, there will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
testimonies in the future part of his life. I
shall therefore only tell, that he was made <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
Fellow</hi> in the year 1609. <hi>Batchelor of Art</hi>
in the year 1611. <hi>Major Fellow</hi> of the <hi>Colledge,
March</hi> 15. 1615. And, that in that year, he
was also made <hi>Master of Arts,</hi> he being then in
the 22<hi>d</hi> year of his Age; during all which time,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56222:164"/>
all, or the greatest diversion from his Study,
was the practice of Musick, in which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a great Master; and of which, he would
say, <hi>That it did relieve his drooping spirits, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his distracted thoughts, and raised his weary
Soul so far above Earth, that it gave him an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
of the joyes of Heaven, before he possest them.</hi>
And it may be noted, that from his first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Colledge, the generous Dr.
<hi>Nevil</hi> was a cherisher of his Studies, and such a
lover of his person, his behaviour, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
endowments of his mind, that he took
him often into his own company, by which he
confirm'd his native gentileness; and, if during
this time he exprest any Error, it was, that he
kept himself too much retir'd, and at too great
a distance with all his inferiours; and, his cloaths
seem'd to prove, that he put too great a value
on his parts and parentage.</p>
                     <p>This may be some account of his disposition,
and of the employment of his time, till he was
Master of Arts, which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. and in
the year 1619. he was chosen Orator for the
University. His two precedent Orators, were
Sir <hi>Robert Nanton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Nethersoll:</hi>
The first was not long after made Secretary of
State; and, Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> not long after his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Orator, was made Secretary to the Lady
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> In this place of
Orator, our <hi>George Herbert</hi> continued eight
years; and manag'd it with as becoming, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56222:164"/>
grave a gaity, as any had ever before, or since
his time. For, <hi>He had acquir'd great Learning,
and was blest with a high fancy, a civil and sharp
wit, and with a natural elegance, both in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
his tongue, and his pen.</hi> Of all which,
there might be very many particular evidences,
but I will limit my self to the mention of but
three.</p>
                     <p>And the first notable occasion of shewing
his fitness for this employment of <hi>Orator,</hi> was
manifested in a Letter to King <hi>James,</hi> who had
sent the University his Book, called <hi>Basilicon
Doron</hi>; and their Orator was to acknowledge
this great honour, and return their gratitude to
His Majesty for such a condescention; at the
close of which Letter, he writ,</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Quid Vaticanam Bodleianamque objicis hospes!</l>
                        <l>Unicus est nobis Bibliotheca Liber.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>This Letter was writ in such excellent Latin,
was so full of Conceits, and all the expressions
so suted to the <hi>genius</hi> of the King, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the Orators name, and then ask'd <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> if he knew him? whose
answer was, <hi>That he knew him very well; and,
that he was his Kinsman, but he lov'd him more
for his learning and vertue, than for that he was
of his name and family.</hi> At which answer, the
King smil'd, and asked the Earl leave, <hi>that he
might love him too; for, he took him to be the
Jewel of that University.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56222:165"/>The next occasion that he had to shew his
great Abilities, was, with them, to shew also his
great affection to that Church in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his <hi>Baptism;</hi> and, of which he profest
himself a member, and the occasion was this:
There w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s one <hi>Andrew Melvin,</hi> a Gentleman of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> who was in his own Countrey possest
with an aversness, if not a hatred of <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government
by Bishops;</hi> and, he seem'd to have
a like aversness to our manner of <hi>Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and of <hi>Church-prayers</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
This Gentleman had travail'd <hi>France,</hi> and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
so long in <hi>Geneva,</hi> as to have his opinions
the more confirm'd in him by the practice of
that place; from which he return'd into
<hi>England</hi> some short time before, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> was made <hi>Orator.</hi> This
Mr. <hi>Melvin</hi> was a man of learning, and was the
Master of a great wit, a wit full of <hi>knots</hi> and
<hi>clenches:</hi> a wit sharp and satyrical; exceeded, I
think, by none of that Nation, but their <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canen.</hi>
At Mr. <hi>Melvins</hi> return hither, he writ
and scattered in Latin, many pieces of his wit
against our <hi>Altars,</hi> our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and our <hi>Publick
Worship</hi> of God; in which, Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> took
himself to be so much concern'd, that as fast as
<hi>Melvin</hi> writ and scatter'd them, Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>
writ and scatter'd answers, and reflections of the
same sharpness, upon him and them; I think,
to the satisfaction of all un-ingaged persons.
But, this Mr. <hi>Melvin,</hi> was not only so busie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56222:165"/>
against the <hi>Church,</hi> but at last so bold with the
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> that he rayl'd, and writ himself
into the <hi>Tower;</hi> at which time, the Lady <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
was an innocent prisoner there; and, he
pleas'd himself much in sending the next day
after his Commitment, these two Verses to the
good Lady; which, I will under-write, because
they may give the Reader a taste of his others,
which were like these.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Causa tibi mecum est communis, Carceris, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bella;
tibi causa est, Araque sacra mihi.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>I shall not trouble my Reader with an account
of his enlargement from that Prison, or his
Death; but tell him, Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> Verses were
thought so worthy to be preserv'd, that Dr. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
the learned Dean of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> hath
lately collected, and caus'd them to be printed,
as an honourable memorial of his friend Mr.
<hi>George Herbert,</hi> and the Cause he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took.</p>
                     <p>And, in order to my third, and last observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his great Abilities, it will be needful to
declare, that about this time King <hi>James</hi> came
very often to hunt at <hi>New-market</hi> and <hi>Royston;</hi>
and was almost as often invited to <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
where his entertainment was suted to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
humor<note n="*" place="margin">Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizer. Ig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note>, and where Mr. <hi>George Herbert</hi>
was to welcome him with <hi>Gratulations,</hi> and the
<hi>Applauses</hi> of an <hi>Orator;</hi> which he alwayes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56222:166"/>
so well, that he still grew more into the
Kings favour; insomuch, that he had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
appointment to attend His Majesty at <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
where after a Discourse with him, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
declar'd to his Kinsman, the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,
That he found the Orators learning and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
much above his age or wit.</hi> The year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
the King appointed to end His progress
at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and to stay there certain dayes;
at which time, he was attended by the great
Secretary of Nature, and all Learning, Sir
<hi>Francis Bacon</hi> (Lord <hi>Virulam</hi>) and by the ever
memorable and learned Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Winchester,</hi> both which did at that time begin a
desir'd friendship with our <hi>Orator.</hi> Upon whom
the first put such a value on his judgement, that
he usually desir'd his approbation, before he
would expose any of his Books to be printed;
and thought him so worthy of his friendship,
that having translated many of the Prophet
<hi>Davids</hi> Psalms into English Verse, he made
<hi>George Herbert</hi> his Patron of them, by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
dedication of them to him, as the best
Judge of <hi>Divine Poetry.</hi> And, for the learned
Bishop, it is observable, that at that time, there
fell to be a modest debate about <hi>Predestination,</hi>
and <hi>Sanctity of life;</hi> of both which, the <hi>Orator</hi>
did not long after send the Bishop some safe and
useful <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> in a long Letter written in
Greek; which, was so remarkable for the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and matter, that after the reading of it,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56222:166"/>
the Bishop put it into his bosom, and did often
shew it to Scholars, both of this, and forreign
Nations; but did alwayes return it back to the
place where he first lodg'd it, and continu'd it
so near his heart, till the last day of his
life.</p>
                     <p>To these, I might add the long and intire
friendship betwixt him and Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> but I have promis'd to contract
my self, and shall therefore only add one testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to what is also mentioned in the Life of
Dr. <hi>Donne;</hi> namely, that a little before his
death, he caused many <hi>Seals</hi> to be made, and in
them to be ingraven the figure of <hi>Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
on an <hi>Anchor,</hi> which is the emblem of hope,
and of which Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> would often say, <hi>Crux
mihi Anchora.</hi> These Seals, he sent to most of
those friends on which he put a value; and, at
Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> death, these Verses were found
wrap't up with that Seal which was by the
Doctor given to him.</p>
                     <q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>When my dear Friend, could write no more,</l>
                           <l>He gave this <hi>Seal,</hi> and, so gave ore.</l>
                        </lg>
                        <lg>
                           <l>When winds and waves rise highest, I am sure,</l>
                           <l>This <hi>Anchor</hi> keeps my <hi>faith,</hi> that, me secure.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                     <p>At this time of being <hi>Orator,</hi> he had learnt
to understand the <hi>Italian, Spanish,</hi> and <hi>French</hi>
Tongues very perfectly; hoping, that as his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56222:167"/>
Predecessor, so he might in time attain the place
of a <hi>Secretary of State,</hi> being then high in the
Kings favour; and, not meanly valued and
lov'd by the most eminent and most powerful
of the Court Nobility: This, and the love of
a Court-conversation mixt with a laudable am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to be something more then he then was,
drew him often from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to attend the
<hi>King,</hi> who then gave him a <hi>Sine Cure,</hi> which
fell into His Majesties disposal, I think, by the
death of the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph.</hi> It was the
same, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had formerly given
to her Favourite Sir <hi>Philip Sidney;</hi> and valued
to be worth an hundred and twenty pound <hi>per
Annum.</hi> With this, and his Annuity, and the
advantage of his Colledge, and of his Orator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
he enjoy'd his gentile humour for Cloaths,
and Court-like company, and seldom look'd
towards <hi>Cambridge,</hi> unless the King were there,
and then he never fail'd; but, at other times,
left the manage of his Orators place, to his
learned friend Mr. <hi>Herbert Thorndike,</hi> who is now
Prebend of <hi>Westminster.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I may not omit to tell, that he had often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to leave the University, and decline all
Study, which he judg'd did impair his health;
for he had a body apt to a <hi>Consumption,</hi> and to
<hi>Fevers,</hi> and other infirmities which he judg'd
were increas'd by his Studies; for he would
often say, <hi>He had a Wit, like a Pen-knife in a
narrow sheath, too sharp for his Body:</hi> But his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56222:167"/>
would by no means allow him to leave the
University, or to travel; to which, though he
inclin'd very much, yet he would by no means
satisfie his own desires at so dear a rate, as to
prove an undutiful Son to so affectionate a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but, did alwayes submit to her wisdom:
And, what I have now said, may partly appear in
a Copy of Verses in his printed Poems; 'tis
one of those that bears the title of <hi>Affliction:</hi>
And it appears to be a pious reflection on Gods
providence, and some passages of his life, and in
which he sayes,

                     <p>In this time of Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> attendance and
expectation of some good occasion to remove
him from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to Court; God, in whom
there is an unseen Chain of Causes, did in a
short time put an end to the lives of two of his
most oblieging and most powerful friends, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowick</hi>
Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
of <hi>Hamilton;</hi> and not long after him,
King <hi>James</hi> dyed, and with them, all Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's</hi>
Court-hopes: So that he presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56222:168"/>
himself to a Retreat from <hi>London,</hi> to a
Friend in <hi>Kent,</hi> where he liv'd very privately,
and was such a lover of solitariness, as was judg'd
to impair his health. In this time of Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he had many Conflicts with himself,
Whether he should return to the painted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of a Court-life, or betake himself to a
study of Divinity, and enter into Sacred Orders?
(to which his dear Mother had often persuaded
him) These were such Conflicts, as they only
can know, that have endur'd them; for, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Desires, and the outward Glory of this
World, are not easily laid aside; but, at last,
God inclin'd him to put on a resolution to serve
at his Altar.</p>
                     <p>He did at his return to <hi>London,</hi> acquaint a
Court-friend with his resolution to enter into
<hi>Sacred Orders,</hi> who persuaded him to alter it, as
too mean an employment, and too much below
his birth, and the excellent abilities and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his mind. To whom he replied, <hi>It
hath been formerly judg'd, that the Domestick
Servants of the King of Heaven, should be of
the noblest Families on Earth: and, though the
Iniquity of the late Times have made Clergy-men
meanly valued, and the sacred name of Priest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible;
yet, I will labour to make it honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by consecrating all my learning, and all my poor
abilities, to advance the glory of that God that
gave them; knowing, that I can never do too
much for him, that hath done so much for me, as to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56222:169"/>
make me a Christian. And I will labour to be like
my Saviour, by making Humility lovely in the
eyes of all men, and by following the merciful and
meek example of my dear Jesus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was then his resolution, and the God of
Constancy, who intended him for a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of vertue, continued him in it; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that year he was made Deacon, but the day
when, or by whom, I cannot learn; but that
he was about that time made Deacon, is most
certain; for I find by the Records of <hi>Lincoln,</hi>
that he was made Prebend of <hi>Layton Ecclesia,</hi>
in the Dioces of <hi>Lincoln, July 15. 1626.</hi> and
that this Prebend was given him, by <hi>John,</hi> then
<hi>Lord Bishop of that See.</hi> And now, he had a
fit occasion to shew that Piety and Bounty that
was deriv'd from his generous Mother, and his
other memorable Ancestors, and the occasion
was this.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Layton Ecclesia,</hi> is a Village near to
<hi>Spalden</hi> in the County of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and the
greatest part of the Parish was fallen down, and
that of it which stood, was so decayed, so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and so useless, that the Parishioners could
not meet to perform their Duty to God in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
prayer and praises; and thus it had been for
almost 20 years, in which time there had been
some faint endeavours for a publick Collection,
to enable the Parishioners to rebuild it; but,
with no success, till Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> undertook it;
and he, by his own, and the contribution of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56222:169"/>
of his Kindred, and other noble Friends, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>edification of it; and, made it
so much his whole business, that he became rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
till he saw it finisht as it now stands; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for the workmanship, a costly <hi>Mosaick:</hi> for
the form, an <hi>exact Cross;</hi> and, for the decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and beauty, I am assur'd it is the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Parish-Church, that this Nation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords.
He liv'd to see it so Wainscoated, as
to be exceeded by none; and, by his order, the
Reading Pew, and Pulpit, were a little distant
from each other, and both of an equal height;
for, he would often say, <hi>They should neither have
a precedency or priority of the other: but, that</hi>
Prayer <hi>and</hi> Preaching <hi>being equally useful, might
agree like Brethren, and have an equal honour and
estimation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I proceed farther, I must look back to
the time of Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> being made Prebend,
and tell the Reader, that not long after, his
Mother being inform'd of his intentions to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buld
that Church; and, apprehending the
great trouble and charge that he was like to
draw upon himself, his Relations, and Friends,
before it could be finisht; sent for him from
<hi>London</hi> to <hi>Chelsey</hi> (where he then dwelt) and
at his coming, said—<hi>George, I sent for you, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
you to commit Simony, by giving your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
as good a gift as he has given to you; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that you give him back his Preb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nd; for,</hi>
George, <hi>it is not for your weak body, and empty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56222:170"/>
purse, to undertake to build Churches.</hi> To which,
he desir'd he might have a Dayes time to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and then make her an Answer: And at his
return to her at the next Day, when he had first
desired her blessing, and she given it him, his
next request was, <hi>That she would at the Age of
Thirty three Years, allow him to become an unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Son; for, he had made a kind of Vow to God,
that if he were able, he would Re-build that
Church:</hi> And then, shew'd her such reasons for
his resolution, that she presently subscribed to
be one of his Benefactors, and undertook to
sollicit <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
who subscribed for 50 <hi>l.</hi> and not long
after, by a witty, and persuasive Letter from Mr.
<hi>Herbert,</hi> made it 50 <hi>l.</hi> more. And in this nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of some of his Benefactors, <hi>James</hi> Duke
of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and his brother Sir <hi>Henry Herbert,</hi>
ought to be remembred; and the bounty of
Mr. <hi>Nicholas Farrer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Woodnot;</hi>
the one, a Gentleman in the Neighbourhood of
<hi>Layton,</hi> and the other, a Goldsmith in <hi>Foster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,
London,</hi> ought not to be forgotten; for
the memory of such men ought to out-live
their lives. Of Mr. <hi>Farrer,</hi> I shall hereafter
give an account in a more seasonable place; but
before I proceed farther, I will give this short
account of Mr. <hi>John Woodnot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was a man, that had consider'd, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
Estates do often require more care and
watchfulness to preserve, than get them; and,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56222:170"/>
that there be many Discontents, that Riches
cure not; and did therefore set limits to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as to the desire of wealth: And having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
so much as to be able to shew some mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the Poor, and preserve a competence for
himself, he dedicated the remaining part of his
life to the service of God; and being useful
for his Friends, he prov'd to be so to Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert;</hi>
for, beside his own bounty, he collected
and return'd most of the money that was paid
for the Re-building of that Church; he kept
all the account of the charges, and would often
go down to state them, and see all the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
paid. When I have said, that this good
man was a useful Friend to Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to his Mother, and continued to be so to
him, till he clos'd his eyes on his Death-bed;
I will forbear to say more, till I have the next
fair occasion to mention the holy friendship that
was betwixt him, and Mr. <hi>Herbert.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the year 1629. and the 34<hi>th</hi> of
his Age, Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> was seiz'd with a sharp
<hi>Quotidian Ague,</hi> and thought to remove it by
the change of Air; to which end, he went to
<hi>Woodford</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> but thither more chiefly, to
enjoy the company of his beloved Brother Sir
<hi>Henry Herbert,</hi> and other Friends. In his House
he remain'd about Twelve Months, and there
became his own Physitian, and cur'd himself of
his Ague, by forbearing Drink, and eating no
Meat, no not Mutton, nor a Hen, or Pidgeon,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56222:171"/>
unless they were salted; and by such a constant
Dyet, he remov'd his Ague, but with inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
that were worse; for he brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himself a disposition to Rheums, and other
weaknesses, and a supposed Consumption. And
it is to be Noted, that in the sharpest of his
extream Fits, he would often say, <hi>Lord abate my
great affliction, and increase my patience; but,
Lord I repine not, I am dumb, Lord, before thee,
because thou doest it.</hi> By which, and a sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
submission to the Will of God, he shewed
he was inclinable to bear the sweet yoke of
<hi>Christian Discipline,</hi> both then, and in the latter
part of his life; of which, there will be many
true Testimonies.</p>
                     <p>And now his care was to recover from his
Consumption by a change, from <hi>Woodford</hi> into
such an air as was most proper to that end. And
his remove was from <hi>Woodford</hi> to <hi>Dantsey</hi> in
<hi>Wiltshire,</hi> a noble House which stands in a
choice Air, the owner of it then was, the Lord
<hi>Danvers</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> who lov'd Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
much, and allow'd him such an apartment
in that House, as might best sute Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi>
accomodation and liking. And, in this place,
by a spare Dyet, declining all perplexing Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
moderate exercise, and a chearful conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
his health was apparently improv'd to
a good degree, of strength and chearfulness:
And then, he declar'd his resolution to marry,
and to enter into the Sacred Orders of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56222:171"/>
These had long been the desires of his
Mother, and his other Relations; but, she liv'd
not to see either: for, she dyed in the year 1627.
And, though he was disobedient to her about
<hi>Layton</hi> Church, yet, in conformity to her will,
he kept his Fellowship in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and his
Orators place, till after her death; and then, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
both: And, the last, the more willingly,
that he might be succeeded by his friend <hi>Robert
Creighton,</hi> who now is Dr. <hi>Creighton,</hi> and the
worthy Dean of <hi>Wells.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I shall now proceed to his Marriage, in order
to which, it will be convenient, that I first give
the Reader a short view of his person, and then,
an account of his Wife, and of some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
concerning both.</hi>—He was for his person
of a stature inclining towards Tallness; his body
was very strait, and so far from being cumbred
with too much flesh, that he was lean to an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
His aspect was chearful, and his speech and
motion did both declare him a Gentleman; and
were all so meek and oblieging, that both then,
and at his death, he was said to have no
Enemy.</p>
                     <p>These, and his other visible vertues, begot
him so much love from a Gentleman of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fortune, and a near Kinsman to his friend the
Earl of <hi>Danby;</hi> namely, from Mr. <hi>Charles Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
of <hi>Bainton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr>
That Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> having known him long, and
familiarly, did so much affect him, that he often,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56222:172"/>
and publickly declar'd a desire that Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>
would marry any of his Nine Daughters (for
he had so many) but rather, his Daughter
<hi>Jane,</hi> than any other, because <hi>Jane</hi> was his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Daughter: And he had often said the
same to Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> himself; and, that if he
could like her for a Wife, and she him for a
Husband, <hi>Jane</hi> should have a <hi>double blessing:</hi>
And Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> had so often said the like to
<hi>Jane,</hi> and so much commended Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> to
her, that <hi>Jane</hi> became so much a Platonick, as
to fall in love with Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> unseen.</p>
                     <p>This was a fair preparation for a Marriage;
but alas, her father dyed before Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi>
retirement to <hi>Dantsey;</hi> yet some friends to both
parties, procur'd their meeting; at which time,
a mutual affection entered into both their
hearts; and as a Conqueror, enters into a surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
City, so Love having got that possession
govern'd, and made there such Laws and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
as neither party was able to resist; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
that she chang'd her name into <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
the third day after this first Interview.</p>
                     <p>This haste, might in others be thought a
Love-phrensie, or worse, but it was not; for
they wooed so like Princes, as to have select
Proxies; such, as were friends to both parties;
such, as well understood Mr. <hi>Herberts,</hi> and her
temper of mind; and, their Estates so well,
before this Interview, that, the suddenness
was justifiable, by the st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ictest Rules of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56222:172"/>
And, the more, because it prov'd so
happy to both parties; for, the eternal lover of
Mankind, made them happy in each others mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
affections, and compliance; so happy, that
there never was any opposition betwixt them,
unless it were a Contest which should most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to a compliance with the others desires.
And, though this begot, and continued in them,
such a mutual love and joy, and content, as was
no way defective; yet, this mutual content and
love, and joy, did receive a daily augmentation,
by such daily obligingness to each other, as still
added such new affluences to the former fulness
of these divine Souls, as was only improvable
in Heaven, where they now enjoy it.</p>
                     <p>About three months after his Marriage, Dr.
<hi>Curle,</hi> who was then Rector of <hi>Bemerton</hi> in
<hi>Wiltshire,</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi>
(and not long after Translated to <hi>Winchester</hi>)
and by that means the presentation of a Clerk
to <hi>Bemerton,</hi> did not fall to the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>
(who was the undoubted Patron of it)
but to the King, by reason of Dr. <hi>Curles</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement:
But <hi>Philip,</hi> then Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>
(for <hi>William</hi> was lately dead) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
the King to bestow it upon his
Kinsman <hi>George Herbert;</hi> and the King said,
<hi>Most willingly to Mr.</hi> Herbert, <hi>if it were worth
his acceptance:</hi> And the Earl as willingly and
suddenly sent it him, without seeking; but
though Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> had formerly put on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56222:173"/>
for the Clergy: yet, the apprehension
of the last great Account that he was to make
for the Cure of so many Souls, made him fast
and pray, and consider, for not less than a
month: in which time, he had some resolutions
to decline both the Priesthood, and that living.
And in this time of considering, <hi>He endur'd</hi> (as
he would often say) <hi>such spiritual Conflicts, as
none can think, but only those that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the midst of these Conflicts, his old and
dear friend Mr. <hi>John Woodnot,</hi> took a journey
to salute him at <hi>Bainton</hi> (where he then was
with his Wives Friends and Relations) and was
joyful to be an Eye-witness of his Health, and
happy Marriage. And after they had rejoyc'd
together some few dayes, they two took a
Journey to <hi>Wilton,</hi> the famous Seat of the
Earls of <hi>Pembroke;</hi> at which time, the King,
the Earl, and the whole Court were there, or
at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which is near to it. At which time
Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> presented his Thanks to the Earl,
for his presentation to <hi>Bemerton,</hi> but had not
yet resolv'd to accept of it, and told him the
reason why; but that Night, the Earl acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
with his Kinsmans irresolution. And the Bishop
did the next day so convince Mr. <hi>Herbert, That
the refusal of it was a sin;</hi> that a Taylor was
sent for to come speedily from <hi>Salisbury</hi> to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
to take measure, and make him Canonical
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56222:173"/>
Cloaths, against next day, which the Taylor
did; and Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> being so habited, went
with his presentation to the learned Dr. <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
who was then Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and he
gave him Institution immediately (for Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
had been made Deacon some years before)
and he was also the same day (which was <hi>April</hi>
26. 1630. inducted into the good and more
pleasant, than healthful Parsonage of <hi>Bemerton,</hi>
which is a Mile from <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>I have now brought him to his Parsonage of
<hi>Bemerton,</hi> and to the Thirty sixth Year of his
Age, and must now stop, and bespeak the Reader
to prepare for an almost incredible story, of the
great sanctity of the short remainder of his holy
life; a life so full of Charity, Humility, and all
Christian vertues, that it deserves the eloquence
of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to commend and declare it.
A life, that if it were related by a Pen like his,
there would then be no need for this Age to look
back into times past for the examples of primitive
piety; for they might be all found in the life of
<hi>George Herbert.</hi> But now, alas, who is fit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it, I confess I am not, and am not pleas'd
with my self that must; and profess my self
amaz'd, when I consider how few of the Clergy
liv'd like him then; and, how many live so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
him now: But it becomes not me to censure,
my design is rather to assure the Reader, that I
have used very great diligence to inform my
self, that I might inform him of the truth of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56222:174"/>
what follows, and I will do that with since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>When at his Induction he was shut into <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merton</hi>
Church, being left there alone to Toll
the Bell, as the Law requires him; he staid so
much longer than an ordinary time, before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to his Friends that staid expecting him
at the Church-door; that his Friend, Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi>
looked in at the Church-window, and saw
him lie prostrate on the ground before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:
at which time and place (as he after told
Mr. <hi>Woodnot</hi>) he set some Rules to himself,
for the future manage of his life; and then
and there made a vow, to labour to keep
them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the same night that he had his Induction,
he said to Mr.</hi> Woodnot, <q>I now look back upon my
aspiring thoughts, and think my self more happy
than if I had attain'd what I so ambitiously thirsted
for: And, I can now behold the Court with an
impartial Eye, and see plainly, that it is made up
of Fraud, and Titles, and Flattery, and many
other such empty, imaginary painted Pleasures.
Pleasures, that are so empty, as not to satisfie when
they are enjoy'd; but, in God and his service, is
a fulness of all joy and pleasure, and no satiety:
And I will now use all my endeavours to bring my
Relations and Dependants to a love and reliance
on him, who never fails those that trust him. But
above all, I will be sure to live well because the
vertuous life of a Clergy-man, is the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56222:174"/>
eloquence to perswade all that see it, to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and love, and at least to desire to live like
him. And this I will do, because I know we live
in an Age that hath more need of good examples,
than precepts. And I beseech that God, who hath
honour'd me so much as to call me to serve at his
Altar: that, as by his special grace he hath put
into my heart these good desires, and resolutions:
so, he will be his assisting grace enable me to bring
the same to good effect; and, that my humble and
charitable life, may so win upon others, as to bring
glory to my Jesus, whom I have this day taken to
be my Master and Governour; and am so proud of
his service, that I will alwayes observe, and obey,
and do his Will, and alwayes call him Jesus my
Master: and I will alwayes contemn my birth, or
any title or dignity that can be conferr'd upon me,
when I shall compare them with any title of being
a Priest, and serving at the Altar of Jesus my
Master.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that he did so, may appear in many parts
of his Book of <hi>Sacred Poems;</hi> especially, in that
which he calls <hi>the Odour.</hi> In which he seems
to rejoyce in his thoughts of that word Jesus,
and to say the adding these words <hi>my Master</hi> to
it, and the often repetition of them, seem'd to
persume his mind, and leave an oriental fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in his very breath. And for his unforc'd
choice to serve at Gods Altar, he seems in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place (<hi>the Pearl,</hi> Matth. 13.) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
and say—<q>He knew the wayes of Learning:

                     </p>
                     <p>The third day after he was made Rector of
<hi>Bemerton,</hi> and had chang'd his sword and silk
Cloaths into a Canonical Coat; he return'd so
habited with his friend Mr. <hi>Woodnot</hi> to <hi>Bainton:</hi>
And, immediately after he had seen and saluted
his Wife, he said to her—<q>
                           <hi>You are now a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Wife, and must now so far forget your fathers
house, as not to claim a precedence of any of your
Parishioners; for you are to know, that a Priests
Wife can challenge no precedence or place, but that
which she purchases by her obliging humility; and,
I am sure, places so purchased, do best become them.</hi>
And, let me tell you, <hi>That I am so good a Herald,
as to assure you that this is truth.</hi> And she was
so mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> a Wife, <hi>as to assure him it was no vexing
News to her, and that he should see her observe it
with a chearful willingness.</hi>
                        </q> And indeed her
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56222:175"/>
unforc'd humility, that humility that was in her
so original, as to be born with her, made her so
happy as to do so; and her doing so, begot her
an unfeigned love, and a serviceable respect
from all that converst with her; and this love
followed her in all places, as inseparably, as sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
follow substances in Sun-shine.</p>
                     <p>It was not many dayes before he return'd
back to <hi>Bemerton,</hi> to view the Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the Chancel; and indeed, to re-build three
parts of his house which was fall'n down by
reason of his Predecessors living at a better Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage
house; namely, at <hi>Minal, 16 or 20</hi> miles
from this place. At which time of Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi>
coming alone to <hi>Bemerton,</hi> there came to
him a poor old Woman, with an intent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with her necessitous condition, and
with some troubles of her mind; but after she
had spoke some few words to him, she was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
with a fear and shortness of breath, so
that her spirits and speech fail'd her; which he
perceiving, did so compassionate her, that he
took her by the hand, and said, <q>Speak good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
be not afraid to speak to me; for, I am a
man that will hear you with patience; and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
your necessities too, if I be able: and this I
will do willingly, and therefore, Mother, be not
afraid to acquaint me with what you desire.</q> After
which comfortable speech, he again took her
by the hand, made her sit down by him, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
she was of his Parish, he told her, <hi>He
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56222:176"/>
would be acquainted with her, and take her into
his care:</hi> And having with patience heard and
understood her wants (and it is some relief to
be but hear'd with patience) he comforted her
by his meek behaviour and counsel; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that cost him nothing, he reliev'd her with
money too, and so sent her home with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heart, praising God, and praying for him.
<hi>Thus worthy, and</hi> (like <hi>Davids</hi> blessed man)
<hi>thus lowly, was Mr.</hi> George Herbert <hi>in his own
eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At his return that Night to his Wife at
<hi>Bainton,</hi> he gave her an account of the passages
'twixt him and the poor Woman, with which
she was so affected, that she went next day to
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> and there bought a pair of Blankets,
and sent them as a Token of her love to the
poor Woman, and with them a Message, <hi>That
she would see and be acquainted with her, when
her house was built at</hi> Bemerton.</p>
                     <p>There be many such passages both of him
and his Wife, of which, some few will be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but I shall first tell, that he hasted to get
the Parish-Church repair'd; then, to beautifie
the Chappel (which stands near his house)
and that at his own great charge. He then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to re-build the Parsonage-house, which
he did also very compleatly, and at his own
charge; and having done this good work, he
caus'd these Verses to be writ upon, or ingraven
in the Mantle of the Chimney in his Hall.

seen the Church repair'd, and the Chappel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it very decently adorn'd, at his own
great charge (which is a real Truth) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now fixt him there, I shall proceed to give
an account of the rest of his behaviour to his
Parishioners, and those many others that knew
him.</p>
                     <p>Doubtless Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> had consider'd and
given Rules to himself for his Christian carriage
both to God and man before he enter'd into
<hi>Holy Orders.</hi> And 'tis not unlike, but that he
renewed those resolutions at his prostration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Holy Altar,</hi> at his Induction into the
Church of <hi>Bemerton;</hi> but as yet he was but a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56222:177"/>
Deacon, and therefore long'd for the next <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-week,</hi>
that he might be ordain'd <hi>Priest,</hi> and
made capable of administring both the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
At which time, the Reverend Doctor
<hi>Humphrey Hinchman,</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
(who does not mention him, but with
some veneration for the life and excellent
learning of Mr. <hi>George Herbert</hi>) tells me, <hi>He
laid his hand on Mr.</hi> Herberts <hi>Head, and (alas!)
within less than three Years, lent his Shoulder to
carry his dear Friend to his Grave.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, that Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> might the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those holy Rules which such a <hi>Priest</hi> as he
intended to be, ought to observe; and, that
time might not insensibly blot them out of his
memory, but the next year shew him his vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
from this years resolutions; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
did set down his Rules in that order, as the
World now sees them printed in a little Book,
call'd, <hi>The Countrey Parson,</hi> in which some of his
Rules are:

                     </p>
                     <p>And his behavior toward God and man, may
be said to be a practical Comment on these, and
the other holy Rules set down in that useful
Book. A Book, so full of plain, prudent and
useful Rules, that, that <hi>Countrey Parson,</hi> that
can spare 12 <hi>d.</hi> and yet wants, is scarce excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable;
because it will both direct him what he
is to do, and convince him for not having done it.</p>
                     <p>At the Death of Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> this Book fell
into the hands of his friend Mr. <hi>Woodnot;</hi> and
he commended it into the trusty hands of Mr.
<hi>Bar. Oly.</hi> who publish't it with a most conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and excellent Preface; from which I
have had some of those Truths, that are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this life of Mr. <hi>Herbert.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Text for his first Sermon, was taken
out of <hi>Solomons Proverbs,</hi> and the words were,
<hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence.</hi> In which first
Sermon, he gave his Parishioners many necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
holy, safe Rules, for the discharge of a good
Conscience, both to God and man. And, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
his Sermon after a most florid manner,
both with great learning and eloquence. And
at the close of his Sermon, told them, <hi>That
should not be his constant way of Preaching, and
that he would not fill their heads with unnecessary
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56222:178"/>
Notions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> but, that for their sakes, his language
and his expressions should be more plain and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
in his future Sermons.</hi> And he then made it
his humble request, <hi>That they would be constant
to the Afternoons Service, and Catechising.</hi> And
shewed them convincing reasons why he desir'd
it; and his obliging example and perswasions,
brought them to a willing conformity to his
desires.</p>
                     <p>The Texts for all his Sermons, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
taken out of the Gospel for the day;
and he did as constantly declare why the
Church did appoint that portion of Scripture to
be that day read: And in what manner the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi>
for every Sunday does refer to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or
to the <hi>Epistle</hi> then read to them; and, that they
might pray with understanding, he did usually
take occasion to explain, not only the <hi>Collect</hi>
for every particular day, but the reasons of all
the other <hi>Collects</hi> and <hi>Responses</hi> in our Service;
and, made it appear to them, that, <hi>the whole
Service of the Church,</hi> was a reasonable, and
therefore an acceptable Sacrifice to God; as
namely, that we begin with <hi>Confession of our
selves to be vile, miserable sinners;</hi> and, that we
begin so, because till we have confessed our
selves to be such, we are not capable of that
mercy which we acknowledge we need, and
pray for; but having in the prayer of our
Lord, begg'd pardon for those sins which we
have confest: And hoping, that as the <hi>Priest</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:56222:178"/>
hath declar'd our Absolution, so by our publick
Confession, and real Repentance, we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
that pardon: Then, we dare proceed to
beg of the Lord, <hi>to open our lips, that our mouths
may shew forth his praise;</hi> for, till then, we are
neither able, nor worthy to praise him: But this
being suppos'd, we are then fit to say, <hi>Glory be
to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
Ghost;</hi> and fit to proceed to a further service of
our God, in the <hi>Collects,</hi> and <hi>Psalms,</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi>
that follow in the Service.</p>
                     <p>And, as to these <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Lauds,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to inform them, why they were so often,
and some of them daily repeated in our <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service:</hi>
namely, the <hi>Psalms</hi> every Month, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be an <hi>Historical</hi> and thankful repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mercies past; and, such a composition
of prayers and praises, as ought to be repeated
often, and publickly; for, <hi>with such Sacrifices,
God is honour'd, and well-pleased.</hi> This, for the
<hi>Psalms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Lauds,</hi> appointed to
be daily repeated or sung after the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Lessons were read to the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he proceeded to inform them, that it was
most reasonable, after they have heard the will
and goodness of God declar'd or preach't by
the <hi>Priest</hi> in his reading the two Chapters, that
it was then a seasonable Duty to rise up and
express their gratitude to Almighty God for
those his mercies to them, and to all Mankind,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56222:179"/>
and say with the <hi>blessed Virgin, That their Souls
do magnifie the Lord, and that their spirits do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
rejoyce in God their Saviour:</hi> And that it was
their Duty also to rejoyce with <hi>Simeon</hi> in his
Song, and say with him, <hi>That their eyes have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
seen their salvation;</hi> for they have seen that
salvation which was but prophesied till his
time; and he then broke out in expressions of
joy to see it: but they live to see it daily, in the
History of it, and therefore ought daily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and daily to offer up their Sacrifices of
praise to their God, for that and all his mercies.
A service, which is now the constant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that <hi>blessed Virgin,</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> and
all those blessed Saints that are possest of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and where they are at this time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably,
and constantly singing, <hi>Holy, Holy,
Holy Lord God, Glory be to God on High, and on
Earth peace.</hi> And he taught them, that to do
this, was an acceptable service to God, because
the Prophet <hi>David</hi> sayes in his Psalms, <hi>He that
praiseth the Lord, honoureth him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He made them to understand, how happy
they be that are freed from the incumbrances
of that Law which our Fore-fathers groan'd
under: namely; from the <hi>Legal Sacrifices;</hi> and
from the many <hi>Ceremonies of the Levitical Law:</hi>
freed from <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and from the strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the <hi>Jewish Sabbath,</hi> and the like:
And he made them know, that having receiv'd
so many, and so great blessings, by being born
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56222:179"/>
since the dayes of our Saviour, it must be an
acceptable Sacrifice to Almighty God, for
them to acknowledge those blessings, and stand
up and worship, and say as <hi>Zacharias</hi> did, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be the Lord God of</hi> Israel, <hi>for he hath</hi> (in our
dayes) <hi>visited and redeemed his people; and</hi> (he
hath in our dayes) <hi>remembred, and shewed that
mercy which by the mouth of the Prophets, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to our Fore-fathers:</hi> and this he hath
done, <hi>according to his holy Covenant made with
them:</hi> And we live to see and enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of it, in his <hi>Birth,</hi> in his <hi>Life,</hi> his <hi>Passion,</hi> his
<hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven, where
he now sits sensible of all our temptations and
infirmities; and where he is at this present time
making intercession for us, to his, and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore they ought daily to express
their publick gratulations, and say daily with
<hi>Zacharias, Blessed be that Lord God of</hi> Israel <hi>that
hath thus visited, and thus redeemed his people.—</hi>
These were some of the reasons by which Mr.
<hi>Herbert</hi> instructed his Congregation for the
use of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and the <hi>Hymns</hi> appointed
to be daily sung or said in the Church-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                     <p>He inform'd them, when the <hi>Priest</hi> did pray
only for the Congregation, and not for himself;
and when they did only pray for him, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
after the repetition of the <hi>Creed,</hi> before he
proceeds to pray the Lords prayer, or any of the
appointed Collects, the Priest is directed to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56222:180"/>
kneel down, and pray for them, saying—<hi>The
Lord be with you</hi>—And then they pray for him,
saying—<hi>And with thy spirit.</hi> and he assur'd them,
that when there is such mutual love, and such
joint prayers offered for each other, then the
holy Angels look down from Heaven, and are
ready to carry such charitable desires to God
Almighty, and he as ready to receive them; and
that a Christian Congregation calling thus up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, with one heart, and one voyce, and in
one reverend and humble posture look as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
as <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that is at peace with it
self.</p>
                     <p>He instructed them, why the prayer of our
Lord was pray'd often in every full service of
the Church; namely, at the conclusion of the
several parts of that Service; and pray'd then,
not only because it was compos'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by our Jesus that made it, but as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
pattern for our less perfect Forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and therefore fittest to sum up and conclude
all our imperfect Petitions.</p>
                     <p>He instructed them, that as by the second
Commandment we are requir'd not to bow
down, or worship an Idol, or false god; so, by
the contrary Rule, we are to bow down and
kneel, or stand up and worship the true God:
And he instructed them, why the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
the Congregation to stand up, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of the Creeds; namely, because they
did thereby declare both their obedience to the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56222:180"/>
Church, and an assent to that faith into which
they had been baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d. And he taught them,
that in that sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter Creed, or Doxology so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
repeated daily; they also stood up to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their belief to be, that, <hi>the God that they
trusted in was one God, and three persons the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Son, and the Holy Ghost; to whom, the
Priest gave glory:</hi> And because there had been
Heretic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s that had denied some of these three
persons to be God, therefore the Congregation
stood up and honour'd him, by con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>essing and
saying, <hi>It was so in the beginning is now so, and
shall ever be so World without end.</hi> And as gave
their assent to this be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ef, by saying <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He instructed them, what benefit they had,
by the Churches appointing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> elebration
of Holy-dayes, and the excellent use of them;
namely, that they were set apart for particular
Commemorations of particular mercies recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from Almighty God; and (as Reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

distinguish times; for by them we are taught to
take notice how the years pass by us; and, that
we ought not to let them pass without a Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of praise for those mercies which they
give us occasion to remember: and therefore
the year is appointed to begin the 25th day of
<hi>March;</hi> a day, in which we commemorate the
<hi>Angels</hi> appearing to the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> with the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
tydings that <hi>she should conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ive and bear a Son,
that should be the redeemer of Mankind:</hi> and, she
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56222:181"/>
did so Forty weeks after this joyful salutation;
namely, at our <hi>Christmas,</hi> a day in which we
commemorate his Birth, with joy and praise;
and that eight dayes after this happy Birth, we
celebrate his <hi>Circumcision;</hi> namely, in that
which we call <hi>New-years day.</hi> And that upon
that we call <hi>Twelfth-day,</hi> we commemorate the
manifestation of the unsearchable riches of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And that day we also cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the memory of his goodness in sending a
<hi>Star</hi> to guide the <hi>three wise men</hi> from the <hi>East</hi>
to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> that they might there <hi>worship,</hi> and
present him with their oblations of <hi>Gold, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incense,</hi>
and <hi>Myrrhe.</hi> And he (Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>)
instructed them, that <hi>Jesus</hi> was Forty dayes
after his Birth, presented by his blessed mother
in the <hi>Temple;</hi> namely, on that day which we
call, <hi>the Purification of the blessed Virgin, Saint</hi>
Mary. And he instructed them, that by the
<hi>Lent-fast,</hi> we imitate and commemorate our
Saviours humiliation in fasting Forty dayes;
and, that we ought to endeavour to be like him
in purity. And, that on <hi>Good fryday</hi> we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate
and condole his <hi>Crucifixion.</hi> And,
at <hi>Easter,</hi> commemorate his <hi>glorious Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And he taught them, that after Jesus had
manifested himself to his Disciples, to be <hi>that
Christ that was crucified, dead and buried;</hi> that
then by his appearing and conversing with them
for the space of Forty dayes after his <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
he then, and not till then, <hi>ascended into
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56222:181"/>
Heaven,</hi> in the sight of his Disciples, namely,
on that day which we call the <hi>Ascension,</hi> or
<hi>Holy Thursday.</hi> And that we then celebrate
the performance of the promise which he made
to his Disciples, at or before his Ascension;
namely, <hi>that though he left them, yet he would
send them the Holy Ghost to be their Comforter;</hi>
and he did so on that day which the Church
calls <hi>Whit sunday</hi>—Thus the Church keeps an
Historical and circular Commemoration of
times, as they pass by us; of such times, as
ought to incline us to occasional praises, for the
particular blessings which we do, or might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
at those holy times.</p>
                     <p>He made them know, why the Church hath
appointed <hi>Ember-weeks;</hi> and, to know the
reason why the <hi>Commandements,</hi> and the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
and <hi>Gospels</hi> were to be read at the <hi>Altar,</hi> or
<hi>Communion Table:</hi> why the Priest was to pray
the <hi>Litany</hi> Kneeling; and, why to pray some
<hi>Collects</hi> standing; and he gave them many
other observations, fit for his plain Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but not fit for me now to mention; for I must
set limits to my Pen, and not make that a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
which I intended to be a much shorter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
than I have made it; but I have done,
when I have told the Reader, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in <hi>Catechising</hi> every <hi>Sunday</hi> in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
and that his Catechising was after his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
lesson, and in the Pulpit, and that he never
exceeded his half hour, and was always so happy
as to have a full Congregation,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:56222:182"/>But to this I must add, That if he were at
any time too zealous in his Sermons, it was, in
reproving the indecencies of the peoples beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
in the time of Divine Service; and of
those Ministers that hudled up the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayers,
without a visible reverence and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
namely, such as seem'd to say the Lords
prayer, or a Collect in a breath; but for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
his custom was, to stop betwixt every Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and give the people time to consider what
they had pray'd, and to force their desires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately
to God, before he engag'd them
into new Petitions.</p>
                     <p>And by this account of his diligence, to
make his Parishioners understand what, and why
they pray'd, and prais'd, and ador'd their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
I hope I shall the more easily obtain the
Readers belief to the following account of
Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> own practice; which was, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
constantly with his Wife, and three Neeces
(the daughters of a deceased Sister) and his
whole Family, twice a day at the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayers,
in the Chappel which does almost join
so his Parsonage-house. And for the time of
his appearing, it was strictly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t the Canonical
hours of Ten and Four; and then, and there, he
lifted up pure and charitable hands to God in the
midst of the Congregation. And he would
joy to have spent that time in that place, where
the honour of his Master Jesus dwelleth; and
there, by that inward devotion which he testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56222:182"/>
constantly by an humble behaviour, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
adoration, he, like <hi>David,</hi> brought not
only <hi>his own Houshold thus to serve the Lord;</hi>
but brought most of his Parishioners, and many
Gentlemen in the Neighbourhood, constantly
to make a part of his Congregation twice a
day; and some of the meaner sort of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
did so love and reverence Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> that
they would let their Plow rest when Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts
Saints-Bell</hi> rung to Prayers, that they
might also offer their devotions to God with
him, and would then return back to their Plow.
And his most holy life was such, that it begot
such reverence to God, and to him, that they
thought themselves the happier, when they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> blessing back with them to
their labour. Thus powerful was his reason,
and example, to perswade others to a practical
piety.</p>
                     <p>And his constant publick Prayers did never
make him to neglect his own private devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor those prayers that he thought himself
bound to perform with his Family; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
were a Set-form, and not long; and he
did alwayes conclude them with that Collect
which the Church hath appointed for the day
or week.—<hi>Thus he made every dayes sanctity a
step towards that Kingdom where Impurity cannot
enter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His chiefest recreation was Musick, in which
heavenly Art he was a most excellent Master,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56222:183"/>
and, compos'd many <hi>divine Hymns</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems,</hi>
which he set and sung to his <hi>Lute</hi>
or <hi>Viol;</hi> and, though he was a lover of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iredness,
yet his love to <hi>Musick</hi> was such,
that he went usually twice every week on
certain appointed dayes, to the <hi>Cathedral
Church</hi> in <hi>Salisbury;</hi> and at his return would
say, <hi>That his time spent in Prayer, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Musick, elevated his Soul, and was
his Heaven upon Earth:</hi> But before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
thence to <hi>Bemerton,</hi> he would usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sing and play his part, at an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
private Musick meeting; and, to justifie
this practice, he would often say, <hi>Religion does
not banish mirth, but only moderates, and sets rules
to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, as his desire to enjoy <hi>his Heaven
upon Earth,</hi> drew him twice every week
to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> so, his walks thither, were
the occasion of many happy accidents to
others, of which, I will mention some
few.</p>
                     <p>In one of his walks to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook
a Gentleman that is still living in that
City, and in their walk together, Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>
took a fair occasion to talk with him, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
begg'd to be excus'd, if he ask'd him some
account of his faith; and said, <q>I do this,
the rather, because though you are not of my
Parish, yet I receive Tythe from you by the
hand of your Tenant; and, Sir, I am the bolder
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56222:183"/>
to do it, because I know there be some Sermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearers,
that be like those Fishes, that alwayes
live in salt water, and yet are alwayes
fresh.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After which expression, Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him some needful Questions, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received his answer, gave him such
Rules for the tryal of his sincerity, and
for a practical piety, and in so loving and
meek a manner, that the Gentleman did
so fall in love with him, and his discourse,
that he would often contrive to meet him
in his walk to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> or to attend
him back to <hi>Bemerton;</hi> and still mentions
the name of Mr. <hi>George Herbert</hi> with vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and still praises God that he knew
him.</p>
                     <p>In another of his <hi>Salisbury</hi> walks, he
met with a Neighbour Minister, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some friendly Discourse betwixt them,
and some Condolement for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Times, and Contempt of the
Clergy, Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> took occcasion to
say,</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>One Cure for these Distempers, would
be for the Clergy themselves to keep the
<hi>Ember-Weeks</hi> strictly, and begg of their
Parishioners to joyn with him in <hi>Fasting</hi>
and <hi>Prayers,</hi> for a more Religious Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56222:184"/>
                           <hi>And another Cure would be,</hi> for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the great and neglected duty of <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi>
on which the salvation of so many of the poor
and ignorant Lay-people does depend; but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
that the Clergy themselves would be sure
to live unblameably; and that the dignified Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
especially, which preach Temperance, would
avoid Surfeting, and take all occasions to express a
visible humility, and charity in their lives; for
this would force a love and an imitation, and an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nfeigned reverence from all that knew them:
(<hi>And for proof of this, we need no other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
than the life and death of Dr.</hi> Lake,
<hi>late Lord Bishop of</hi> Bath <hi>and</hi> Wells) This, (<hi>said
Mr.</hi> Herbert) would be a Cure for the wickedness
and growing Atheism of our Age. And, <hi>my dear
Brother,</hi> till this be done by us, and done in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
let no man expect a reformation of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the <hi>Laity:</hi> for 'tis not learning, but this,
this only, that must do it; and till then, the fault
must lie at our doors.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>In another walk to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> he saw a poor
man, with a poorer horse, that was fall'n under
his Load; they were both in distress, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
present help; which Mr.<hi>Herbert</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
put off his Canonical Coat, and help'd
the poor man to unload, and after to load his
horse: The poor man blest him for it; and he
blest the poor man, and was so like the <hi>good
Samaritan,</hi> that he gave him money to refresh
both himself and his horse; and told him, <hi>That
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56222:184"/>
if he lov'd himself, he should be merciful to his
Beast.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hus he left the poor man, and at his
coming to his musical friends at <hi>Salisbury,</hi>they
began to wonder that Mr. <hi>George Herbert,</hi> which
us'd to be so trim and clean, came into that
company so soyl'd and discompos'd; but he
told them the occasion: And when one of the
company told him, <hi>He had disparag'd himself by
so dirty an employment;</hi> his answer was, <hi>That
the thought of what he had done, would prove
Musick to him at Midnight; and the omission of
it, would have upbraided and made discord in his
Conscience, whensoever he should pass by that place;
for if I be bound to pray for all that be in distress,
I am sure I am bound so far as it is in my power to
practise what I pray for. And though I do not wish
for the like occasion every day yet let me tell you, I
would not willingly pass one day of my life, without
comforting a sad soul, or shewing mercy; and I
praise God for this occasion:</hi> And now let's tune
our Instruments.</p>
                     <p>Thus, as our blessed Saviour after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
did take occasion to interpret the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to <hi>Cleopas,</hi> and that other Disciple which
he met with and accompanied too in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Emmaus;</hi> so Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> in his path to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Heaven, did daily take any fair occasion
to instruct the ignorant, or comfort any that
were in affliction; and did alwayes confirm his
precepts, by shewing mercy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56222:185"/>And he was most happy in his Wifes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
compliance with his acts of Charity,
whom he made his <hi>Almoner,</hi> and paid constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into her hand, <hi>a tenth penny</hi> of what money
he receiv'd for Tythe, and gave her a power to
dispose that to the poor of his Parish, and with
it a power to dispose a tenth part of the Corn
that came yearly into his Barn; which trust
she did most faithfully perform, and would often
offer to him <hi>an account of her stewardship,</hi> and
as often beg an inlargement of his bounty, for
she rejoyc'd in the employment; and this was
usually laid out by her in <hi>Blankets</hi> and <hi>Shooes,</hi>
for some such poor people, as she knew to stand
in most need of them. This, as to her Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
—And for his own, he set no limits to it;
nor did ever turn his face from any that he saw
in want; but would relieve them, especially his
poor Neighbours, to the meanest of whose
Houses, he would go and inform himself of
their wants, and relieve them chearfully if they
were in distress; and would alwayes praise
God, as much for being willing, as for being
able to do it. And, when he was advis'd by a
friend to be more frugal, because he might have
Children, his answer was, <hi>He would not see the
danger of want so far off; but, being the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
does so commend Charity, as to tell us, that
Charity is the top of Christian vertues, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of sins, the fulfilling of the Law, the life
of Faith. And, that Charity hath a promise of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56222:185"/>
the blessings of this life, and of a reward in that
life which is to come; being these, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things are in Scripture spoken of thee O
Charity; and being all my Tythes, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues,
are a Deodate from thee O my God; make
me, O my God, so far to trust thy promise, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
them back to thee; and, by thy grace, I will

that are in distress, or do but bear the image
of Jesus my Master. Sir</hi> (said he to his friend)
<hi>my Wife hath a competent maintenance secur'd her
after my death, and therefore as this is my prayer,
so this my resolution shall by Gods grace be unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may be some account of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the active part of his life, and thus he
continued, till a Consumption so weakned him,
as to confine him to his House, or to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
which does almost join to it; in which, he
continued to read Prayers constantly twice eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, though he were very weak; in one of
which times of his reading, his Wife observ'd
him to read in pain, and told him so, and that it
wasted his spirits, weakned him, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
it, but said, <hi>His life could not be better
spent, than in the service of his Master Jesus, who
had done and suffered so much for him: But,</hi> he
said, <hi>I will not be wilful, for Mr.</hi> Bostock <hi>shall
be appointed to read Prayers for me to morrow, and
I will now be only a hearer of them, till this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
shall put on immortality.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Bostock</hi>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56222:186"/>
did the next day undertake and continue this
happy employment, till Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> death.—
This Mr. <hi>Bostock</hi> was a learned and vertuous
man, an old friend of Mr. <hi>Herberts,</hi> and then
his Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

a mile from <hi>Bemerton,</hi> to which Church, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merton</hi>
is but a <hi>Chappel of ease.</hi>—And, this Mr.
<hi>Bostock</hi> did also constantly supply the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service</hi>
for Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> in that Chappel, when
the Musick-meeting at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> caus'd his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from it.</p>
                     <p>About one month before his death, his friend
Mr. <hi>Farrer</hi> (for an account of whom I am by
promise indebted to the Reader, and intend to
make him sudden payment) sent Mr. <hi>Edmund
Duncon</hi> (who is now Rector of <hi>Fryer Barnet</hi> in
the County of <hi>Middlesex</hi>) from his House of
Gidden Hall, which is near to <hi>Huntington,</hi> to see
Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> and to assure him, he wanted not
his daily prayers for his recovery; and Mr. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
was to return back to <hi>Gidden,</hi> with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> condition. Mr. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
found him at that time lying on his Bed, or
on a Pallet; but at his seeing Mr. <hi>Duncon,</hi> he
rais'd himself vigorously, saluted him, and with
some earnestness inquir'd the health of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Farrer,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Duncon</hi> satisfied
him; and after a conference of Mr. <hi>Farrers</hi>
holy life and the manner of his constant serving
God, he said to Mr. <hi>Duncon—Sir, I see by your
habit that you are a Priest, and I desire you to pray
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56222:186"/>
with me;</hi> which being granted, Mr. <hi>Duncon</hi>
ask'd him, <hi>what Prayers?</hi> to which, Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi>
answer was, <hi>O Sir, the Prayers of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Church of</hi> England, <hi>no other Prayers are
equal to them; but, at this time, I beg of you to
pray only the</hi> Litany. <hi>for I am weak and faint,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Duncon</hi> did so After which, and some
other discourse of Mr. <hi>Farrer,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Herbert</hi>
provided Mr. <hi>Duncon</hi> a plain Supper, and a clean
Lodging, and he betook himself to rest—<hi>This
Mr.</hi> Duncon <hi>tells me;</hi> and, that at his first view
of Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> he saw majesty and humility so
reconcil'd in his looks and behaviour, as begot
in him an awful reverence for his person, and
sayes, his discourse was so pious, and his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so gentile and meek, that after almost forty
years, they remain still fresh in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, Mr. <hi>Duncon</hi> left him, and
betook himself to a Journey to <hi>Bath,</hi> but with
a promise to return back to him within five
dayes, and he did so; but before I shall say any
thing of what discourse then fell betwixt them
two, I will pay my promis'd account of Mr.
<hi>Farrer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Nicholas Farrer</hi> (who got the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being call'd Saint <hi>Nicholas,</hi> at the age of
six years) was born in <hi>London,</hi> and doubtless
had good education in his youth; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
was at a fit age made Fellow of <hi>Clare-Hall</hi>
in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he continued to be eminent
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56222:187"/>
for his temperance and learning. About the
26<hi>th</hi> year of his Age, he betook himself to
Travel, in which he added to his Latin and
Greek, a perfect knowledge of all the Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
spoken in the Western parts of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world, and understood well the principles
of their Religion, and their manner, and the
reasons of their worship. In this his Travel,
he met with many perswasions to come into a
communion with that Church which calls it
self <hi>Catholick,</hi> but he return'd from his Travels
as he went, eminent for his obedience to his
Mother, <hi>the Church of England.</hi> In his absence
from <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Farrers</hi> father (who was a
Merchant) allow'd him a liberal maintenance;
and, not long after his return into <hi>England,</hi> he
had by the death of his father, or an elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
an Estate left him, that enabled him to
buy Land to the value of 500 <hi>l.</hi> a year, the
greatest part of which Land was at <hi>Little Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
four or six miles from <hi>Huntington,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
18 from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which place he chose
for the privacy of it, and the Hall, which had
the Parish-Church, or Chappel belonging, and
adjoining near to it; for Mr. <hi>Farrer</hi> having
seen the manners and vanities of the World,
and found them to be, as Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> sayes, <hi>A
nothing between two Dishes;</hi> he did so contemn
the World, that he resolv'd to spend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his life in mortifications, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and charity, and to be alwayes prepar'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56222:187"/>
for Death.—And his Life was spent
thus.</p>
                     <p>He, and his Family, which were like a little
Colledge, and about Thirty in number, did
most of them keep <hi>Lent,</hi> and all <hi>Ember-weeks</hi>
strictly, both in fasting, and using all those
prayers that the Church hath appointed to be
then used; and he and they, did the like on
<hi>Fridayes,</hi> and on the <hi>Vigils,</hi> or Eves appointed
to be fasted before the Saints dayes; and, this
frugality and abstinence, turn'd to the relief of
the Poor; but, this was but a part of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
none but God and he knew the rest.</p>
                     <p>This Family, which I have said to be in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
about Thirty, were a part of them his
Kindred, and the rest chosen to be of a temper
fit to be moulded into a devout life; and all of
them were for their dispositions serviceable
and quiet, and humble, and free from scandal.
Having thus fitted himself for his Family, he
did about the year 1630. betake himself to a
constant and methodical service of God, and it
was in this manner.—He did himself use to
read the Common prayers (for he was a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con)
every day, at the appointed hours of ten
and four, in the Church which was very near his
House, and which he had both repair'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd;
for it was fall'n into a great ruine, by
reason of a depopulation of the Village before
Mr. <hi>Farrer</hi> bought the Mannor. And he did
also constantly read the <hi>Mattins</hi> every morning
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56222:188"/>
at the hour of six, either in the Church, or in
an Oratory, which was within his own House:
And many of the Family did there continue
with him after the Prayers were ended, and
there they spent some hours in singing Hymns,
or Anthems, sometimes in the Church, and
often to an Organ in the Oratory. And, they
sometimes betook themselves to meditate, or
to pray privately, or to read a part of the New
Testament, or to continue their praying or
reading the Psalms; and in case the Psalms
were not all read in the day, then Mr. <hi>Farrer,</hi>
and others of the Congregation, did at Night,
at the ring of a Watch-bell, repair to the
Church or Oratory, and there betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to prayers, and lauding God, and reading
the Psalms that had not been read in the day;
and when these, or any part of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
grew weary, or faint, the Watch-bell was
rung, sometimes before, and sometimes after
Midnight; and then a part of the Family rose,
and maintain'd the Watch, sometimes by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or singing Lands to God, or reading the
Psalms, and when after some hours they also
grew we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt, then they rung the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
and were reliev'd by some of the former,
or by a new part of the Society, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
their devotions (as hath been mentioned)
until morning.—And it is to be noted, that in
this continued serving of God, the Psalter, or
whole Book of Psalms, was in every four and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56222:188"/>
twenty hours, sung or read over, from the first
to the last verse, and this done as constantly, as
the Sun runs his Circle every day about the
World, and then begins it again the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
that it ended.</p>
                     <p>Thus did Mr. <hi>Farrer</hi> and his happy Family,
serve God day and night. Thus did they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
behave themselves, as in his presence.
And they did alwayes eat and drink by the
strictest rules of Temperance; eat and drink
so, as to be ready to rise at Midnight, or at the
call of a Watch-bell, and perform their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to God.—And 'tis fit to tell the Reader,
that many of the Clergy that were more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to practical prety, and devotion, then to
doub ful and needless Disputations, did often
come to <hi>Gidden Hall,</hi> and make themselves a
part of that happy Society, and stay a week or
more, and join with Mr. <hi>Farrer,</hi> and the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in these Devotions, and assist and ease him or
them in their Watch by Night; and these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Devotions, had neverless than two of the
domestick Family in the Night; and the
Watch was alwayes kept in the Church or Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
unless in extreme cold Winter-nights, and
then it was maintain'd in a Parlor which had a
fire in it, and the Parlor was fitted for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
and this course of piety, and great liberality
to his poor Neighbours, Mr. <hi>Farrer</hi> maintain'd
till his death, which was in the year 1639.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56222:189"/>Mr. <hi>Farrers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> devout lives,
were both so noted, that the general report of
 their sanctity, gave them occasion to renew
that slight acquaintance which was begun at
their being Contemporaries in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and,
this new holy friendship was maintain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any interview, but only by loving and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing
Letters. And, one testimony of their
friendship, and pious designs, may appear by
Mr. <hi>Farrers</hi> commending the considerations of
<hi>John Valdesso</hi> (a Book which he had met with
in his Travels, and Translated out of <hi>Spanish</hi>
into <hi>English</hi>) to be examin'd and censur'd by
Mr. <hi>Herbert;</hi> which Book, Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> did
read, and return back with many margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Notes, as they be now printed with
that excellent Book; and with them, Mr.
<hi>Herberts</hi> affectionate Letter to Mr. <hi>Farrer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>John Valdesso</hi> was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and was
for his Learning and Vertue, much valued and
lov'd by the great Emperour <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi>
whom <hi>Valdesso</hi> had followed as a <hi>Cavalier</hi> all
the time of his long and dangerous Wars;
and when <hi>Valdesso</hi> grew old, and weary of the
World, he took his fair opportunity to declare
to the Emperour, that his resolution was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
His Majesties Service, and betake himself
to a quiet and contemplative life, <hi>because there
ought to be a vacancy of time, betwixt fighting
and dying.</hi>—The Emperor had himself, for the
same, or other reasons, put on the same resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56222:189"/>
but God and himself did then only
know them; and he did for those, or other
reasons, desire <hi>Valdesso</hi> to consider well of what
he had said, but keep his purpose within his
own breast, till they two had another like op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of a friendly Discourse, which <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desso</hi>
promis'd.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the Emperour appoints
privately a day for him and <hi>Valdesso</hi> to receive
the Sacrament publickly, and appointed an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and devout Fryer, to preach a Sermon of
contempt of the World, and of the happiness
sand benefit of a quiet and contemplative life,
which the Fryer did most affectionately. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which Sermon, the Emperour declar'd open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
,<hi>That the Preacher had begot in him a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to lay down his Dignities, to forsake the World,
and betake himself to a Monastical life.</hi> And,
he pretended, he had perswaded <hi>John Valdesso</hi>
to do the like; but this is most certain, that
after the Emperour had called his son <hi>Philip</hi>
out of <hi>England,</hi> and resign'd to him all his
Kingdoms, that then the Emperour, and <hi>John
Valdesso,</hi> did perform their resolutions.</p>
                     <p>This account of <hi>John Valdesso,</hi> I receiv'd
from a Friend, that had it from the mouth of
Mr. <hi>Farrer:</hi> And, the Reader may note, that in
this retirement, <hi>John Valdesso</hi> writ his 110 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
and many other Treatises of worth,
which want a second Mr. <hi>Farrer</hi> to procure, and
Translate them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56222:190"/>After this account of Mr. <hi>Farrer,</hi> and <hi>John
Valdesso,</hi> I proceed to my account of Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Duncon,</hi> who, according to his
promise, return'd the fifth day, and found Mr.
<hi>Herbert</hi> much weaker than he left him, and
therefore their Discourse could not be long;
but at Mr. <hi>Duncons</hi> parting with him, Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
spoke to this purpose—<hi>Sir, I pray give my
brother</hi> Farrer <hi>an account of my decaying condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and tell him, I beg him to continue his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for me, and let him know, that I have consider'd,
That God only is what he would be; and, that I
am by his grace become now so like him, as to be
pleas'd with what pleaseth him, and do not repine
at my want of health; and tell him, my heart is
fixed on that place where true joy is only to be
found; and, that I long to be there, and will wait
my appointed change with hope and patience.</hi>-And
having said this, he did with such a humility as
seem'd to exalt him, bow down to Mr. <hi>Duncon,</hi>
and with a thoughtful and contented look, say
to him, <hi>Sir, I pray deliver this little Book to my
dear brother</hi> Farrer, <hi>and tell him, he shall find in
it a picture of the many spiritual Conflicts that
have past betwixt God and my Soul, before I could
subject mine to the will of Jesus my Master, in
whose service I have now found perfect freedom;
desire him to read it. and then if he can think it
may turn to the advantage of any dejected poor
Soul, let it be made publick; if not, let him burn
it, for I and it, are less than the least of Gods
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56222:190"/>
mercies.</hi>—Thus meanly did this humble man
think of this excellent Book, which now bears
the name of <hi>The TEMPLE:</hi> Or, <hi>Sacred
Poems, and Private Ejaculations;</hi> of which, Mr.
<hi>Farrer</hi> would say, <hi>There was the picture of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Soul in every page; and, that the whole Book,
was such a harmony of holy passions, as would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the World with pleasure and piety.</hi> And, it
appears to have done so, for there have been
Ten thousand of them sold since the first Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
                     <p>And this ought to be noted, that when Mr.
<hi>Farrer</hi> sent this Book to <hi>Cambridge</hi> to be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
for the Press, the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> would
by no means allow the two so much noted
Verses
<q>
                           <l>Religion stands a Tip-toe in our Land,</l>
                           <l>Ready to pass to the <hi>American</hi> Strand.</l>
                        </q>
to be printed; and, Mr. <hi>Farrer,</hi> would by no
means allow the Book to be printed, and want
them: But after some time, and some argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for, and against their being made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> said, <hi>I knew Mr.</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
<hi>well, and know that he had many heavenly
Speculations, and was a Divine Poet; but, I hope
the World will not take him to be an inspired Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and therefore I License the whole Book:</hi> So
that it came to be printed, without the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or addition of a syllable, since it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56222:191"/>
into the hands of Mr. <hi>Duncon,</hi> save only,
that Mr. <hi>Farrer</hi> hath added that excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
that is printed before it.</p>
                     <p>At the time of Mr. <hi>Duncons</hi> leaving Mr.
<hi>Herbert,</hi> which was about three Weeks before
his death, his old and dear friend Mr. <hi>Woodnot,</hi>
came from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Bemerton,</hi> and never left
him, till he had seen him draw his last breath,
and clos'd his Eyes on his Death-bed. In this
time of his decay, he was often visited and
pray'd for by all the Clergy that liv'd near to
him, especially by the Bishop and Prebends of
the Cathedral Church in <hi>Salisbury;</hi> but by
none more devoutly, than his Wife, his three
Neeces (then a part of his Family) and Mr.
<hi>Woodnot,</hi> who were the sad Witnesses of his
daily decay, to whom he would often speak to
this purpose.—<hi>I now look back upon the pleasures
of my life past, and see the content I have taken in
beauty, in wit, in musick, and pleasant Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how they are now all past by me, as a shadow that
returns not, and are all become dead to me, or I to
them; that as my father and generation hath
done before me, so I shall now suddenly</hi> (<hi>with</hi>
Job) <hi>make my Bed also in the dark; and, I praise
God, I am prepar'd for it; and, that I am not to
learn patience, now I stand in such need of it;
and, that I have practised Mortification, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to dye daily, that I might not dye eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally;
and, my hope is, that I shall shortly leave
this valley of tears, and be free from all fevers
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56222:191"/>
and pain; and which will be a more happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I shall be free from sin, and all the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and anxieties that attend it; and this being
past, I shall dwell in the new</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>dwell
there with men made perfect; dwell, where these
eyes shall see my Master and Saviour Jesus; and,
with him, see my dear mother, and relations, and
friends; but I must dye, or not come to that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py place
: And, this is my content, that I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
daily towards it; and, that every day that I
have liv'd, hath taken a part of my appointed
time from me; and, that I shall live the less time,
for having liv'd this, and the day past.</hi>—These,
and the like expressions, which he utter'd often,
may be said to be his enjoyment of Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he enjoy'd it. The <hi>Sunday</hi> before his death,
he rose Suddenly from his Bed or Couch, call'd
for one of his Instruments, took it into hand, and
said—</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>My God, my God,</l>

                        <l>And every string</l>
                        <l>Shall have his attribute to sing.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>And having tun'd it, he play'd and sung:

                           <l>The Sundayes of mans life,</l>
                           <l>Thredded together on times string,</l>

                           <l>Of the eternal glorious King:</l>

                           <l>Blessings are plentiful and rife,</l>
                           <l>More plentiful than hope.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus he sung on earth such Hymns and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems,
as the Angels and he, and Mr. <hi>Farrer,</hi>
now sing in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56222:192"/>Thus he continued meditating and praying,
and rejoycing, till the day of his death, and on
that day said to Mr. <hi>Woodnot, My dear Friend, I
am sorry I have nothing to present to my merciful
God but sin and misery; but the first is pardon'd,
and a few hours will put a period to the latter.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which expression, Mr. <hi>Woodnot</hi> took occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to remember him of the Re-edifying <hi>Layton</hi>
Church, and his many Acts of mercy; to which
he made answer, saying, <hi>They be good works, if
they be sprinkled with the blood of Christ, and
not otherwise.</hi> After this Discourse, he became
more restless, and his Soul seem'd to be weary of
her earthly Tabernacle; and this uneasiness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so visible, that his Wife, his three Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Mr. <hi>Woodnot,</hi> stood constantly about
his Bed, beholding him with sorrow, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
to lose the sight of him whom they
could not hope to see much longer. As they
stood thus beholding him, his Wife observ'd
him to breath faintly, and with much trouble;
and, observ'd him to fall into a sudden Agony;
which so surpriz'd her, that she fell into a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
passion, and requir'd of him to know <hi>how he
did?</hi> to which his answer was, <hi>That he had past
a Conflict with his last Enemy, and had overcome
him, by the merits of his Master Jesus.</hi> After
which answer, he look'd up, and saw his Wife
and Neeces weeping to an extremity, and
charg'd them, <hi>If they lov'd him, to withdraw
into the next Room, and there pray every one alone
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56222:192"/>
for him, for nothing but their lamentations could
make his death uncomfortable.</hi> To which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
their sighs and tears would not suffer
them to make any reply, but they yielded him
a sad obedience, leaving only with him Mr.
<hi>Woodnot,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bostock.</hi> Immediately after
they had left him, he said to Mr. <hi>Bostock, Pray
Sir open that door, then lock into that Cabinet, in
which you may easily find my last Will, and give it
into my hand;</hi> which being done, he deliver'd it
into the hand of Mr. <hi>Woodnot,</hi> and said, <hi>My old
Friend, I here deliver you my last Will, in which
you will find that I have made you my sole Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for the good of my Wife and Neeces, and I
desire you to shew kindness to them, as they shall
need it; I do not desire you to be just, for I know
you will be so for your own sake; but I charge
you, by the Religion of our friendship, to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of them</hi> And having obtain'd Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
promise to be so, he said, <hi>I am now ready to
dye;</hi> after which words he said, <hi>Lord, grant me
mercy, for the merits of my Jesus, and now, Lord,
receive my Soul.</hi> And with those words breath'd
forth his Divine Soul, without any apparent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance,
Mr. <hi>Woodnot,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bostock,</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his last breath, and closing his eyes.</p>
                     <p>Thus he liv'd, and thus he dy'd like a Saint,
unspotted of the World, full of Alms-deeds,
full of Humility, and all the examples of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
life; which I cannot conclude better, than
with this borrowed observation:

                        </q>

                     <p>THere is a Debt justly due to the memory
of Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> vertuous Wife, a part
of which I will endeavour to pay by a very short
account of the remainder of her life, which shall
follow.</p>
                     <p>She continued his disconsolate Widow five
years, bemoaning her self, and complaining, <hi>That
she had lost the delight of her eyes;</hi> but more,
<hi>that she had lost the spiritual guide for her poor
soul;</hi> and would often say, <hi>O that I had like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Mary, <hi>the Mother of Jesus, treasur'd up all
his sayings in my heart; but since I have not
been able to do that, I will labour to live like
him, that where he now is, I may be also.</hi> And
she would often say (as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> for
his son <hi>Absolon) O that I had dyed for him.</hi>
Thus she continued mourning, till time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
had so moderated her sorrows, that she
became the happy life of Sir <hi>Robert Cook</hi> of
<hi>Higham</hi> in the County of <hi>Gloucester</hi> Knight:
And, though he put a high value on the excellent
accomplishments of her mind and body; and was
so like Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> as not to govern like a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
but as an affectionate Husband; yet, she
would even to him often take occasion to mention
the name of Mr. <hi>George Herbert,</hi> and say, <hi>That
name must live in her memory, till she put off
mortality.</hi> By Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> she had only one
Child, a Daughter, whose parts and plentiful estate
make her happy in this world, and her well using
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56222:194"/>
of them, gives a fair testimony, that she will be so
in that which is to come.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Herbert</hi> was the Wife of Sir <hi>Robert</hi>
eight years, and liv'd his Widow nine; all which
time, she took a pleasure in mentioning, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the excellencies of Mr. <hi>George Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi>
She dyed in the year <hi>1663.</hi> and lies buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Higham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> in his own Church,
under the Altar, and cover'd with a Grave-stone
without any inscription.</p>
                     <p>This Lady <hi>Cook,</hi> had preserv'd many of Mr.
<hi>Herberts</hi> private Writings, which she intended to
make publick; but they, and <hi>Higham</hi> house,
were burnt together, by the late Rebels; and by
them was also burnt or destroyed a choice Library,
which Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> had fastned with Chains, in a
sit room in <hi>Mountgomery</hi> Castle, being by him
dedicated to the succeeding <hi>Herberts,</hi> that should
become the owners of it. He dyed without an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
if <hi>Andrew Melvin</hi> dyed before him?</p>

I now return with many thanks,
and some notes, in which perhaps you will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
some care, which I forbear not in the midst
of my griefs; First for your sake; because, I
would do nothing negligently that you commit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

by Printing it, I would have you consecrate it. You
owe the Church a debt, and God hath put this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your hands (as he sent the Fish with money to
St. <hi>Peter</hi>) to discharge it: happily also with this
(as his thoughts are fruitful) intending the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his servant the Author, who being obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his own Countrey, he would have to flourish
in this land of light, and region of the Gospel,
among his chosen. It is true, there are some
things which I like not in him, as my frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will express, when you read them; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
I wish you by all means to publish
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56222:196"/>
it, for these three eminent things observable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
First, that God in the midst of Popery should
open the eyes of one to understand and express so
clearly, and excellently the intent of the Gospel in
the acceptation of Christs righteousness: (as he
sheweth through all his Considerations,) a thing
strangely buried, and darkned by the Adversaries,
and their great stumbling block. Secondly, the
great honour and reverence, which he everywhere
bears towards our dear Master and Lord; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
every Consideration almost with his holy
Name, and setting his merit forth so piously; for
which I do so love him, that were there nothing
else, I would Print it, that with it the honour of
my Lord might be published. Thirdly, the many
pious rules of ordering our life, about Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and observation of Gods Kingdom within us,
and the working thereof; of which he was a very
diligent observer. These three things are very
eminent in the Author, and overweigh the Defects
(as I conceive) towards the publishing thereof.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Dare no longer be silent, least while I
think I am modest, I wrong both my self,
and also the confidence my Friends have in
me; wherefore I will open my case unto you,
which I think deserves the reading at the
least; and it is this, I want Books extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
You know Sir, how I am now setting foot
into Divinity, to lay the platform of my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
life, and shall I then be fain alwayes
to borrow Books, and build on anothers foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation?
What Trades-man is there who will
set up without his Tools? Pardon my boldness
Sir, it is a most serious Case, nor can I write
coldly in that, wherein consisteth the making
good of my former education, of obeying that
Spirit which hath guided me hitherto, and of
atchieving my (I dare say) holy ends. This
also is aggravated, in that I apprehend what
my Friends would have been forward to say,
if I had taken ill courses, <hi>Follow your Book,
and you shall want nothing:</hi> You know Sir, it
is their ordinary speech, and now let them make
it good; for, since, I hope, I have not deceived
their expectation, let not them deceive mine:
But perhaps they will say, you are sickly, you
must not study too hard; it is true (God knows)
I am weak, yet not so, but that every day,
I may step one step towards my journies end;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56222:198"/>
and I love my friends so well, as that if all
things proved not well, I had rather the fault
should lie on me, than on them; but they will
object again, What becomes of your Annuity?
Sir, if there be any truth in me, I find it
little enough to keep me in health. You know
I was sick last Vacation, neither am I yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
so that I am fain ever and anon, to
buy somewhat tending towards my health; for
infirmities are both painful and costly. Now
this <hi>Lent</hi> I am forbid utterly to eat any Fish,
so that I am fain to dyet in my Chamber at
mine own cost; for in our publick Halls, you
know, is nothing but Fish and Whit-meats:
Out of <hi>Lent</hi> also, twice a Week, on <hi>Fridayes</hi>
and <hi>Saturdayes,</hi> I must do so, which yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I fast. Sometimes also I ride to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market,</hi>
and there lie a day or two for fresh
Air; all which tend to avoiding of costlier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if I should fall absolutely sick: I protest
and vow, I even study Thrift, and yet I am
scarce able with much ado to make one half
years allowance, shake hands with the other:
And yet if a Book of four or five Shillings
come in my way, I buy it, though I fast for
it; yea, sometimes of Ten Shillings: But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
Sir, what is that to those infinite Volumes
of Divinity, which yet every day swell, and
grow bigger. Noble Sir, pardon my bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and consider but these three things. First,
the Bulk of Divinity. Secondly, the time
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56222:198"/>
when I desire this (which is now, when I must
lay the foundation of my whole life.) Thirdly,
what I desire, and to what end, not vain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
nor to a vain end. If then, Sir,
there be any course, either by engaging my
future Annuity, or any other way, I desire
you, Sir, to be my Mediator to them in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
                  <p>Now I write to you, Sir, because to you I
have ever opened my heart; and have reason,
by the Patents of your perpetual favour to do
so still, for I am sure you love</p>

I wish I could have come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to thank you, but it is not possible; presently
after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> I am to make an Oration to the
whole University of an hour long in <hi>Latin,</hi> and my
<hi>Lincoln</hi> journey, hath set me much behind hand:
neither can I so much as go to <hi>Bugden,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
your Letter, yet have I sent it thither by a
faithful Messenger this day: I beseech you all, you
and my dear Mother and Sister to pardon me, for
my <hi>Cambridge</hi> necessities are stronger to tye me
here, than yours to <hi>London:</hi> If I could possibly
have come, none should have done my message to
Sir <hi>Fr: Nethersole</hi> for me; he and I are anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
acquaintance, and I have a strong opinion of
him, that if he can do me a courtesie, he will of
himself; yet your appearing in it, affects me
strangely. I have sent you here inclosed a Letter
from our Master in my behalf, which if you can
send to Sir <hi>Francis</hi> before his departure, it will do
well, for it expresseth the Universities inclination
to me; yet if you cannot send it with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
it is no matter, for the Gentleman needs
no incitation to love me.</p>
                  <p>The Orators place (that you may understand
what it is) is the finest place in the University,
though not the gainfullest; yet that will be about
<hi>30 l. per an.</hi> but the commodiousness is beyond
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56222:199"/>
the Revenue; for the Orator writes all the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
Letters, makes all the Orations, be it to
King, Prince, or whatever comes to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity;
to requite these pains, he takes place next
the Doctors, is at all their Assemblies and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and sits above the Proctors, is Regent or
Non-regent at his pleasure, and such like Gaynes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which will please a young man well.</p>
                  <p>I long to hear from Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> I pray Sir send
the Letter you receive from him to me as soon as
you can, that I may work the heads to my purpose.
I hope I shall get this place without all your <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
helps, of which I am very proud, not but that
I joy in your favours, but that you may see, that if
all fail, yet I am able to stand on mine own legs.
Noble Sir, I thank you for your infinite favours,
I fear only that I have omitted some fitting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
yet you will pardon my haste, which is
very great, though never so, but that I have both

and now the only thing I long for, is to
hear of my dear sick Sister; first, how her health
fares, next, whether my peace be yet made with
her concerning my unkind departure. Can I
be so happy, as to hear of both these that they
succeed well? Is it not too much for me?
Good Sir, make it plain to her, that I loved
her even in my departure, in looking to her
Son, and my charge. I suppose she is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to spend her eye-sight on a piece of paper,
or else I had wrote to her; when I shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

matter, since this place being civil may divert

back, that this dignity, hath no such earthiness in
it, but it may very well be joined with Heaven;
or if it had to others; yet to me it should not, for
ought I yet knew; and therefore I desire him to
send me a direct answer in his next Letter. I pray

                  <p>THis is my second Letter, in which though
I cannot tell you what is good, yet this
is the worst, that I must be a great part of it;
yet to me, that is recompensed, because you
must be mingled. After I knew you were
gone (for I must, little less than accusingly
tell you, I knew not you would go) I sent my
first Letter, like a <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>Hampton,</hi> to seek
Adventures. This day I came to Town, and
to the best part of it, your House; for your
memory, is a State-cloth and Presence; which
I reverence, though you be away; though I
need not seek that there, which I have about
and within me. There, though I found my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
yet any thing to which your hand is,
is a pardon; yet I would not burn my first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
because as in great destiny no small passage

must almost dye, that is, come to <hi>London,</hi> to

And such it will be, till your return redeem it:
Not that, the greatest vertue in the World,

things. To abstain from it, was therefore but
the Childhood, and Minority of your Soul,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56222:204"/>
which hath been long exercised since, in your

since I have been a witness and subject, not to
