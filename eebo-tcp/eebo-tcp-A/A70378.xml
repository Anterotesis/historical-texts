            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi> One man is a Wolf to another, hath been so truly said of old, that it hath obtained the authority of an adage; and well may it, when you see by this Text, it is Scripture-proofe. And would that were all; but man to man is both a Wolf and a Cockatrice, fulfilling the Text from the <hi>Alpha</hi> to the <hi>Omega</hi> of it; I, and all that is in the belly of it too; a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, a young Lyon, &amp;c. Yea, and more then is in the Text by farre, He is


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40992:9"/>
an Asse for sloth; <hi>Issacar is a strong asse, couching down between two burdens, Gen.</hi> 49.14. He is a Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion for lust; <hi>They are as fed horses, neighing after their neighbours wife, Ier.</hi> 5.8. He is a Fox for craft, <hi>Goe tell that Fox,</hi> meaning <hi>Herod, Luke</hi> 13.32. What not? he will piece the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons skin with the Foxes taile; that is, adde craft to strength, subtilty to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, to bring his ends, and designes about.</p>
            <p>But I must not range as in a Forrest, when I am impaled with a Text. It will be sufficient to make good, that man is what this Text puts upon him; and that we shall


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40992:9"/>
easily doe by other Texts of Scripture, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this, as <hi>face answereth face, Prov.</hi> 17.19. <hi>As iron sharpeneth iron, Proverbs</hi> 17.17.</p>
            <p>First then, man to man is a ravenous Wolf. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin is a rapacious Wolfe, Gen.</hi> 49.27. <hi>Inwardly they are ravening Wolves, Mat.</hi> 7.15. <hi>I send you as sheepe among Wolves, Mat.</hi> 10.16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, man is a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard. <hi>I saw a beast like unto a Leopard,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his <hi>Revelation</hi> 13.2. So have I ten thousand; for man is a beast. Wicked men are plain beasts; <hi>I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, after the manner


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40992:10"/>
of men,</hi> complaineth S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. Good men are too like unto beasts; <hi>So foolish was I and ignorant, even as it were a beast before thee,</hi> complaineth <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 73.22. <hi>Surely, I am more brutish then a man,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth <hi>Agur, Prov.</hi> 30.2. And also man is like unto a Leopard, in two things; a Leopard is a swift creature; <hi>Swifter then Leopards</hi>; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habbakkuks</hi> phrase, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. So is man, <hi>His feet are swift to shed blood, Rom.</hi> 3.15. A Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard is a spotted creature: so is man; spotted in himselfe, and coinquina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others, with his vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40992:10"/>
and infectious habits and customes; therefore the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the man-Leopard, not the beast-Leopard, when he asketh, <hi>Can the Leopard change his spots? Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, man is a yong Lyon, or a Lyons whelp, lurking and sculking to doe mischiefe. A wicked man is by <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 17.12. assimilated to a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whelp <hi>lurking in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places. Iudah is a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whelp, Gen.</hi> 49.9, lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one while for a prey to his lust, <hi>I pray thee let me come in unto thee,</hi> said he to <hi>Thamar,</hi> before he lay with her; and again for a prey to his cruelty;


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40992:11"/>
               <hi>Bring her forth and let her be burned,</hi> said he, after he had laine with her: in both a lurking young Lyon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, man is a Beare; as very a Beare as either of those two which came out of the wood and devoured the forty two children: <hi>As a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lyon and a ranging Beare, &amp;c. Prov.</hi> 28.15. Nay worse then a Beare: for <hi>better meet a Beare rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of her whelps, then some sort of wicked persons, Pro.</hi> 17.12.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, man is a Lyon; <hi>Lest he devoure my soule, as a Lyon,</hi> speaks <hi>David, Psa.</hi> 7.3. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse termes calleth <hi>Nero</hi>


               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:40992:11"/>
a Lyon, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. <hi>The Lord delivered mee out of the mouth of the Lyon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly, man to man is an Aspe also; one while a deafe Adder, stopping his eare to the sweet voice of the Charmer; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother while an hissing one, <hi>having the poyson of Aspes under his lips, Psal.</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>Lastly, man is a Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice, a Serpent, a Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk, biting the heele, and stinging the face, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinating with an envious eye the prosperity of his neighbour: Man, like the cup of wine in the hand of <hi>Solomons</hi> drunkard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.32. bites like a Serpent, and stings like an


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40992:12"/>
Adder; he is ever either weaving the spiders webs of vain and idle actions, or hatching the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice egs of wicked &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful actions, <hi>Es.</hi> 59.4. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third was so, while he went about to make another so; when at <hi>Venice</hi> he insulted over the Emperour <hi>Frederick Barbarossa,</hi> and setting his foot upon his neck, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the thirteenth verse of the ninety first Psalme, <hi>Thou shalt tread upon the Lyon and Adder, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see man to man, is 1. a ravenous Wolfe: 2. a swift and spotted Leopard: 3. a lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyons whelp: 4. a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and ranging Beare: 5. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Upon his understanding the character of the horse and mule, which have no understanding: upon his will, of the untamed Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: upon his eie, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinating Basilisk: upon his ear, of the deaf Adder: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his lips, of the poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Asp: upon his tongue, of the subtile Serpent: upon his reines, of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious

that they must be as sheep among wolves, that they must bee as sheepe to the slaughter, that they must bee hated of all men for his names sake, that in the world they should have tribulation, that the time should come, that in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them men should thinke they did God good service, and the like: So as no man can say, there is any breach of Covenant, or non-performance on Gods part, or that, as it is in the Proverbe, he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the one hand a piece of bread, and in the other a stone.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40992:47"/>
which was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit and hunting of the seven nocent, and harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creatures; wherein (in some sense) wee may be termed with <hi>Nimrod, mighty hunters before the Lord,</hi> so to dare to hold a Wolfe by the eares, to wash a Leopards spots, to take a Lions whelp by the beard, a Beare by the tooth, a Lion by the paw, an Adder by the sting, and to crush the eggs of a Cockatrice.</p>
            <p>The second part of the Text, now to be handled, are the parties innocent, and injuried, which are enumerated to be seven also, that so the one might hold proportion in

            <p>The first is the <hi>Lambe,</hi> a most meeke, and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse creature; therefore the phrase of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament is, <hi>a Lambe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemish, Exod.</hi> 12.5. and of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>an immaculate Lamb,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.

too; but <hi>Christ himselfe</hi> under the Gospell; <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> was said of him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29.

            <p>The second is the <hi>Kid,</hi> a most innocent creature also, second to none but the Lambe, therefore was there a positive Law, with the Jewes, both given <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. and 34. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. not to <hi>seeth the Kid in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

things at your hands?</hi> The Arians, and <hi>Arius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe suffered grievous things for their Tenets, but they were but pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domartyrs. The Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists suffered many things from the civil Magistrate, and reputed themselves Lambs and Martyrs, but S. <hi>Augustine</hi> nervously takes from them that glorious wreath.

                  <p>The rules here are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that a Sheep for the slaughter must first be a Sheep of the fold; A true Martyr must be a true member of the Church. <note n="y" place="margin">
                        <hi>Extra Ecclesiam non est Martyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Vide Baron. ad an. 362. n. 37.</note> It is a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led case, No Martyrdome without the pale of the Church. Where there is not the truth of Religion, there cannot be the truth of Martyrdome. It must not be respected <hi>what,</hi>

but <hi>who</hi> it is that suffers. He that is not a member of the body, cannot suffer for the head. If a Turk should advance Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Mahomet, or a Jew above <hi>Moses,</hi> or a Pagan above an Idol, and should suffer for so doing, were he therefore a Martyr?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, next the righteousnesse of the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> the righteousnesse of the <hi>cause</hi> is requisite; which is as necessary to remunerable suffering, as fuell to make a fire, or dough to make a cake: to suffer, that is well, but then it must be for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse sake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10. as Christians, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 16. <hi>It is not the paine, but the

Creatures, in the first Ser. and the 7. innocent in the last. There now remaines to bee spoken too in this, the third, and last gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall part, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and agreement of these most divers, yea ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse parties, the Wolfe with the Lamb, the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard with the Kid, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It was cautioned in the Law not to yoake an Oxe, and an Asse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 22.10.</note>, and the Gospell too bids us <hi>not bee une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually yoaked</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14.</note>, but what is it to bee unproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably yoaked, if this bee not? a Lamb to a Wolfe, &amp;c. And it is yet more strange, if (with <hi>Hierome, Rupertus,</hi> and others) wee


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40992:87"/>
observe that this accord is not made, by way of the retrograde motion, as Crabs swim backward; as if the Lamb should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and goe dwell with the Wolfe, or the Kid goe lye downe with the Leopard, so forsaking their owne righteousness, and taking up others vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But it is the regular, and straight course of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, the Wolfe turning Lambe, and the Leopard turning Kid; Craft and Cruelty being the termes <hi>from which,</hi> and simplicity, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency the <hi>termes to which</hi> of this Conversion.</p>
            <p>But most remarkable of all is it, to consider the


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40992:88"/>
full and perfect expression of this their reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and atonement, which is a graduall expression, growing up to the height of its <hi>emphasis</hi> by foure steps. The first is that <hi>they shall dwell together</hi>; not under one Canopie, or under one elevation of the Pole, but under one house, and roofe. And if it were no more, this wants no waight of signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy of it selfe, for <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation</hi> containes in it all the offices of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall dearnesse. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> requires no more of Husband and Wife, but that they be <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. 1 Pet. 37.</note> 
               <hi>dwellers together,</hi> or <hi>housed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as the word imports.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:40992:88"/>The second is that <hi>they lye downe together.</hi> A fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of neereness. To have one bed, is more then to be in one house; under one covering, more then to bee under one roofe. Can two <hi>walke</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether except they bee friends? is the question, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.3. but <hi>lye downe</hi> together sure they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, especially so neere, as one to keepe another warme, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p>The third is <hi>to feed, and eate together.</hi> Another degree of vicinity, and neerenesse. Therefore the Law when it separates one from close, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar accesses to another, severs <hi>à mensa,</hi> as well as


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40992:89"/>
               <hi>à thoro,</hi> both from board, and bed. <hi>Nathan</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expressing in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of <hi>Davids</hi> convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neere approaches of Wedlock, saith <hi>it did eate of his owne meate, and drank of his owne cup, and lay in his owne bosome,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3. Loe there is <hi>mensa,</hi> and <hi>thorus,</hi> board and bed together againe. And <hi>David</hi> said the like to <hi>Mephibosheth, Thou shalt eate bread at mine own table,</hi> when he would shew him the utmost of kindnesse, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.7.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, that they <hi>play and sport together.</hi> A thing so true a symbole of deerenesse, and alwaies so connate thereunto, that


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40992:89"/>
               <hi>Abimelech</hi> in the <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 26.8.</note> book of Genesis, looking out of a window, and seeing <hi>Isaac</hi> sporting with <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> concluded thereupon she was surely his Wife. Which thing also <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> in the Apocryphall <hi>Esdras</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Esd. 4.29</note> thus expresseth: <hi>I saw,</hi> saith he, <hi>Apame the Kings Concubine, the daughter of the noble Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus, sitting at the right hand of the King, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Crowne from his head, and setting it upon her owne head; shee also stroke the King with her left hand: and yet for all this the King gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth: if she laughed upon him he laughed also; but if


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40992:90"/>
she tooke any displeasure at him, the King was faine to flatter, that she might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the foure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to make up this one entire union and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. And now the way is opened for the third, and last Conclusion, which is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a disposition and temper truly Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, and savouring of Christ, to be peaceable, and reconcileable, and that in all the severall approaches of love and union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Gospel is a true cause of peace, and peace is a true


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40992:90"/>
effect of the Gospell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Messias where he is Monarchicall, and rules, is also Eirenarchicall, and atones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ Jesus is the true <hi>Augustus</hi> of the world, and the Scepter of his Kingdome as it is a <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> so is it also a <hi>peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Scepter; wheresoever &amp; whensover he is known and obeyed, there &amp; then he doth by his Word and Spirit, waste and take away all hatreds, enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and antipathies, and makes Wolves, and Lambs, Leopards, and Kids, Lyons whelps, and


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40992:91"/>
Calves, Beares, and Kine, Lyons, and Oxen, Asps, and young Children, (for thus the Text conjugates them) dwell together, lie down together, eate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and play together; that is, have friendly and mutuall entercourse of affections, actions, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, habits.</p>
            <p>Therefore is he called in his type <hi>Melchisedech, King of Salem</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 14.18.</note>, which the Apostle renders <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 7.2. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>King of peace.</hi> Therefore also <hi>Solomon</hi> was another type of him: <hi>Solomon,</hi> I say, in whose daies abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of peace flourished, not <hi>David,</hi> a man of War and blood.</p>
            <p>Therefore again was


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40992:91"/>
he born under the raigne of peaceable <hi>Augustus,</hi> who enjoyed such cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of warre, that he shut the gates of <hi>Ianus</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the world to be taxed. His natalitiall hymne was sung not by a regiment of souldiers, but by a Chore of Angels. The Dity of that hymne, or Caroll, <hi>Peace on earth.</hi> The tidings of his birth brought not to cavalliers, but to quiet and simple Shepherds: The time of the revelation of it, in the night season, a time of silence and rest.

                  <p>ANd first this point is profitable to bring forth this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that <hi>Christianity is a sociable Religion.</hi> The end of Christs comming was to be a Mediatour, not only to unite man to God, but even man to man; that


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40992:94"/>
Christians might <hi>dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>; in one house, both Ecclesiastical, the Church; and oeconomicall, the family; and Politicall, the Common-wealth; <hi>lye downe together,</hi> in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled bed of holy and chast wedlock, if they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need it, or will it; and in any other noble, and lawfull familiarities of intimacie, and deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; <hi>eate together,</hi> both the Eucharisticall Bread of the Lords Table, and the daylie bread of their owne boards. Lastly, <hi>play together,</hi> in those honest and warrantable recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are of good report among the Saints, to fit them better for


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40992:94"/>
both their generall, and particular callings.</p>
                  <p>What is the Church but a Communion of Saints? the Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Communion of Saints on earth, and the Church Triumphant, a Communion of Saints in Heaven. <hi>Coetus fidelium, A company or knot of the faithfull,</hi> is a short and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived definition of the Church. The Religion of the Jews was all for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and separation of both persons, and things; the Jew from the Gentile, the holy from the prophane, the cleane from the uncleane. But Christ did so demolish and breake downe that


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40992:95"/>
partition wall, that it is like the Picts wall in Northumberland, scarce one stone to be found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another.</p>
                  <p>Christian Society is like a Fagot, one stick keepes another glowing; like stones in an arch, one holds and fastens ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Christ himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the key-stone. Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry persons as they have (indeed) the fewest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations unto evill, so have they the fewest inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations unto good.</p>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40992:108"/>
down the Bitturn, and seazed upon it, and the Bitturne lying under, strikes his bill upward through the Hawkes gorge. The other is two pots floting upon a pond, or surface of a water with this word, <note n="p" place="margin">

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40992:109"/>
to dogges; witnesse that illustrious Temple of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, which was forty sixe years in building, but scarce as many houres in demolishing. In Warre, every man is a Gadarene, respecting a swine more then a man; witnesse <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Vespasian,</hi> who in the sacking of Jerusalem sold thirty Jews for a peny, to be a <hi>tulio</hi> to them, who had sold Christ for thirty pence. In War, old men bow themselves at the feet of their enemy, with as many teares and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as a dry brain, and a faltring tongue can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford: Women are distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted between care for the fruit of their bodies to


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40992:109"/>
preserve their children from sword, and the sin of their soules, to preserve their chastity from lust. Lastly, to say no more, in Warre, the barbarous Souldier ransacks houses, breaks open locks, rifles chests, ravisheth wives, and daughters, blunts his sword with the blood of Fathers and sons, and like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes, set on fire whole fields of corne. These and such like things have occasioned many fair and goodly Proverbs, and Apophthegmes, whereinto a great deale of wisedome is abridged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the character of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, that is now stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them: As that of

                        </gap>e</hi> it first in the severall <hi>kindes</hi> of it; secondly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the severall <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of it; thirdly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the right <hi>order</hi> and <hi>method</hi> of it; and lastly, by the surest and safest <hi>rule</hi> of it; of which foure, briefly, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>First, pursue it, I say, in the severall <hi>kindes</hi> of it, which are three; 1. Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall, or houshold peace, in all those three severall relations which doe constitute a perfect family; the Matrimoniall


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40992:113"/>
relation betwixt husband and wife; the Parentall knot, betwixt Parents and children; and the servile one, betwixt Masters and servants. Now in each of these relations, commonly the superiour is the Wolf, and Leopard, and Lyon, and the inferiour the Lamb, Kid, and Calfe, while husbands are <hi>bitter to their wives,</hi> while Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <hi>provoke their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to wrath,</hi> and whilst Masters <hi>threaten their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>; and too often by a reversed order, the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour plaies the Wolf, and superiour must be the Lamb, when there are such wives as <hi>Vashti,</hi> such children as <hi>Absolom,</hi> such


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40992:114"/>
servants as <hi>Gehezi,</hi> or <hi>Ziba</hi>; but whether of the two waies the fault hath been, let us henceforth follow peace, and let the Wolfe goe and dwell with the Lamb, and Leopard lie down with the Kid. The second is Ecclesiasticall, or Church-peace, which must be pursued too, both <hi>swiftly,</hi> and <hi>strongly.</hi> If the Shepherds have played the <hi>Lords,</hi> more then the <hi>Fathers</hi> over Gods heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; or if the flock have plaied the Church rebels rather then obedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren let them convert, and repent, and henceforth dwell &amp; lie down, &amp;c. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The third is Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or Common-wealth-peace,


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40992:114"/>
which we had need to follow too; as the King is towards the Subject in protection, and just go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, so the Subject towards the King in loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and allegiance, and Subject towards Subject in love, and concord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue it according to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>degrees</hi> of it, which are four: 1. Interior peace with a mans self, both with his <hi>affections,</hi> and with his <hi>conscience</hi>; and this is the <hi>basis,</hi> and ground of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peace, for if there be storms within, there will hardly be a calm without. 2. Exterior peace, both with beasts <hi>figurative,</hi> and beasts <hi>proper</hi>; that is, both


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40992:115"/>
betwixt man and man, and betwixt man and beast; for even that is taken in, as a branch of the covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 5.23. 3. Superiour peace with celestiall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, both betwixt <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 51</note> God and man, and betwixt <note n="d" place="margin">Ps 91.11 Mat. 4.6.</note> Angels and man. 4. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall peace, which is that sweet harmony and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent which passeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, when the Lambs and Kid shall <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e down safely, and securely in the fold of the Church Triumphant, by those who have been Wolves, and Leopards; yea, and sit downe with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the Kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must pursue


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40992:115"/>
it according to the right method and order, which is this; first <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and then peace: <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech</hi> was first King of Righteousnesse, as his name signifies, and then <hi>King of Salem, or peace,</hi> as his title imports. This is the method observed in the Nuptialls, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements of these two, <hi>Psal.</hi> 85.11. <hi>Righteousnesse and peace have kissed each other</hi>; and it is the very method of this place and Text: for <hi>ver.</hi> 5. of this Chapter, which is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate pro-text, it is prophecied, <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse shall be the girdle of his loynes, &amp;c.</hi> and then in the very next verse of all


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40992:116"/>
begins this grand Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of peace, <hi>The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, &amp;c.</hi> Internall peace without righteousnesse is but secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; externall peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, is but servitude and slavery; supernall is but presumption; and eternall is but fancy. Look to it therefore, that we doe in this work <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Goe the right way to work,</hi> lay a good foundation, and then the superstructure is like to stand.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, let peace be prosecuted, and followed, by the safest and surest rule of this pursuit: which (certainly) is that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Prov.</hi> 16.7. <hi>When a mans wayes please the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>


                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:40992:116"/>
he maketh even his enemies to bee at peace with him.</hi> Here is a short cut; <hi>Please one, and please all,</hi> as we say: for house-peace in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, where, it may be, the Mistris is a good Huswife, but of shrewish condition. To go about to work out true peace by our applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and compliances with men, is an endlesse work, and to go about <hi>by the bow,</hi> but to attain both peace <hi>with</hi> others, and peace <hi>within</hi> our selves, by this one most compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way, of being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, in the face of his son, is to go straight <hi>by the string.</hi> And now the fift and last use cals on us, to take notice of it, to wit</p>
