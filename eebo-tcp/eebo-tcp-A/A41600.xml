            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> THere being particular Duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to every State, pray tell me, What are the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Duties of Servants?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As to what concerns their Maſters, and thoſe, whom they ſerve, their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Duties are, <hi>Reſpect, Fidelity,</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What do you mean by Reſpect?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:38468:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> I mean, that Servants are to be mindful of the Command given by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13. 7. <hi>Render therefore to all their Dues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Fear to whom Fear, Honor to whom Honor.</hi> There is an Honor due to all, who have any Superiority or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over us: And Maſters being in this degree, according to the Order of God, there is an Honor or Reſpect due to them from Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How is this Reſpect to be ſhewn?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In Behavior, in Words and Actions: Servants are not to ſay or do any thing, but all ought to be temper'd with ſuch a Reſpect, as may be a perpetual Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Superiority Maſters have over them.</p>
            <p>Hence, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> Servants are not to give to their Maſters Surly or Diſreſpectful Anſwers.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly,</hi> They are not to mock them, nor by any Words, Signs or Geſtures, expreſs a Contempt of them.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> They are not to make any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with their Fellow-Servants of any Failings they apprehend or obſerve in their Maſters, and much leſs with Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> If their Maſters, &amp;c. are unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their Commands, and by Paſſionate or Abuſive Words provoke their Servants, muſt not they anſwer?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38468:4"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Advice given by S. <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 2. 9. is, <hi>Not to anſwer again,</hi> at leaſt, not to Contradict them: But if there be ſometimes reaſon to give an Anſwer, then this cannot be reprov'd, if it be done with Reſpect. I am ſenſible, how difficult this is, under ſome Provocations; but it being their Duty to be ever Reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Moderate, the Difficulty obliges them to be more Watchful in their Words, but cannot excuſe them from their Duty. Every Chriſtian is bound to ſubmit to the Difficulties of their State, and bear them with Patience. And ſince this is what particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Servants, they muſt labor with Humility and Meekneſs to bear the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their Condition. It were to be wiſh'd, that Maſters, and all in Authority, would follow the Advice of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in governing their Paſſions, and uſing Moderation with their Servants; but if Maſters are wanting to this Duty, and are unreaſonably provoking, this is no Warrant for Servants to loſe either their Reſpect, or their Patience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How are Servants to come to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this Advice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By obſerving their Maſter's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and their own. If Maſters are of a Paſſionate Temper, and grow more Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperated
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38468:5"/>
upon the leaſt Reply, there is then a neceſſity of hearing all with Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, whether the Reproof be deſerv'd or no; ſince it cannot be adviſable then to ſpeak, when it can do no Good, but only help to encreaſe the Storm.</p>
            <p>The like Silence ought to be obſerv'd, when Servants know their own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be ſuch, that however they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon being Moderate in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, yet they ſeldom begin to ſpeak, but Paſſion ſoon carries them beyond all Bounds of Moderation and Reſpect; for in this Caſe again, 'tis better to be wholly ſilent, than to make things worſe, by ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But may not there be juſt Occaſion for Servants to ſpeak, when they are unjuſtly reprov'd, or have unreaſonable things impos'd on them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There may be often ſufficient Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for ſpeaking; but it cannot be reaſonable for Servants then to ſpeak, when Maſters are not diſpos'd to hear. Whatever therefore the Occaſion be, it is much better to be ſilent for the preſent, while Paſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes the Maſter unfit to hear or judge aright, and to wait for ſome better Seaſon, when all things being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, he may be in a Diſpoſition of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doing that which is juſt.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:38468:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But don't you think it hard to be ſilent, when Servants know themſelves to be unjuſtly reprov'd, and are condemn'd for what they never did?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I have already own'd this to you; but it being a Hardſhip belonging to their State, they are bound to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for it: And if they cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they are not ſuch Chriſtians, as their Condition requires them to be. Hear from S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Advice, what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from Servants: <hi>Servants,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>be ſubject to your Maſters with all Fear, not only to the Good and Gentle, but alſo to the Froward,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 18. He expects from them, that with Patience they bear the Inconveniencies of their Maſter's Paſſion: And he gives ſufficient Encouragement, by ſhewing them, That if they do well, and ſuffering for it, take it patiently, it is acceptable to God. Here he ſuppoſes, it may be their Caſe to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer wrongfully; and inſtead of expreſſing his Compaſſion towards them, he adviſes them to ſubmit with Patience, with the Aſſurance of doing in this what is well-pleaſing to God.</p>
            <p>Here then you ſee Servants have the ſame Eucouragement to bear with the uneaſie Temper of thoſe over them, and likewiſe whatever Trouble theſe give
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38468:6"/>
them, as all other Chriſtians have to bear patiently all the Difficulties and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of Life; and this Encouragement is, that Patient Suffering is well-pleaſing to God, and that he will be their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> When again are Servants to practiſe this Silence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When by Obſervation they find thoſe, who are over them, to be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Fretful and Uneaſie Temper, which ſeldom ſeems pleas'd with any thing, and therefore ſcarce knows any other Language with Servants, beſides making Exceptions, and finding Fault.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> When again?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When they have Reaſon to believe, that the Occaſion of their Maſter being in Paſſion with them, is becauſe of ſome Trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, Misfortune or Pain, which has put him out of Humor. In theſe two Caſes, 'tis beſt for Servants to be Silent under all manner of Reproof, becauſe, tho' it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with Sharpneſs, yet they have reaſon to believe, that it is either nothing more than their common way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or that the Paſſion is not rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but only fell upon them, as they by chance came in the way: And that if they let it paſs, all will be ſoon compos'd again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:38468:6"/>
It is a common Duty of all Chriſtians to bear with the natural Imperfections of their Neighbors, and peaceably to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Mortification of their Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable or Uneaſie Temper, as there may be occaſion for it. And this Duty preſſes more particularly in regard of thoſe, who have Authority and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over us, ſo that we cannot impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently complain of their difficult Humor, without a Fault. Have not then Servants Reaſon to bear in Silence the uneaſie Temper of Maſters, ſince there is no Perſon in whatever Condition, but who is oblig'd to diſſemble many an Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs given them by thoſe, with whom they live, for the keeping of Peace; and thoſe, who have not Patience for this, how is it poſſible they ſhould eſcape being in a perpetual Fret within, and a perpetual War without? The Caſe therefore of Servants is not ſo particular in this Point, but it belongs to other States, all having this Hardſhip to bear in ſome degree or other: And this many Servants find, who changing their Condition, in hopes of being reliev'd in their preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, ſee themſelves oblig'd to another fort of Compliance, ſuch as makes them think all their paſt Uneaſineſs to have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38468:7"/>
been a Happineſs, in compariſon of what they now ſuffer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Then you recommend Silence, as a General Rule for Servants, under all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reproof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There muſt however be ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, as when a Maſter preſſes a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to give an Anſwer; for thus it may prove, that there may be as great a Direſpect in this Stubborn Silence, as there is at other times in being too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in anſwering. It may likewiſe be allow'd them, in any Reproof, to make their Plea in ſhort, by declaring the Truth; and if this be not accepted, then to ſubmit in Silence and Patience, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than juſtifie themſelves by Paſſion. It cannot likewiſe be diſapprov'd in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſpeak, when they can do it in a Reſpectful manner, and Maſters ſeem eaſie in the Liberty they take.</p>
            <p>All therefore that I diſcourage here in Servants, is only ſuch Speaking, ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and ſuch Anſwers, as are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their Condition; but having ſomething of Diſreſpect in them, are to be condemn'd as Offences againſt the General Duty of their State. And this being a Duty, which God has impos'd on them, they are bound to comply with it, as they deſire to be his Servants. If it be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38468:7"/>
troubleſome, it is a Trouble, which may be overcome by watchful Endeavors; their own Intereſt obliges them to take Pains in this Victory, that they may have Peace here, and hereafter.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> What does S. <hi>Paul</hi> teach Servants in theſe Words?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He teaches them ſeveral things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they ought to look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the Servants of God. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That in whatever Service they perform, they are to endeavor, not only to pleaſe the Eye of Men, but do all with that Care, as to pleaſe the Eye of God. 3<hi>dly,</hi> That the Motive in all they do, ought to be, to comply with the Will of God. 4<hi>thly,</hi> That the Comfort of all their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors is to be; that the moſt difficult La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors are due to God; that God will be the Recompence of whatever is done faithfully, who has no Reſpect of Perſons, but will reward the Servant, according to his Works, as well as the Maſter.</p>
            <p>Now if Servants are to do all things, not as pleaſing the Eye of Men, but as pleaſing God; it is very plain, that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are not only to be Careful and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in what they do, when their Maſter's Eye is to examin their Work; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when they have no Eye over them, to commend their Diligence, or reprove their Neglect: Becauſe the Work they undertake is their Duty, and ought to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38468:8"/>
done for Duty ſake, and becauſe God always ſees them. This is the Fidelity belonging to Servants, as to this Point, and is the Meaning of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, when he bids them do all, not with <hi>Eye-Service, as pleaſing Men, but as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, and doing the Will of God from the Heart.</hi> And if they follow his Direction, they may be ſure, beſides the Yearly Wages from their Maſter, they will have God to reward them.</p>
            <p>Whence 'tis very evident, thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are wanting to their Duty, and commit a Sin, who are then only care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when they have an Eye over them, or know what they do will be ſeen; but in other Circumſtances, when they have no Witneſs, and apprehend no Reproof of their Neglect, do their Work careleſly, or leave it undone; for theſe are only Eye-Servants, they forget that they are the Servants of God, and inſtead of a Reward, will find him the Puniſher of their Neglect.</p>

            <head>SECT. III. Of Fidelity, in managing what is entruſted with them.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> HOW are Servants to ſatisfie the other part of Fidelity, which is that, Of managing with Care, whatever is entruſted with them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They ſatisfie this, by being ſo Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Juſt in all they undertake, that their Maſter be not a Loſer in any Way, thro' their Fault.</p>
            <p>By this then Servants are oblig'd, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To be ſo careful of whatever Goods are under their Charge, that they be not injur'd, loſt or ſtoln, by their Sloth or Neglect. You know how many things require the Care of Servants, as in all belonging to Furniture, Cloaths, to Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking, &amp;c. Without this due Care, ſome of them are very much prejudiced, others become wholly Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and the Maſters are often great Sufferers, by Servants not being diligent in what they undertake, and is their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are oblig'd to ſee, there be no Waſte of any thing under their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38468:9"/>
Charge, but muſt manage all with as much Care and Frugality, as if it were their own. I need not here mention Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; they, who know what belongs to a Family, know likewiſe, there is ſcarce any thing in it, but what is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Waſte; and that tho' the Concern ſeems not much, yet at the Years end 'tis a great Expence to the Maſter, if in the Uſe and Care of every thing, there be not that due Management in Servants, which is neceſſary to prevent the Waſte of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They are oblig'd to ſee, that nothing under their Care be miſ-ſpent, broken or loſt. And they are to reckon all that miſ-ſpent, which is not employ'd according to their Order, whom they ſerve. Whence it cannot be allow'd them, either to give away, or to treat Companions or Friends, with what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to their Maſter, any further, than they have his Order, or have ſufficient Reaſon to preſume of his Conſent. And as they are not to do this themſelves, ſo neither are they to give Opportunity to others of doing it, thro' their Neglect, by careleſly leaving the Keys of things under their Charge, in publick, or by letting Doors or Boxes be open, which they ought to keep lockt. For whatever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38468:10"/>
comes thus to be taken away, muſt be charg'd to them, as occaſion'd by their Neglect. Tho' all Servants are, in ſome degree or other, concern'd in this, yet none more than Apprentices, who have the Care of a Shop left to them; and therefore, if theſe, by Careleſneſs, or by talking with Companions, or by leaving the Shop, are the Occaſion of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter being defrauded or robb'd, they muſt anſwer for the Wrong done; ſince the Care of Goods being entruſted with them, 'tis the ſame thing to the Maſter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be robb'd by his own Servants, or by ſuch as are invited and encourag'd by their Careleſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They are oblig'd to be juſt in all Accompts of Money; ſo as neither to take Money from thoſe, whom they ſerve, nor ſet down to their Accompt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, than has been laid out by their Order. In this they ought to be very Juſt, notwithſtanding the faireſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of defrauding the Maſter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Poſſibility of his coming to the Knowledge of it. As they are not to wrong him, by taking Money, ſo neither by keeping what is his in their Hands, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him: And therefore nothing of this can be done, without an evident Injuſtice, which tho' hid from Man, is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38468:10"/>
known to God, and will be ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh'd by him, even more than common Theft, ſince the Truſt repos'd in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants makes their Crime worſe than that of Robbers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They are oblig'd to be Juſt, in whatever Money they lay out for their Maſter, and never to make ſuch Bargains, in which they themſelves may be Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by their Maſter's Loſs. They muſt not therefore, by the Encouragement of Bribes, be perſwaded, either to give more for what they Buy, or take leſs for what they Sell, than they would do, were the Concern altogether their own. They muſt not Buy at a Shop, which allows them ſomething for their Cuſtom, when they might buy either better Goods, or better Cheap at another Place, which gives no ſuch Encouragement. If by their Induſtry or Art, they have made a better Bargain in Buying or Selling, than their Maſter expects, the Advan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tage is to be their Maſter's, and not their own: If he will reward them for it, he may; but they muſt not reward themſelves, by either ſetting down more than what the thing coſt, in Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or reſerve any part to themſelves of the Price receiv'd in Selling.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:38468:11"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are Servants then to have no Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for being Induſtrious?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This muſt depend wholly on the Maſter: And if he ſhould be ſo hard, as not to give them ſo much as good Words for what they do in his Service, yet ſtill they are to be Induſtrious in all they do for him, to the beſt of their Skill and Power. The reaſon is, becauſe 'tis their Duty to be Faithful in their Service; this God requires of them, and it is to be done for his and their own ſake, tho' the Maſter may ſeem not to deſerve it: For they are to <hi>do their Service with good Will, as to the Lord, and not as to Men.</hi> Whence thoſe Servants have a great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to give, who being put out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor by the undue or ſevere Reproofs of their Maſter, are, upon this, Careleſs in his Service, neglect their Duty, and matter not how much they miſ-ſpend his Money, or waſte his Goods. For in this they are wanting in that Fidelity, which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of them, and is therefore due, not only to the Gentle and Meek, who give Encouragement, and ſeem to deſerve it, but likewiſe to thoſe of the moſt Harſh and Froward Temper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> In relation to what you have ſaid above, pray tell me: May not Servants take any thing, which is uſually given by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38468:11"/>
thoſe Shopkeepers, where they are Cuſtomers all the Year?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If ſuch Shopkeepers rate their Goods accordingly, and make the Maſter pay what they are to give to their Servants, it is not then fair dealing on either ſide. But if Servants are Induſtrious to examin the Price of things, and do not keep to a Shop, but where things are as Good, and at as low a Rate, as they can buy any where elſe; then I ſee no Reaſon, but they may take what is given them. But this is a Point, in which Servants ought to be very Jealous of themſelves; becauſe in the Buſineſs of Money, every one is apt to judge too favorably of what is for their own Intereſt: And therefore if they do not often try the Price of things at other Places, I fear the Hopes of their own Gain will leſſen their Induſtry, and make them pay in their Maſter's Wrong.</p>

            <head>SECT. IV. Of Obedience due to Maſters.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> VVHat is the Obedience Servants owe their Maſters?</p>
            <p>A. S. Paul <hi>declares this Duty,</hi> Coloſ. <hi>3. 22.</hi> Servants, obey in all things your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, according to the Fleſh; not with Eye-Service, as pleaſing Men, but in Singleneſs of Heart, fearing God. And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to Men; knowing, that of the Lord you ſhall receive the Reward of the Inheritance: For you ſerve the Lord Chriſt. But he that does Wrong, ſhall receive the Wrong he has done; for with God there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee the full Duty of Servants, as to this Point: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is an exact Obedience due from Servants to Maſters, in all that is not Sinful. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That this ought not to be done, upon the Motive of Human Reſpect, of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, Flattery or Intereſt, but Sincerely, in Submiſſion to the Order of God. 3<hi>dly,</hi> That they are to conſider the Authority of God in him, whom they ſerve. 4<hi>thly,</hi> That they are not to regard the Failings,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38468:12"/>
Weakneſſes, or Ill Humors of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt, whom they ſerve in him, and by whoſe Authority he commands. 5<hi>thly,</hi> That whatever they do upon Command, they be mindful to do it, in Obedience to God, and in ſuch a manner, as to hope for a Recompence from him. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That if the Maſter deals unjuſtly with them, they are to deſire no Revenge, but remit their Cauſe to God, who will puniſh Injuſtice, whether in Maſter or Servant, without Diſtinction of Perſons.</p>
            <p>In this Direction given by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſhews, what is to be the Obedience of Servants, you may obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Servants offend God by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying their Maſters, and by ſo doing, are guilty of Sin. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That if they grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and expreſs an Unwillingneſs to comply with their Maſter's Commands, they fall ſhort of what S. <hi>Paul</hi> requires of them, which is, To do their Service <hi>with Good Will.</hi> 3<hi>dly,</hi> If they do not what he commands, heartily, and as ſerving God, notwithſtanding all the Moroſe and Peeviſh Humors, to which he may be ſubject, they wrong their own Souls, and cannot expect the Reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to thoſe, who do all their Service <hi>heartily, as to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:38468:13"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is there no Exception in this Obedience due to Maſter? What if they require that of Servants, which they never undertook, and in Reality belongs not to them to do?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Where this is evidently the Caſe, it is a good Plea for an Exception. But there cannot eaſily be Evidence in this, becauſe the Work of Servants is ſeldom ſo ſtrictly limitted; for whatever the Buſineſs be, for which they are taken, yet 'tis generally ſuppos'd, they ſhould be ready to ſet their Hand to any thing elſe, if thro' any Accident, it be requir'd of them. And therefore I cannot but fear, when Servants make this the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for not doing what they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, it is generally the Effect of their own Sloth or Ill Humor, which take up this Argument to cover them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But will not Servants ſoon be impos'd on, who except againſt nothing, that is requir'd of them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is poſſible they may, but this can be only from very ill-natur'd People: For certainly with all others, there is nothing can more recommend Servants, and make them more valuable, than when they are of a free Diſpoſition, and ever ready to put their Hand to any thing, as Occaſion may require, tho' it be not what properly belongs to their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38468:13"/>
Place: This has ſomething generous in it, and cannot fail of gaining the Eſteem and Love of thoſe, whom they ſerve. And as for thoſe Servants, who are more Formal and Ceremonious, ſo as to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten making Exceptions, and queſtioning, <hi>Whether doing ſuch and ſuch things belongs to their Place?</hi> 'Tis certain, tho' they may thus endeavor to prevent what they call <hi>being impos'd on,</hi> yet that they are Loſers by this exceſſive Nicety, by thus draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on themſelves the Diſlike of thoſe over them, who can never judge them fit for their Service, ſince the Buſineſs of a Family, in the many Accidents, to which it is ſubject, can never allow of this Confin'd and Formal Temper, and there is nothing more diſturbs the Peace of a Family, and makes Quarrels amongſt Servants, than the Ceremonies of one ſuch Nice one, who is ſo fearful of going beyond his Bounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Well, but if a Servant be commanded to do, what in it ſelf is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful and Sinful, muſt he obey?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No; in this Caſe, God is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd, who forbids it, and not Man. Hence if a Maſter is ſo ill a Chriſtian, as to require what is evidently Sinful; the Servant is not only bound to venture his Diſpleaſure, but likewiſe the Loſs of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38468:14"/>
his Place, rather than comply with ſuch Commands; and if the Fear of ſuch a Loſs prevails on him to act againſt his Conſcience, he may be aſſur'd, he in ſo doing, forſakes God for Man, and can be no Diſciple of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What if the thing requir'd of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant be not in it ſelf evil, and yet ſo, as to be concurring and aiding in ſomething that is Sinful? There are many ſinful Intriegues, which cannot be manag'd, without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Aſſiſtance of the Servant. A like Concurrence is neceſſary in Frauds and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. A like in Drunkenneſs, &amp;c. Can a Servant concurr in theſe, in Obedience to thoſe, whom he ſerves?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, he cannot do it, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of the Sin, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs, that is, if he does it with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his concurring to what is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. He that keeps Watch, while the Houſe is robb'd, is guilty of the Robbery. He that carries Meſſages, or conveys Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for the accompliſhing a Wickedneſs, and knows what he does, is guilty of whatever Crime it be, to which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concurrs. And I cannot but think, that he, who carries Drink to his Maſter, when he knows, 'tis to make him Drunk, might, with as much color of Innocence, fetch Poyſon for one, who ſeems reſolv'd o drink it.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:38468:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> If the Maſter commands not what is directly Sinful, and yet hinders the Servant from complying with ſuch Duties, which he thinks himſelf in Conſcience oblig'd to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; is this ſufficient Reaſon for the Servant to diſpence with ſuch Duties, or is he oblig'd to quit the Service?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Some kinds of Duties, as of Prayer, going to Church, &amp;c. may be ſometimes diſpenc'd with, in Compliance with a Maſter, and rather than diſturb the Peace of a Family: But if the Circumſtances of the Family, or the Buſineſs of it, or the Perverſe Humor of the Maſter be ſuch, as generally not to allow the Servant Liberty of performing ſuch Duties, which in Conſcience he is oblig'd to ſatisfie; then the Servant is bound to quit ſuch a Place, and ſeek another, where he may have Opportunity for ſatisfying his Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But if he has a great Advantage where he is, and cannot change, but with very conſiderable Loſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He is ſtill bound to ſeek another Place, becauſe the Advantage of this World is not lawful, when it is to the Loſs of the next. Servants, as well as others, are bound, in the firſt place, to ſeek the Kingdom of God; and, if they ſtay in ſuch a Place, where they cannot
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38468:15"/>
ſeek the Kingdom of God, by ſerving him, as they know they are oblig'd, they offend againſt this Command of Chriſt, by neglecting the Kingdom of God, for the Convenience or Intereſt of this World. Upon which Conſideration, I think all Servants, in the Choice of a Place, ought not only to have Regard to the Wages, but likewiſe (and that more principally) to the Convenience of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of God, in being free from ill Company, in living in Chriſtian Diſciplin, and having the Opportunity of ſerving God according to Conſcience. And, as for thoſe, who take not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conſideration, but for an inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Intereſt put their Salvation to the hazard, 'tis a ſign, their Concern for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is not great; and then how little can their Hopes be of coming to the Promiſes made to thoſe, who ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I apprehend now, how far Obedience goes: But pray tell me; may not there be a Fault in Servants, in doing more than they are Commanded?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There may ſometimes, by out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Maſter's Orders; but the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſe is in thoſe Servants, who, having the Care of Children, quite outgo their Commiſſion, in taking upon them to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38468:15"/>
correct them, without Orders for it, and ever treating the Children, according as they themſelves are out of Humor; ſo that if they happen to be chid, the Children muſt certainly be beaten for it. This is not Obedience, but Uſurpation, and ſuch as Servants cannot anſwer; I confeſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward Children may ſeem to want ſuch Correction; and Servants may try all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways to bring them into better Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but they muſt not endeavor it by beating them, except they have expreſs Order for it; and even then ought to be very careful, there be no Paſſion, in what they do.</p>
            <p>As giving Correction is generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Commiſſion; ſo frighting Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is much more ſo, and therefore not to be done on any account. Thoſe, who know the Miſchiefs caus'd in Children by Frights, muſt be Barbarous, if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it; and ſuch as do it, without thinking of the Miſchief, betray their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, or want of Experience, and ſhew themſelves unfit for the Charge they have undertaken.</p>

            <head>SECT. V. Of Duties to Fellow Servants.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> THeſe are the Principal Duties of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to thoſe, who are over them; but are there not other Duties or Rules to be obſerv'd to Companions or Fellow-Servants?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There are; and they are ſuch, that if they are not carefully obſerv'd, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould be good Servants, or ſatisfie thoſe Duties they owe their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Which are theſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Firſt is that of being <hi>Mild</hi> and <hi>Moderate</hi> both in Words and Actions; this is neceſſary for living in peace with Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servants; becauſe ſome are ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Paſſion, that a moroſe or harſh word is enough to raiſe it, and occaſion a Quarrel. This Moderation is with the more reaſon expected from Servants to their Companions, becauſe they know how diſagreeable and uneaſie it is to them to be treated with harſhneſs by thoſe, whom they ſerve; and having often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of feeling this in themſelves, one would think it ſhould make them very careful, in not giving a like uneaſineſs to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38468:16"/>
their Companions. And hence their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reflection is very ſurprizing, who knowing not how to take a haſty word from thoſe, who are over them, without Reſentments and Complaints of their ill Humor, upon the leaſt occaſion are ſo Snappiſh and Moroſe to their Fellow-Servants, as if none had any Senſe of Ill Uſage, beſides themſelves.</p>
            <p>This is a Point I preſs to the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Servants, for their Common Peace; for that living under the ſame Roof, they are bound to maintain a ſtricter Bond of Charity with their Fellow-Members of the ſame Body, than with Strangers, and therefore ought to be very careful in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all that, which may give any diſturbance, or cauſe uneaſineſs in their Companions. For this end they ought to be ever mindful of doing, as they would be done by, and not treat them in ſuch a manner, as they themſelves cannot bear with Patience even from their Maſters. With greater reaſon then they ought to govern their Paſſions, and not take the liberty of abuſing their Fellow-Servants with ill Language, or reproachful Names, becauſe this is ſtill more provoking, and being the ready way to breed Contention, is directly contrary to that Charity, which the Goſpel demands of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:38468:17"/>
A Second Duty, is that of having Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with one another, and mutually bearing with one another's Infirmities. For tho' there would not be much need of this, if the former Rule were ſtrictly obſerv'd; yet ſince it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that ſome may be wanting in the Duty there preſcrib'd, and inſtead of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all with that Moderation and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as is requir'd, may give Provocations and great Uneaſineſs to their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; hence there is a neceſſity, that all Servants ſhould learn to have Patience, and bear with one another. The General Reaſon for this is, becauſe without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Rule, there can be no poſſibility of preſerving that Peace and Charity, which are neceſſary in a Chriſtian Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And this Peace is ſo valuable, both as to the Public, and in reſpect of every Particular Perſon, that it is very well worth all that Patience, that can be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for maintaining it; and thoſe, who will not be at the trouble of it, ſhall certainly be at more trouble for want of it.</p>
            <p>Such therefore, as will not take any Croſs, Peeviſh or Snappiſh Word from their Fellow-Servants, without returning it again in the ſame Language of Ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or Paſſion, have neither the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38468:17"/>
of this World, or the next, becauſe they will be generally engag'd in Quarrels, and ſeldom be ſo peaceable within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to be in a diſpoſition of ſerving God.</p>
            <p>Where-ever there is but a moderate degree of Prudence, it will teach Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for their own Quiet, to bear with others. It will oblige them to Reflect, that as they themſelves are ſometimes out of Humor, ſo may others be ſo too: That, as they deſire others ſhould bear with them, ſo they ought to take their turn, and bear with others: That great Allowances are to be given to every Body, as to their Particular Humor or Way: That they are not to expect every one to follow the Rule they preſcribe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and judge beſt: That the Peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others may be the Effect of ſome Indiſpoſition of Body or Mind, which they would willingly Remedy, but know not how: That it may be a greater Trouble to themſelves, than to others, whom they provoke: That to be Angry at ſuch their Weakneſs, is no more reaſonable, than to be Angry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they Stammer or Squint. So far Common Prudence will direct them; and if they have any Principles of Charity or the Goſpel, it will teach them not only this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38468:18"/>
Patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but likewiſe to bear with the Provocations of Ill-will and Malice, to return Good for Evil, to pray for and love their Enemies. And therefore it muſt be concluded, that thoſe Servants, who will not patiently bear with the ill Humors or Provocations given them by their Companions, but make returns of them, and improve every little Occaſion into a Contention or Quarrel, have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Reaſon, which belongs to them, as Men, nor the Virtue, which belongs to them, as Chriſtians. <hi>To give no Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> then is one Part of their Duty, and <hi>to take no Notice of ſuch, as are given,</hi> is the other: One Part without the other makes but a Lame Chriſtian: Peace and Charity cannot be preſerv'd without both.</p>

            <head>SECT. VI. Other Duties to Fellow-ſervants.</head>
            <p>THere are ſtill other Rules of Duties for Servants; as never to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or diſſwade any Fellow-Servant from being Diligent in his Duty, or from doing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38468:18"/>
any Service, which he is willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. This is but too Common a Method made uſe of by ſome, for covering their own Careleſs, Slothful or Exceptious Humor. They know, it will Reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, if others appear more Punctual in their Service, or more Ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their Maſter's Orders, than they; and therefore to cut off all ſuch Arguments, they endeavor to bring their Companions, and eſpecially New-comers, to their own pitch of Idleneſs. Now by this Means, 'tis true, they may be never reproach'd with their Companions Extraordinary Care; but they take a moſt unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way, ſince 'tis by Corrupting their Fellow-Servants, and preparing them to become the Object of their Maſter's diſlike. If they ſhould purpoſely Infect them with a Diſtemper, and by this make them unfit for their Place, it would not be more Prejudicial to them, or more Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in it ſelf, than what they do by this Treacherous Artifice.</p>
            <p>Again, Servants are to be careful, not to give ill Example to their Companions, nor to put them upon doing any thing that may be Prejudicial to thoſe, whom they ſerve, or diſpleaſing to God. Upon this Principle, they are to decline all Prophane and irreligious Expreſſions, is of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38468:19"/>
Oaths, Curſing, Swearing, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are of Ill Example, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Sin, are as a Leſſon to others, to do the like. They are to avoid all ſorts of Immodeſt and Filthy Expreſſions, Relations, Diſcourſes or Songs, becauſe theſe are directly Sinful, and have a Mark ſet upon them by the Apoſtle, as things not to be nam'd amongſt Chriſtians. They are not purpoſely to uſe any ſuch Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which, having a Double Meaning, may be taken in an ill Senſe; for tho' this may be intended only for Mirth, yet 'tis Jeſting with Poyſon, and may as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring Death to the Soul, as if it were deſign'd to Kill. They are not to uſe with their Companions any ſuch Freedom of Words or Actions, which are the Effects of Lightneſs and Corruption, and carry with them the evident danger of Sin; and as for all beyond this, 'tis ſo notoriouſly Criminal, that it needs no Caution here. They are not to carry their Companions into ill Company, or ſuch Houſes, where they are in danger of being drawn into Exceſs. They are not to invite or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade their Fellow-Servants to ſuch Divertiſements, Games or Entertainments, which are forbid by the Maſter, or may be the Occaſion of keeping ill Hours.</p>
            <p>They are not to turn Informers againſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38468:19"/>
their Companions, (except, in ſuch Caſes, where Juſtice or Charity oblige them to it.) And if they carry Stories to their Maſters, puſh'd on by a Secret Malice or Ill-will againſt any, they in this Offend againſt Charity, and not only injure their Neighbor, but do a much greater Injury to their own Souls, by making God their Enemy, and incurring the Guilt of ſuch a Sin, which cannot be forgiven, but by making Reſtitution for whatever wrong they have done. This is a Point, in which thoſe Servants are very much concern'd, who having the Ear of their Maſter or Miſtreſs, are in the daily Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of falling into this Sin. And the Temptation is ſo great, whether by their own Itch of Talking, or by the Hopes of Recommending themſelves; or by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their indiſcreet Curioſity, who ſeem deſirous of Hearing all that paſſes in their Family, that if they have not a great Command of themſelves, and as great Diſcretion in Diſtinguiſhing what is fit to be told, and what not, they will every Day Offend againſt Charity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and by theſe Sins make Void what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Good they otherwiſe do in Order to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Theſe Rules ought to be obſerv'd with Care by all ſuch Servants, as deſire
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38468:20"/>
to ſatisfie their Duty to God and Man. And where there is not this Care, it can be no wonder, if ſuch Servants fall into remarkable Diſorders, and are judg'd by all that know them, as unfit for a well Diſciplin'd Family.</p>

            <head>SECT. VII. Duties of Servants in regard of themſelves.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> THere is one Principal Queſtion yet to come; and that is; What are the Duties of Servants in Regard of themſelves?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> One Duty is that of Prayer: For this being a Means appointed by God, by which Chriſtians are to obtain ſuch Graces and Bleſſings, as they daily want, it muſt be as neceſſary for Servants, as for any other Rank; and the Neglect of it can be eſteem'd no leſs, than withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves from the Protection of Heaven, and Robbing their own Souls of thoſe Helps, which are neceſſary for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Faithful Servants, and Good Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How can they perform this Duty, who have ſo little time to themſelves, and being
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38468:20"/>
generally tir'd, are fitter for Sleep than Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Let them but make the beſt uſe of what Time they have, and God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly accept it, as he did the Widows Mite, when ſhe had no more to give. It cannot be expected they ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy as much Time in Prayer, as thoſe, who have their Hours at Command: But if they make their Buſineſs the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of their Sloth, and upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, Neglect their Duty to God; when if they were more Careful and Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they might find Time for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, they will have God the Judge of their Inſincerity and Sloth in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to whom it is known, however they may hide it from all others.</p>
            <p>All Services are not ſo hard as to allow no Time for Prayer: And if all thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who make this their Excuſe, would Examin themſelves, and ſee how much Time they find every Day for Unneceſſary Sleeping, Curious Gazing, Idle Talking, &amp;c. they might ſoon diſcover, that 'tis not Exceſs of Buſineſs, but want of Good-Will, is the general Occaſion of their not finding Time to Pray: And that a little more Reſolution, with better Management, would help them to all the Time, that could be neceſſary for this Duty. Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38468:21"/>
therefore theſe with the Advice of being more Induſtrious, I turn to ſuch, who are really ſo ſtreightn'd in Time, that they cannot find Opportunity to Pray. And to theſe I give the following Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they endeavor to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in ſaying ſome ſhort Prayer in the Morning, Offering themſelves to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God for the following Day, and to be preſerv'd from all Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That, if by any Accident, they are hinder'd in this, they be careful to ſupply it, by raiſing up their Hearts to God, even when they are at Work, and earneſtly begging the ſame Protection of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That often in the Day they would turn their Thoughts towards God, and Speak to him from their Hearts, with this Aſſurance, that if they could ſay no more, than ſuch ſhort Sentences as theſe; <hi>Lord have Mercy on me: O God be Merciful to me a Sinner: Jeſus, forgive me my Sins: O God, thy Will be done in me: O God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend me from all Evil: O God, be thou my Comfort and my Strength: O God, Save my Soul,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch ſhort Prayers ſaid from the Heart, might find as good acceptance with God, as the longer Devotions of theſe, who have more Time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:38468:21"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That they would Offer up all the Work they do, to God, Beginning it in his Name, and Ending it to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For ſince all their Labors are to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Duties of their State, and this is what God requires of them, they may Offer up to him every Work as done in Compliance with his Will, and thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Advice, in <hi>Doing their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with Good-Will as to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That ſince God himſelf enjoin'd Labor on <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity for the Puniſhment of Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. they would Submit to all their Labors, as to the Execution of this Sentence pronounc'd by God againſt Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That as often as they find diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in any part of their Duty, as in Riſing in the Morning, or in hard Work, or in doing ſuch things, to which they have a diſlike, or in complying with Humors or Submitting to Paſſions, &amp;c. they would conſider, it is God s Will it ſhould be ſo; that it is the Puniſhment God has ſet upon Sin, and upon theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of ſatisfying the Will and Juſtice of God, perſwade themſelves to a ready Compliance, and make Nature bend to that, to which it is moſt averſe.</p>
            <p>If theſe Rules be obſerv'd, no Servant need complain for want of Time to Pray,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38468:22"/>
for that by this way, all they do will be Prayer, and become a proper Means for obtaining the Divine Grace, and whatever other Helps they want of God.</p>
            <p>Only let them Remember to add this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the former; Of daily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to Practice Patience, Humility and Meekneſs, amidſt the many Trials and Provocations they meet with in their State. They cannot fail of meeting ſome every Day, either from thoſe, whom they ſerve, or from their Companions; and if under theſe Trials, they would be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Humble themſelves, to ſuppreſs all Impatience, to avoid Contentions, and receive both the Troubles and Difficulties of their Place, as from the Hand of God, this Practice of Humility, Patience and Self-denial, would ſupply all the want of Prayer, and ſet them on forward in their Way to Heaven, above any thing elſe they can poſſibly do.</p>
            <p>This I moſt earneſtly recommend to Servants, becauſe the great Art of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is for all Chriſtians to practice thoſe Virtues, which particularly ſeem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their State, and to Advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven in that way, in which God ſeems to call them. Now as the Rich are to do this by Hoſpitality and Alms-giving; Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men by being true
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38468:22"/>
to the Duties of their Function; Parents by the Care of their Eſtate, Children and Family; the Afflicted and Sick by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to their Trouble and Pain; ſo Servants are to do this by bearing the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their State, by Patiently, Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Meekly accepting all the Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; ſo that, if they cannot Pray, give Alms, &amp;c. like others, they have ſtill a way to Heaven, as direct as any others; and there can be no Miſcarriage, but becauſe they will not walk in the way belonging to their State, and in which God calls them to him.</p>

         <div n="8" type="section">
            <head>SECT. VIII. Other Duties of Servants in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of themſelves.</head>
            <p>VVHen Servants have learnt the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of theſe Rules, their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in the Knowledge of God, and in the Senſe of Eternity, will find them daily more Time for Prayer: But eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on <hi>Sundays</hi> and Holy-days, when having ſome Reſt from their uſual Labors, they will be Careful to take the Advantage of ſuch leiſure, by turning their Thoughts to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38468:23"/>
God, and employing ſome Time in Prayer, and the Buſineſs of Eternity.</p>
            <p>This is certainly one Duty of Servants, as well as of others, to ſanctifie the Lord's Day as far as their Circumſtances will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, by the Worſhip of God, by Prayer, and by carrying on the Work of their Salvation. And becauſe neither Prayer, nor any part of the great Affair of the Soul can be well perform'd, without due Inſtruction in the Chriſtian Doctrin, therefore all thoſe Servants, who think in earneſt of providing for Eternity, make this one Buſineſs of <hi>Sundays</hi> and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, to be well Inſtructed in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſtian Doctrin. This they do, by conſtantly Reading ſuch Books, as are proper for this End, and by Hearing thoſe, who are willing to teach them. And if they cannot Read themſelves, they deſire this Charity of others to Read to them, take all Opportunities of hearing Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and follow ſuch as are willing to give them.</p>
            <p>The Inſtruction, I here ſpeak of, is not to be confin'd to Catechiſms, but extends to all thoſe Books, which teach the Practice of a Chriſtian Life. The Difficulties, and Temptations, and Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which Servants, as well as others, muſt meet with, oblige them to Read
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38468:23"/>
and Hear ſuch Books or Inſtructions, that by them their Hearts may be rais'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, be quicken'd in his Service, and be inſpir'd with new Reſolutions of Fighting againſt their own Paſſions and Sin, and carefully avoiding all the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who are not Conſtant in thus converſing with Good Books, Neglect their own Souls; and tho' they are never ſo well Inſtructed, yet if by Reading, they do not Revive what they know, their Knowledge is not likely to bring forth much Fruit, but will be ſmother'd by the continual Buſineſs, Snares and Diſſipations of Life, ſo as to be in danger of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly uſeleſs in them.</p>
            <p>Hence it muſt be reckon'd a Fault in Servants on <hi>Sundays</hi> and Holy-days, to Neglect Reading, or Hearing others Read, what may be for their Inſtruction; and as for ſuch, who, at that time, Contrive purpoſely to be out of the way, to be Sleeping, Converſing, or running Abroad, rather than be employ'd in the manner, as the Day requires, and is for their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Good, there needs no other Mark to fear the Worſt of them; for as thoſe Branches, which receive no Nouriſhment from the Root, muſt certainly Wither and Die; ſo thoſe Chriſtians muſt be in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38468:24"/>
way of a Spiritual Death, who make it a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to deny themſelves that Nouriſhment which is Neceſſary for the Life of the Soul. Thoſe, then, who are ſubject to this ill Cuſtom, thro' Sloth or Neglect, muſt not wonder, if their Ignorance be great, if their Paſſions be violent, if they are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Virtue, if they are Fond of what is Idle and Vicious; for how can it poſſibly be otherwiſe, ſince they are careleſs in making uſe of thoſe Means, by which Knowledge, Strength and Grace, is to be Communicated to them?</p>
         </div>
         <div n="9" type="section">
            <head>SECT. IX. More Duties of Servants in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of themſelves.</head>
            <p>THere is ſtill another General Duty they owe themſelves, and that is, to be watchful againſt all Corruption and Sin, and more eſpecially againſt that, to which they find their Nature moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd; whether it be Swearing, Lying, Back-biting, Quarrelling, filthy Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unbecoming Familiarities, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe it be, by which God is Offended: For ſince they know, there is no place in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38468:24"/>
Heaven for ſuch Sins, theſe muſt either be Amended, or elſe they muſt conclude themſelves to live in the Diſpleaſure of God, and then how vain is the Hope of coming to the Poſſeſſion of him? This Work is not to be effected, but by Labor, in which they are never to be tir'd; and they, who Work ſo hard for Bread, and a Poor Salary, are not to wonder, if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is to Coſt them ſome Pains.</p>
            <p>But one Principal part in this Work conſiſts in avoiding the Occaſions of Evil, by declining their Converſation, who are the Encouragers or Promoters of what is Sinful in them; and if it cannot be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declin'd in a Family, they are at leaſt ſo to manage their part, as neither to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to, nor Concurr in any thing, that is Offenſive to God.</p>
            <p>If any Fellow-Servants are ſubject to Murmur againſt thoſe, who are over them, or againſt the Abſent: If any are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to Contentions; if any to Spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Whiſperings, or Malicious Suggeſtions; if any to Immoderate Songs or Diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; the others, who are preſent, are not, any ways, to encourage or approve ſuch Sinful Converſation; they are not to ſhew themſelves pleas'd with it; but are bound to expreſs their diſlike of it, either by leaving the Company, or condemning their Diſcourſe upon the Spot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:38468:25"/>
There can be nothing more neceſſary for ſo doing, but a Good Will, and a Good Reſolution; for tho' there may be greater difficulty in regard of their Betters; yet when all are Equals, any one may take that Liberty, as to reprove whatever is publickly Sinful in the reſt; nay, this is ſo much the Duty of every one Preſent, that to ſit ſtill in Silence, while God is publickly Offended, and our Neighbor juſtly Scandalized, is no leſs than concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Sin, and the Silent Hearers are as guilty as the Speakers. I cannot tell, how Chriſtians can do otherwiſe, than is here preſcrib'd, and yet excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as Innocent; for, I believe, God will admit of no Excuſe; it being Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for one, who has a Zeal for God's Honor, or his Law, to ſit ſtill a Silent Witneſs of Companions ſcandalouſly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him, and let them go on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reproof; for ſuch are certainly Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and not the Servants of God, who can ſtand thus and ſee his Cauſe betray'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Reproof will be an Encouragement, and no Check, to ſome, who deſire nothing more, than to Vex their Companions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If a Reproof be given in earneſt, and Threats added, if neceſſary, of Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Scandals, by informing thoſe, to whom it belongs, a better effect might
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38468:25"/>
be expected. But if upon ſufficient Trial, there be no Amendment; the Caſe may be ſuch, as to oblige a Servant, to ſeek Remedy by changing Place.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>When?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When it carries with it the danger of Sin; as in a Cuſtom of Immodeſt Jeſting, Filthy Diſcourſe, or too much Freedom in Action: For the danger of Sin is ſo great here, that if expreſſing in good earneſt a diſlike of it has no Effect, there is a neceſſity of informing thoſe, who have more Authority; and if there be no Care taken to reform it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving thoſe, who give the Scandal, I know of no other Expedient, but quitting the Place; ſince no Servant can ſatisfie a good Conſcience if they abide in a Place, where they are daily in danger of being drawn into Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What think you then of thoſe Servants, who being in Public Houſes, muſt hear all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Lewdneſs, and are daily expos'd to the Abuſes of every Wicked and Drunken Gueſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I think they take no Care of their Souls, and by loving danger, are likely to Periſh in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are there ſtill any farther Duties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Head?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is one more, which is that of making a good uſe of leiſure Hours,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38468:26"/>
by all that, which is Sinful or Dangerous. I except not againſt Innocent Mirth at any time, when it is no hindrance to their Duty, nor againſt Innocent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation at Times allow'd them: But Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is ſo general, and the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idle Hours ſo great, that if Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are not very Cautious, they may be eaſily drawn into variety of Snares.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Snare is in Converſation, which is ſubject to many Evils already mention'd; as to Back-biting the Abſent, Murmuring againſt Superiors, Immodeſt Songs, Immodeſt Stories or Diſcourſe, and to Freedoms, which are of the worſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Thoſe, who are not Reſolute in avoiding the Evils of this Snare, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Home or Abroad, but give En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to them, either directly, or by too much eaſineſs in complying, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Good Chriſtians, and are in the way to Ruin; and this much more, if they are for ſingling out thoſe, whoſe Principles are not Good, and ſeem Fond of Corner-converſation.</p>
            <p>Another Snare is in Divertiſements or Entertainments; and under this Head I bring all thoſe Incoveniencies, to which great numbers are expos'd, eſpecially Clerks of the Law, and Apprentices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe, who ſhutting up Shop early, and being
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38468:26"/>
not tied to the ſtrict Diſciplin of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have ſome Hours, every Night, to diſpoſe of. And here how many the Miſchiefs are, let it be reckon'd, not by Imaginary Fears, but by Example: By the Example of thoſe, who affecting a Genteel Air, have found Company to be Early Fops, and have been made ſo Airy, as never more to be Serious enough for Buſineſs: By the Example of thoſe, who being drawn into Gaming, have been ſoon Bubbled out of all their Stock, and by defrauding their Maſter, have kept up the Credit of their Broken For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: By the Example of thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engag'd in Clubs, have been Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with all that is Lewd and Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: By the Example of thoſe, who being charm'd with Wit, have been taught to laugh at all that is Sacred: By the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of thoſe, who Fond of Muſic, and Balls, could never more Reliſh the dull Buſineſs of the Desk or the Shop.</p>
            <p>Let the number be taken of thoſe, who being ſurpriz'd in this Snare, have prov'd the Affliction of their Parents, the Scandal of their Church, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of Youth, and then it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, of how great Conſequence it is, that all of this Rank ſhould be careful in the better uſe of their leiſure Hours;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38468:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſince of the vaſt number, that become loſt to all that is Honorable and Good, I believe there is ſcarce One in Ten, but what muſt derive his Ruin from the want of this Care. And while the Proof of this Miſchief is ſo great, be no leſs than the Preſumption or Madneſs for Apprentices, &amp;c. to put themſelves in the way of this General Ruin, by abuſing their leiſure Time, and to pretend there is no danger in it.</p>
            <p>I think I need add no more on this or any other Head, but having given theſe hints to Servants, of the Duties of their State, and of the Difficulties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, I leave them with this Encouragement; That tho' their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be but Mean, and their Life Difficult, yet they are as capable of Salvation, as any other State of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: Let them but be Faithful in their Duties to God, and to thoſe whom they ſerve, and be watchful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Corruption of Sin, and they will find God their Eternal Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, who without reſpect of Perſons is the Reward of all that are Good, whether Bond or Free.</p>
