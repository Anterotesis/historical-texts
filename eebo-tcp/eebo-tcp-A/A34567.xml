            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Trevers</hi> his Caſtles of <hi>Rochfords</hi> Towne neere <hi>Corke,</hi> was the rendevouz of the Lord of <hi>Muskery,</hi> and for all the prime Gentlemen that were Rebels in the Werſtern parts, which they termed the Catholike Camp, and fortified it by the directions of old Colonell <hi>Garret Barry,</hi> who with the Lord of <hi>Muskery</hi> was a little before retyred to <hi>Kinſale,</hi> which unhappy Town is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted and given up unto them.

            <p>The eleventh of this Month, <hi>Muskery</hi> employed a ſtrong party of men to take the prey that was under the walls of <hi>Cork,</hi> whereof they being poſſeſſed, and the Lord Preſident being ſick within the walls; the Lord of <hi>Inſequine,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Vaviſor,</hi> the one with the horſe, and the other

with the foot, ſallyed out, but the nimble foot kerns got ſuch a ſtart of them, as our foot were not able to overtake them; whereupon the horſe galloped after them, and entertained them in fight till our foot recovered up, who with great courage ſet upon them, recovered the prey, and killed ſo many of them as they could ſerve upon; for the bog that was neere them; With which good ſucceſſe they being fleſhed, they reſolved in their return to attempt their beſt upon the Fortification and Caſtle of <hi>Rochfords</hi> Town; Whereunto they gave a great and fierce aſſault, and Captaine <hi>Seogave,</hi> Maſter <hi>Finunis</hi> Brother having chiefe command there, made a ſtrong defence, ſo long as his Powder laſted, (for thanks be to God, with that commodity they are ſparingly furniſhed) which is a great part of our happineſſe: But in in the end our mens courage overcame all oppoſion; So as they entred and gave them <hi>Condons</hi> quarter at <hi>Coole,</hi> for they killed their Captain, and all the reſt that were in it, being about foure hundred, except three Pipers, whom they cauſed to play before their Captaines head, which they brought upon a Pole to <hi>Cork,</hi> and there they were put out of tune and their muſick ended, for they were all hanged up; They found in the Caſtle very good booty and proviſion, and amongſt the reſt, choice Armor of the Lord of <hi>Muskeries,</hi> M. <hi>Carty Teaghe,</hi> and <hi>Swallirant;</hi> and all the choyce of them are retired into their ſevetal Countries, expecting to bee ſupplied with Powder by ſome ſhipping to come into the Weſt, and have left the Lord <hi>Roach</hi> in great diſcontent and diſtreſſe to ſhelter himſelfe, in an open Champion Countrey, where I hope we ſhall give him work enough.
