         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>GEntlemen</hi> and <hi>Yeomen,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
not that I writ this Pamphlet
in Prose now, hauing before times
set forth so many Bookes in verse;
The First Reason that mooued me to write
thus, was because I was Lame, and durst
not write Verses for feare they should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with my Griefe, &amp; be lame too. The
Second Reason is, because that I finde no
good rime for a <hi>Coach</hi> but <hi>Broach, Roach
Encroach,</hi> or such like: And you knowe
that the <hi>Coach</hi> hath ouer-throwne the good
<pb facs="tcp:2128:3"/>
vse of the <hi>Broach</hi> &amp; Broch-turner, turning
the one to <hi>Rackes</hi> and the other to <hi>Iackes,</hi>
quite through the Kingdome: The <hi>Roach</hi>
is a drie Fish, much like the vnprofitable
profit of a <hi>Coach:</hi> It will cost more the dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and Appurtnances then 'tis worth: For
the word <hi>Encroach</hi> I thinke that best befits
it, for I think neuer such an impudent, prowd
sawcie Intruder or Encroacher came into
the world as a <hi>Coach</hi> is: for it hath driuen
many honest Families out of their Houses,
many Knights to Beggers, Corporations to
pouerty, Almes deedes to all misdeedes, Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality
to extortion, Plenty to famine, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
to pride, Compassion to oppression, and
all Earthly goodnes almost to an vtter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
            <p>These haue beene the causes why I writ
this Booke in Prose, and Dedicated it to all
your good Companies, knowing that you
haue borne a heauy share in the Calamitie
which these hyred Hackney hell-Carts haue
<pb facs="tcp:2128:3"/>

my whole Discourse, I doe not enueigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any <hi>Coaches</hi> that belong to Persons
of worth or qualitie, but onely against the
Catterpiller swarme of hyrelings; they haue

Member, and though I looke for no reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet I expect the benefit of an old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe
(<hi>Giue the loosers leaue to speake:</hi>)
I haue Imbroadered it with mirth, Quilted
it with materiall stuffe, Lac'd it with simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes;
Sowed it with comparisons, and in
a word, so playd the Taylor with it, that I
thinke it will fitte the wearing of any honest

Children: well, I will buy this volume of nuention

some of these Bookes very shrewd Items; yea, and
<pb facs="tcp:2128:5"/>
by your leaue, somewhat is found in them now and
then, which the wisest of vs all may be the better for:
though you call them Pamphlets, to tell you true, I
like em better that are plaine and merrily written to
a good intent, then those who are purposely stuffed
and studyed, to deceiue the world, &amp; vndo a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
That tells vs of Proiects beyond the Moone, of
Golden Mines, of Deuices to make the <hi>Thames</hi> run

be done, by remouing <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Banke-side</hi>) of

me see, as I take it, it is an inuectiue against <hi>Coaches,</hi>
or a proofe or tryall of the Antiquitie of <hi>Carts</hi> and
<hi>Coaches,</hi> Tis so, and Gods blessing light on his heart
that wrote it, for I thinke neuer since <hi>Phaeton</hi> brake

molestation then this hath, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual rumbling
of these vpstart 4. wheel'd Tortoyses, as you may
perhaps find anone: For as concerning the Antiquity
of the <hi>Cart,</hi> I think it beyond the limmits of Record
or writing, Besides, it hath a Reference or allusion to
the Motion of the <hi>Heauens,</hi> which turnes vpon the
<hi>Equinoctiall</hi> Axeltree, the two wheeles being the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke</hi>
and <hi>Antarticke</hi> Poles. Moreouer, though it be
Poetically feygned, that the <hi>Sunne</hi> (whom I could
haue called <hi>Phoebus, Tytan, Apollo, Soll,</hi> or <hi>Hiperion</hi>)
is drawne by his foure hot and headstrong <hi>Horses</hi>
(whose names as I take it are) <hi>Aeolus, Aethon, Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
and <hi>Pyrois,</hi> Yet doe I not finde that Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
Refulgent extinguisher of darknes is <hi>Coach'd,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2128:5"/>
but that he is continually <hi>Carted</hi> through the twelue
signes of the <hi>Zodiaque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if <hi>Copernicus</hi> his opinion were to be allowed,
that the Firmament with the <hi>Orbs</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi> did
stand vnmoueable, and that onely the Terrestriall
Globe turnes round daily according to the motion
of <hi>Time,</hi> yet could the World haue no resemblance
of a foure-wheel'd <hi>Coach;</hi> but in all reason it must
whirle round vpon but One Axeltree, like a two
wheeld <hi>Cart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can the searching eye, or most admirable Art
of Astronomie, euer yet finde, that a <hi>Coach</hi> could
attaine to that high exaltation of honour, as to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the Firmament: It is apparently seene, that
<hi>Charles</hi> his <hi>Cart</hi> (which we by custome call <hi>Charles</hi>
his <hi>Waine</hi>) is most gloriously stellifide, where in
the large Circumserence of Heauen, it is a most vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
&amp; beneficiall Sea-marke (and somtimes a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke
too) guiding and directing in the right way,
such as trauaile on <hi>Neptunes</hi> waylesse Bosome, and
many which are often benighted in wilde and desert
passages, as my selfe can witnesse vpon <hi>Newmarket</hi>
heath, where if that good <hi>Waine</hi> had not <hi>Carted</hi> me
to my Lodging, I &amp; my Horse might haue wandred
I know not whither.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, as <hi>Man</hi> is the most noblest of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and all foure-footed <hi>Beasts</hi> are ordayned for
his vse and seruice; so a <hi>Cart</hi> is the Embleme of a
<hi>Man,</hi> and a <hi>Coach</hi> is the Figure of a <hi>Beast;</hi> For as
Man hath two legges, a <hi>Cart</hi> hath two wheeles: The
<hi>Coach</hi> being (in the like sense) the true resemblance
<pb facs="tcp:2128:6"/>
of a <hi>Beast,</hi> by which is Parabollically demonstrated
vnto vs, that as much as <hi>Men</hi> are superior to <hi>Beasts,</hi>
so much are honest and needfull <hi>Carts</hi> more nobly to
be regarded and esteemed, aboue needlesse, vpstart,
fantasticall, and Time-troubling <hi>Coaches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as necessities and things whose commodious
vses cannot be wanted, are to be respected before
Toyes and trifles (whose beginning is Folly, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
Pride, and whose end is Ruine) I say as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
is to be preferred before superfluity, so is the
<hi>Cart</hi> before the <hi>Coach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For Stones, Timber, Corne,
Wine, Beere, or any thing that wants life, there is a
necessity they should be caried, because they are
dead things and cannot goe on foot, which necessity
the honest <hi>Cart</hi> doth supply: But the <hi>Coach</hi> like a
superfluous Bable, or an vncharitable Mizer, doth
sildome or neuer cary or help any dead or helplesse
thing; but on the contrary it helps those that can help
themselues (like <hi>Scoggin</hi> when he greazd the fat <hi>Sow</hi>
on the Butt-end) and carries men and women, who
are able to goe or run; <hi>Ergo</hi> the <hi>Cart</hi> is necessary, and
the <hi>Coach</hi> superfluous.</p>
            <p>Besides, I am verily perswaded, that the proudest
Coxcombe that euer was iolted in a <hi>Coach,</hi> will not
be so impudent but will confesse that humility is to
be preferred before pride; which being granted, note
the affability and lowlines of the <hi>Cart,</hi> and the pride
and insoleney of the <hi>Coach,</hi> For the <hi>Carman</hi> humbly
paces it on foot, as his Beast doth, whilst the <hi>Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Cloath and Colours as are in the <hi>Rainebowe,</hi> like a
Motion or Pageant rides in state, &amp; loades the poore
Beast, which the <hi>Carman</hi> doth not; and if the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
horse be melancholly or dull with hard and
heauy labour, then will he like a kinde Piper whistle
him a fit of mirth, to any tune from aboue <hi>Eela</hi> to
belowe <hi>Gammoth,</hi> of which generosity and courtesie
your <hi>Coachman</hi> is altogether ignorant, for he neuer
whistles, but all his musicke is to rap out an oath, or
blurt out a curse against his <hi>Teame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>Carmen</hi> (as I finde it in the <hi>Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>)
doth signifie a Verse, or a Song, and betwixt
<hi>Carmen</hi> and Carmen, there is some good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie,
for Versing, Singing, and Whistling, are all
three Musicall, besides the <hi>Carthorse</hi> is a more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>If Adultery or Fornication bee committed in a
<hi>Coach,</hi> it may be grauely and discreetely punished
in a <hi>Cart,</hi> for as by this meanes the <hi>Coach</hi> may be a
running Bawdy-house of abhomination, so the <hi>Cart</hi>
may, (and often is) the sober, modest, and ciuill

            <p>It was a time of famous memorable misery, when
the <hi>Danes</hi> had tyrannicall insulting domination in

that he must Plowe, Sowe, Reape, Thrash

Winnow, Grinde, Sift, Leauen, Knead, and Bake,

sleepe, play, and eate the fruit of the English mans
labour; which well may be alluded to the carefull

I'le assure you it eates more (though it drinkes lesse)
then the Coachman and his whole Teeme, it hath
a mouth gaping on each side like a monster, with
which they haue swallowed all the good housekee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in <hi>England:</hi> It lately (like a most insatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
beast) did eate vp a Knight, a neighbour of
mine, in the County of N. a Wood of aboue 400.
Akers, as if it had beene but a bunch of Radish: of
another, it deuoured a whole Castle, as it had beene
a Marchpane; scarcely allowing the Knight and his
Lady halfe a colde shoulder of Mutton to their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
on a Thursday night; out of which reuersion
the Coachman and the Footeman could picke but
hungry Vailes: in another place (passing through
a Parke) it could not be content to eate vp all the
<hi>Deere,</hi> and other grazing Cattell, but it bit vp all the
<hi>Oakes</hi> that stoode bareheaded, there to doe homage
to their Lord and Maister euer since the conquest,
crushing their olde sides as easily as one of our fine
Dames (with a poysoned breath) will snap a Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

eate a Pippin Tart, or swallow a stewed Pruine.</p>

Chauncell, Steeple, Bells and all, and it threatens a

hungry it is, that it will scarcely endure, in a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

to turne a Spit; nor a Yeomans sonne to enter the

            <p>Whence comes Leather to be so deare, but by
reason (or as I should say against reason) of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

Boores for my selfe vnder an Angell, nor my Wife

the shame and obloquy of our owne.</p>
            <p>The Saddlers (being an ancient, a worthy and a
vsefull Company) they haue almost ouerthrowne
the whole trade, to the vndoing of many honest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;
For whereas within our memories, our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry would tide well mounted (and
sometimes walke on foot) gallantly attended with
three or foure score braue fellowes in blew coates,
which was a glory to our Nation; and gaue more
content to the beholders, then forty of your Leather
Tumbrels: Then men preseru'd their bodies strong
and able by walking, riding, and other manly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises:
then Sadlers were a good Trade, and the name
of a Coach was Heathen-Greeke. Who euer saw
(but vpon extraordinary occasions) Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> Sir <hi>William

with the renowned <hi>George</hi> Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> or
<hi>Robert</hi> Eatle of <hi>Essex:</hi> These sonnes of <hi>Mars,</hi> who
in their times were the glorious Brooches of our
Nation, and an admirable terrour to our Enemies:
these I say did make small vse of Coaches, and there
<pb facs="tcp:2128:9"/>
were two maine reasons for it, the one was that
there were but few Coaches in most of their times:
and the second reason is, they were deadly foes to
all sloath and effeminacie: The like was Sir <hi>Francis
Vere,</hi> with thousands others: but what should I
talke further? this is the ratling, rowling, rumbling
age, and <hi>The World runnes on Wheeles.</hi> The Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-men
who were wont to haue furnished Trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in all places, with fitting and seruiceable Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for any iourney, (by the multitude of Coaches)
are vndone by the dozens, and the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
most abhominably Iaded, that in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
a man had as good to ride vpon a wodden Post,
as to Post it vpon one of those poore hunger-staru'd
hirelings: which enormity can be imputed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but the Coaches intrusion, is the Hackney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
confusion.</p>
            <p>Nor haue we poore Watermen the least cause to
complaine against this infernall swarme of Trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spillers,
who like the <hi>Grashoppers</hi> or <hi>Caterpillers</hi> of
<hi>Egipt</hi> haue so ouer-runne the land, that we can get
no liuing vpon the water; for I dare truly affirme
that euery day in any Tearme (especially if the
Court be at <hi>Whitehall</hi>) they do rob vs of our liuings,
and carry 560. fares daily from vs, which numbers
of passengers were wont to supply our necessities,
and enable vs sufficiently with meanes to doe our
Prince and Countrey seruice: and all the whole fry
of our famous Whores, whose ancient Lodgings
were neere S. <hi>Katherines,</hi> the Bankside, <hi>Lambeth-Marsh,
Westminster, White Friers, Coleharbar,</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:2128:9"/>
any other place neere the <hi>Thames,</hi> who were wont
after they had any good Trading, or reasonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
in, to take a Boate and ayre themselues vpon
the water, yea (and by your leaue) be very liberall
to, and I say as a Mercer said once, A Whores mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is as good as a Ladies, and a Bawdes as current
as a Midwiues: Tush those times are past, and our
Hackney <hi>Coaches</hi> haue hurried all our Hackney cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers
quite out of our reach towards the North
parts of the Citie, where they are daily practised in
the Coach, that by often iolting they may the better
endure the Cart vpon any occasion, and indeede
many times a hired Coachman with a basket hilted
blade hang'd or executed about his shoulders in a
belt, (with a cloake of some py<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

maintaining a Sir Pandarus or an Apple-squire,
which seruice indeede to speake the truth, a Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is altogether vnfit for; and the worst is, most of
them are such Loggerheads, that they either will not
learne, but as I thinke would scorne to be taught: so
that if the Sculler had not bene paide when hee was
paide, it is to be doubted that he should neuer haue
beene paide, for the Coachman hath gotten all the
custome from the Scullers pay-Mistris.</p>
            <p>This is one apparent reason, why all the Whores
haue forsaken vs, and spend their Cash so free and
frequent vpon those ingenious, well practiz'd, and
seruiceable hired Coachmen: but (a Pox take em

all) whither doth my wits runne after Whores and
Knaues? I pray you but note the streetes, and the
chambers or lodgings in <hi>Fleet streete,</hi> or the <hi>Strand,</hi>
how they are pesterd with them, especially after a
Masque or a Play at the Court, where euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
earth quakes and trembles, the Cazements shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
tatter and clatter, and such a confused noyse
is made, as if all the deuils in hell were at Barly-breake;
so that a man can neither sleepe, speake,
heare, write, or eate his dinner or supper quiet for
them: besides, their tumbling din (like a counterfeit
Thunder) doth sowre Wine, Ale and Beere most
abhominably, to the impairing of their healths that
drinke it, and the making of many a Victualer and
Tapster Trade-falne.</p>
            <p>A Wheelewright or a maker of Carts, is an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
a profitable, and a Trade, which by no meanes
can be wanted; yet so poore it is, that scarce the best
amongst them can hardly euer attaine to better then
a Calueskin sute, or a piece of neck Beefe &amp; Carret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rootes
to dinner on a Sunday; nor scarcely any of
them is euer mounted to any Office aboue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of a Scauenger, or a Tything man at the most.
On the contrary, your Coachmakers trade is the
most gainefullest about the Towne, they are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
in Sattens and Veluets, are Maister of their
Parish, Vestry men, who fare like the Emperours
<hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> or <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> seldom without their

in the Countrey: neither are these Coaches onely
thus cumbersome by their Rumbling and Rutting,
as they are by their standing still, and damming vp
the streetes and lanes, as the <hi>Blacke Friers,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other places can witnesse, and against Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
dores the streetes are so pesterd and clogg'd
with them, that neither Man, Horse, or Cart can
passe for them; in so much as my Lord <hi>Maior</hi> is
highly to be commended for his care in this restraint,
sending in February last many of them to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for their carelesnesse herein.</p>
            <p>They haue beene the vniuersall decay of almost
all the best Ash Trees in the Kingdome, for a young
plant can no soouer peepe vp to any perfection, but
presently it is felled for the Coach: Nor a young
Horse bred of any beauty or goodnesse, but he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
from his foaling for the seruice of the Coach;
so that whereas in former ages, both in peace and
warres, we might compare with any Nation in the
world for the multitude and goodnes of our Horses:
wee now thinke of no other imployment for them,
then to draw in a Coach, and when they are either
lamed by the negligence of the Coachman, or worne
out after many yeares with trotting to Playes and
Bawdy houses, then are they (like olde maymed
Souldiers) after their wounds and scarres, preferd to
Woodmongers, (where they are well Billited) or to
Draymen, where they turne Tapsters, and draw
Beere by whole Barrels, and Hogsheads at once;
and there they weare out the Remainder of their

The last Proclamations concerning the Retiring of

what they get by cheating, swearing, and lying at

shame; I did lately write a Pamphlet called a <hi>Thiefe,</hi>
wherein I did a little touch vpon this point; that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Heard of Hireling Coaches are more then the

so excessiue decre, that it were good the order
in <hi>Bohemia</hi> were obserued here, which is, that euery

if the Couer and Bootes of them were of good

would be knowne from a Princes, a Noble mans,

            <p>And if it be but considered in the right <hi>Kue,</hi> a
Coach or Carroach are meere Engines of Pride,
(which no man can denie to be one of the seauen
deadly sinnes) for two Leash of Oyster-wiues hired
a Coach on a Thursday after Whitsontide, to carie
them to the greene-Goose Faire at <hi>Stratford</hi> the

began to swell with a proud supposition or
Imaginary greatnesse, and gaue all their money to
the mendicanting Canters; insomuch that they were
feigne to pawne their Gownes and Smocks the next

them Cry for want of what to Cry withall.</p>
            <p>Thus much I can speake by experience; I doe

know that I doe hate pride, as I hate famine or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting;
and moreouer, I know my selfe to be (at the

yet it was but my chance once to be brought from

was ready to burst with the winde Chollick of vaine

my selfe better then my betters that went on foote,
and that I was but little inferiour to <hi>Tamberlaine,</hi>
being iolted thus in state by those pampered Iades of
<hi>Belgia:</hi> all men of indifferent iudgement will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that a Cart is an instrument conformable to
law, order, and discipline; for it rests on the Sabaoth
dayes, and commonly all other Holy dayes, and if it
should by any meanes breake or transgresse against
any of these good Iniunctions, there are Informers

may maintaine life, and then they remoue to a fresh
place doing the like; thus wearing out their accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
liues like the broode of <hi>Caine,</hi> they and their
houses being perpetuall vagabonds, and continuall
runnagates vpon the face of the earth. They are so
practized and inured in all kinde of Barbarisme, that
they will milke one Mare and let another blood, and
the blood and the milke they will <hi>Charne</hi> together
<pb facs="tcp:2128:13"/>
in their Hats or Caps, till they haue made fresh
Cheese and Creame (which the deuill will scarce
eate) from these people our Coaches had first origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and I doe wish with all my heart that the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
number of all our hireling Hackney carrie-Knaues
and <hi>Hurrie-Whores,</hi> with their makers and
maintainers were there, where they might neuer
want continuall imployment.</p>
            <p>For their Antiquity in <hi>England,</hi> I thinke it is in the
memory of many men when in the whole Kingdome,
there was not one, and there was another principall
vertue, as good as themselues came with them: for
the Prouerbe saith, That mischiefe or mischances
seldome come alone: and it is a doubtfull question,
whether the deuill brought <hi>Tobacco</hi> into <hi>England</hi> in
a <hi>Coach,</hi> or else brought a <hi>Coach</hi> in a fogge or mist
of <hi>Tobacco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in the yeare 1564. one <hi>William B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ouen</hi> a
Dutchman brought first the vse of Coaches hither,
and the said <hi>Boonen</hi> was Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
for indeede a <hi>Coach</hi> was a strange Monster in
those dayes, and the fight of them put both horse
and man into amazement: some said it was a great
Crab-shell brought out of <hi>China,</hi> and some imagin'd
it to be one of the Pagan Temples, in which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals
adored the deuill: but at last all those doubts
were cleared, and Coach-making became a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Trade: So that now all the world may see,
they are as common as Whores, and may be hired as
easie as Knights of the Post.</p>
            <p>The Cart is an open transparent Engine, that any
<pb facs="tcp:2128:13"/>
man may perceiue the plaine honesty of it; there is
no part of it within or without, but it is in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
view of all men: On the contrary, the Coach is
a close hipocrite, for it hath a couer for any Knauery,
and Curtaines to vaile or shadow any wickednesse:
besides, like a perpetuall Cheater, it weares two
Bootes and no Spurres, sometimes hauing two paire
of legges in one Boote, and often times (against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
most preposterously it makes faire Ladies
weare the Boote; and if you note, they are carried
backe to backe, like people surpriz'd by Pyrates, to
be tyed in that miserable manner, and throwne ouer
boord into the Sea. Moreouer, it makes people imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Sea Crabs, in being drawne side-wayes, as they
are when they sit in the boote of the Coach, and it
is a dangerous kinde of Carriage for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
if it be rightly considered; for when a man
shall be a Iustice of the Peace, a Serieant, or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour
at Law; what hope is it that all or many of
them should vse vpright dealing, that haue beene so
often in their youth, and daily in their maturer or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
age, drawne aside continually in a <hi>Coach,</hi> some
to the right hand, and some to the left, for vse makes
perfectnesse, and often going aside willingly makes
men forget to goe vpright naturally.</p>
            <p>The order of Knighthood is both of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and very honourable, yet within these later
times there is a strange mysterie crept into in, for I
haue noted it that when a Gentleman hath the sword
laid vpon his shoulder, either by his Prince, or his
Deputy or Generall in the field, although the blow
<pb facs="tcp:2128:14"/>
with the sword, be an honour to the man, yet (by a
kinde of inspiration) it cripples his wife, though she
be at that time 300. miles from her husband, for if
you but note her, you shall see her lamed for euer,
so that shee can by no meanes goe without leading
vnder the arme, or else shee must be carried in a
Coach all her life time after; forgetting in a manner
to goe on her feete so much as to Church, though it
bee but two Quoytes cast; for I haue heard of a
Gentlewoman that was lamed in this manner, who
sent her man to Smithfield from Charing-Crosse, to
hire a Coach to carrie her to Whitehall; another
did the like from Ludgate hill, to be carried to see a
Play at the Blacke Friers: And in former times
when they vsed to walke on foote, and recreate
themselues, they were both strong and healthfull;
now all their exercise is priuately to Sawe Billets,
to hang in a Swinge, or to rowle the great Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in the Alleyes of their Garden, but to goe
without leading, or Riding in a Coach is such an
impeachment and derogation to their Calling,
which flesh and blood can by no meanes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
            <p>Euery man knowes, that were it not for the <hi>Cart</hi>
the Hay would Rot in the medowes, the Corne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in the fields, the Markets be emptily furnished,
at the Courts remoue the King would bee vnseru'd,
and many a Gallant would bee enforced to bee his
owne Sumpter-horse to carrie his luggage, bag and
baggage himselfe; and finally, were it not for the
mannerly and courteous seruice of the <hi>Cart,</hi> many a
<pb facs="tcp:2128:14"/>
well deseruing ill condition'd braue fellow might
goe on foote to the gallowes.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Cart</hi> (by the iudgement of an honourable and
graue Lawyer) is elder brother to a <hi>Coach</hi> for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
and for vtility and profit, all the world knows
which is which, yet so vnnaturall and vnmannerly a
brother the <hi>Coach</hi> is, that it will giue no way to the
<hi>Cart,</hi> but with pride, contempt bitter curses and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations,
the Coachman wishes all the Carts on
fire, or at the diuell, and that Carmen were all
hang'd, when they cannot passe at their pleasures,
quite forgetting themselues to be sawcy vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
intruders, vp starts, and Innouators.</p>
            <p>When I see a Coach put vp into a house (mee
thinkes) the pole standing stiffely erected, it lookes
like the Image of <hi>Priapus,</hi> whom the libidinous and
leacherous Whores and Knaues of <hi>Egypt</hi> were wont
to fall downe and worship; and I pray you what
hinderance hath it but it may vse the <hi>Paphean</hi> or
<hi>Priapean</hi> game? for it is neuer vnfurnished of a bed
and curtaines, with shop windowes of leather to
buckle Bawdry vp as close in the midst of the street,
as it were in the Stewes, or a Nunnery of <hi>Venus</hi>
Votaries.</p>
            <p>What excessiue waste doe they make of our best
broad-cloath of all colours? and many times a young
heire will put his old Fathers old Coach in a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Gowne of Cloth or Cotton, when many of the
poore distressed members of Christ, goes naked,
staruing with cold, not hauing any thing to hide
their wretched carkasses; and what spoyle of our
<pb facs="tcp:2128:15"/>
Veluets, Damaskes, Taffataes, Siluer and Gold
Lace, with Fringes of all sorts, and how much consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in guilding, wherein is spent no small quantity
of our best and finest gold: nor is the charge little
of maintaining a <hi>Coach</hi> in reparation, for the very
mending of the Harnesse, a Knights Coachman
brought in a bill to his Master of 25. pounds: besides
there is vsed more care &amp; diligence in matching the
Horses and Mares, then many fathers and mothers
doe in the marriage of their sonnes and daughters:
for many times a rich lubberly Clowne, the sonne
of some gowty extortioner, or rent-racking Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
(for his accursed muckes sake) may bee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with a beatifull or propper well qualified and
nobly descended Gentlewoman, and a well fac'd
handsome Esquire or Knights sonne and heire may
be ioyn'd with a Ioyners puppet, or the daughter of
a Sexton; but for the choyce of your Coach-horses
there is another manner of prouidence to be vsed, for
they must be al of a colour, longitude, latitude, Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde,
height, length, thicknesse, breadth, (I muse
they doe not weigh them in a paire of Ballance) and
being once matched with a great deale of care and
cost, if one of them chance to die (as by experience
I know a Horse to bee a mortall beast) then is the
Coach like a maimed cripple, not able to trauell, till
after much diligent search, a meete mate be found
whose correspondency may be as equiualent to the
suruiuing Palfrey, and in all respects as like as a
Broome to a Bee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The mischiefes that haue beene done by them are
not to be numbred, as breaking of legges and armes,
ouerthrowing downe hills, ouer bridges. running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
children, lame and old people, as <hi>Henrie</hi> the
fourth of <hi>France,</hi> (the father to the King that now

tricke, he was some few yeares after his first
escape, most inhumanely and traiterously murdred
in one, by <hi>Rauiliacke,</hi> in the streets at <hi>Paris:</hi> but what
neede I runne my inuention out of breath into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
countreys for examples, when many of the
chiefe Nobilitie and Gentrie of our owne Nation
haue had some triall and sad experience of the truth
of what I write? sometimes the Coachman (it may be
hath bin drunk, or to speake more mannerly stolne a
Manchet out of the Brewers Basket) hath tumbled
besides his Box of state, and <hi>Coach</hi> running ouer
him hath kild him, the whilst the horses (hauing the
reines loose) haue runne away with their Rattle at
their heeles (like dogges that had bladders of dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Beanes, or empty bottles at their tailes) as if
the deuill had beene in them, and sometimes in the
full speed of their course a wheele breakes, or the
Naue slips off from the Axletree, downe leapes the
Coachman, and away runs the horses, throwing
their carriage into bushes, hedges, and ditches, neuer
leauing their mad pace, till they haue torne to tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
their tumbling Tumbrell, to the manifest perill,
danger, and vnrecouerable hurt to those whom they
<pb facs="tcp:2128:16"/>
carry, and to all men, women, children and cattell,
as Hogges, Sheepe, or whatsouer chanceth to be in
their way: besides the great cost &amp; charge of mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Reparations of the <hi>Coach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is almost nothing, but when it is worne
out, it will serue for some vse, either for profit or
pleasure (except a <hi>Coach</hi>) of the bottome of an old
<hi>Cart,</hi> one may make a fence to stop a gap, of the
Raues one may make a Ladder for Hennes to goe to
Roost: of an olde Bores Franke, a new Dogge-ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
may be founded; of a decayed Wherry or Boat,
a backe part of a house of office may be framed (as
you may see euery where on the Bankside) of an old
Barrell, a bolting Hutch, an ouer-worne old Whore

Bawde may make a new Witch. I knew a neighbour
of mine (an olde Iustice) that of the bald veluet ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Cloake, made him a paire of new Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and those Breeches being worne past the best,
with the best of them he made his wife a new French
Hoode; and when that was bare and past her wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
it made him facing for his new Boote tops: But
an old Coach is good for nothing but to cousen and
deceiue people, as of the olde rotten Leather they
make Vampies for high Shooes, for honest Country
Plow-men, or Belts for Souldiers, or inner lynings
for Girdles, Dogge-chollers for Mastiffes, indeede
the Box if it were bored thorow, would be fittest for
a close stoole, and the body would (perhaps) serue
for a Sow to pigge in.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2128:17"/>
yearely, and a ten-pound house-rent now, was

the <hi>Coach</hi> quickly mounted the price of all things
(except poore mens labour) and withal transformed
(in some places 10. 20. 30. 40. 50. 60. or 100. proper
Seruingmen, into two or three Animals <hi>(videlicet)</hi>
a Butterfly page, a trotting footman, a stiff-drinking
Coachman, a Cooke, a Clarke, a Steward, and a
Butler, which hath enforced many a discarded tall
fellow (through want of meanes to liue, and grace
to guide him in his pouertie) to fall into such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous
actions before named, for which I thinke
the Gallowses in England haue deuonred as many
lusty valiant men within these 30. or 40. yeares, as
would haue beene a sufficient armie to beate the
foes of Christ out of Christendome, and marching to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> haue pluck'd the great Turke by the
Beard: but as is aforesaid, this is the age wherien
<hi>The World Runnes on Wheeles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a most vneasie kinde of passage in Coaches
on the paued streetes in London, wherein men and
women are so tost, tumbled, iumbled, rumbled, and
crossing of kennels, dunghills, and vneuen-wayes,
which is enough to put all the guts in their bellies
out of ioynt, to make them haue the Palsey or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum,
or to cast their Gorges with continuall Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Wallowing: to preuent which, there was a
gentleman of great note, found fault with his Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horses,
because his Coach iolted him, commanding
his man to sell away those hard trotting Iades, and
to buy him a paire of Amblers, that might draw him
<pb facs="tcp:2128:17"/>
with more ease: another, when hee saw one of his
horses more lusty and free then his fellow, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Coachman to feede him onely with
bread &amp; water, till he were as tame and quiet as the
other, which wise command was dutifully obserued.</p>
            <p>The best vse that euer was made of <hi>Coaches</hi> was
in the old warres betwixt the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and the
<hi>Turkes,</hi> (for like so many land Gallies) they carried
souldiers on each side with Crosbowes, and other
warlike engines, and they serued for good vse being
many thousands of them, to disrowte their enemies,
breaking their rankes and order, making free and
open passage for their horse and foote amongst the
scattered squadrons and regiments, &amp; vpon occasion
they serued as a wall to Embarricado and fortifie
their campe: this was a millitarie imployment for
<hi>Coaches,</hi> and in this sort onely I could wish all our
hirelings to be vsed. It is to be supposed that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
Charriots which were drowned in the red sea,
were no other things in shape and fashion then our
<hi>Coaches</hi> are at this time, and what great pitty was it

were wont to be drawne in their <hi>Coaches</hi> with

(himselfe being the Coachman) and the <hi>Coaches</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:2128:18"/>
these late times (to shew some sparke of gratitude
or thankfulnes) in remembrance that naked Whores
once drew <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of them, they doe in requitall very
often carrie Whores halfe naked to the belly, and
gallantly apparelled; besides only but foure Whores
drew one <hi>Coach,</hi> and 500. <hi>Coaches</hi> hath carried
10000. of them for it: but sometimes they were
drawne with Stagges, as it is the vse in <hi>Lapland</hi> at
this day. The Emperour <hi>Firmus</hi> was drawne with
foure Estridges, and to requite those fauours, they
doe now often carrie men as rauenous as Lyons, as
well headed as Oxen or Stagges, and as the Estridges
did once draw, so the feathers of them doe daily
ride in Plumes and Fannes.</p>
            <p>In the Citie of <hi>Antwerp</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi> I haue seene
little <hi>Coaches,</hi> which men send their children to
Schoole in, each of them drawne by a Mastiffe
dogge, not hauing any guide: for the dogge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
doth exercise three offices at one time, being as
the Horse to draw, the Coachman to direct, and an
honest labouring dogge besides.</p>
            <p>I remember that in one place aforesaid, I haue
written, that <hi>Coaches</hi> doe seldome carrie any dead
things, as Stones, Timber, Wine, Beere, Corne, &amp;c.
But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so writing I finde that I haue done many of
them great wrong, for I perceiue that they carrie
oftentimes diuers sorts of Rye, as Knaue-Rye, Foole-Rye,
Leache-Rye, Rogue-Rye, Vsue-Rye, Bawde-Rye,
Braue-Rye, Slaue-Rye, and Begge-Rye.
Sometimes (by chaunce) they may hap to carrie
good Husband-Rye, and Housewife-Rye, but
<pb facs="tcp:2128:18"/>
such burthens are as scarce, as money or charity: and
one thing more comes into my minde about their
multitude, for though a Coach doe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be a

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> consider
how they doe multiply and encrease: I am doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
but that they are male and female, and vse the
act of generation or begetting, or else their procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could neuer so haue ouer-spread our Nation.</p>
            <p>To conclude, a <hi>Coach</hi> may fitly be compared to a
Whore, for a <hi>Coach</hi> is painted, so is a Whore: a
<hi>Coach</hi> is common, so is a Whore: a <hi>Coach</hi> is costly,
so is a Whore; a <hi>Coach</hi> is drawne with beasts, a
Whore is drawne away with beastly Knaues. A
<hi>Coach</hi> hath loose Curtaines, a Whore hath a loose
Gowne, a <hi>Coach</hi> is lac'd and fring'd, so is a Whore:
A <hi>Coach</hi> may be turn'd any way, so may a Whore:
A <hi>Coach</hi> hath Bosses, Studs, and guilded nailes to
adorne it: a Whore hath Owches, Brooches, Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
Chaines and Iewels to set her forth: a <hi>Coach</hi> is
alwaies out of reparations, so is a Whore: a <hi>Coach</hi>
hath need of mending still, so hath a Whore: a <hi>Coach</hi>
is vnprofitable, so is a whore: a <hi>Coach</hi> is superfluous,
so is a Whore: a <hi>Coach</hi> is insatiate, so is a Whore: A
<hi>Coach</hi> breakes mens neckes: a Whore breakes mens
backes: This oddes is betwixt a <hi>Coach</hi> and a Whore,
a man will lend his <hi>Coach</hi> to his friend, so will hee
not his Whore: but any mans Whore will saue him
the labour of lending her; for she will lend her selfe
to whom shee pleaseth. And thus my Booke and
