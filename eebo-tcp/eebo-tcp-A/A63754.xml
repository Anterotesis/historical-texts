         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHen I reflect upon the
infinite disputes which
have troubled the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
meetings of Christendom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Original sin, and how
impatient and vext some men
lately have been, when <hi>I</hi> offered
to them my endeavours and
conjectures concerning that
Question, with purposes very
differing from what were seen
in the face of other mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
and had handled it so,
that God might be glorified in
the Article, and men might be
instructed and edified in order
to good life; I could not but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36649:5"/>
think that wise Heathen said
rarely well in his little adagy,
relating to the present subject;
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Mankind
was born to be a riddle, and
our nativity is in the dark; for
men have taken the liberty to
think what they please, and to
say what they think; and they
affirme many things, and can
prove but few things; and take
the sayings of men for the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of God, and bold affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
for convincing arguments;
and Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> text must be
understood by Saint <hi>Austins</hi>
commentary, and Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
shall be heard in all, because he
spake against such men who in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36649:5"/>
some things were not to be heard;
and after all, because his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was taken for granted
by ignorant ages, and being
received so long, was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into the resolved Doctrine
of the Church, with so great a
firmnesse, it became almost a
shame to examine what the
world believed so unsuspecting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and he that shall first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it, must resolve to give
up a great portion of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to be torn in pieces by
the ignorant and by the zealous,
by some of the learned, and by
all the Envious; and they who
love to teach in quiet; being at
rest in their chaires and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36649:6"/>
will be froward when they
are awakened, and rather then
they will be suspected to have
taught amisse, will justifie an
error by the reproaching of him
that tells them truth, which they
are pleased to call new.</p>
                  <p>If any man differs from me in
opinion, I am not troubled at it,
but tell him that truth is in the
understanding, and charity is in
will, and is or ought to be there,
before either his or my opinion
in these controversies can enter,
and therefore that we ought to
love alike, though we do not
understand alike; but when I
finde that men are angry at my
Ingenuity and opennesse of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36649:6"/>
and endeavour to hinder
the event of my labours, in the
ministery of Souls, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of contradiction or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of explication, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Questions, <hi>I</hi> think
my self concerned to defend the
truth which <hi>I</hi> have published,
to acquit it from the suspition
of evil appendages, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
not onely the truth, but the
piety of it, and the necessity, and
those great advantages which
by this Doctrine so understood
may be reaped, if men will be
quiet and patient, void of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and not void of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>(Madam)</hi> is reason
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36649:7"/>
sufficient why <hi>I</hi> offer so many
justifications of my Doctrine,
before any man appears in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
against it; but because
there are many who do enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the houses of the rich and the
honourable, and whisper secret
oppositions and accusations ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then arguments against my
Doctrine; and the good women
that are zealous for Religion,
and make up in the passions of
one faculty what is not so visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the actions and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of another, are sure to be
affrighted before they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
and men enter caveats
in that Court before they try the
cause. <hi>I</hi> have found, that some
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36649:7"/>
men, to whom I gave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
my labours, and for
whose sake I was willing to
suffer the persecution of a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
truth, have been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
to me, and so unserviceable
to your Honour (<hi>Madam,</hi>) and
to some other excellent and rare
personages, as to tell stories, and
give names to my proposition,
and by secret murmurs hinder
you from receiving that good
which your wisdom and your
piety would have discerned
there, if they had not affrighted
you with telling, that a snake
lay under the Plantane, and that
this Doctrine wich is as whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
as the fruits of Paradise,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36649:8"/>
was inwrapped with the infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of a Serpent, subtle and
fallacious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> I know the arts of
these men; and they often put
me in mind of what was told me
by <hi>Mr. Sackvill</hi> the late <hi>Earl</hi> of
<hi>Dorsets</hi> Vncle; that the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Sects of the World (he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the <hi>Jesuits</hi> and the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>)
did more prevail by
whispering to <hi>Ladies,</hi> then all
the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the
more sober <hi>Protestants</hi> could do
by fine force and strength of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
For they by prejudice
or fears, terrible things, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
nothings, confident sayings
and little stories, governing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36649:8"/>
the <hi>Ladies</hi> consciences, who can
perswade their <hi>Lords,</hi> their
<hi>Lords</hi> will convert their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and so the World is all
their own. I wish them all good
of their profits and purchases;
but yet because they are questions
of Souls, of their interest and
advantages; <hi>I</hi> cannot wish they
may prevail with the more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and Zealous Personages:
and therefore <hi>(Madam)</hi> I have
taken the boldnesse to write this
tedious letter to your Honour,
that I may give you a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and an easy expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this great Question; as
conceiving my self the more
bound to do it to your Honour,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36649:9"/>
not onely because you are Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the Religion of this
Church, and are a person as
well of reason as of Honour, but
also because you have passed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
obligations upon me, for
which, all my services are too
little a return.</p>

to death, and deprived of the
means of long life, and of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and instrument of Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36649:10"/>
I mean the Tree of Life; he then
fell under the evills of a sickly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and a passionate, ignorant, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
soul; his sin made him sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
his sickliness made him peevish,
his sin left him ignorant, his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
made him foolish and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable:
His sin left him to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and by his nature, who ever
was to be born at all, was to be born
a child, and to do before he could
understand, &amp; bred under Laws, to
which he was alwayes bound, but
which could not always be exacted;
and he was to choose, when he could
not reason, and had passions most
strong, when he had his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most weak, and was to ride a
wilde horse without a bridle, and
the more need he had of a curb, the
less strength he had to use it, and this
being the case of all the World,
what was <hi>every mans</hi> evill, became
all mens greater evill; and though
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36649:11"/>
alone it was very bad, yet when
they came together it was made
much worse; like Ships in a storm,
every one alone hath enough to do
to out-ride it; but when they meet,
besides the evills of the storm, they
find the intolerable calamitie of
their mutuall concussion, and every
ship that is ready to be oppressed
with the tempest, is a worse tempest
to every vessell, against which it is
violently dashed. So it is in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
every man hath evill enough of
his own; and it is hard for a man to
live soberly, temperately, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously;
but when he hath Parents
and Children, brothers and sisters,
friends and enemies, buyers and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Lawyers and Physitians, a
family and a neighbourhood, a
King over him, or Tenants under
him, a Bishop to rule in matters of
Government spirituall, and a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be rul'd by him in the affaires
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36649:11"/>
of their Souls, then it is that every
man dashes against another, and one
relation requires what another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
and when one speaks, another
will contradict him; and that which
is well spoken, is sometimes inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
mistaken, and that upon a
good cause, produces an evill effect,
and by these, and ten thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concurrent causes, man is made
more then most miserable.</p>
                  <p>But the main thing is this; when
God was angry with <hi>Adam,</hi> the
man fell from the state of grace; for
God withdrew his grace, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the state of meer nature,
of our prime creation. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I am not of <hi>Petrus Diaconus</hi>
his mind, who said, that when we
all fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> we fell into the dirt,
and not only so, but we fell also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a heap of stones; so that we not
onely were made naked, but defiled
also, and broken all in pieces; yet
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36649:12"/>
this I believe to be certain, that we
by his fall received evill enough to
undoe us, and ruine us all; but yet
the evill did so descend upon us, that
we were left in powers &amp; capacities
to serve and glorifie God; Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was made much harder, but not
impossible; mankind was made mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
but not desperate, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
an actuall mortality, but we
were redeemable from the power
of Death; sinne was easie and
ready at the door, but it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable;
Our <hi>Will</hi> was abused, but
yet not destroyed; our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
was cosened, but yet still ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the best instructions; and
though the Devill had wounded us,
yet God sent his Son, who like the
good Samaritan poured Oyle and
Wine into our wounds, and we
were cured before we felt the hurt,
that might have ruined us upon that
Occasion. It is sad enough, but not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36649:12"/>
altogether so intolerable, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory,
which the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracle
describes to be the effect of <hi>Adams</hi>
sin.</p>

true, <hi>Mirum quod pedes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36649:13"/>
moverunt ad usum rationis, nullo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
fraeno passiones:</hi> the foot moves at
the command of the Will and by the
empire of reason, but the passionsare
stiff even then when the knee bends,
and no bridle can make the Passions
regular and temperate. And indeed
(Madam) this is in a manner the
sum total of the evill of our abused
and corrupted nature; Our soul is in
the body as in a Prison; it is there
<hi>tanquam in alienâ domo,</hi> it is a so jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and lives by the bodies mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and loves and hates by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Interests and Inclinations; that
which is pleasing and nourishing to
the body, the soul chooses and
delights in: that which is vexatious
and troublesome, it abhorres, and
hath motions accordingly; for Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are nothing else but acts of
the Will, carried to or from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
Objects, and effects and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
upon the man, made by such
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36649:13"/>
acts; consequent motions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
from the Will It is an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and a groundless proposition in
Philosophy, to make the Passions to
be distinct faculties, and seated in a
differing region; for as the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
soul is both sensitive and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,
so is the Will elective and
passionate, the region both of
choice and passions, that is, When
the Object is immateriall, or the
motives such, the act of the Will is
so meerly intellectuall, that it is then
spirituall, and the acts are proper
and Symbolical; but if the Object
is materiall or corporall, the acts of
the Will are adhaesion and aversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and these it receives by the needs
and inclinations of the body; now
because many of the bodies needs
are naturally necessary, and the rest
are made so by being thought
needs, and by being so naturally
pleasant, and that this is the bodies
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36649:14"/>
day, and it rules here in its own
place and time, therefore it is that
the will is so great a scene of passion
and we so great servants of our
bodies.</p>
                  <p>This was the great effect of
<hi>Adams</hi> sin which became therrefore
to us a punishment because of the
appendant infirmity that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it; for <hi>Adam</hi> being spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of all the rectitudes and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
heights of grace, and thrust
back to the form of nature, and
left to derive grace to himself by
a new Oeconomy, or to be without
it; and his posterity left just so as
he was left himself; he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the power of his enemy
that betray'd him, and put under
the power of his body whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
would govern him; and
when they would grow irregular
could not be mastered by any thing
that was about him, or born with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36649:14"/>
him, so that his case was miserable
and naked, and his state of things
was imperfect and would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered.</p>
                  <p>But now Madam, things being
thus bad, are made worse by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced
Doctrines of men,
which when I have represented to
your Ladiship and told upon what
accounts I reprove them, your
Honour will finde that I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>There are one sort of <hi>Calvins</hi>
Scholars whom we for distinctions
sake call <hi>Supralapsarians,</hi> who are so
fierce in their sentences of predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and reprobation, that they
say God look'd upon mankinde
onely, as his Creation, and his slaves,
over whom he having absolute
power, was very gracious that he
was pleased to take some few, and
save them absolutely; and to the
other greater part he did no wrong,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36649:15"/>
though he was pleased to damn
them eternally, onely because he
pleased; for they were his own;
and <hi>Qui jure suo utitur nemini facit
injuriam</hi> saies the law of reason,
every one may do what he please
with his own. But this bloody and
horrible opinion is held but by a
few; as tending directly to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of God, charging on Him
alone that He is the cause of mens
sins on Earth, and of mens eternal
torments in Hell; it makes God to
be powerfull, but his power not to
be good; it makes him more cruel
to men, then good men can be to
Dogs and sheep; it makes him give
the final sentence of Hell without
any pretence or colour of justice;
it represents him to be that which
all the World must naturally fear,
and naturally hate, as being a God
delighting in the death of innocents;
for so they are when he resolves to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36649:15"/>
damn them: and then most tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
cruel, and unreasonable; for
it saies that to make a postnate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of justice, it decrees that men
inevitably shall sin, that they may
inevitably, but justly, be damned;
like the <hi>Roman Lictors</hi> who because
they could not put to death <hi>Seja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
daughters as being Virgins, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured
them after sentence, that
by that barbarity they might be
capable of the utmost Cruelty; it
makes God to be all that thing that
can be hated; for it makes him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be good, nor just, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable;
but a mighty enemy to the
biggest part of mankinde; it makes
him to hate what himself hath
made, and to punish that in another
which in himself he decreed should
not be avoided: it charges the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God with folly, as having
no means to glorifie his justice, but
by doing unjustly, by bringing in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36649:16"/>
that which himself hates, that he
might do what himself loves: do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as <hi>Tiberius</hi> did to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
the Sons of <hi>Germanicus;
Variâ fraude induxit ut
concitarentur ad convitia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sueton. in vita. liber.c. 54.</note>
                     <hi>et concitati perderentur;</hi>
provoking them to raise,
that he might punish their reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
This opinion reproaches the
words and the Spirit of Scripture,
it charges God with Hypocrisy and
want of Mercy, making him a
Father of Cruelties, not of Mercie,
and is a perfect overthrow of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and all Lawes, and all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it destroyes the very being,
and nature of all Election, thrusting
a man down to the lowest form of
beasts and birds, to whom a Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneity
of doing certain actions is
given by God, but it is in them so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
that it is unavoidable. Now
concerning this horrid opinion, I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36649:16"/>
for my part shall say nothing but
this; that he that sayes there was no
such man as <hi>Alexander,</hi> would tell a
horrible lie, and be injurious to all
story, and to the memory and fame
of that great Prince, but he that
should say. It is true there was such
a man as <hi>Alexander,</hi> but he was a
Tyrant, and a Blood-sucker, cruel
and injurious, false and dissembling,
an enemy of mankind, and for all
the reasons of the world to be hated
and reproached, would certainly
dishonour <hi>Alexander</hi> more, and be
his greatest enemy: So I think in
this, That the Atheists who deny
there is a God, do not so impiously
against God, as they that charge him
with foul appellatives, or maintain
such sentences, which if they were
true, God could not be true. But
these men (Madam) have nothing
to do in the Question of Originall
Sin, save onely, that they say that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36649:17"/>
God did decree that <hi>Adam</hi> should
fall, and all the sins that he sinn'd,
and all the world after him are no
effects of choice, but of predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that is, they were the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God, rather then man.</p>
                  <p>But because these men even to
their brethren seem to speak evil
things of God, therefore the more
wary and temperat of the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
bring down the order of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
lower; affirming that God
looked upon all mankind in <hi>Adam</hi>
as fallen into his displeasure, hated
by God, truly guilty of his sin, lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Eternal damnation, and they
being all equally condemned, he
was pleased to separate some, the
smaller number far, and irresistibly
bring them to Heaven; but the far
greater number he passed over, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them to be damned for the sin
of <hi>Adam,</hi> and so they think they
salve Gods Justice; and this was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36649:17"/>
the designe and device of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
of <hi>Dort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to bring this to passe, they
teach concerning Original sin.</p>
                  <p>1. That by this sin our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
fell from their Original righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
and communion with
God, and so became dead in sinne
and wholly defiled in all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and parts of soul and body.</p>
                  <p>2. That whatsoever death was due
to our first Parents for this sin, they
being the root of all mankinde, and
the guilt of this sin, being imputed,
the same is conveied to all their
posterity by ordinary genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>3. That by this Original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
we are utterly indisposed,
disabled, and made opposite to all
good, and wholly inclined to all
evill; and that from hence proceed
all actual trangressions.</p>
                  <p>4. This corruption of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36649:18"/>
in the regenerate, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be through Christ pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and mortified, yet both it self
and all the motions thereof, are
trulie and properly sin.</p>
                  <p>5. Original sin being a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the righteous Law of God,
and contrary thereunto, doth in its
own nature bring guilt upon the
sinner whereby he is bound over to
the wrath of God and curse of the
Law, and so made subject to death
with all miseries, spiritual, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and eternal. These are the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the late Assembly at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against this heap of errors and
dangerous propositions I have made
my former discoursings, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Question of Original
sin. These are the Doctrines of the
<hi>Presbyterian,</hi> but as unlike truth, as
his assemblies are to our Church;
for concerning him I may say.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:36649:18"/>Nemo tam propè procul<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>

to a Son of our Church in the world;
he is neerest to us and furthest from
us; and to all the world abroad he
calls himself our friend, while at
home he hates us and destroyes
us.</p>
                  <p>Now I shall first speak to the
thing in general and its designes,
then I shall make some observations
upon the particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. This device of our <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
and of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> is but an
artifice to save their proposition
harmless, &amp; to stop the out-cries of
Scripture and reason, and of all the
World against them. But this way
of stating the article of reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is as horrid in effect as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For</p>
                  <p>1. Is it by a natural consequent
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36649:19"/>
that we are guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, or is
it by the decree of God? Naturally
it cannot be; for then the sins of all
our forefathers, who are to their
posterity the same that <hi>Adam</hi>
was to his, must be ours; and
not onely <hi>Adams</hi> first sin, but his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are ours upon the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
But if it be by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God,<note place="margin">Instit. l. 3. c. 23. Sect. 7. Vind. Grat. l. 1. p. 1. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres. 4. c. 3.</note> by his choice
and constitution, that it
should be so. (as Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> (that
I may name no more for
that side, do expresly
teach) it followes, that
God is the Author of our
Sin; So that I may use Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi>
words; <q>How is it that so many
Nations with their Children
should be involved in the fall
without remedy,</q> but because
God would have it so? and if that
be the matter, then to God, as to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36649:19"/>
the cause, must that sin, and that
damnation be accounted.</p>
                  <p>And let it then be considered,
whether this be not as bad as the
worst, For the <hi>Supralapsarians</hi> say,
God did decree that the greatest
part of mankind should perish, only
because he would: The <hi>Sublapsari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
say, That God made it by his
decree necessary, that all wee who
were born of <hi>Adam</hi> should be born
guilty of Originall Sin, and he it was
who decreed to damne whom he
pleased for that sin, in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
they should be born; and both
these he did for no other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but because he would. Is it
not therefore evident, that he abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
decreed Damnation to these
Persons? For he that decrees the
end, and he that decrees the onely
necessary and effective meanes to the
end, and decrees that it shall be the
end of that means, does decree abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36649:20"/>
alike; though by several dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations:
And then all the evill
consequents which I reckoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be the monstrous producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the first way; are all Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the other; and if <hi>Solomon</hi> were
here, he could not tell which were
the truer Mother.</p>
                  <p>Now that the case is equall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, some of their own
chiefest do confess, so Dr. <hi>Twisse.</hi>
If God may ordain Men to Hell for
<hi>Adam's</hi> sin, which is derived unto
them by Gods onely constitution:
he may as well do it absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without any such constitution:
The same also is affirmed
by <hi>Maccovius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Disp. 18. Inst. lib. 3. cap. 23. Sect. 23.</note> and by Mr.
<hi>Calvin:</hi> and the reason is
plain; for he that does a
thing for a reason which
himself makes, may as well do it
without a reason, Or he may make
his owne Will to be the reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the thing, and the motive of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36649:20"/>
the thing, come in both cases, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the same principle, and
from that alone.</p>
                  <p>Now (Madam) be pleased to say,
whether I had not reason and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
for what I have taught: You are
a happy Mother of an Honorable
Posterity, your Children and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews
are Deare to you as your
right eye, and yet you cannot love
them so well as God loves them, and
it is possible that a Mother should
forget her Children, yet God even
then will not, cannot; but if our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother forsake us, God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
us up: Now Madam consider,
could you have found in your heart
when the Nurses and Midwives had
bound up the heads of any of your
Children, when you had born them
with pain and joy upon your knees,
could you have been tempted to
give command that murderers
should be brought to slay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
to put them to exquisite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36649:21"/>
and then in the middest of
their saddest groans, throw any one
of them into the flames of a fierce
fire, for no other reason, but because
he was born at Latimers, or upon a
Friday, or when the Moon wasin her
prime, or for what other reason you
had made, and they could never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void?
could you have been delighted
in their horrid shrieks and out-cries,
and taking pleasure in their una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
and their intollerable cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity?
could you have smiled, if the
hangman had snatched your Eldest
Son from his Nurses breasts, and
dashed his brains out against the
pavement; and would you not have
wondred that any Father or Mother
could espie the innocence and prety
smiles of your sweet babes, and yet
tear their limbs in pieces, or devise
devilish artifices to make them roar
with intollerable convulsions? could
you desire to be thought good, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36649:21"/>
yet have delighted in such cruelty?
I know I may answer for you; you
would first have dyed your self.
And yet say again, God loves man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
better then we can love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and he is essentially just,
and he is infinitely mercifull, and he
is all goodness, and therefore
though we might possibly do evil
things, yet he cannot, and yet this
doctrine of the Presbyterian repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
saies he both can and does
things, the very apprehension of
which hath caused many in despair
to drown or hang themselves.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Doctrine of absolute
Reprobation be so horrid, so intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a proposition, so unjust and
blasphemous to God, so injurious
and cruell to men, and that there is
no colour or pretence to justifie it,
but by pretending our guilt of
<hi>Adams</hi> sin, and damnation to be the
punishment: then because from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36649:22"/>
truth nothing but truth can issue;
that must needs be a lie, from which
such horrid consequences do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
For the case in short is this;
If it be just for God to damne any
one of <hi>Adam's</hi> Posterity for <hi>Adam's</hi>
sin, then it is just in him to damne
all; for all his Children are equally
guilty; and then if he spares any, it
is Mercy: and the rest who perish
have no cause to complain. But if
all these fearful consequences which
Reason and Religion so much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr
do so certainly follow from
such doctrines of Reprobation, and
these doctrines wholly rely upon
this pretence, it follows, that the
pretence is infinitely false and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable;
and that it cannot be just
for God to damne us for being in a
state of calamity, to which state we
entred no way but by his constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and decree.</p>
                  <p>You see, Madam, I had reason to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36649:22"/>
reprove that doctrine, which said,
It was just in God to damne us for
the sinne of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though this be the maine error;
yet there are some other collaterall
things which I can by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
such is that. 1. That by the
Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> our Parents became
wholly defiled in all the faculties
and Powers of their souls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
And 2. That by this we also are
disabled, and made opposite to all
good, and wholly inclined to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
And 3. That from hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
all actuall transgressions. And
4. that our naturall corruption in
the regenerate still remains, and is
still properly a sin.</p>
                  <p>Against this, I opposed these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
That the effect of <hi>Adams</hi>
sin was in himself bad enough; for it
devested him of that state of grace
and favour where God placed him;
it threw him from Paradise, and all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36649:23"/>
the advantages of that place, it left
him in the state of Nature; but yet
his nature was not spoiled by that
sin; he was not wholly inclined to all
evill, neither was he disabled and
made opposite to all good; only his
good was imperfect, it was naturall
and fell short of heaven; for till his
nature was invested with a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he could go no further then
the designe of his first Nature, that
is, without Christ, without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ, he could never arrive
at heaven, which is his supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
condition; But 1. There still
remained in him a naturall freedom
of doing good or evill. 2. In every
one that was born, there are great
inclinations to some good. 3. Where
our Nature was averse to good, it is
not the direct <hi>sin of Nature,</hi> but the
imperfection of it, the reason being,
because God superinduced Lawes
against our naturall inclination, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36649:23"/>
yet there was in nature nothing suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make us contradict our
nature in obedience to God; all that
being to come from a supernaturall
and Divine principle. These I shall
prove together, for one depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another.</p>
                  <p>1. And first, that the liberty of
will did not perish to mankind by
the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> is so evident, that
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austin</hi> who is an adversary in
some parts of this Question, but not

                     <note place="margin">Lib. 1. ad Bonifac. c.2.</note> Which of us
can say, That the liberty of our
Will did perish by the sin of the first
Man? And he adds a rare reason; for
it is so certain, that it did not perish
in a sinner, that this thing onely is it
by which they do sinne, especially
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36649:24"/>
when they delight in their sinne,
and by the love of sin, that thing is
pleasing to them which they list to
do.] And therefore when we are
charged with sin, it is worthy of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
whence it is that we are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
Is it by the necessity of nature,
or by the liberty of our Will? If by
nature, and not choice, then it is
good and not evil; for whatsoever is
our Nature is of Gods making, and
consequently is good; but if we are
sinners by choice &amp; liberty of will,
whence had we this libertie? If from
<hi>Adam,</hi> then we have not lost it; but
if we had it not from him, then from
him we do not derive all our sin; for
by this liberty alone we sin.</p>
                  <p>If it be replied, that wee are free
to sin, but not to good; it is such a
foolery, and the cause of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
so evident, and so ignorant, that
I wonder any man of Learning or
common sense should own it. For
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36649:24"/>
if I be free to evill; then I can chuse
evill, or refuse it; If I can refuse it,
then I can do good; for to refuse
that evill is good, and it is in the
Commandement [<hi>Eschew evill</hi>] but
if I cannot choose or refuse it, how
am I free to evill? For <hi>Voluntas</hi> and
<hi>libertas, Will</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
are not the same: I may will it,
when I cannot will the contrary; as
the Saints in Heaven, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wills good; they can not
will evill; because to do so is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and contrary to felicity; but
here is no liberty; for liberty is with
power, to do, or not to do; to do
this or the contrary; and if this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
be not in us, we are not in the
state of obedience, or of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
which is the state of all them
who are alive, who are neither in
hell nor Heaven. But that our case
is otherwise, if I had no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the world, and were never
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36649:25"/>
so prejudicate and obstinate a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I think I should be perfectly
convinced by those words of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.37. The Apostle speaks of
a good act tending not onely to the
keeping of a Precept, but to a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of perfection; &amp; concerning that,
he hath these words; <hi>Neverthelesse,
he that standeth stedfast in his heart,
having no necessity, but hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his own will, and hath so decreed
in his heart that he will keep his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
doth well;</hi> The words are plain,
and need no explication. If this be
not a plain liberty of choice, and a
power of will, then words mean
nothing, and we can never hope to
understand one anothers meaning.
But if sinne be avoidable, then wee
have liberty of choice. If it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable,
it is not imputable by the
measures of Lawes, and Justice;
what it is by Empire and Tyranny,
let the Adversaries inquire and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36649:25"/>
prove: But since all Theology, all
Schools of learning consent in this,
that an invincible or unavoidable
ignorance does wholly excuse from
sin; why an invincible and an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
necessity shall not also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
I confesse I have not yet been
taught.</p>
                  <p>But if by <hi>Adam's</hi> sinne wee be so
utterly indisposed, disabled, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to all good, wholly inclined
to evill, and from hence come all
actuall sinnes, that is, That by <hi>Adam</hi>
we are brought to that passe, that
we cannot chuse but sinne: it is a
strange severity, that this should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
upon Persons otherwise most
innocent, and that this which is the
most grievous of all evills; <hi>prima
&amp; maximapeccantium poena est pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse.</hi>
(Seneca) To be given over to
sin, is the worst calamity, the most
extreme anger never inflicted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
at all for any sinne, as I have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36649:26"/>
therwise proved, and not indirectly,
but upon the extremest anger;
which cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
unlesse God be
more angry with us for
being born Men, then
for choosing to be sinners.<note place="margin">Doctr. and Pract. of Repent.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Consequent of these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is this; That our faculties are
not so wholly spoiled by <hi>Adams</hi> fall,
but that we can choose good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
that our nature is not wholly
disabled and made opposite to all
good: But to nature are left and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as much as to the handmaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;</hi>
nature hath nothing to do with
the inheritance, but she and her
sons have gifts given them; and by
nature we have Laws of Virtue and
inclinations to Virtue, and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we love God, and worship him,
and speak good things of him, and
love our Parents, and abstain from
incestuous mixtures, and are pleased
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36649:26"/>
when we do well, and affrighted
within when we sin in horrid instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

and much good comes from

                     <hi>neque enim quasi lassa

so absolute and dried a trunck as
to bring no good fruits upon its

have a good proverb, <hi>Bonus sanguis
non mentitur,</hi> a good blood never
lies; and some men are naturally
chast, and some are abstemious,
and many are just and friendly,
and noble and charitable: and
therefore all actual sins do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from this sin of <hi>Adam;</hi> for if
the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> left us in liberty
to sin, and that this liberty was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Adams</hi> fall; then it is not long
of <hi>Adams</hi> fall that we sin; by his
fall it should rather be that we
cannot choose but do this or that,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36649:27"/>
and then it is no sin; But to say
that our actuall sins should any
more proceed from <hi>Adams</hi> fall,
then <hi>Adams</hi> fal should proceed from

not I, it was not my act, but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the Divine decree, and then
the same decree may make us sin,
and not the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> be the cause
of it. But if a liberty of will made
<hi>Adam</hi> sin, then this liberty to sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still left us, this liberty and
and not <hi>Adams</hi> sin is the cause of all
our actual.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the other clause in
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> article, that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
corruption in the regenerate
still remaines, and <hi>is still a sin, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a sin:</hi> I have (I confesse)
heartily opposed it, and shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
my arguments, confute it
with my blood, if God shall call
me; for it is so great a reproach to
the spirit and power of Christ, and
to the effects of Baptisme, to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and to right reason, that all
good people are bound in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36649:28"/>
to be zealous against it.</p>
                  <p>For when Christ came to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
us to his Father, he came to
take away our sins, not onely to
pardon them, but to destroy them;
and if the regenerate, in whom the
spirit of Christ rules, and in whom
all their habitual sins are dead, are
still under the servitude and in the
stock's of Original sin, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
not onely that our guilt
of <hi>Adams</hi> sin is greater then our
own actual, the sin that we never
consented to, is of a deeper grain
then that which we have chosen
and delighted in, and God was
more angry with <hi>Cain</hi> that he was
born of <hi>Adam,</hi> then that he kill'd
his Brother; and <hi>Judas</hi> by descent
from the first <hi>Adam</hi> contracted
that sin which he could never be
quit of: but he might have been
quit of his betraying the second
<hi>Adam,</hi> if he would not have despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36649:28"/>
I say not onely these horrid
consequences do follow, but this
also will follow; that <hi>Adams</hi> sin
hath done some mischief that the
grace of Christ can never cure; and
generation staines so much, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
cannot wash it clean.
Besides all this; if the natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
remaines in the regenerate
and be properly a sin, then either
Gods hates the regenerate, or loves
the sinner, and when he dies he
must enter into Heaven, with that
sin, which he cannot lay down but
in the grave: as the vilest sinner
layes down every sin; and then an
unclean thing can go to Heaven, or
else no man can; and lastly, to say
that this natural corruption, though
it be <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>mortified,</hi> yet still
remaines, and is stil a sin, is perfect
non-sence; for if it be <hi>mortified,</hi> it is
not, it hath no being; if it is pardoned
it was indeed, but now is no sin; for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36649:29"/>
till a man can be guilty of sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obligation to punishment, a sin
cannot be a sin that is pardoned;
that is, if the obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or the guilt be taken away, a
man is not guilty. Thus far (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)
I hope you will think I had
reason.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I did and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
in their <hi>Westminster</hi> articles:
and that is, that Original sin, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
our sin derived from <hi>Adam,</hi>
is contrary to the law of God and
doth in its own nature bring guilt
upon the sinner; binding him over
to Gods wrath &amp;c. that is, that
the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed to us is
properly, formally, and inhaerently
a sin. If it were properly a sin in
us, <hi>our sin,</hi> it might indeed be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
for every transgression of
the Divine Commandment is so:
but because I have proved it cannot
bring eternal damnation, I can as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36649:29"/>
well argue thus: this sin cannot just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bring us to damnation, therefore
it is not properly a sin: as to say; this
is properly a sin, therefore it can
bring us to damnation. Either of
them both follow well: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot prove it to be a
sin properly, or any other wayes
but by a limited imputation to
certain purposes; they cannot say
it infers damnation. But because I
have proved, it cannot infer dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
I can safely conclude, it is
not formally, properly, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
a sin in us.</p>

so far as I can judge fitting for the

some exceptions; and there are some

me as it happened to our Blessed
Saviour, <hi>in domo illorum qui dilige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
me;</hi> in the house of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:36649:30"/>They joyn with me in all this
that I have said; <hi>viz.</hi> That Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin is ours onely by imputation;
that it leaves us still in our natural
liberty, and though it hath devested
us of our supernaturals, yet that
our nature is almost the same, and
by the grace of Jesus as capable of
Heaven as it could ever be, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation
of Original rightousnesse
from <hi>Adam.</hi> In the conduct and in
the description of this Question,
being usually esteemed to be onely
Scholastical, I confesse they (as all
men else) do usually differ; for it
was long ago observ'd, that there
are 16. several famous opinions,
in this one Question of Original sin.
But my Brethren, are willlng to
confesse, that for <hi>Adams</hi> sin alone
no man did or shall ever perish.
And that it is rather to be called a
stain then a sin. If they were all
of one minde and one voice in this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36649:31"/>
article, though but thus far, I would
not move a stone to disturb it, but
some draw one way and some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and they that are aptest to
understand the whole secret, do
put fetters and bars upon their own
understanding by an importune
regard to the great names of some
dead men, who are called <hi>masters
upon earth,</hi> and whose authority is
as apt to mislead us into some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
as their learning is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to guide us in others: but so
it happens, that because all are
not of a minde, I cannot give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of every disagreeing man;
but of that which is most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
I shall. Some learned persons
are content I should say no man is
damned for the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
but yet that we stand guilty
in <hi>Adam,</hi> and redeemed from this
damnation by Christ; and if that
the article were so stated, it would
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36649:31"/>
not intrench upon the <hi>justice</hi> or the
<hi>goodnesse</hi> of God; for <hi>his justice</hi>
would be sufficiently declared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no man can complain of
wrong done him when the evil
that he fell into by <hi>Adam</hi> is taken
off by Christ; and <hi>his goodnesse</hi> is
manifest in making a new <hi>Census</hi>
for us, taxing and numbring us in
Christ, and giving us free Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by the blood of Jesus:
but yet that we ought to confess
that we are liable to damnation
<hi>by Adam,</hi> and saved from thence <hi>by
Christ;</hi> that Gods <hi>justice</hi> may be
glorified in <hi>that,</hi> and his <hi>goodnesse</hi>
in <hi>this,</hi> but that we are still real
sinners till washed in the blood of
Lamb; and <hi>without God,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hopes of heaven, till then: and
that if this article be thus handled,
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> fancie will disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
for they can be confuted
without denying <hi>Adams</hi> sin to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36649:32"/>
damnable; by saying it is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Christ, and in Christ all men
are restored, and he is the head of
the Predestination; for in him God
looked upon us when he designed
us to our final state: and this say
they is much for the honour of
Christs Redemption.</p>
                  <p>To these things (Madam) I have
much to say; some thing I will
trouble your Ladiship withal at
this time, that you and all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the particulars may see, I
could not do the work of God and
truth if I had proceeded in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.
For</p>
                  <p>1. It is observable that those wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
persons, who will by no means
admit that any one is or ever shall
be damned for Original sin, do by
this means hope to salve the justice
of God; by which they plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that to damn us for this, is hard
and intolerable; and therefore
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36649:32"/>
they suppose they have declared
a remedy. But then this also is to
be considered; if it be intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to damn children for the sin of
<hi>Adam,</hi> then it is intolerable to say
it is <hi>damnable;</hi> If that be not just
or reasonable, then this is also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
and unreasonable <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and the execution of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
are the same emanation and
issue of justice and are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
accounted of. For.</p>
                  <p>2. I demand, had it been just in
God, to damn all mankinde to the
eternal paines of hell, for <hi>Adams</hi>
sin, commited before they had a
being, or could consent to it, or
know of it? if it could be just, then
any thing in the world can be just,
and it is no matter who is innocent,
or who is criminal directly and by
choice, since they may turn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in their Mothers bellies; and it
matters not whether there be any
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36649:33"/>
laws or no, since it is all one that
there be no law, and that we do not
know whether there be or no; and
it matters not whether there be any
judicial processe, for we may as
well be damned without judgment,
as be guilty without action: and
besides, all those arguments will
presse here which I urged in my
first discourse. Now if it had been
unjust actually to damn us all for
the sin of one, it was unjust to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
us to it; for if he did give
sentence against us justly, he could
justly have executed the sentence;
and this is just, if that be. But</p>
                  <p>3. God did put this sentence in
execution; for when he sent the
Holy Jesus into the world, to die
for us and to Redeem us, he satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Fathers Anger, for Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin as well as for actual, he
paid all the price of that as well
as of this damnation; and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36649:33"/>
sentence was brought off; and
God was so satisfied that his justice
had full measure; for so all men
say who speak the voice of the
Church in the matter of Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
so that now, although
there was the goodnesse of God, in
taking the evil from us; yet how
to reconcile this processe with his
justice, <hi>viz.</hi> That for the sin of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their God should sentence all
the world to the portion of devils to
eternal ages; and that he would
not be reconciled to us, or take off
this horrible sentence, without a
full price to be paid to his justice;
by the Saviour of the world, <hi>this,
this</hi> is it that I require may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to that Notion which we have of the Divine justice.</p>
                  <p>4. If no man shall ever be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> alone, then
I demand whether are they born
quitt from the guilt; or when they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36649:34"/>
are quitted? if they be born free; I
agree to it; but then they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
charg'd with it, so far as to
make them <hi>liable to damnation.</hi> If
they be not born free, when are
they quitted? By baptisme, before,
or after? He that saies <hi>before</hi> or <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
must speak wholly by chance
and without pretence of Scripture
or tradition, or any sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
and he cannot guesse when
it is. If in Baptisme he is quitted,
then he that dies before baptisme,
is still under the sentence, and what
shall become of him? If it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that God will pardon him,
some way or other, at some time
or other; I reply, yea, but who
said so? For if the Scriptures have
said that we are all in <hi>Adam</hi> guilty
of sin and damnation, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have told us no wayes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quit of it, but by baptisme, and
faith in Christ; Is it not plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36649:34"/>
that til we believe in Christ,
or at least till in the faith of others,
we are Baptised into Christ, we are
reckoned still in <hi>Adam,</hi> not in
Christ, that is, still we are under
damnation, and not heires of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
but of wrath onely?</p>
                  <p>5. How can any one bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into a belief that none can be
damned for Original sin, if it be of
this perswasion that it makes us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to damnation; for if you say
as I say, that it is against Gods
justice to damn us for the fault of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
then it is also against his
justice to sentence us to that suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which to inflict is injustice. If
you say it is beleeved upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
because Christ was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to all mankinde, I reply, that
yet all mankinde shall not be saved;
and there are conditions required
on our part, and no man can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
but by Christ, and he must
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36649:35"/>
come to him or be brought to
him, or it is not told us, how
any one can have a part in him;
and therefore that will not give
us the confidence is looked for.
If it be at last said that we hope
in Gods goodness that he will
take care of innocents, and that
they shall not perish, I answer,
that if they be innocents, we
need not appeal to his goodnesse,
for, his <hi>justice</hi> will secure them. If
they be guilty and not innocents,
then it is but vain to run to Gods
goodnesse, which in this particular
is not revealed; when it is against his
justice which is revealed; and to
hope God will save them whom he
hates, who are gone from him in
<hi>Adam,</hi> who are born heires of his
wrath, slaves of the Devil, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of sin (for these Epithetes
are given to all the children of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36649:35"/>
                     <hi>Adam,</hi> by the opponents in this
Question) is to hope for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which his justice visibly is
ingaged, and for which I hope there
is no ground, unlesse this instance
of Divine goodnesse were expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in revelation; For so even
wicked persons on their death-bed
are bidden to hope without rule
and without reason or sufficient
grounds of trust. But besides;
that we hope in Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in this case is not ill, but I
ask, is it against Gods goodnesse
that any one should perish for
Original sin? if it be against
Gods goodnesse, it is also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his justice; for nothing
is just that is not also good.
Gods goodnesse may cause
his justice to forbear a sentence,
but whatsoever is against
Gods goodnesse, is against
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36649:36"/>
God, and therefore against his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
also; because every attribute
in God is God himself: For it is one
thing to say [This is against Gods
goodnesse] and the contrary is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Gods goodnesse] What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is against the goodnesse of
God is essentially evil: But a thing
may be agreeable to Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and yet the other part not be
against it. For example; It is against
the goodnesse of God to hate fools
and ideots: and therefore he can
never hate them. But it is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Gods goodnesse to give hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to them and the joyes beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:
and if he does not give them
so much, yet if he does no evil to
them hereafter, it is also agreeable
to his goodnesse: To give them
Heaven, or not to give them
Heaven, though they be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories;
yet are both agreeable
to his goodnesse. But in contraries
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36649:36"/>
the case is otherwise: For though
not to give them heaven is consistent
with the Divine goodnesse, yet to
end them to hell is not. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the difference is this. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to do contrary things must
come from contrary principles; and
whatsoever is contrary to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
goodnesse is essentially evil.
But to do or not to do, supposes
but one positive principle; and the
other negative, not having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
cause, may be wholy inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
as proceeding from a negative:
but to speak more plain. Is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Gods goodnese that Infants
should be damned for Original sin?
then it could never have been done,
it was essentially evil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could never have been decreed
or sentenced. But if it be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Gods goodness that they
should perish in hell, then it may
consist with Gods goodness; and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36649:37"/>
then to hope that Gods goodness
will rescue them from his justice,
when the thing may agree with
both, is to hope without ground;
God may be good, though they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
for <hi>Adams</hi> sin; and if so, and
that he can be just too upon the
account, of what attribute shal these
innocents be rescued; and we
hope for mercy for them.</p>
                  <p>6. If <hi>Adams posterity</hi> be onely
liable to damnation, but shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be damned for <hi>Adams</hi> sin, then
all the children of Heathens dying
in their infancy, shall escape as well
as baptized Christian children:
which if any of my disagreeing
Brethren shall affirm, he will
indeed seem to magnifie Gods
goodness, but he must fall out with
some great Doctors of the Church
whom he would pretend to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and besides, he will be hard
put to it, to tell what advantage
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36649:37"/>
Christian children have over Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
supposing them all to die
young; for being bred up in the
Christian Religion is accidental,
and may happen to the children of
unbelievers, or may not happen to
the children of believers; and if
Baptisme addes nothing to their
present state, there is no reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
should be baptized; but if it
does add to their present capacity
(as most certainly it does very
much) then that Heathen infants,
should be in a condition of being
rescued from the wrath of God,
as well as Christian Infants,
is a strange unlookt for affirmative,
and can no way be justified or
made probable, but by affirming it
to be against the justice of God to
condemn any for <hi>Adams</hi> sin. Indeed
if it be unjust (as I have proved it
is) then it will follow, that none
shall suffer damnation by it. But if
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36649:38"/>
the hopes of the salvation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
infants be to be derived onely
from Gods goodnesse, though
Gods goodnesse cannot fail, yet
our argument may fail; for it
will not follow, because God is
good, therefore Heathen infants
shall be saved: for it might as well
follow, God is good, therefore
Heathens shal be no heathens, but all
turn Christians. These things do not
follow affirmatively. But negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they do. For if it were against
Gods Goodnesse that they should
be reckoned in <hi>Adam</hi> unto eternal
death, then it is also against his
Justice, and against God all the
way; and then, either we should
finde some revelation of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in Scripture, or at least, there
would be no principle (such as is this
pretence of being guilty of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in <hi>Adam</hi>) to contest against
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:36649:38"/>7. But to come yet closer to the
Question, some Good Men and wise
suppose, that the <hi>Sublapsarian</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
can be confuted in their
pretended grounds of absolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
although we grant that
<hi>Adams</hi> sinne is damnable to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
provided we say, that though
it was damnable, yet it shall never
damne us. Now though I wish it
could be done, that they and I
might not differ so much as in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
yet <hi>first</hi> it is certain that
the men they speake of can never be
confuted upon the stock of Gods
Justice, because as the one saies, it is
just that God should actually damn
all for the sin of <hi>Adam:</hi> So the other
saies, it is just that God should actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
sentence all to damnation; and
so there the case is equall: <hi>Secondly,</hi>
they cannot be confuted upon the
stock of Gods goodnesse; because
the emanations of that being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36649:39"/>
arbitrary, and though there are
negative measures of it, as there is
of Gods Infinity, and we know Gods
goodness to be inconsistent with
some things, yet there are no positive
measures of this goodnesse; and no
man can tell how much it will do
for us: and therefore without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
things may be sometimes
hoped, which yet may not be presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
and therefore here also they
are not to be confuted: and as for
the particular Scriptures, unlesse we
have the advantage of essentiall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
taken from the divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
they will oppose Scripture
to Scripture, and have as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to expound the opposite
places, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> have in their
Questions of the Messias; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>si meos ipse corymbos necterem,</hi> if
I might make mine own arguments
in their society, and with their leave;
I would upon that very account su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36649:39"/>
the usuall discourses of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and Oeconomy of Originall
sinne.</p>
                  <p>8. For where will they reckon
the beginning of Predestination? will
they reckon it in <hi>Adam</hi> after the fall,
or in Christ immediately promised?
If in <hi>Adam,</hi> then they return to the
Presbyterian way, and run upon
all the rocks before reckoned, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to break all the World in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
If in Christ they reckon it (and
so they do) then thus I argue. If we
are all reckoned in Christ before we
were borne, then how can we
be reckoned in <hi>Adam</hi> when we are
born I speak as to the matter of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination
to salvation, or damnati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on;
For as for the intermedial tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
evills, and dangers spirituall,
and sad infirmities, they are our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and might with Justice have
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36649:40"/>
been all the portion God had given
to <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore may be so to
us, and consequently not at all to be
reckoned in this inquiry: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
as to the maine.</p>
                  <p>9. If God lookes upon us all in
Christ, then by him we are rescued
from <hi>Adam;</hi> so much is done for us
before we were born. For if this is
not to be reckoned till after we
were borne, then <hi>Adam's</hi> sin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
really in some periods, and to
some effects for which God in
Christ had provided no remedie:
for it gave no remedie to children
till after they were born, but irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediably
they were born children
of wrath; For if a remedy were
given to children before they were
born, then they are born in Christ
not in <hi>Adam;</hi> but if this remedy
was not given to children before
they were born, then it followes,
that we were not at first looked
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36649:40"/>
upon in Christ, but in <hi>Adam,</hi> and
consequently he was <hi>caput praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinationis</hi>
the head of predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or else there were two; the one
before we were born, the other
after. So that <hi>haeret lethalis arundo:</hi>
The arrow sticks fast and it cannot
be pulled out, unlesse by other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
then are commonly in
fashion. However it be, yet me
thinks this a very good probable
argument.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Adam</hi> sinned before any childe
was born, so was Christ promised
before; and that our Redeemer
shall not have more force upon
children, that they should be born
beloved and quitted from wrath,
then <hi>Adam</hi> our Progenitor shall
have to cause that we be born ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and in a damnable condition,
wants so many degrees of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that it seems to dishonour
the mercy of God, and the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36649:41"/>
of his goodesse and the power
of his redemption.</p>
                  <p>For this serves as an Antidote,
and Antinomy of their great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
pretended by these learned
persons: for whereas they say,
they the rather affirm this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is an honour to the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which our Saviour wrought
for us, that it rescued us from the
sentence of damnation, which we
had incurred. To this I say, that
the honour of our blessed Saviour
does no way depend upon our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
and weak propositions:
and neither can the reputation and
honour of the Divine goodnesse
borrow aids and artificial supports
from the dishonour of his Justice;
and it is no reputation to a Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to say he hath cured us of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
which we never had; and shall
we accuse the Father of mercies to
have wounded us for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36649:41"/>
but that the son may have the
Honour to have cured us? I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not that. He that makes a
necessity that he may finde a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
is like the <hi>Roman</hi> whom <hi>Cato</hi>
found fault withal; he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a fault that he might begge a
pardon; he had rather write bad
Greek, that he might make an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
then write good latine, and
need none. But however; Christ
hath done enough for us; even all
that we did need, and since it is all
the reason in the World we should
pay him all honour; we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that it is a greater favour
to us that by the benefit of our
Blessed Saviour, who was the Lamb
slain from the beginning of the
world, we were reckoned in Christ,
and born in the accounts of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
favour; I say, it is a greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that we were born under the
redemption of Christ, then under
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36649:42"/>
the sentence and damnation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi>
and to prevent an evil is a
greater favour then to cure it; so
that if to do honour to Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and to the graces of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
we will suppose a need,
we may do him more honour to
suppose that the promised seed of
the woman did do us as early a
good, as the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> could do
us mischief; and therefore that in
Christ we are born, quitted from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such supposed sentence, and not
that we bring it upon our shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
into the World with us. But
this thing relies onely upon their
suppositions,</p>
                  <p>For if we will speak of what is
really true and plainly revealed:
From all the sins of all mankinde
Christ came to redeem us: He
came to give us a supernatural
birth: to tell us all his Fathers
will; to reveal to us those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36649:42"/>
promises upon the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which we might be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to do every thing that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
He came to bring us grace,
and life, and spirit; to strengthen
us against all the powers of Hell
and Earth; to sanctifie our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which from <hi>Adam</hi> by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
generation descended on us; to
take cut the sting of death, to
make it an entrance to immortal
life; to assure us of resurrection,
to intercede for us, and to be an
advocate for us, when we by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
commit sin; to pardon us
when we repent. Nothing of
which could be derived to us from
<hi>Adam</hi> by our natural generation;
Mankinde now, taking in his whole
constitution, and designe, is like
the Birds of <hi>Paradice</hi> which travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
tell us of in the <hi>Molucco Islands;</hi>
born without legs; but by a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
power they have a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36649:43"/>
made to them for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
and they alwayes hover in
the air, and feed on the dew of
heaven: so are we birds of <hi>Paradice;</hi>
but cast out from thence, and born
without legs, without strength to
walk in the laws of God, or to go
to heaven; but by a power from
above, we are adopted in our new
birth to a celestial conversation, we
feed on the dew of heaven, <hi>the just
does <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>live <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oy faith,</hi> and breaths in
this new life by the spirit of God.
For from the first <hi>Adam</hi> nothing
descended to us but an infirm body,
and a naked soul, evil example
and a body of death, ignorance
and passion, hard labor and a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
field, a captive soul and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
body, that is, a soul na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
apt to comply with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
of the body, and its desires
whether reasonable or excessive:
and though these things were not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36649:43"/>
direct sins to us in their natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
and first principle, yet there
are proper inherent miseries and
principles of sin to us in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation.
But from this state,
Christ came to redeem us all by
his grace, and by his spirit, by his
life and by his death, by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and by his Sacraments, by his
promises and by his revelations,
by his resurrection and by his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
by his interceding for us and
judging of us; and if this be not a
conjugation of glorious things great
enough to amaze us, and to merit
from us all our services, and all
our love, and all the glorifications
of God, I am sure nothing can be
added to it by any supposed need
of which we have no revelation:
There is as much done for us as we
could need, and more then we could

                  <p>I have now Madam given to your

added to my other papers, may
satisfie not onely your Ladiship, but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36649:45"/>
those to whom this account may be
communicated. I shall onely now
beg your patience, since your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
hath been troubled with Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
and inquiries, and objections,
and little murmurs to hear my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to such of them as have been
brought to me.</p>
                  <p>1. I am complained of, that I would
trouble the World with a new
thing; which let it be never so true,
yet unlesse it were very useful, will
hardly make recompence for the
trouble I put the world to, in this
inquiry.</p>
                  <p>I answer; that for the newnesse
of it; I have already given accounts
that the opinions which I impugne,
as they are no direct parts of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Original sin, so they are
newer then the truth which I have
asserted. But let what I say seem as
new as the reformation did, when
<hi>Luther</hi> first preached against indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36649:45"/>
the presence of Novelty
did not, and we say, ought not to
have affrighted him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ought also to look to what I
say, that it be true, and the truth
will proove its age. But to speak
freely Madam, though I have a
great reverence for Antiquity, yet
it is the prime antiquity of the
Church; the ages of Martyrs and
Holinesse, that I mean; and I am
sure that in them, my opinion hath
much more warrant then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
But for the descending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
I give that veneration to the
great names of them that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, which themselves gave to
their Predecessors; I honour their
memory, I read their books, I imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their piety, I examine their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments;
for therefore they did
write them, and where the reasons
of the Moderns and their's seeme
equall, I turn the ballance on
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36649:46"/>
the elder side, and follow them; but
where a scruple or a grane of reason
is evidently in the other ballance; I
must follow that. <hi>Nempe qui ante

ever it is; certainly it will be lesse
expected from me to follow the
popular noises and the voices of the
people, who are not to teach us, but
to be taught by us: and I believe my
self to have reason to complain
when men are angry at a doctrine
because it is not commonly taught;
that is, when they are impatient to
be taught a truth, because most men
do already believe a lie; <hi>recti apud

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36649:47"/>
follow an unusuall truth; <hi>quasi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestius

it were well to do so in those propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions

but that they are usuall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But what necessity is
there in my publication of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
supposing it were true; for
all truths are not to be spoken at all
times; and if a truth gives offence, it
is better to let men alone, then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the peace.</p>
                  <p>I answer with the labouring mans
Proverb; a pennyworth of ease is
worth a Penny at any time; and a
little truth is worth a little Peace, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day of the weeke: &amp; <hi>caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rióus,</hi>
Truth is to be preferred before
Peace; not every trifling truth to a
considerable peace: but if the truth
be material, it makes recompence,
though it brings a great noise along
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36649:48"/>
with it; and if the breach of Peace
be nothing but that men talke in
Private, or declame a little in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke;
truly then (Madam) it is a
very pittifull little proposition, the
discovery of which in truth will not
make recompence for the pratling
of disagreeing Persons. Truth and
Peace make an excellent yoke; but
the <hi>truth of God</hi> is alwayes to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before <hi>the Peace of men,</hi> and
therefore our Blessed Saviour came
<hi>not to send Peace, but a sword;</hi> That is,
he knew his doctrine would cause
great devisions of heart; but yet he
came to perswade us to Peace and
Unity. Indeed if the truth be cleare,
and yet of no great effect in the lives
of men, in government, or in the
honour of God, then it ought not
to break the Peace; That is, it
may not run out of its retirement,
to disquiet them, to whom their rest
is better then that knowledge. But if
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36649:48"/>
it be brought out already, it must
not be deserted positively, though
peace goes away in its stead. So that
peace is rather to be <hi>deserted,</hi> then any
truth should be <hi>renounced</hi> or <hi>denied;</hi>
but Peace is rather to be <hi>procured</hi> or
<hi>continued,</hi> then some truth offer'd.
This is my sence (Madam) when the
case is otherwise then I suppose it
to be at present. For as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case, there must be two when
there is a falling out, or a peace bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and therefore I will secure it
now; for let any man dissent from
me in this Article, I will not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at him; he may doe it with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and with my charity. If any
man is of my opinion, I confesse I
love him the better; but if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
it, I will not love him lesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then I did before: but he that
dissents, and reviles me, must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from me no other kindness but
that I forgive him, and pray for him,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36649:49"/>
and offer to reclaim him, and that I
resolve nothing shall ever make me
either hate him, or reproach him:
and that still in the greatest of his
difference, I refuse not to give him
the communion of a Brother; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
I shall be chidden by some or
other for my easinesse, and want of
fierceness, which they call Zeal, but
it is a fault of my nature; a part of
my Original sin:

more then thus; I suppose the truth

which I publish will do more then
make recompence for the noise that
in Clubs and Conventicles is made
over and above. So long as I am thus
resolved; there may be injury done
to me, but there can be no duell, or
losse of Peace abroad. For a single
anger, or a displeasure on one side,
is not a breach of peace on both; and
a Warre cannot be made by fewer,
then a bargain can; in which alwaies
there must be two at least.</p>

edification is there, what
good to souls, what honour to God
by this new explication of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle?
I answer; that the usuall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Originall sinne are made
the great foundation of the horrible
proposition concerning absolute
Reprobation; the consequences of
it<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> reproach God with injustice,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36649:50"/>
they charge God foolishly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
his Goodness and his Wisdom in
many instances: and whatsoever can
upon the account of the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
be objected against the
fierce way of Absolute Decrees; all
that can be brought for the reproof
of their usuall Propositions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Originall sinne. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
are plaine; and by them
the necessity of my Doctrine, and its
usefulnesse may be understood.</p>
                  <p>For 1. If God decrees us to be
born sinners; Then he makes us to
be sinners: and then where is his
goodnesse?</p>
                  <p>2. If God does damne any for
that, he damnes us for what we
could not help, and for what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
did, and then where is his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice?</p>
                  <p>3. If God sentence us to that
Damnation, which he cannot in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
inflict, where is his Wisdome?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:36649:50"/>4. If God for the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi>
brings upon us a necessity of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
where is our liberty? where is
our Nature? what is become of all
Lawes, and of all Vertue and vice?
How can men be distinguish'd from
Beasts: or the Vertuous from the
vitious?</p>
                  <p>5. If by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> we are
so wholly ruined in our faculties,
that we cannot do any good, but
must do evill; how shall any man
take care of his wayes? or how can
it be supposed he should strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all vice, when he can excuse
so much upon his Nature? or indeed
how shall he strive at all? for if all
actual sins are derived from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,
and then is unavoidable, and
yet an Unresistable cause, then no
man can take care to avoid any actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sinne, whose cause is naturall, and
not to be declined. And then where
is his providence and Government?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:36649:51"/>6. If God does cast Infants into
Hell for the sinne of others, and yet
did not condemne Devills, but for
their owne sinne; where is his love
to mankind?</p>
                  <p>7. If God chooseth the death of
so many Millions of Persons who
are no sinners upon their own stock,
and yet sweares that he does not
love the death of a sinner, <hi>viz.</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with his owne choice; how can
that be credible, he should love to
kill Innocents, and yet should love
to spare the Criminall? where then
is his Mercie, and where is his
Truth?</p>
                  <p>8. If God hath given us a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by derivation, which is wholly
corrupted, then how can it be that
all which God made is good? for
though <hi>Adam</hi> corrupted himself, yet
in propriety of speaking, we did
not; but this was the Decree of God;
and then where is the excellency of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36649:51"/>
his providence and Power, where is
the glory of the Creation?</p>
                  <p>Because therefore that God is all
<hi>goodness,</hi> and <hi>justice,</hi> and <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
and <hi>love,</hi> and that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
all things, and all men
wisely and holily, and according to
the capacities of their natures and
Persons; that he gives us a wise law,
and binds that law on us by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and threatnings; I had reason to
assert these glories of the Divine
Majestie, and remove the hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a good life; since every thing
can hinder us from living well, but
scar cely can all the Arguments of
God and man, and all the Powers
of heaven and hell perswade us to
strictnesse and severity.</p>

Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did believe that all
those horrid things were chargable
upon Transubstantiation, and upon
worshipping of Images, which we
charge upon the Doctrines, I doe
not doubt but they would as much
disowne the Proposition, as now
they doe the consequents; and yet I
doe as little doubt but that we do
well to disown the first, because we
espy the latter: and though the Man
be not, yet the doctrines are highly
chargable with the evils that follow
it may be the men espy them not;
yet from the doctrines they do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
follow; and there are not it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36649:53"/>
the World many men who owne
that is evil in the pretence, but many
doe such as are dangerous in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
and this doctrine which I have
reproved, I take to be one of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. But if Originall sinne
be not a sinne properly, why are
children baptized? and what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
comes to them by baptisme?</p>
                  <p>I Answer, as much as they need,
and are capable of: and it may as
well be asked, Why were all the
sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> circumcised, when
in that Covenant there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins at all; for little
things and legal impurities, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
there were; but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no sacrifice there but of beasts,
whose blood could not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
sinne, it is certaine and plainly
taught us in Scripture, that no Rite
of <hi>Moses</hi> was expiatory of sinnes.
But secondly. This Objection can
presse nothing at all; for why was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36649:53"/>
Christ baptized, who knew no sinne?
But yet so it behoved him to fulfill
all Righteousnesse. 3. Baptisme is
called <hi>regeneration,</hi> or the <hi>new birth;</hi>
and therefore, since in <hi>Adam</hi>
Children are borne onely to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life and a Naturall death, and by
this they can never arrive at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
therefore Infants are baptized,
because untill they be borne anew,
they can never have title to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Jesus Christ, or be heirs of
heaven, and coheir's of Jesus. 4. By
Baptisme Children are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the holy Ghost, and of the
grace of God; which I desire to be
observed in opposition to the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
Heresy, who did suppose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be so perfect, that the Grace
of God was not necessary, and that
by Nature alone, they could go to
heaven; which because I affirm to
be impossible, and that Baptisme is
therfore necessary, because nature is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36649:54"/>
insufficient, and Baptisme is the
great chanel of grace; there ought
to be no envious and ignorant load
laid upon my Doctrine, as if it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> against
which it is so essentially and so
mainly opposed in the main diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of his Doctrine. 5. Children
are therefore Baptized, because if
they live they will sinne, and though
their sins are not pardoned before
hand, yet in Baptisme they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to that state of favour, that
they are within the Covenant of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Pardon: and this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
the Doctrine of St. <hi>Austin, lib.
1. de nupt. &amp; concup. cap. 26. &amp; cap.
33. &amp; tract. 124. in Johan.</hi> But of
this I have already given larger ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
in my Discourse of Baptisme.
<hi>part. 2 p. 194.</hi> in the great Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar.
6. Children are baptized for
the Pardon even of Originall sin;
this may be affirmed <hi>truly,</hi> but yet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36649:54"/>
                     <hi>improperly:</hi> for so far as it is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so farr also it is remissible; for
the evill that is done by <hi>Adam,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
taken away in Christ; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us to very evill purposes, as
I have already explicated: but as it
was among the <hi>Jewes</hi> who believed
then the sinne to be taken away,
when the evill of punishment is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off; so is Originall sinne taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in Baptisme; for though the
Material part of the evill, is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, yet the curse in all the
sons of God is turn'd into a blessing,
and is made an occasion of reward,
or an entrance to it. Now in all this
I affirme all that is true, and all that
is probable: for in the same sense,
as Originall staine is a sinne, so does
Baptisme bring the Pardon. It is a
sinne metonymically, that is, because
it is the effect of one sinne, and the
cause of many; and just so in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
it is taken away, that it is now
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36649:55"/>
the matter of a grace, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of glory; and upon these
Accounts the Church Baptizes all
her Children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5. But to deny Originall
sinne to be a sinne properly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently,
is expressly against the
words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 5. Chapter to
the <hi>Romanes, If it bee, I have done;
but that it is not, I have these things to
say.</hi> 1. If the words be capable of
any interpretation, and can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to signifie otherwise then is
vulgarly pretended, I suppose my
self to have given reasons sufficient,
why they ought to be. For any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
that does violence to
right Reason, to Religion, to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of life, and the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God, is therefore to be
rejected, and another chosen; For in
all Scriptures, all good and all wise
men doe it.</p>
                  <p>2. The words in question [<hi>sin</hi>]
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36649:55"/>
and [<hi>sinner</hi>] and [<hi>condemnation</hi>]
are frequently used in Scripture in
the lesser sense, and
[<hi>sin</hi>] is taken for the
punishment of <hi>sin;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings. 1. 21. Zech. 14. 19. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Isai. 53. 10. Hebr. 9. 28. 1 Kings. 1. 21.</note>
and [<hi>sin</hi> is taken for
him who bore the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of the <hi>sinne,</hi> and
[<hi>sin</hi>] is taken for le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
impurity; and for him who
could not be guilty, even for
Christ himself; as I have proved
already: and in the like manner
[<hi>sinners</hi>] is used, by the rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugates
and denominatives; but it
is so also in the case, of <hi>Bathsheba</hi>
the Mother of <hi>Solomon.</hi> 3. For the
word [<hi>condemnation,</hi>] it is by the
Apostle himself limited to signifie
his temporal death; for when the
Apostle sayes <hi>Death passed upon all
men, in as much as all men have sinned;</hi>
he must mean <hi>temporal death;</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
death did not passe upon all
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36649:56"/>
men; and if he means <hi>eternal death</hi>
he must not mean that it came for
<hi>Adams</hi> sin; but <hi>in as much as all
men have sinned,</hi> that is, upon all
those upon whom eternal death
did come, it came because they also
have sinned. 4. The Apostle here
speaks of sin <hi>imputed;</hi> therefore
not of sin <hi>inherent:</hi> and if imputed
onely to such purposes as he here
speaks of, <hi>viz.</hi> to temporal death,
then it is neither a sin properly,
nor yet imputable to Eternal death
so far as is or can be inplyed by
the Apostles words. 5. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
sayes; <hi>by the disobedience of
one many were made sinners:</hi> so that
it appears that we in this have no
sin of our own, neither is it at all
our own <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>inherently;</hi>
for though efficiently it was his, and
effectively ours as to certain pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of imputation; yet it could
not be a sin to us formally; because
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36649:56"/>
it was <hi>Vnius inobedientia,</hi> the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
of one man, therefore
in no sense, could it be <hi>properly</hi> ours.
6. Whensoever another mans sin
is imputed to his relative, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
because it is anothers and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
it can go no further but to
effect certain evils to afflict the
relative, but to punish the cause;
not formally to denominate the
descendant or relative to be a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
for it is as much a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to say that I am formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by him a sinner, as that I
did really do his action. Now <hi>to
impute</hi>] in Scripture, it signifies to
reckon as if he had done it; <hi>Not
to impute</hi> is to treate him so
as if he had not done it. So far
then as the imputation is, so far
we are reckoned as sinners; but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
sin being by the Apostle sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
to be imputed but to the
condemnation or sentence to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:36649:57"/>
death; so far we are sinners
in him, that is, so as that for his
sake death was brought upon us;
And indeed the word [<hi>imputare</hi>]
to impute] does never signifie more,
nor alwayes so much. <hi>Imputare
verò frequenter ad significationem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrantis
accedit, sed citra reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionem,</hi>
sayes <hi>Laurentius valla;</hi> It is
like an exprobation, but short of
a reproof; so <hi>Quintilian. Imput as
nobis propitios ventos, &amp; secundum
mare, ac civitatis opulentae liberalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi>
Thou doest impute, that is,
upbraid to us our prosperous voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
and a calm Sea, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
of a rich City. <hi>Imputare</hi>
signifies oftentimes the same that
<hi>computare;</hi> to reckon or account:
<hi>Nam haec in quartâ non imputantur,</hi>
say the Lawyers, <hi>they are not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
that is, they are not computed or
reckoned. Thus <hi>Adams</hi> sin is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us, that is, it is put into our
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:36649:57"/>
reckoning, &amp; when we are sick and
die, we pay our Symbols, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of evil that is laid upon us: and
what <hi>Marcus</hi> said, I may say in this
case with a little variety <hi>legata in hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditate—sive
legatum datum sit hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redi,
sive percipere, sive deducere vel
retinere passus est, ei imputantur:</hi> the
the legacy whether it be given or
left to the heire, whether he may
take it or keep it, is still imputed
to him; that is, <hi>it is within his
reckoning</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But no reason, no Scripture, no
Religion does inforce; and no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Attribute does permit that we
should say that God did so impute
<hi>Adams</hi> sin to his posterity, that he
di really esteem them to be guilty
of <hi>Adams</hi> sin; equally culpable,
equally hateful; For if in this sense
it be true that in him we sinned;
then we sinn'd as he did, that is, with
the same malice, in the same acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:36649:58"/>
and then we are as much guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as he; but if we have sinned lesse,
then we did not <hi>sin in him;</hi> for to
sinne in him, could not by him be
lessen'd to us; for what we did in
him we did by him, and therefore
as much as he did; but if God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
this sin lesse to us then to
him, then this imputation supposes
it onely to be a collateral and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
account to such purposes as
he pleased: of which purposes we
judge by the analogy of faith, by
the words of Scripture, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
and notices of the Divine
Attributes. 7. There is nothing in
the designe or purpose of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
that can or ought to infer
any other thing; for his purpose is
to signifie that by mans sin death
entred into the world; which the
son of <hi>Sirach Ecclus.</hi> 25. 33. expresses
thus; <hi>à muliere factum est initium
peccati, &amp; inde est quod morimur;</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:36649:58"/>
from the woman is the beginning of
sinne; and from her it is that we all
die: and again, <hi>Ecclus. 1. 24. by the
envie of the Devil death came into
the world;</hi> this evil being Universal,
Christ came to the world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
our head, to other purposes,
even to redeem us from death;
which he hath begun and will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
and to become to us our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in a new birth, the Author of
a spiritual life; and this benefit is
of far more efficacy by Christ, then
the evil could be by <hi>Adam;</hi> and as
by <hi>Adam</hi> we are made sinners: so
by Christ we are made righteous;
not just so; but so and more, and
therefore, as our being made
sinners, signifies that by him we
die, so being by Christ made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
must at least signifie that by
him we live: and this is so evident
to them who read Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36649:59"/>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. from verse 12. to verse 19.
inclusively, that I wonder any man
should make a farther question
concerning them; especially since
<hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> who are to be
reckoned amongst the greatest, and
the best expositors of Scripture,
that any age since the Apostles
and their immediat successors hath
brought forth, have so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
and rendred it. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that your Honour may
read the words and their sense
together, and see that without
violence they signifie what I have
said, and no more; I have here
subjoyned a paraphrase of them;
in which if I use any violence
I can very easily be reproved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:36649:59"/>As by the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12. As by one man sinne entred into the world, and Death by sin: and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</note>
sin had it's

of death, sicknesse, calamity, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution

and all the affections of
Mortality, for the destroying of
our temporall life; and so this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and condition or state of
death pass'd actually upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
for <hi>Adam</hi> being thrown out of
paradise, and forc'd to live with his
Children where they had no trees
of Life, as he had in Paradise, was
remanded to his mortall, naturall
state; and therefore death passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, mortally seized on all; <hi>for
that all have sinned;</hi> that is, the sin
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36649:60"/>
was reckoned to all, not to make
them guilty like <hi>Adam;</hi> but <hi>Adams</hi>
sinne passed upon all, imprinting
this real calamity on us all: But yet
death descended also upon <hi>Adams</hi>
Posterity for their own sins; for since
all did sinne, all should die.</p>
                  <p>And mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
not that
Death did
presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
on all
mankind,<note place="margin">13. For untill the law, sin was in the World, but sin is not imputed where there is no law.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before a Law was given them
with an appendant penalty, <hi>viz.</hi>
With the expresse intermination of
death; For they did do actions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
and vile enough, but yet
these things which afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the publication of the Law were
imputed to them upon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
account, even unto death, <hi>were
not yet so imputed.</hi> For Nature alone
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36649:60"/>
gives Rules, but does not directly
bind to penalties. But death came
upon them before the Law for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
sin; for with him God being
angry, was pleased to curse him also
in his Posterity, and leave them also
in their meere naturall condition, to
which yet they dispos'd themselves,
and had deserved but too much by
committing evill things; to which
things, although before the law,
death was not threatned, yet for the
anger which God had against man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
he left that death which he
threatned to <hi>Adam expresly,</hi> by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi>

did, who had no excuse, many

advantages, trifling temptations,

                     </gap>,
it looked forwards as
well as backwards, and became a
type of Christ, or of him that was to
come. For as from <hi>Adam</hi> evill did
descend upon his naturall Children,
upon the account of Gods enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with <hi>Adam;</hi> so did good
descend upon the spirituall Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the second <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:36649:62"/>This should
have been the
latter part of a
similitude,<note place="margin">15. But not as the offence, so also is the free gift: for if through the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one many be dead much more the grace of God, &amp; the gift by grace, which is by one man Jesus Christ hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> but
upon further
consideration, it
is found, that as
in <hi>Adam</hi> we die,
so in Christ we
live, and much
rather, and
much more,
therefore I cannot say, <hi>As by one
man</hi> [vers. 12] <hi>so by one man</hi> [verse
15.] <hi>But much more;</hi> for not as the
offence, so also is the free gift, for
the offence of one did run over unto
many, and those many, even as it
were all, all except <hi>Enoch,</hi> or some
very few more of whom mention
peradventure is not made, are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
dead upon that account, but
when God comes by Jesus Christ
to shew mercy to mankind, he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36649:62"/>
does it in much more abundance;
he may be angry to the third and
fourth generation, in them that
hate him, but he will shew mercy
unto thousands in them that love
him; to a thousand generations, and
and in ten thousand degrees; so that
now although a comparison pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
was at first intended, yet
the river here rises far higher
then the fountain; and now no
argument can be drawn from the
similitude of <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ, but
that as much hurt was done to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature by <hi>Adams</hi> sin, so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much more good is done to
mankinde by the incarnation of the
Son of God.</p>

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:36649:63"/>And the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity

is in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:

                     </gap>,<note place="margin">16. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the judgement was by one to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification</note>

by one
man sinning one
sin; that one sin
was imputed; but
by Christ, not onely one sin was
forgiven freely, but many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were remitted unto justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and secondly, a vast disparity
there is in this; that the descendants
from <hi>Adam</hi> were perfectly like him
in nature, his own real natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
and they sinned (though
not so bad) yet very much, and
therefore there was a great parity
of reason that the evil which was
threatened to <hi>Adam,</hi> and not to his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36649:63"/>
children should yet for the likeness
of nature and of sin descend upon
them. But in the other part the
case is highly differing; for Christ
being our Patriarch in a spiritual
birth, we fall infinitely short of
him, and are not so like him as we
were to <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet that we in
greater unlikelinesse should receive
a greater favour, this was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of the comparison, and this is
the free gift of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:36649:64"/>And this is the
third degree, or
measure of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of efficacy
on Christs part,
over it was on the
part of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">17. For if by one offence [so it is in the Kings MS. or,] if by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ.</note>
For if the sin of
<hi>Adam</hi> alone could
bring death upon
the world, who
by imitation of
his transgression
on the stock of
their own natural
choice did sin against God, though
not after the similitude of <hi>Adams</hi>
transgression: much more shall we,
who not onely receive the aides of
the spirit of grace, but receive them
also in an abundant measure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
also the effect of all this, even
to reign in life by one Jesus Christ.</p>

by <hi>Adam;</hi> yet the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and comparison lies in the

and life from the other; [<hi>judgement
unto condemnation</hi>] that is, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death came upon all men
by the offence of one; even so,
by a like Oeconomy and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
God would not be behind in

judgement was not to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

by the offence of one: so the
free gift, and grace came upon all
to justification of life, by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse

                  <p>The sum of all is
this; by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
of one

that God could be the Author of
a sin to any, but that he appointed

be on the other side; for by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of one, even of Christ, many
shall be made, or constituted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
But still this must be with a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of what was said before,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36649:65"/>
that there was a vast difference; for
we are made much more righteous
by Christt,<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hen we were sinners by
<hi>Adam;</hi> and the life we receive by
Christ shall be greater then the
death by <hi>Adam;</hi> and the graces we
derive from Christ, shall be more
and mightier then the corruption
and declination by <hi>Adam;</hi> but yet
as one is the head, so is the other:
one is the beginning of sinne and
death, and the other of life and
righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Now the consequent of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
must needs at least be this;
that it is impossible that the greatest
part of mankinde should be left in
the eternal bonds of hell by <hi>Adam;</hi>
for then quite contrary to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the Apostle, there had
been abundance of sin, but a scarcity
of grace; and the accesse had been
on the part of <hi>Adam,</hi> not on the
part of Christ, against which he so
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36649:66"/>
mightily and artificially contends:
so that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
condemned by this discourse
of the Apostle; and the other more
gentle way, which affirmes that we
were sentenc'd in <hi>Adam</hi> to eternal
death, though the execution is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off by Christ, is also no way
countenanced by any thing in this
Chapter; for that the judgement
which for <hi>Adams</hi> sin came unto
the condemnation of the world,
was nothing but <hi>temporal death,</hi> is
here affirmed; it being in no sense
imaginable that the death which
here Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes <hi>passed upon all
men,</hi> and which <hi>reigned from Adam</hi>
to <hi>Moses,</hi> should be eternal death;
for the Apostle speaks of that death
which was threatened to <hi>Adam;</hi>
and of such a death which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
threatened in <hi>Moses</hi> Law;
and such a death which fell even
upon the most righteous of <hi>Adams</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:36649:66"/>
posterity, <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusela,</hi>
that is, upon them who did
not sin after the similitude of <hi>Adams</hi>
transgression. Since then, all the
judgement which the Apostle saies,
came by the sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
affirmed to be death tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that God should sentence man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
to eternal damnation for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
sin, though in goodnesse tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
Christ he afterwards took it
off; is not at all affirm'd by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle;
and because in proportion
to the evil, so was the imputation
of the sin, it follows that <hi>Adams</hi>
sin is ours metonymically and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly;
God was not finally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with us, nor had so much as any
designes of eternal displeasure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account; his anger went
no further then the evils of this
life, and therefore the imputation
was not of a proper guilt, for that
might justly have passed beyond
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36649:67"/>
our grave; if the sin had passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
a metonymie, or a juridical,
external imputation. And of this
God and Man have given this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
testimony; that as no man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
imposed penance for it; so God
himself in nature did never for
it afflict or affright the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and yet the Conscience ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spares any man that is guilty of
a known sin.</p>

scares him with an impertinent

should not naturally be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for it, nor so much as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally

yet make any reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
save this onely, that it is
not properly a sin, but onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymicall
and improperly. And
indeed there are some whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which think themselves so
little concern'd in the matter of
Original sin, that they have not a
word of it in all their Theology:
I mean the Christians in the <hi>East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies,</hi>
concerning whom <hi>Fryer Luys
de Urretta</hi> in his Ecclesiastical story
of <hi>AEthiopia,</hi> saies, that the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in <hi>AEthiopia,</hi> unde the Empire of
<hi>Prestre Juan,</hi> never kept the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
conception of the <hi>Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
[no se entremetieron enessas Teolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias
del peccado Original: porque nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
tuvieron los entendimientes may
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:36649:68"/>
metafisicos, antes como gente afable,
benigna, Uana, de entendimientos
conversables, y alaguenos, seguian la
dotrina de los Santos antiguos, y de los
sagrados Concilies, sin disputas, ni
diferencias</hi>] nor do they insert into
their Theology any propositions
concerning Original sin, nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themselves with such Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
contemplations; but being of
an affable, ingenuous, gentile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
and understanding, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Doctrine of the primitive
Saints and Holy Councels without
disputation of difference, so sayes
the story. But we unfortunatly
trouble our selves by raising ideas
of sin, and afflict our selves with our
own dreams, and will not beleeve
but it is a vision. And the height of
this imgination hath wrought so
high in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
when they would do great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> they were
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36649:68"/>
pleas'd to allow to her an immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
conception without any Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin, and a Holy-day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the celebration of the
dream. But the Christians in the
other world are wiser, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themselves with none of these
things, but in simplicity, honour
the Divine attributes, and speak
nothing but what is easy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
And indeed religion is
then the best, and the world will
be sure to have fewer Atheists, and
fewer Blasphemers, when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
of witty men are not
tempted, by commanding them to
beleeve impossible articles, and
unintelligible propositions: when
every thing is believed by the same
simplicity it is taught: when we do
not cal that a mystery which we are
not able to prove, and tempt our
faith to swallow that whole which
reason cannot chew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:36649:69"/>One thing I am to observe more,
before I leave considering the
words of the Apostle. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
here having instituted a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
between <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ;
that as death came by one, so life
by the other; <hi>as by one we are
made sinners, so by the other we are
made righteous;</hi> some from hence
suppose they argue strongly
to the overthrow of all that I
have said; <hi>thus:</hi> Christ and <hi>Adam</hi>
are compared, therefore as by
Christ we are made really righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
so by <hi>Adam</hi> we are made
really sinners: our righteousnesse
by Christ is more then imputed,
and therefore so is our unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
by <hi>Adam</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> To this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what I have already spoken
in my humble addresses to that
wise and charitable Prelate the
Lord Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sense and objections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36649:69"/>
in which I have declared
my sense of the imputation of
Christ's righteousnesse; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that although the Apostle
offers at a similitude, yet he findes
himself surprised, and that one
part of the similitude does far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the other, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can follow hence; but that
if we receive evil from <hi>Adam,</hi>
we shall much more receive good
from Christ; besides this I say, I
have something very material to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the form of the argument,
which is a very trick and fallacy.
For the Apostle argues thus, <hi>As by
Adam we are made sinners, so by
Christ we are made righteous;</hi> and
that is very true, and much more;
but to argue from hence [as by
Christ we are made <hi>really righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
so by <hi>Adam</hi> we are made <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
sinners</hi>] is to invert the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Apostle, (who argues
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36649:70"/>
from the lesse to the greater) and
to make it conclude affirmatively
from the greater to the lesse in
matter of power: as if one should
say: If a childe can carry a ten
pound weight, much more can a
man: and therefore whatsoever a
man can do, that also a childe can
do. For though I can say, <hi>If this
thing be done in a green tree, what
shall be done in the dry?</hi> yet I must
not say therefore, <hi>If this be done in
the dry tree, what shall be done in
the green?</hi> for the dry try of the
Crosse could do much then the
green tree in the Garden of Eden.
It is a good argument to say; If the
Devil be so potent to do a shrewd
turn much more powerful is God
to do good: but we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from hence, but God can
by his own meer power, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
save a soul; therefore the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36649:70"/>
Devil can by his power ruine one:
In a similitude, the first part may
be, and often is, lesse then the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
but never greater: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though the Apostle said, <hi>as
by Adam &amp;c. So by Christ &amp;c.</hi> Yet
we cannot say <hi>as by Christ, so by
Adam:</hi> We may well reason thus.
As by Nature there is a reward
to evil doers; so much more is
there by God; but we cannot by
way of conversion, reason thus;
As by God there is an eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appointed to good actions;
so by Nature there is an Eternal
reward for evil ones. And who
would not deride this way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.
As by our Fathers we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
temporal good things; so
much more do we by God: but
by God we also receive an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Soul; therefore from our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
we receive an immortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36649:71"/>
For not the consequent of
a hypothetical proposition, but
the antecedent is to be the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of the Syllogisme; This
therefore is a fallacy, which when
those wise persons, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
perswaded by it, shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
I doubt not but the whole
way of arguing will appear uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object. 6.</hi> But it is objected that
my Doctrine is against the ninth
Article in the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
and that I heare Madam does
most of all stick with your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>Of this Madam, I should not
now have taken notice, because I
have already answered it in some
additional papers, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
published; but that I was so
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:36649:71"/>
delighted to hear and to know
that a person of your interest and
Honour, of your zeal and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is so earnest for the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> that I could not pass
it by, without paying you that
regard and just acknowledgment
which so much excellencie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.
But then Madam I am to
say, that I could not be delighted
in your zeal for our excellent
Church, if I were not as zealous
my self for it too: I have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
subscribed that Article, and
though if I had cause to dissent
from it, I would certainly do it
in those just measures which my
duty on one side, and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of truth on the other would
require of me; yet because I have
no reason to disagree, I will not
suffer my self to be supposed to
be of a Differing judgement from
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:36649:72"/>
my Dear Mother, which is the best
Church of the world. Indeed
Madam, I do not understand the
words of the Article as most men
do; but I understand them as they
can be true, and as they can ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fairely signifie, and as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the word of God and
right reason. But I remember
that I have heard from a very good
hand, and there are many alive this
day that may remember to have
heard it talk'd of publickly, that
when Mr. <hi>Thomas Rogers</hi> had in
the yeer 1584. published an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the 39. Articles, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were not onely then, but long
since very angry at him, that he by
his interpretation had limited the
charitable latitude which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in the subscription to them.
For the Articles being fram'd in a
Church but newly reform'd, in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:36649:72"/>
which many complied with some
unwillingnesse, and were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have their consent broken
by too great a straining, and even
in the Convocation it self so many
being of a differing judgement, it
was very great prudence and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to secure the peace of the Church
by as much charitable latitude as
they could contrive; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Articles in those things,
which were publickly disputed at
that time, even amongst the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Reformation (such
were the Articles of predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and this of Original sinne)
were described, with incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wisdom and temper; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have reason to take it ill, if
any man shall denie me liberty to
use the benefit of the Churches
wisdom; For I am ready a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times to subscribe the Article,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36649:73"/>
if there can be just cause to do it
so often; but as I impose upon no
man my sense of the Article, but
leave my reasons and him to
struggle together for the best, so
neither will I be bound to any one
man, or any company of men but
to my lawful Superiours, speaking
there where they can and ought to
oblige. Madam, I take nothing
ill from any man, but that he
should think I have a lesse zeal
for our Church then himself,
and I will by Gods assistance be all
my life confuting him; and though
I will not contend with him, yet
I will die with him in behalf of the
Church if God shall call me; but for
other little things and trifling ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
and little murmurs I value
none of it.</p>

                  <p>I Am not my self Ignorant, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
learned it from those, whose
words had in them reason and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
too, that the world is most
benefited by those pieces, which
with greatest difficulty were gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the modesty, or seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or fears of their Authors.
The fruits that first drop from the
tree, are not the longest ere they
rot, and the corn that lies longest
<pb facs="tcp:36649:76"/>
in the ground, <hi>bis quae solem, bis
frigora</hi>—most pleases the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man.
I have some confidence,
the Reader, who has yet given
his name to no sect, will by the
excellencies of this discourse I have
now presented, be so fairly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to receive my excuse, when
I tell him that I publish it without
the Reverend Authors consent, that
he will become rather a Patron than
an Accuser of that great ambition,
he observes in me, to offer some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that may instruct him, and
please him too. Because so many
papers passe the Presse, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to finde it the place of their
Burial rather than their birth, I was
persuaded, my Charity would have
in it something more of merit.
I intended a Benefit to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and if my designe meet with
reproof in the Successe, I am sure
<pb facs="tcp:36649:77"/>
it deserved none in its principle,
for I shall not misse my aims,
if his intentions in receiving instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
be but as cleer as mine were
to assist him in my meaner ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.
The Discourse in its own
behalf will to the Intelligent give
sufficient assurance, that though
the Authors consent be wanting,
nothing else is, that should come
from him to make it intire: for
I know what was fitted for the
use and made able to endure the
judgment of the Honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who was the occasion of this,
will with some security passe lesser
judgements. And this favour the
charitable Reader will the more
easily grant me, because it will
be a good advantage towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the favour of the worthy
Person, who wote the Discourse;
whose displeasure I have reason
<pb facs="tcp:36649:77"/>
to fear, I have too far provoked
by making his secrets publike
without his leave. But if the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Reader shall receive this
little piece with the same kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as the others, that were sent
from the same hand, the pleading
of my own cause will put me to
the lesse expence of words. And
I know the Reverend Author go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
all his passions with such an
excellent charity, and levels all his
designes of this kinde to that great
end of advancing piety, and holy
living, that my boldnesse will the
more easily find pardon, because the
right understanding of this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has a great influence upon all
the parts of holy obedience; and
the discourses of this Letter, I
have good authority to say, add
much to the clearnesse and defence
of his former writings upon this
<pb facs="tcp:36649:78"/>
Subject. The question as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be understood now, that
it is set on foot, so is it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to all those, that first choose
their interest, and then such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
as are consistent with that,
and frame their arguments and
premisses last of all. And no man
for this can charge me highly, but
he must also affirme, it is fit some
things be concealed, that would
free the judgements of men from
those prejudices of custome, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
and humour, with which
Error hath fortified her self in the
understandings of many. The er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of this question are so deere to
one kinde of men, that nothing
will more provoke their pens, then
to be contradicted in this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and for the advantage of
truth and the common benefit, it
was my designe, that whatsoever
<pb facs="tcp:36649:78"/>
was needful to be said to make the
truth more clear, might first get
possession of the understandings of
men. Which could not, certainly,
have been done if I had delayed
my hand, till I could, at that great
distance from me, where he lives,
have consulted with the Author,
and received returns from him.
And have no lesse hope, that the
Honourable Person, into whose
Cabinet I have too boldly admitted
the common eye, will pardon my
presumption, because it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Religion, which is so deer
to every rightly instructed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that they will neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
for its advancement to give
up their priviledges, nor their life.
And when she feels the benefit of
being free'd from those Scruples,
which this Discourse was designed
to remove, she will not conceive her
<pb facs="tcp:36649:79"/>
light will be made less by being
common, but will be rather plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to have obliged, by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations
of a Pen so learned,
all those that shall receive benefit
from it.</p>

                  <p>YOur Lordships Letter Dated
<hi>July</hi> 28. I received not till
<hi>Septemb.</hi> 11. it seems <hi>R. Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
detained it in his hands, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it could not come safely to
me while I remain a prisoner. But
I now have that liberty, that I can
receive any Letters, and send any;
for the Gentlemen under whose
custody I am, as they are carefull
of their charges, so they are civil
to my person. It was necessary I
should tell this to your Lordship,
that I may not be under a suspicion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36649:83"/>
of neglecting to give accounts in
those particulars, which with somuch
prudence and charity you were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to represent in your Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
my discourse of Original
Sin. My Lord, in all your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
I cannot but observe your
candor and your paternal care con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
me. For when there was
nothing in the Doctrine, but your
greater reason did easily see the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and the truth of it, and I am
perswaded could have taught me to
have said many more material things
in confirmation of what I have
taught; yet so careful is your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of me, that you would not
omit to represent to my considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
what might be said by captious
and weaker persons; or by the
more wise and pious who are of a
different judgement.</p>
                  <p>But my Lord, first you are pleased
to note that this discourse runs not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36649:83"/>
in the ordinary channel. True; for if it
did, it must nurse the popular error:
but when the disease is epidemical,
as it is so much the worse, so the
extraordinary remedy must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
to be the better. And
if there be in it some things hard to
be understood, as it was the fate of
S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles (as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
notes out of S. <hi>Peter</hi>) yet this
difficulty of understanding proceeds
not from the thing it self, nor from
the manner of handling it, but from
the indisposition and prepossession
of mens minds to the contrary,
who are angry when they are told
that they have been deceived: for
it is usuall with men to be more
displeased, when they are told they
were in error, then to be pleased
with them who offer to lead them
out of it.</p>
                  <p>But your Lordship doth with
great advantages represent an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36649:84"/>
of some captious persons,
which relates not to the material
part of the Question, but to the rules
of art. If there be no such thing as
Original Sin transmitted from <hi>Adam</hi>
to his posterity, then all that sixth
chapter is a strife about a shadow, a
<hi>Non ens.</hi> A. It is true my Lord, the
Question as it is usually handled, is
so. For when the Franciscan and
Dominican do eternally dispute
about the conception of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgin, whether it was with,
or without Original Sin, meaning by
way of grace and special exemption,
this is <hi>de non ente;</hi> for there was no
need of any such exemption: and
they supposing that commonly it
was otherwise, troubled themselves
about the exception of a Rule,
which in that sense which the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
it, was not true at all: she
was born as innocent from any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity
or formal guilt as <hi>Adam</hi> was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36649:84"/>
created, and so was her Mother, and
so was all her family. * When the
Lutheran and the Roman dispute,
whether justice and original righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
in <hi>Adam</hi> was Natural or
by Grace, it is <hi>de non ente:</hi> for it
was positively neither, but nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
only; he had original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
till he sin'd, that is, he was
righteous till he became unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
* When the Calvinist troubles
himself and his Parishioners with
fierce declamations against natural
inclinations or concupiscence, and
disputes whether it remains in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
persons, or whether it be taken
off by Election, or by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether to all Christians or
to some few; this is a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; for
it is no sin at all in persons baptiz'd
or unbaptiz'd, till it be consented to.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, when I was a young
man in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I knew a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
professor of Divinity, whose
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36649:85"/>
ordinary Lectures in the Lady <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets</hi>
Chair for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nine as I suppose, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
were concerning Original
Sin, and the appendant questions:
This indeed could not choose but
be <hi>Andabatarum conflictus.</hi> But
then my discourse representing that
these disputes are uselesse, and, as
they discourse usually, to be <hi>de non
ente,</hi> is not to be reprov'd. For I
professe to evince that many of those
things, of the sense of which they
dispute, are not true at all in any
sense, I declare them to be <hi>de non
ente,</hi> that is, I untie their intricate
knots by cutting them in pieces.
For when a false proposition is the
ground of disputes, the process must
needs be infinite, unless you disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the first error. He that tels
them they both fight about a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and with many arguments
proves the vanity of their whole
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36649:85"/>
processe, they (if he saies true) not
he is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. * When S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
was horribly puzled about the
traduction of Original Sin, and
thought himself forc'd to say that
either the Father begat the soul, or
that he could not transmit sin
which is subjected in the soul, or at
least he could not tell how it was
transmitted: he had no way to be
relieved but by being told that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Sin was not subjected in the
soul, because properly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
it was no reall sin of ours at
all; but that it was only by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to certain purposes, not
any inherent quality, or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and so in effect all his trouble
was <hi>de non ente.</hi> * But now some
wits have lately risen in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and they tell us another
story. The soul followes the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
of the body, and so Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sin comes to be transmitted by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36649:86"/>
contact: because the constitution
of the body is the <hi>fomes</hi> or nest of
the sin, and the souls concupiscence
is deriv'd from the bodies lust.
But besides that this fancy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears
at the first handling, and
there would be so many Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sins as there are several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
and the guilt would not
be equal, and they who are born
Eunuchs should be lesse infected by
<hi>Adam</hi>'s pollution, by having lesse
of concupiscence in the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of desires, [and after all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
it self could not be a sin
in the soul, till the body was grown
up to strength enough to infect it]
Besides all this, (I say) while one
does not know how Original Sin
can be derived, and another who
thinks he can, names a wrong way,
and both the waies infer it to be
another kinde of thing then all the
Schools of learning teach [and in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36649:86"/>
the whole process it must be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
thing, because the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which hath all its operations
by the force of the principal agent,
cannot of it self produce a great
change and violent effect upon the
principal agent] does it not too
clearly demonstrate, that all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
variety of fancies agreeing in
nothing but in an endless uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is nothing else but a being busie
about the quiddities of a dream, and
the constituent parts of a shadow?
But then, My Lord, my discourse
representing all this to be vanity and
uncertainty, ought not to be call'd
or suppos'd to be a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: as he
that ends the question between two
Schoolmen disputing about the
place of Purgatory, by saying they
need not trouble themselves about
the place; for that which is not, hath
no place at all; ought not to be told
he contends about a shadow, when he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36649:87"/>
proves that to be true, which he sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
to the two trifling litigants.</p>
                  <p>But as to the thing it self: I do
not say there is no such thing as
Original Sin, but it is not that which
it is supposed to be: it is not our
sin formally, but by imputation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and it is imputed so, as to be an
inlet to sickness, death and disorder:
but it does not introduce a necessity
of sinning, nor damn any one to
the flames of Hell. So that Original
Sin is not a <hi>Non ens,</hi> unless that be
nothing which infers so many real
mischiefs.</p>
                  <p>The next thing your Lordship
is pleas'd to note to me, is that in
your wisdome you foresee, some
will argue against my explication
of the word <hi>Damnation,</hi> in the ninth.
Article of our Church, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
that Original Sin deserves
damnation. Concerning which, My
Lord, I do thus (and I hope fairly)
acquit my self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:36649:87"/>1. That it having been affirmed
by S. <hi>Austin</hi> that Infants dying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized
are damn'd, he is deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <hi>Durus pater Infantum,</hi> and
generally forsaken by all sober men
of the later ages: and it will be an
intolerable thing to think the
Church of <hi>England</hi> guilty of that
which all her wiser sons, and all the
Christian Churches generally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre.
I remember that I have
heard that King <hi>James</hi> reproving a
Scottish Minister, who refus'd to
give private Baptism to a dying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
being askt by the Minister, if
he thought the childe should be
damn'd for want of Baptism? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
No, but I think you may
be damn'd for refusing it: and he
said well. But then my Lord, If
Original Sin deserves damnation,
then may Infants be damn'd if they
die without Baptism. But if it be
a horrible affirmative, to say that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36649:88"/>
the poor babes shall be made De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
or enter into their portion, if
they want that ceremony, which is
the only gate, the only way of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that stands open; then the word
[<hi>Damnation</hi>] in the 9. Article must
mean something less, then what we
usually understand by it: or else
the Article must be salved by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
some other word to an
allay and lessening of the horrible
sentence; and particularly the word
[<hi>Deserves</hi>] of which I shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
give account. Both these
waies I follow. The first is the way
of the Schoolmen.</p>
                  <p>For they suppose the state of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized
Infants to be a <hi>poena damni;</hi>
and they are confident enough to
say that this may be well suppos'd
without inferring their suffering the
pains of hell. But this sentence of
theirs I admit and explicate with
some little difference of expression.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36649:88"/>
For so far I admit this <hi>pain of loss,</hi>
or rather a deficiency from going to
Heaven, to be the consequence of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, that by it we being left
<hi>in meris Naturalibus,</hi> could never by
these strengths alone have gone to
Heaven. Now whereas your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in behalf of those whom you
suppose may be captious, is pleas'd
to argue. That as loss of sight or
eyes infers a state of darkness or
blindness: so the losse of Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
Hell; and if Infants go not to
heaven in that state, whither can
they go but to hell? and that's
Damnation in the greatest sense.
I grant it, that if <hi>in the event of
things</hi> they do not go to Heaven
(as things are now ordered) it is
but too likely that they go to Hell:
but I adde, that as all darkness does
not infer horror and distraction of
minde, or fearful apparitions and
phantasms: so neither does all Hell,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36649:89"/>
or states in Hell infer all those tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which the Schoolmen signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
by a <hi>poena sensus</hi> (for I speak
now in pursuance of their way).
So that there is no necessity of a
third place; but it concludes only
that in the state of separation from
Gods presence there is a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of degrees and kinds of evil,
and every one is not the extreme:
and yet by the way, let me observe,
that <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi>
taught that there is a third
place for Infants and Heathens:
and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirm'd that the evils
of Hell were not eternal to all, but
to the Devils only and the greater
criminals. But neither they nor we,
nor any man else can tell whether
Hell be a place or no. It is a state
of evil; but whether all the damned
be in one or in twenty places, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell.</p>
                  <p>But I have no need to make use
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36649:89"/>
of any of this. For when I affirm
that Infants being by <hi>Adam</hi> reduc'd
and left to their meer natural state,
fall short of Heaven; I do not say
they cannot go to Heaven at all,
but they cannot go thither by their
naturall powers, they cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a new grace and favour go to
heaven. But then it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
be inferred, that therefore
they go to hell; but this ought to
be infer'd, which indeed was the
real consequent of it; therefore it
is necessary that Gods Grace should
supply this defect, if God intends
Heaven to them at all; and because
Nature cannot, God sent a Saviour
by whom it was effected. But if it
be asked, what if this grace had not
come? and that it be said, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Gods grace they must have
gone to Hell, because without it
they could not go to Heaven? I
answer, That we know how it is,
now that God in his goodness hath
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36649:90"/>
made provisions for them: but if
he had not made such provisions,
what would have been we know
not, any more then we know what
would have followed, if <hi>Adam</hi> had
not sinned; where he should have
liv'd, and how long, and in what
circumstances the posterity should
have been provided for in all their
possible contingencies. But yet, this
I know, that it followes not, that if
without <hi>this Grace</hi> we could not have
gone to Heaven, that therefore we
must have gone to Hel. For although
the first was ordinarily impossible,
yet the second was absolutely
unjust, and against Gods goodness,
and therefore more impossible.
But because the first could not be
done by nature, God was pleased to
promise and to give his grace, that
he might bring us to that state whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had design'd us, that is, to a
supernatural felicity. If <hi>Adam</hi> had
not fallen, yet Heaven had not been
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36649:90"/>
a natural consequent of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but a Gracious, it had been
a gift still: and of <hi>Adam</hi> though he
had persisted in innocence, it is
true to say, that without Gods
Grace, that is, by the meer force of
Nature, he could never have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to a Supernatural state, that is,
to the joyes of Heaven; and yet it
does not follow, that if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in Innocence, he must have
gone to Hell. Just so it is in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
Hell was not made for man,
but for Devils; and therefore it
must be something besides meer
Nature that can bear any man thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
meer Nature goes neither to
Heaven nor Hell. So that when I
say Infants naturally cannot go to
Heaven, and that this is a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, he being for it
punished with a loss of his gracious
condition, and devolv'd to the
state of Nature, and we by him left
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36649:91"/>
so; my meaning is, that this Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which is of our Nature, is
but negative, that is, as a consequent
of our Patriarchs sin, our Nature is
left imperfect and deficient in order
to a supernatural end, which the
Schoolmen call a <hi>poena damni,</hi> but
improperly: they indeed think it
may be a real event, and final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of persons as well as things:
but I affirm it was an evil effect of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s sin: but in the event of
things it became to the persons the
way to a new grace, and hath no
other event as to Heaven and Hell
directly and immediately. In the
same sense and to the same purpose
I understand the word Damnation
in the 9. Article.</p>
                  <p>But the word [Damnation] may
very well, truly, and sufficiently sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
all the purposes of the Article,
if it be taken only for the effect of
that sentence which was inflicted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36649:91"/>
upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and descended on his
posterity, that is, for condemnation
to Death, and the evils of mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
So the word is used by S. <hi>Paul
1 Cor. 11. 29. He that eateth and
drinketh unworthily, eateth and
drinketh</hi> Damnation to <hi>himself.</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the word, but that it did
particularly signifie temporal death
and evils, appears by the instances
of probation in the next words,
<hi>For, for this cause some are weak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you, some are sick, and some
are fallen asleep.</hi> This also in the
Article. Original Sin deserves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that is, it justly brought in
the angry sentence of God upon
Man, it brought him to death, and
deserv'd it: it brought it upon us,
and deserv'd it too. I do not say that
we by that sin deserv'd that death,
neither can death be properly a
punishment of us till we superadde
some evil of our own; yet <hi>Adam</hi>'s
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36649:92"/>
sin deserv'd it so, that it was justly
left to fall upon us, we as a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and punishment of his sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reduc'd to our natural portion.
<hi>In odiesis quod minimum est sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi>
The lesser sense of the word
is certainly agreeable to truth and
reason: and it were good we us'd
the word in that sense which may
best warrant her doctrine, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for that use of the word,
having the precedent of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>I am confirm'd in this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by the 2. §. of the Article:
<hi>viz.</hi> of the remanency of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
or Original Sin in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.
All the sinfulness of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Sin is the lust or concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,
that is, the proneness to sin.
Now then I demand, whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
before actual consent be
a sin or no? and if it be a sin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it deserves damnation? That
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36649:92"/>
all sin deserves damnation, I am
sure our Church denies not. If
therefore concupiscence before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
be a sin, then this also deserves
damnation where ever it is: and if
so, then a man may be damned for
Original Sin even after Baptism.
For even after Baptism, concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
(or the sinfulness of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sin) remains in the regenerate:
and that which is the same thing, the
same vitiousness, the same enmity
to God after Baptism, is as damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it deserves damnation as much
as that did that went before. If it
be replied, that Baptism takes off
the guilt or formal part of it, but
leaves the material part behinde,
that is, though concupiscence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
yet it shall not bring damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the regenerate or Baptized.
I answer, that though baptismal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
puts a man into a state
of grace and favour, so that what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36649:93"/>
went before shall not be imputed
to him afterwards, that is, <hi>Adam</hi>'s
sin shall not bring damnation (in any
sense) yet it hinders not, but that
what is sinful afterwards shall be
then imputed to him, that is, he may
be damn'd for his own concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence.
He is quitted from it as it
came from <hi>Adam;</hi> but by Baptism
he is not quitted from it, as it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
in himself, if (I say) concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
before consent be a sin. If
it be no sin, then for it, Infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized
cannot with justice be
damn'd; it does not deserve dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
but if it be a sin, then so
long as it is there, so long it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
damnation; and Baptism did
only quit the relation of it to <hi>Adam</hi>
(for that was all that went before it)
but not the danger of the man. *But
because the Article supposes that it
does not damn the regenerate or
baptized, and yet that it hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36649:93"/>
of sin, it follows evidently and
undeniably, that both the phrases
are to be diminished and understood
in a favourable sense. As the
phrase [the Nature of sin] signifies;
so does [Damnation] but [the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of sin] signifies something that
brings no guilt, because it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to be in the Regenerate,
therefore [Damnation] signifies
something that brings no Hell: but
[to deserve Damnation] must mean
something lesse then ordinary, that
is, that concupiscence is a thing not
morally good, not to be allowed of,
not to be nurs'd, but mortifi'd,
fought against, disapprov'd, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd</hi>
and disallowed of men as it
is of God.</p>
                  <p>And truly My Lord, to say that
for <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin it is just in God
to condemn Infants to the eternal
flames of Hell: and to say, that
concupiscence or natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36649:94"/>
before they pass into any act,
could bring eternal condemnation
from Gods presence into the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
portion of Devils, are two such
horrid propositions, that if any
Church in the world would expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm them, I for my part should
think it unlawful to communicate
with her in the defence or profession
of either, and do think it would be
the greatest temptation in the world
to make men not to love God, of
whom men so easily speak such
horrid things. I would suppose the
Article to mean any thing rather
then either of these. But yet one
thing more I have to say.</p>
                  <p>The Article is certainly to be
expounded according to the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of faith, and the express words
of Scripture, if there be any that
speak expresly in this matter. Now
whereas the Article explicating Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Sin affirms it to be that fault
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36649:94"/>
or corruption of mans nature (<hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
Naturae,</hi> not <hi>peccatum</hi>) by
which he is far gone from ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
righteousness, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to evil: because this is
not full enough, the Article adds
by way of explanation [<hi>So that
the flesh lusteth against the spirit</hi>]
that is, it really produces a state
of evil temptations: it lusteth,
that is, actually and habitually;
[it lusteth against the spirit, and
therefore deserves Gods wrath
and damnation] So the Article:
<hi>Therefore;</hi> for no other reason
but because the flesh lusteth against
the spirit; not because it can lust,
or is <hi>apta nata</hi> to lust, but because
it lusteth <hi>actually, therefore it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
damnation:</hi> and this is <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Sin:</hi> or as the Article ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
it, <hi>it hath the nature of
sin;</hi> it is the <hi>fomes,</hi> or matter of
sin, and is in the original of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36649:95"/>
and deriv'd from <hi>Adam</hi> as
our body is, but it deserves not
damnation in the highest sense
of the word, till the concupiscence
be actual. Till then, the words
of [Wrath and Damnation] must
be meant in the less and more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
signfication, according to the
former explication: and must on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relate to the personal sin of
<hi>Adam.</hi> To this sense of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
I heartily subscribe. For
besides the reasonableness of the
thing, and the very manner of
speaking us'd in the Article; it
is the very same way of speaking,
and exactly the same doctrine
which we finde in S. <hi>James,</hi> (Jam.
1. 14.) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

when it is impregnated, <hi>when
it hath conceiv'd, then it brings
forth sin: and sin when it is in</hi>
production, and <hi>birth, brings forth
death.</hi> But in Infants, concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36649:95"/>
is innocent and a virgin,
it conceives not, and therefore is
without sin, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
death or damnation. * Against
these expositions I cannot imagine
what can be really and materially
objected.</p>
                  <p>But my Lord, I perceive the
main outcry is like to be upon
the authority of the <hi>Harmony of
Confessions.</hi> Concerning which I
shall say this, that in this Article
the Harmony makes as good mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
as bels ringing backward;
and they agree, especially when
they come to be explicated and
untwisted into their minute and
explicite meanings, as much as
<hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calvinist,</hi> as <hi>Papist</hi>
and <hi>Protestant,</hi> as <hi>Thomas</hi> and
<hi>Scotus,</hi> as <hi>Remonstrant</hi> and <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drechtan,</hi>
that is, as much as <hi>pro</hi>

I have not the book with me here

in prison, and this neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
cannot supply me, and I
dare not trust my memory to give
a scheme of it: but your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
knows that in nothing more
do the reformed Churches dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree,
then in this and its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages;
and you are pleased to
hint something of it, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that some speak more of
this then the Church of <hi>England:</hi>

he affirmes of the whole collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is most notorious in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36649:96"/>
of Original Sin. For my own
part I am ready to subscribe the
<hi>first Helvetian</hi> confession, but not
the second. So much difference
there is in the confessions of the
same Church.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas your Lordship
adds, that though they are falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet when they bring evidence
of holy Writ, their assertions are
infallible, and not to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted:
I am bound to reply, that
when they do so, whether they be
infallible or no, I will beleeve
them, because then though they
might, yet they are not deceived.
But as evidence of holy Writ had
been sufficient without their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
so without such evidence
their authority is nothing. But
then, My Lord, their citing and
urging the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
Rom. 5. 12. is so far from being
an evident probation of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36649:97"/>
that nothing is to me a
surer argument of their fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
then the urging of that which
evidently makes nothing for them,
but much against them: As 1. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
expresly that death was
the event of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin; the
whole event, for it names no other;
temporal death; according to
that saying of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.
<hi>In Adam we all die.</hi> And 2. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
this process of death to
be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is and
ought to be taken to be the allay
or condition of the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It became a punishment to
them only who did sin; <hi>but upon
them also inflicted for</hi> Adam's
<hi>sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A like expression to which is in
the Psalms, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 32, 33. <hi>They
angred him also at the waters of
strife, so that he punished</hi> Moses
<hi>for their sakes.</hi> Here was plainly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36649:97"/>
a traduction of evil from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Moses</hi> their relative: For
their sakes he was punished, but
yet <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>for as much
as</hi> Moses <hi>had sin'd:</hi> for so it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<hi>because they provoked his
spirit, so that he spake unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with his lips.</hi> So it is between
<hi>Adam</hi> and us. He sin'd and God
was highly displeased. This dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
went further then upon
<hi>Adam</hi>'s sin: for though that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was threatned with death, yet
the sins of his children which
were not so threatned, became so
punished, and they were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
heirs of wrath and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that is, for his sake our sins
inherited his curse. The curse
that was specially and only threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to him, we when we sin'd did
inherit for his sake. So that it is
not so properly to be called, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Sin,</hi> as <hi>an original curse</hi> upon
our sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:36649:98"/>To this purpose we have also
another example of God trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the curse from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Both were sinners, but one
was the original of the curse or
punishment. So said the Prophet
to the wife of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 King.
14. 16. [<hi>He shall give Israel up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the sins of</hi> Jeroboam,
<hi>who did sin, and who made Israel
to sin] Jereboam</hi> was the root of
the sin and of the curse. Here it
was also (that I may use the words
of the Apostle) that <hi>by the sin of
one man</hi> [Jeroboam] <hi>sin went out
into all</hi> [Israel] <hi>and</hi> the curse,
captivity, or <hi>death by sin, and so
death went upon all men</hi> [of
Israel] <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>in as much
as all men</hi> [of Israel] <hi>have sinned.</hi>
If these men had not sinned, they
had not been punished: I cannot
say they had not been afflicted;
for <hi>David</hi>'s childe was smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36649:98"/>
for his fathers fault: but
though they did sin, yet unless
their root and principal had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
possibly they should not
have so been punish'd: For his
sake the punishment came. Upon
the same account it may be, that
we may inherit the damnation or
curse for <hi>Adam</hi>'s sake, though we
deserve it; yet it being transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Adam</hi> and not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
threatned to the first poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
we were his heirs, the heirs
of death, deriving from him an
original curse, but due also (if
God so pleased) to our sins. And
this is the full sense of the 12. verse,
and the effect of the phrase <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> twice in
the Scripture signifies [for as
much as] as you may read Rom.
8. 3. &amp; Heb. 2. 18. So that here
are two places besides this in
question, and two more <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti</hi>
to shew, that if it were not
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but said in words expresly
as you would have it in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
yet even so neither the
thing, nor any part of the thing
could be evicted against me:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36649:99"/>
and lastly, if it were not only
said <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> but that that sense of it
were admitted which is desired,
and that it did mean <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by</hi> in
this very place: yet the Question
were not at all the nearer to be
concluded against me. For I
grant that it is true [<hi>in him we
are all sinners</hi>] as it is true that
[<hi>in him we all die</hi>] that is, for his
sake we are us'd as sinners; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miserable really, but sinners
in account and effect: as I have
largely discoursed in my book.
But then for the place here in
question, it is so certain that it
signifies the same thing (as our
Church reads it) that it is not
sense without it, but a violent
breach of the period without prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
or reason. And after all; I have
looked upon those places where
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is said to signifie <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by,</hi>
and in one of them I finde it so,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36649:100"/>
Mar. 2. 4. but in Act. 3. 16. &amp;
Phil. 1. 3. I finde it not at all in
any sense: but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> indeed is used
for <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by,</hi> in that of the Acts;
and in the other it signifies, <hi>at</hi> or
<hi>upon;</hi> but if all were granted that is
pretended to, it no way prejudices
my cause, as I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>Next to these your Lordship
seems a little more zealous and
decretory in the Question upon the
confidence of the 17, 18, &amp; 19.
verses of the 5. chapter to the
Romans. The sum of which as
your Lordship most ingeniously
sums it up, is this. <q>As by one
many were made sinners: so by
one many were made righteous,
that by <hi>Adam,</hi> this by <hi>Christ.</hi>
But by Christ we are made
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> just, not by imputation
only, but effectively and to real
purposes; therefore by <hi>Adam</hi>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:36649:100"/>
we are really made sinners. And
this your Lordship confirms by
the observation of the sense of
two words here used by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
The first is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
which signifies a sentence of
guilt, or punishment for sin,
and this sin to be theirs upon
whom the condemnation comes,
because God punishes none but
for their own sin, Ezek. 18.
2. From the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>clear
from sin,</hi> so your Lordship ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it: and in opposition to
this, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is to be rendred,
that is, guilty, criminal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
really and properly.</q> This
is all which the wit of man can
say from this place of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
and if I make it appear that
this is invalid, I hope I am se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
                  <p>To this then, I answer: That
the Antithesis in these words here
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36649:101"/>
urg'd, (for there is another in the
chapter) and this whole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of S. <hi>Paul</hi> is full and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
without descending to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.
Death came in by one
man, much more shall life come
by one man; if that by <hi>Adam,</hi>
then much more this by Christ:
by him to condemnation, by this
man to justification. This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to verifie the argument of
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though life and death
did not come in the same manner
to the several relatives; as indeed
they did not: of which afterwards.
But for the present: It runs thus.
By <hi>Adam</hi> we were made sinners;
by Christ we are made righteous:
As certainly one as the other,
though not in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of dispensation. By <hi>Adam</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> death reigned; by
this man the reign of death shall
be destroyed, and life set up in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36649:101"/>
stead of it; by him we were us'd
as sinners, for in him we died:
but by Christ we are justified,
that is, us'd as just persons, for
by him we live. This is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the Apostles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet no necessity to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that we are sinners in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
any more then by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for we are by Christ made
just no otherwise then by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>In the proof or perswasion I
will use no indirect arguments, as
to say, that to deny us to be just
by imputation is the Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and of the
<hi>Socinian</hi> Conventicles, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
dislik'd by all the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
Calvinist,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglian</hi>
Churches, and particularly by the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and indeed
by the whole Harmony of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36649:102"/>
this I say, I will not make
use of; not only because I my self
do not love to be press'd by such
prejudices rather then arguments;
but because the question of the
imputation of righteousness is
very much mistaken and misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
on all hands. They that
say that Christs righteousness is
imputed to us for justification, do
it upon this account, because they
know all that we do is imperfect,
therefore they think themselves
constrain'd to flie to Christ's
righteousness, and think it must
be imputed to us, or we perish.
The other side, considering that
this way would destroy the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of holy living; and that in
order to our justification, there
were conditions requir'd on our
parts, think it necessary to say
that we are justified by inherent
righteousness. Between these the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36649:102"/>
truth is plain enough to be read.
Thus:</p>
                  <p>Christ's righteousness is not
imputed to us for justification di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and immediately; neither
can we be justified by our own
righteousness: but our Faith and
sincere endevours are through
Christ accepted in stead of legal
righteousness: that is; we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
through Christ, by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
not of Christs, nor our
own righteousness: but of our
faith and endevours of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as if they were perfect: and
we are justified by a Non-impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<hi>viz.</hi> of our past sins, and
present unavoidable imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
that is, we are handled as
if we were just persons and no
sinners. So faith was imputed to
<hi>Abraham</hi> for righteousness; not
that it made him so, <hi>legally,</hi> but
<hi>Evangelically,</hi> that is, by grace
and imputation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:36649:103"/>And indeed My Lord, that I
may speak freely in this great
question: when one man hath
sin'd, his descendents and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
cannot possibly by him, or
for him, or in him be made sinners
properly and really. For in sin
there are but two things imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
the irregular action; and the
guilt, or obligation to punishment.
Now we cannot in any sense be
said to have done the action which
another did, and not we: the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is as individual as the person;
and <hi>Titius</hi> may as well be <hi>Cajus,</hi>
and the Son be his own Father, as
he can be said to have done the
Fathers action; and therefore we
cannot possibly be guilty of it:
for guilt is an obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for having done it: the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the guilt are relatives; one
cannot be without the other:
something must be done inwardly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36649:103"/>
or outwardly, or there can be no
guilt. * But then for the evil of
punishment, that may pass further
then the action. If it passes upon
the innocent, it is not a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to them; but an evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
by right of Dominion; but
yet by reason of the relation of
the afflicted to him that sin'd, to
him it is a punishment. But if it
passes upon others that are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
then it is a punishment to
both; to the first principally; to
the Descendents or Relatives, for
the others sake; his sin being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
so far.</p>
                  <p>How far that is in the present
case, and what it is, the Apostle
expresses thus: It was <gap reason="foreign">

oppose mine. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
cannot pass upon a man
for any sin but his own: therefore
it did not pass upon man for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s
sin; because <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, was
<hi>Adam</hi>'s, not our own: But we all
have sinned, we have sins of our
own, therefore for these the curse
pass'd from <hi>Adam</hi> to us. To back
mine, besides that common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
of sense and reason defend
it, I have the plain words of
S. <hi>Paul; Death passed upon all men, for as much as all
men have sinned;</hi> all men, that is, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of mankinde, all that liv'd
till they could sin, the others that
died before, died in their nature,
not in their sin, neither <hi>Adam</hi>'s
nor their own, save only that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
brought it in upon them, or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36649:107"/>
rather left it to them, himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disrobed of all that which
could hinder it.</p>
                  <p>Now for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which
your Lordship renders [clear from
sin] I am sure no man is so justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in this world, as to be clear
from sin; and if we all be
sinners, and yet healed as just
persons, it is certain we are just
by imputation only, that is, Christ
imputing our faith, and sincere,
though not unerring obedience
to us for righteousness: And then
the Antithesis must hold thus; By
Christ comes justification to life,
as by <hi>Adam</hi> came the curse or
the sin to the condemnation of
death: But our justification which
comes by Christ is by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and acceptilation, by grace
and favour: not that we are
made really, that is, legally and
perfectly righteous, but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36649:107"/>
of faith and obedience
to us, as if it were perfect: And
therfore <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin was but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
only to certain purposes;
not real, or proper, not formal or
inherent. For the grace by Christ
is more then the sin by <hi>Adam:</hi>
if therefore that was not legal
and proper, but Evangelical and
gracious, favourable and imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
much more is the sin of
<hi>Adam</hi> in us improperly, and by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
* And truly my Lord,
I think that no sound Divine of
any of our Churches will say that
we are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in any
other sense: not that Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is imputed to us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any inherent graces in us, but
that our imperfect services, our
true faith and sincere endevours
of obedience are imputed to us
for righteousness through Jesus
Christ: and since it is certainly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36649:108"/>
so, I am sure the Antithesis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> can never
be salved by making us sinners
really by <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet just or
righteous by <hi>Christ</hi> only in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
and imputation. For
then sin should abound more then
grace; expresly against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our blessed Saviour, the
glory of our redemption, and the
words of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> But rather on
the contrary is it true, That
though by <hi>Christ</hi> we were really
and legally made perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
it follows not that we were
made sinners by <hi>Adam</hi> in the same
manner and measure: for this
similitude of S. <hi>Paul</hi> ought not
to extend to an equality in all
things; but still the advantage and
prerogative, the abundance and
the excess must be on the part
of Grace: for <hi>if sin does abound,
grace does much more abound;</hi> and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36649:108"/>
we do more partake of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by <hi>Christ,</hi> then of sin by
<hi>Adam. Christ</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> are the
several fountains of emanation,
and are compar'd <hi>aequè,</hi> but not
<hi>aequaliter.</hi> Therefore this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
holds redundantly, since by
Christ we are not made legally
righteous, but by imputation only;
much less are we made sinners by
<hi>Adam.</hi> This in my sense is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
far from being an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that it perfectly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
the main question; and
for my part I mean to relie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                  <p>As for that which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
adds out of Rom. 5. 19.
That <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies sinners, not
by imitation, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi>
dream, but sinners really and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively;
I shall not need to make
any other reply; but that 1. I
do not approve of that gloss of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36649:109"/>
the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that in <hi>Adam</hi> we
are made sinners by imitation;
and much less of that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
we are made so properly
and formally. But [made sinners]
signifies, us'd like sinners; so as
[justified] signifies healed like
just persons: In which interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I follow S. <hi>Paul,</hi> not the
<hi>Pelagians;</hi> they who are on the
other side of the question, follow
neither. And unless men take in
their opinion before they read;
and resolve not to understand
S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epistle, I wonder
why they should fancy that all that
he sayes sounds that way which
they commonly dream of: But
as men fancy, so the Bels will ring.
But I know yovr Lordships grave
and wiser judgement, sees not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this that I have now opened,
but much beyond it, and that
you will be a zealous advocate
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36649:109"/>
for the truth of God, and for the
honour of his justice, wisdome and
mercy.</p>
                  <p>That which followes, makes me
beleeve your Lordship resolv'd to
try me, by speaking your own
sense in the line, and your tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the interline. For when your
Lordship had said that <q>[My ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for the vindication of
Gods goodness and justice are
sound and holy]</q> your hand run
it over again and added [as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
from the case of Original
Sin.] But why should this be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
from all the whole Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of God, from all his other
dispensations? Is it in all cases of
the world unjust for God, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
our fathers fins to us unto
eternal condemnation; and is it
otherwise in this only? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a man would think this were
the more favourable case; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36649:110"/>
a single act, done but once,
repented of after it was done, not
consented to by the parties inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ested,
not stipulated by God
that it should be so, and being
against all lawes and all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the world: therefore it
were but reason that if any where,
here much rather Gods justice
and goodness should be relied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as the measure of the event.
* And if in other cases lawes be
never given to Ideots and Infants
and persons uncapable, why
should they be given here? but if
they were not capable of a Law,
then neither could they be of Sin;
for where there is no law, there is
no transgression. And is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
to condemn one man to hell
for all the sin of a thousand of his
Ancestors actually done by them?
and shall it be accounted just to
damn all the world for one sin of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36649:110"/>
one man? But if it be said, that
it is unjust to damn the innocent
for the sin of another; but the
world is not innocent, but really
guilty in <hi>Adam.</hi> Besides that this
is a begging of the question, it is
also against common sense, to say
that a man is not innocent of that
which was done before he had a
being; for if that be not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
then it is impossible for a
man to be innocent. And if
this way of answer be admitted,
any man may be damned for the
sin of any Father; because it may
be said here as well as there, that
although the innocent must not
perish for anothers fault, yet the
son is not innocent as being in his
fathers loyns when the fault was
committed, and the law cals him
and makes him guilty. And if
it were so indeed, this were so
far from being an excuse, to say
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36649:111"/>
that the Law makes him guilty,
that this were absolute tyranny,
and the thing that were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of.</p>
                  <p>I hope, by this time your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
perceives, that I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to fear that I praevaricate
S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, in

that's <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, to

they that do so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as
to resolve it to be so whether
God be honour'd in it, or disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd,
and to answer all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whether they can or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be answered, and to efform all
their Theology to the ayre of
that one great proposition, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36649:111"/>
to find out waies for God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in, which he hath never told
of, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
then I hope I shall have less need
to fear that I do, who do none
of these things.</p>
                  <p>And in proportion to my secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
here, I am confident that I am
unconcern'd in the consequent
threatning. If any man shall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelize, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doctrine then what ye have
received, something for Gospel
which is not Gospel, something
that ye have not received, let
him be accursed. My Lord, if
what I teach were not that which
we have received, that God is
just and righteous and true: that
the soul that sins the same shall
die: that we shall have no cause
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36649:112"/>
to say, The Fathers have eaten
sowre grapes, and the childrens
teeth are set on edge: that God
is a gracious Father, pardoning
iniquity, and therefore not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it where it is not: that Infants
are from their Mothers wombs
beloved of God their Father:
that of such is the Kingdome of
God: that he pities those souls
who cannot discern the right hand
from the left, as he declar'd in
the case of the <hi>Ninevites:</hi> that to
Infants there are special Angels
appointed who alwaies behold the
face of God: that Christ took
them in his arms and blessed them,
and therefore they are not hated
by God, and accursed heirs of
Hell, and coheirs with Satan:
that the Messias was promis'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any children were born; as
certainly as that <hi>Adam</hi> sin'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were born: that if sin
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36649:112"/>
abounds, grace does superabound;
and therefore children are with
greater effect involv'd in the grace
then they could be in the sin:
and the sin must be gone before
it could do them mischief: if
this were not the doctrine of both
Testaments, and if the contrary
were, then the threatning of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
might well be held up against
me: but else my Lord, to shew
such a Scorpion to him that speaks
the truth of God in sincerity and
humility, though it cannot make
me to betray the truth and the
honour of God, yet the very
fear and affrightment which must
needs seize upon every good man
that does but behold it, or hear
the words of that angry voice,
shall and hath made me to pray
not only that my self be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in truth, but that it would
please God to bring into the way
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36649:113"/>
of truth all such as have erred and
are deceived.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I humbly thank your
Lordship for your grave and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Councel, and kisse the hand
that reaches forth so paternal a
rod. I see you are tender both of
truth and me: and though I have
not made this tedious reply to
cause trouble to your Lordship,
or to steal from you any part of
your precious time, yet because
I see your Lordship was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>induere personam,</hi> to give
some little countenance to a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
error out of jealousie against
a less usual truth, I thought it
my duty to represent to your
Lordship such things, by which as
I can, so I ought to be defended
against captious objectors. It is
hard when men will not be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of truth, because another man
offers it to them, and they did
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36649:113"/>
not first take it in, or if they did,
were not pleas'd to own it.</p>
                  <p>But from your Lordship I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
and am sure to finde the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of your piety, wisdome and
learning, and that an error for
being popular shall not prevail
against so necessary, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>observed
truth. A necessary truth
I call it; because without this I
do not understand how we can
declare Gods righteousness and
justifie him, with whom unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
cannot dwell: But if
men of a contrary opinion, can
reconcile their usual doctrines of
Original Sin with Gods justice,
and goodness and truth, I shall
be well pleased with it, and think
better of their doctrine then now
I can.</p>
                  <p>But untill that be done, it
were well (My Lord) if men
would not trouble themselves or
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36649:114"/>
the Church with impertinent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions;
but patiently give
leave to have truth advanced, and
God justified in his sayings and
in his judgements, and the Church
improved, and all errors confuted,
that what did so prosperously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the Reformation, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to bring it to perfection,
that men may no longer go <hi>quâ

                        <hi>Let me request you to weigh that
of S.</hi> Paul <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 5. The words
are these [<hi>Even when we were
dead in sins,</hi> (God) <hi>hath quickned
us together with Christ</hi>] which
words I do not at all suppose relate
to the matter of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> but
to the state of <hi>Heathen sins, habitual

the world was dead before the

                        <hi>And to remember how often he

S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons <hi>Concupiscence</hi> to
be one of the works of the flesh,
and consequently such as excludes
from heaven, Col. 3. 5. <hi>Evil
concupiscence</hi>] concupiscence with
something superadded, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that is nothing that is <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;</hi>

                        <hi>all concupiscence,</hi> that is the very

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36649:120"/>
I finde S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,
1 Thess. 4. 5. <hi>Let
every man knew to possess his
vessel in holiness and honour, not
in the lust of concupiscence, as do
the Gentiles which know not God.</hi>
In the <hi>lust of Concupiscence,</hi> that
is plainly in lustfulness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity:
for it is a Hebraism,
where a superlative is usually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the <hi>synonymon:</hi> as
<hi>Lutum coeni; pluvia imbris;</hi> so
<hi>the Gall of bitterness</hi> and the <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of sins; Robur virium; the
blackness of darkness,</hi> that is,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the outer darkness,</hi>
or the greatest darkness: so here
<hi>the lust of Concupiscence,</hi> that is,
the vilest and basest of it. I know
no where else that the Apostle uses
the word in any sense. But the
like is to be said of the word <hi>lust,</hi>
which the Apostle often uses, for
the <hi>habits produced</hi> or <hi>the preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36649:121"/>
desires,</hi> but never for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
principle and affection, when
he speaks of sin.</p>
                     <p>But your Lordship is pleased
to adde a subtlety in pursuance of
your former advices and notices,
which I confess I shall never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Although Baptism take away
the guilt as concretively redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the person, yet the simple
abstracted guilt as to the Nature
remains; for Sacraments are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
to persons, not to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>]
Thus I suppose those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from whom your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
reports it, intended as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to a secret objection. For
if Concupiscence be a sin, and
yet remains after baptism, then
what good does Baptism effect?
But if it be no sin after, then it
is no sin before. To this it is
answered as you see: there is a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36649:121"/>
double guilt; <hi>a guilt of person,</hi>
and <hi>of nature.</hi> That is taken away,
<hi>this</hi> is not: for, Sacraments are
given to Persons, not to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>But first, where is there such
a distinction set down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or in the prime antiquity,
or in any moral Philosopher?
There is no humane nature but
what is in the persons of men;
and though our understanding
can make a separate consideration
of these, or rather consider a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in a double capacity, in his
personal and in his natural, that is
(if I am to speak sense) a person
may be considered in that which
is proper to him, and in that
which is common to him and
others; yet these two considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
cannot make two distinct
subjects capable of such different
events. I will put it to the trial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:36649:122"/>This guilt that is in nature,
what is it? Is it the same thing
that was in the person? that is,
is it an obligation to punishment?
If it be not, I know not the
meaning of the word, and therefore
I have nothing to do with it. If
it be, then if this guilt or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to punishment remains in the
nature after it is taken from the
person, then if this concupiscence
deserve damnation, this nature
shall be damned, though the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be saved. Let the Objectors,
my Lord, choose which they will.
If it does not deserve damnation,
why do they say it does? If it
does, then the guilty may suffer
what they deserve, but the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
or the absolved must not;
the person then being acquitted,
and the nature not acquitted,
the nature shall be damn'd and
the person be saved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:36649:122"/>But if it be said that the guilt
remains in the <hi>nature</hi> to certain
purposes, but not to all; then I
reply, so it does in the <hi>person;</hi>
for it is in the <hi>person</hi> after Baptism,
so as to be a perpetual possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and proneness to sin, and a
principle of trouble; and if it be
no otherwise in the nature, then
this distinction is to no purpose;
if it be otherwise in the nature,
then it brings damnation to it,
when it brings none to the Man,
and then the former argument
must return. But whether it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
or no, yet I cannot but note,
that what is here affirmed is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
against the words common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attributed to S. <hi>Cyprian (De
ablutione pedum) Sic abluit quos
parentalis labes infecerat, ut nec
actualis nec Originalis macula post
ablutionem illam ulla sui vestigia
derelinguat:</hi> How this supposing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36649:123"/>
it of Baptism can be reconcil'd
with the guilt remaining in the
nature, I confess I cannot
give an account. It is expresly against
S. <hi>Austin (Tom. 9. Tract. 41. in
Johan. epist. ad Ocean.</hi>) saying,
<hi>deleta est tota iniquitas!</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against S. <hi>Hierom, Quo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>odo
justificati sumus &amp; sanctificati, si
peccatum aliquid in nobis relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But again (My Lord) I did
suppose that <hi>Concupiscence</hi> or <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Sin</hi> had been founded in
nature, and had not been a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal</hi>
but <hi>a natural evil.</hi> I am
sure, so the Article of our Church
affirms; <hi>it is the fault and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of our Nature.</hi> And so
S. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> affirms in the
wo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ds cited by your Lordship in
your Letter: <hi>Sicui peccatum actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale
tribuitur alicui ratione singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
persona: ita peccatum origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36649:123"/>
tribuitur ratione naturae.</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the Sacrament must
have effect upon our Nature, to
purifie that which is vitiated by
Concupiscence, or else it does no
good at all. For if the guilt or
sin be founded in the nature, (as
the Article affirms) and Baptism
does not take off the guilt from
the nature, then it does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>Now since your Lordship is
pleas'd in the behalf of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors
so warily to avoid what
they thought pressing, I will take
leave to use the advantages it
ministers: for so the Serpent
teaches us where to strike him, by
his so warily and guiltily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
his head. I therefore argue
thus.</p>
                     <p>Either Baptism does not take
off the guilt of Original Sin, or
else there may be punishment
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36649:124"/>
where there is no guilt, or else
natural death was not it which
God threatned as the punishment
of <hi>Adam's</hi> fact. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that all men die as well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
baptism as before; and more
after then before. That which
would be properly the consequent
of this Dilemma, is this, that
when God threatned death to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
saying, <hi>On the day thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of the tree thou shalt die the
death,</hi> he inflicted and intended
to inflict the evils of a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
mortal life. For <hi>Adam</hi> did
not die that day, but <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be miserable that day, to
live upon hard labour, to eat
fruits from an accursed field, till
he should return to the earth
whence he was taken. (Gen. 3. 17,
18, 19.) So that death in the
common sense of the word was
to be the end of his labour,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36649:124"/>
not so much the punishment of
the sin. For it is probable he
should have gone off from the
scene of this world to a better,
though he had not sin'd; but if
he had not sin'd, he should not be
so afflicted, and he should not
have died <hi>daily</hi> till he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>finally,</hi> that is, till he had
<hi>returned to his dust whence he was
taken,</hi> and whither he would
naturally have gone: and it is no
new thing in Scripture that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
and infelicities should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>dying</hi> or <hi>death.</hi> (Exod. 10. 17.
1 Cor. 15. 31. 2 Cor. 1. 10. &amp;
4. 10, 11, 12. &amp; 11. 23.). But I
only note this as probable; as not
being willing to admit what the
<hi>Socinians</hi> answer in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
who affirm that God
threatning death to the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi>
meant <hi>death eternal:</hi> which
is certainly not true; as we learn
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36649:125"/>
from the words of the Apostle,
saying, <hi>In Adam we all die;</hi> which
is not true of <hi>death eternal,</hi> but it
is true of the miseries and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of mankinde, and it is true
of temporal death in the sense
now explicated, and in that
which is commonly received.</p>
                     <p>But I add also this probleme.
That which would have been,
had there been no sin, and that
which remains when the sin or
guiltiness is gone, is not properly
the punishment of the sin. But
dissolution of the soul and body
should have been, if <hi>Adam</hi> had
not sin'd, for the world would
have been too little to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
those myriads of men
which must in all reason have
been born from that blessing of
<hi>Increase and multiply,</hi> which was
given at the first Creation; and
to have confin'd mankinde to the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36649:125"/>
pleasures of this world, in case he
had not fallen, would have been
a punishment of his innocence;
but however, it might have been,
though God had not been angry,
and shall still be, even when the
sin is taken off. The proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of this will be, that when
the Apostle sayes, <hi>Death came in
by sin,</hi> and that <hi>Death is the wages
of sin,</hi> he primarily and literally
means the solemnities, and causes,
and infelicities, and untimeliness
of temporal death, and not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the dissolution, which is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no evil, but an inlet to a better
state. But I insist not on this,
but offer it to the consideration
of inquisitive and modest persons.</p>
                     <p>And now that I may return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from whence this objection
brought me; I consider, that if any
should urge this argument to me:</p>
                     <p>Baptism delivers from Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:36649:126"/>Baptism does not deliver from
<hi>Concupiscence;</hi> therefore <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence</hi>
is not Original Sin.</p>
                     <p>I did not know well what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
I could possibly say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to satisfie the boyes &amp; young
men at a publique disputation, but
not to satisfie my self when I am
upon my knees and giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to God of all my secret and
hearty perswasions. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that by <hi>Concupiscence</hi> must
be meant either the first inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to their object; or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
acts of Election which are the
second acts of <hi>Concupiscence.</hi> If
the first inclinations be meant, then
certainly that cannot be a sin
which is <hi>natural,</hi> and which is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</hi>
For I consider that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
and natural desires are
like <hi>hunger;</hi> which while it is
natural and necessary, is not for
the destruction but conservation
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36649:126"/>
of man; when it goes beyond the
limits of nature, it is violent and
a disease: and so is <hi>Concupiscence;</hi>
But desires or lustings when they
are taken for the natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to their proper object, are so
far from being a sin, that they are
the instruments of felicity for
this duration, and when they grow
towards being irregular, they
may, if we please, grow instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of felicity in order to the
other duration, because they may
serve a vertue by being restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
And <hi>to desire</hi> that to which
all men tend naturally, is no more
a sin then to desire to be happy
is a sin: <hi>desire</hi> is no more a
sin then <hi>joy</hi> or <hi>sorrow</hi> is: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it be fancied why one
passion more then another can be
in its whole nature Criminal;
either all or none are so; when
any of them growes irregular or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36649:127"/>
inordinate, Joy is as bad as
Desire, and Fear as bad as either.</p>
                     <p>But if by <hi>Concupiscence</hi> we
mean the second acts of it, that
is, avoidable consentings, and
deliberate elections, then let it
be as much condemned as the
Apostle and all the Church after
him hath sentenc'd it; but then it
is not <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, but our own by
which we are condemned; for it
is not his fault that we choose;
If we choose, it is our own; if
we choose not, it is no fault. For
there is a natural act of the Will
as well as of the Understanding,
and in the choice of the supreme
Good, and in the first apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of its proper object, the Will
is as natural as any other faculty;
and the other faculties have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of adherence as well as the
Will: so have the potestative and
intellective faculties; they are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted</hi>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:36649:127"/>
in their best objects. But
because these only are natural,
and the will is natural some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
but not alwaies, there it is
that a difference can be.</p>
                     <p>For I consider, if the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
be a sin, Original Sin,
(for actual it is not) and that this
is <hi>properly, personally,</hi> and <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently</hi>
our sin by traduction, that
is, if our will be necessitated to
sin by <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, as it must
needs be if it can sin when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deliberate, then there can be
no reason told, why it is more a
sin to will evil, then to understand
it: and how does that which is
moral differ from that which is
natural? for the understanding is
first and primely moved by its
object, and in that motion by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but by God, who moves
all things: and if that which hath
nothing else to move it but the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36649:128"/>
object, yet is not free; it is strange
that the will can in any sense be
free, when it is necessitated by
<hi>wisdome</hi> and by <hi>power,</hi> and by
<hi>Adam,</hi> that is, <hi>from within</hi> and
<hi>from without,</hi> besides what <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>violence</hi> do and can do.</p>
                     <p>But in this I have not only
Scripture and all the reason of
the world on my side, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
sentences of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
writers of the Primitive
Church; I need not trouble my
self with citations of many of
them, since <hi>Calvin</hi> (<hi>lib. 3. Instit.</hi>
c. 3. § 10.) confesses that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
hath collected their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and is of their opinion, that
Concupiscence is not a <hi>sin,</hi> but an
<hi>infirmity</hi> only. But I will here
set down the words of S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
(Homil. 13. in epist. Rom.)</hi>
because they are very clear; <hi>Ipsae
passiones in se peccatum non sunt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36649:128"/>
Effraenata verò ipsarum immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia
peccatum operata est. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscentia
quidem peccatum non
est quando verò egressa modum fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
eruperit, tunc demum adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
fit, non à concupiscentia sed
à nimio &amp; illicito illius luxu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the way I cannot but
wonder why men are pleased,
where ever they finde the word
<hi>Concupiscence</hi> in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
presently to dream of
<hi>Original Sin,</hi> and make that to be
the sum total of it; whereas <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence</hi>
if it were the product
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, is but one small
part of it; [<hi>Et ut exempli gratia
unam illarum tractem</hi>] said S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
in the forecited place;
<hi>Concupiscence</hi> is but one of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and in the utmost extension
of the word, it can be taken but
for one half of the passion; for
not only all the passions of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36649:129"/>
Concupiscible faculty can be a
principle of sin, but the Irascible
does more hurt in the world;
<hi>that</hi> is more <hi>sensual, this</hi> is more
<hi>devillish.</hi> The reason why I note
this, is because upon this account
it will seem, that <hi>concupiscence</hi>
is no more to be called a sin then
<hi>anger</hi> is, and as S. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Be
angry, but sin not;</hi> so he might
have said, <hi>Desire,</hi> or <hi>lust, but sin not.</hi>
For there are some lustings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
without sin, as well as some
Angers; and that which is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to vertue and vice, cannot of it
self be a vice; To which I add, that
if <hi>Concupiscence</hi> taken for all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
be a sin, then so are all the
passions of the Irascible faculty.
Why one more then the other is
not to be told, but that Anger in
the first motions is not a sin, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
because it is not alwaies sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the second; a man may
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36649:129"/>
be actually angry, and yet really
innocent: and so he may be <hi>lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
and <hi>full of desire,</hi> and yet he
may be not only that which is
good, or he may overcome his
desires to that which is bad. I
have now considered what your
Lordship received from others, and
gave me in charge your self, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
concupiscence.</p>
                     <p>Your next charge is concerning
<hi>Antiquity,</hi> intimating that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the first antiquity is not
clearly against me, yet the second
is. For thus your Lordship is
pleased to write their objection
[<hi>I confess I finde not the Fathers
so fully and plainly speaking of
Original Sin, till</hi> Pelagius <hi>had
pudled the stream; but after this
you may finde S.</hi> Jerom &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p>That the Fathers of the first
400 years did speak plainly and
fully of it, is so evident as nothing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36649:130"/>
more, and I appeal to their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
as they are set down in
the papers annexed in their proper
place; and therefore that must needs
be one of the little arts by which
some men use to escape from the
pressure of that authority, by which
because they would have other
men concluded, sometimes upon
strict inquiry they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
entangled. Original Sin as
it is at this day commonly expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
was not the Doctrine of
the primitive Church; but when
<hi>Pelagius</hi> had pudled the stream,
S. <hi>Austin</hi> was so angry that he
stampt and disturb'd it more:
and truly my Lord, I do not
think that the Gentlemen that
urg'd against me S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
do well consider that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
my self to follow those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who were before him; and
whom S. <hi>Austin</hi> did forsake as I
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36649:130"/>
do him in the question. They may
as well press me with his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Article of the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Infants dying unbaptized,
or of absolute predestination. In
which Article, S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s words
are equally urged by the <hi>Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
and <hi>Molinists,</hi> by the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi>
and <hi>Contra-remonstrants,</hi>
and they can serve both, and
therefore cannot determine me.
But then (My Lord) let it be
remembred, that they are as
much against S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> as
I am against S. <hi>Austin,</hi> with
this only difference; that S.
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaks constantly in
the argument, which S. <hi>Austin</hi>
did not, and particularly in that
part of it which concerns <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence.</hi>
For in the inquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a sin or no; he speaks
so variously, that though <hi>Calvin</hi>
complains of him, that he cals
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36649:131"/>
it only an <hi>infirmity,</hi> yet he also
brings testimonies from him to
prove it to be a <hi>sin,</hi> and let any
man try if he can tie these words
together. (<hi>De peccator. mer. et
remission l. 1. c. 3.) Concupiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
carnis peccatum est, quia inest
illi inobedientia contra dominatum
mentis.</hi> Which are the words your
Lordship quotes: Concupiscence
is a sin because it is a disobedience
to the Empire of the spirit. But
yet in another place; (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de

                           </expan> culpa est in
corpore dormientis?</hi> It is a sin and
it is no sin, it is criminal, but is
without fault; it is culpable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a disobedience, and yet
this disobedience without actual
consent is not culpable. If I do
beleeve S. <hi>Austin,</hi> I must disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36649:131"/>
him; and which part soever
I take, I shall be reproved by
the same authority. But when the
Fathers are divided from each
other, or themselves, it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to follow either; but when
any of them are divided from
reason and Scripture, then it is
not indifferent for us to follow
<hi>them,</hi> and neglect <hi>these;</hi> and yet if
these who object S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to my Doctrine, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to subject to all that he saies,
I am content they shall follow
him in this too, provided that
they will give me my liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I will not be tied to him that
speaks contrary things to himself,
and contrary to them that went
before him; and though he was a
rare person, yet he was as fallible
as any of my brethren at this
day. He was followed by many
ignorant ages, and all the world
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36649:132"/>
knowes by what accidental advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
he acquired a great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but he who made no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of deserting all his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
must give us leave upon the
strength of his own reasons to quit
his authority.</p>
                     <p>All that I shall observe is this,
that the Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin</hi>
as it is explicated by S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
had two parents; one was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Encratites,</hi> and some
other Hereticks, who forbad Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and supposing it to be evill,
thought they were warranted to
say, it was the bed of sin, and
children the spawn of vipers and
sinners. And S. <hi>Austin</hi> himself,
and especially S. <hi>Hierom</hi> (whom
your Lordship cites) speaks some
things of marriage, which if they
were true, then marriage were
highly to be refused, as being the
increaser of sin rather then of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36649:132"/>
children, and a semination in the
flesh, and contrary to the spirit,
and such a thing which being
mingled with sin, produces uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal
issues, the mother and the
daughter are so like that they are
the worse again. For if a proper
inherent sin be effected by chaste
marriages, then they are in this
particular equal to adulterous em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
and rather to be <hi>pardoned</hi>
then <hi>allowed;</hi> and if all <hi>Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence</hi>
be vicious, then no marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
can be pure. These things it
may be have not been so much
considered, but your Lordship I
know remembers strange sayings
in S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in <hi>Athenag or as,</hi>
and in S. <hi>Austin,</hi> which possibly
have been countenanced and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at the charge of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But the other parent of this
is the zeal against the <hi>Pelagian</hi>
Heresie, which did serve it self
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36649:133"/>
by saying too little in this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and therefore was thought fit
to be confuted by saying too
much; and that I conjecture right
in this affair, I appeal to the words
which I cited out of S. <hi>Austin</hi> in
the matter of Concupiscence;
concerning which he speaks the
same thing that I do, when he is
disingaged; as in his books <hi>De
eivitate Dei:</hi> but in his Tractate
<hi>de peccatorum meritis &amp; remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione,</hi>
which was written in his
heat against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> he
speaks quite contrary. And who
ever shall with observation read his
one book of Original Sin against
<hi>Pelagius,</hi> his two books <hi>de Nuptiis
&amp; Concupiscentia</hi> to <hi>Valerius,</hi> his
three books to <hi>Marcellinus, de pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum
meritis &amp; remissione,</hi> his
four books to <hi>Boniface, contra
duas epistolas Pelagianorum,</hi> his
six books to <hi>Claudius</hi> against <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:36649:133"/>
and shall think himself
bound to beleeve all that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
man wrote, will not only
finde it impossible he should, but
will have reason to say, that zeal
against an error is not alwaies the
best instrument to finde our truth.
The same complaint hath been
made of others; and S. <hi>Jerome</hi>
hath suffer'd deeply in the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
I shall not therefore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
your Lordship with giving
particular answers to the words
of S. <hi>Jerom</hi> and S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(besides what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said) I do not think that
their words are an argument fit to
conclude against so much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
nor against a much less
then that which I have every
where brought in this Article,
though indeed their words are
capable of a fair interpretation,
and besides the words quoted out

of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> are none of his;
and for <hi>Aquinas, Lombard,</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure,</hi>
your Lordship might as
well press me with the opinion of
Mr. <hi>Calvin, Knox</hi> and <hi>Buchannan,</hi>
with the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> or the
<hi>Scots</hi> Presbyteries: I know they
are against me, and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them for it, but it is no
disparagement to the truth, that
other men are in error. And yet
of all the Schoolmen, <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
should least have been urg'd
against me, for the proverbs sake:
for, <hi>Adam non peccavit in Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura;
Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales</hi> would
often say, that <hi>Adam</hi> never sin'd
in <hi>Bonaventure.</hi> But it may be
he was not in earnest: no more
am I.</p>
                     <p>The last thing your Lordship
gives to me in charge in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the objectors, is that <hi>I
would take into consideration the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36649:135"/>
Covenant made between Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God and</hi> Adam, <hi>as relating to
his posterity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I answer, that I know of
no such thing; God made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>Adam</hi> indeed, and us'd
the right of his dominion over
his posterity, and yet did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what was just; but I
finde in Scripture no mention
made of any such Covenant as is
dreamt of about the matter of
original sin: only the Covenant of
works God did make with all
men till Christ came; but he did
never exact it after <hi>Adam;</hi> but
for a Covenant that God should
make with <hi>Adam,</hi> that if he stood,
all his posterity should be I know
not what; and if he fell, they
should be in a damnable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of this (I say) there is <hi>nec vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
nec vestigium</hi> in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that ever I could meet
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36649:136"/>
with: if there had been any such
covenant, it had been but equity
that to all the persons interessed it
should have been communicated,
and caution given to all who were
to suffer, and abilities given to
them to prevent the evil: for
else it is not a Covenant with
them, but a decree concerning
them; and it is impossible that
there should be a covenant made
between two, when one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
knowes nothing of it.</p>
                     <p>I will enter no further into this
enquiry, but only observe, that
though there was no such co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
yet the event that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
might without any such co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
have justly entred in at
many doors. It is one thing to
say that God by <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin was
moved to a severer entercourse
with his posterity, for that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
true; and it is another
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36649:136"/>
thing to say that <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin of it
self did deserve all the evill that
came actually upon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
Death is the wages of sin,
one death for one sin; but not
10000 millions for one sin; but
therefore the Apostle affirms it to
have descended on all, <hi>in as much
as all men have sin'd,</hi> But if
from a sinning Parent a good
childe descends; the childs inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
will more prevail with God
for kindness, then the fathers sin
shall prevail for trouble. <hi>Non

God does not alwaies
make the fathers sins descend
upon the children. But if a good
childe is born of a bad father,
like a healthful body from an ill
affected one, he is freed from the
punishment of his stock, and passes
from the house of wickedness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another family. But he who
inherits the disease, he also must
be heir of the punishment; <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

                     <p>Other waies there are by which
it may come to pass that the sins
of others may descend upon us.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:36649:137"/>
He that is <hi>author</hi> or the <hi>perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
the <hi>minister</hi> or the <hi>helper,</hi> the
<hi>approver</hi> or the <hi>follower,</hi> may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
the sins of others to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but then it is not their sins
only, but our own too, and it is
like a dead taper put to a burning
light and held there, this derives
light and flames from the other,
and yet then hath it of its own,
but they dwell together and make
one body. These are the waies by
which punishment can enter, but
there are evils which are no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
and they may come
upon more accounts, by <hi>Gods Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
by natural consequence,</hi> by

                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:36649:138"/>But that directly and properly
one should be punish'd for the
sins of others was indeed practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by some Common-wealths;
<hi>Utilitatis specie saepissimè in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub.

it sometimes for terror, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their waies of preventing
evil is very imperfect: and when
<hi>Pedianus secundus</hi> the <hi>Pretor</hi> was
kill'd by a slave, all the family of
them was kill'd in punishment;
this was <hi>secundum veterem morem</hi>
said <hi>Tacit. (Annal.</hi> 14.) for in the
slaughter of <hi>Marcellus</hi> the slaves
fled for fear of such usage; it was
thus, I say, among the <hi>Romans,</hi> but

will move no more stones, but
hereafter carry them as long as I
can, rather then make a noise by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36649:138"/>
throwing them down; I shall
only add this one thing: I
was troubled with an objection
lately; for it being propounded
to me, why it is to be beleeved
that the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> could spoil
the nature of man, and yet the
nature of Devils could not be
spoiled by their sin which was
worse; I could not well tell what
to say, and therefore I held my
peace.</p>
