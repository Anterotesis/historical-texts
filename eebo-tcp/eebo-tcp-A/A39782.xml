            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THERE is not perhaps in humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs any thing ſo unaccountable as the Indignity and Cruelty with which the far greater part of Mankind ſuffer themſelves to be uſed under pretence of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For ſome Men falſly perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that bad Governments are advantageous to them, as moſt conducing to gratify their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Avarice and Luxury, ſet themſelves with the utmoſt Art and Violence to procure their Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment: and almoſt the whole World has been trampled under foot, and ſubjected to Tyranny, for want of underſtanding by what Methods they were brought into it. For tho Mankind take great Care and Pains to inſtruct themſelves in other Arts and Sciences, yet very few apply themſelves to conſider the Nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an Enquiry ſo uſeful and neceſſary both
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46820:3"/>
to Magiſtrate and People. Nay, in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries the Arts of State being altogether directed either to enſlave the People, or to keep them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Slavery, it is become almoſt every where a Crime to reaſon about Matters of Government. But if Men would beſtow a ſmall part of the Time and Application which they throw away upon curious but uſeleſs Studies, or endleſs Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, in peruſing thoſe excellent Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which the Antients have left us, they would be enabled to diſcover all ſuch Abuſes and Corruptions as tend to the Ruine of Publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. 'Tis therefore very ſtrange that they ſhould think Study and Knowledg neceſſary in every thing they go about, except in the nobleſt and moſt uſeful of all Applications, The Art of Government.</p>
            <p>Now if any Man in compaſſion to the Miſeries of a People ſhould endeavour to diſabuſe them in any thing relating to Government, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly incur the Diſpleaſure, and perhaps be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the Rage of thoſe, who think they find their Account in the Oppreſſion of the World; but will hardly ſucceed in his Endeavours to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the Multitude. For the Generality of all Ranks of Men are cheated by Words and Names; and provided the antient Terms and outward Forms of any Government be retained, let the Nature of it be never ſo much altered, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to dream that they ſhall ſtill enjoy their former Liberty, and are not to be awakned till it prove too late. Of this there are many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Examples in Hiſtory; but that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46820:3"/>
Inſtance which I have choſen to inſiſt on, as moſt ſutable to my purpoſe, is, the Alteration of Government which happened in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Europe</hi> about the Year 1500. And 'tis worth Obſervation, that tho this Change was fatal to their Liberty, yet it was not introduced by the Contrivance of ill-deſigning Men; nor were the miſchievous Conſequences perceived, unleſs by a few wiſe Men, who, if they ſaw it, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Two hundred Years being already paſſed ſince this Alteration began, <hi>Europe</hi> has felt the Effects of it by ſad Experience; and the true Cauſes of the Change are now become more viſible.</p>
            <p>To lay open this Matter in its full Extent, it will be neceſſary to look farther back, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the Original and Conſtitution of thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments that were eſtabliſhed in <hi>Europe</hi> about the Year 400, and continued till this Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>When the Goths, Vandals, and other warlike Nations, had at different Times, and under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Leaders, over-run the Weſtern Parts of the Roman Empire, they introduced the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Form of Government into all the Nations they ſubdued. The General of the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came King of the Conquered Country; and the Conqueſt being abſolute, he divided the Lands amongſt the Great Officers of his Army, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Barons;</hi> who again parcelled out their ſeveral Territories in ſmaller Portions to the inferiour Souldiers that had followed them in the Wars, and who then became their Vaſſals,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46820:4"/>
enjoying thoſe Lands for Military Service. The King reſerved to himſelf ſome Demeaſnes for the Maintenance of his Court and Attendance. When this was done, there was no longer any ſtanding Army kept on foot, but every Man went to live upon his own Lands; and when the Defence of the Country required an Army, the King ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the Barons to his Standard, who came at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with their Vaſſals. Thus were the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Europe</hi> compoſed for about eleven hundred Years; and this Conſtitution of Government put the Sword into the hands of the Subject, becauſe the Vaſſals depended more immediately on the Barons, than on the King; which effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Freedom of thoſe Governments. For the Barons could not make uſe of their Power to deſtroy thoſe limited Monarchies, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying their own Grandeur; nor could the King invade their Privileges, having no other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than the Vaſſals of his own Demeaſnes to rely upon for his Support in ſuch an Attempt.</p>
            <p>I lay no great ſtreſs on any other Limitations of thoſe Monarchies; nor do I think any ſo eſſential to the Liberties of the People, as that which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Sword in the hands of the Subject. But ſince in our time moſt Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> are in poſſeſſion of the Sword, by ſtanding Mercenary Forces kept up in time of Peace, and abſolutely depending upon them, I ſay that all ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are changed from Monarchies to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies. Nor can the Power of granting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing Money, tho veſted in the Subject, be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Security for Liberty, where a ſtanding Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46820:4"/>
Army is kept up in time of Peace: For he that is arm'd, is always Maſter of the Purſe of him that is unarm'd. And not only that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Tyrannical, which is tyrannically exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; but all Governments are Tyrannical, which have not in their Conſtitution a ſufficient Security againſt the Arbitrary Power of the Prince.</p>
            <p>I do not deny that theſe limited Monarchies during the greatneſs of the Barons, had ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: I know few Governments free from them. But after all, there was a Balance that kept thoſe Governments ſteady, and an effectual Proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Encroachments of the Crown. I do leſs pretend that the preſent Governments can be reſtored to the Conſtitution before-mentioned. The following Diſcourſe will ſhow the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it. My Deſign is, firſt of all to explain the Nature of the paſt and preſent Governments of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to diſabuſe thoſe who think them the ſame, becauſe they are called by the ſame Names; and who ignorantly clamour againſt ſuch as would preſerve that Liberty which is yet left.</p>
            <p>In order to this, and for a further and clearer Illuſtration of the Matter, I ſhall deduce from their Original the Cauſes, Occaſions, and the Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe many unforeſeen Accidents, which falling out much about the ſame time, produced ſo great a Change. And it will at firſt ſight ſeem very ſtrange, when I ſhall name the Reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Learning, the Invention of Printing, of the Needle and of Gunpowder, as the chief of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46820:5"/>
them; things in themſelves ſo excellent, and which, the laſt only excepted, might have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of infinite Advantage to the World, if their remote Influence upon Government had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated by ſutable Remedies. Such odd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, and of ſuch a different Nature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company extraordinary Inventions of any kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> being taken by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in the Year 1453, many Learned Greeks fled over into <hi>Italy;</hi> where the favourable reception they found from the Popes, Princes, and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of that Country, ſoon introduced amongſt the better ſort of Men, the ſtudy of the Greek Tongue, and the Antient Authors in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. About the ſame time likewiſe ſome Learned Men began to reſtore the Purity of the Latin Tongue. But that which moſt contributed to the Advancement of all kind of Learning, and eſpecially the ſtudy of the Antients, was the Art of Printing; which was brought to a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection a few Years after. By this means their Books became common, and their Arts generally underſtood and admired. But as Mankind from a natural propenſion to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is always ready to chuſe out of every thing what may moſt gratify their vicious Appetites; ſo the Arts which the Italians firſt applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to improve, were principally thoſe that had been ſubſervient to the Luxury of the Antients in the moſt corrupt Ages, of which they had many Monuments ſtill remaining. <hi>Italy</hi> was preſently filled with Architects, Painters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Sculptors; and a prodigious Expence was made in Buildings,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46820:5"/>
Pictures and Statues. Thus the Italians began to come off from their frugal and military way of living, and addicted themſelves to the purſuit of refined and expenſive Pleaſures, as much as the Wars of thoſe times would permit. This Infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpread it ſelf by degrees into the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations. But theſe things alone had not been ſufficient to work ſo great a Change in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if a preceding Invention, brought into common uſe about that time, had not produced more new and extraordinary Effects than any had ever done before; which probably may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conſequences yet unforeſeen, and a farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Manners of Men, as long as the World laſts: I mean, the Invention of the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, by the help of which Navigation was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved; a Paſſage opened by Sea to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and a new World diſcovered. By this means the Luxury of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>America</hi> was added to that of the Antients; and all Ages, and all Countries concurred to ſink <hi>Europe</hi> into an Abyſs of Pleaſures; which were rendred the more expenſive by a perpetual Change of the Faſhions in Clothes, Equipage and Furniture of Houſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe things brought a total Alteration in the way of living, upon which all Government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. 'Tis true, Knowledg being mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and a great Curioſity and Nicety in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing introduced, Men imagined themſelves to be gainers in all Points, by changing from their frugal and military way of living, which I muſt confeſs had ſome mixture of Rudeneſs and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in it, tho not inſeparable from it. But at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46820:6"/>
the ſame time they did not conſider the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Evils that are altogether inſeparable from an expenſive way of living.</p>
            <p>To touch upon all theſe, tho ſlightly, would carry me too far from my Subject; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore content my ſelf to apply what has been ſaid, to the immediate Deſign of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>The far greater ſhare of all thoſe Expences fell upon the Barons; for they were the Perſons moſt able to make them, and their Dignity ſeemed to challenge whatever might diſtinguiſh them from other Men, This plunged them on a ſudden into ſo great Debts, that if they did not ſell, or otherwiſe alienate their Lands, they found themſelves at leaſt obliged to turn the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Service their Vaſſals owed them, into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; partly by way of Rent, and partly by way of Leaſe, or Fine for paiment of their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And by this means the Vaſſal having his Lands no longer at ſo eaſy a Rate as before, could no more be obliged to military Service, and ſo became a Tenant. Thus the Armies, which in preceding times had been always compoſed of ſuch Men as theſe, ceaſed of courſe, and the Sword ſell out of the hands of the Barons. But there being always a neceſſity to provide for the Defence of every Country, Princes were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards allowed to raiſe Armies of Volunteers and Mercenaries. And great Sums were given by Diets and Parliaments for their Maintenance, to be levied upon the People grown rich by Trade, and diſpirited for want of Military Exerciſe.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46820:6"/>
Such Forces were at firſt only raiſed for preſent Exigencies, and continued no longer on foot than the Occaſions laſted. But Princes ſoon found Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to make them perpetual, the chief of which was the gariſoning Frontier Towns and Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Methods of War being altered to the tedious and chargeable way of Sieges, principally by the Invention of Gunpowder. The Officers and Souldiers of theſe Mercenary Armies depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Subſiſtence and Preferment, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Prince, as the former Militia's did upon the Barons, the Power of the Sword was transferred from the Subject to the King, and War grew a conſtant Trade to live by. Nay, many of the Barons themſelves being reduced to Poverty by their expenſive way of living, took Commands in thoſe Mercenary Troops; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill continued Hereditary Members of Diets, and other Aſſemblies of State, after the loſs of their Vaſſals, whom they formerly repreſented, they were now the readieſt of all others to load the People with heavy Taxes, which were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to increaſe the Prince's Military Power, by Guards, Armies, and Citadels, beyond Bounds or Remedy.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that before this Change, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies were often giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

What I have ſaid hitherto has been always with regard to one or other, and often to moſt Countries in <hi>Europe.</hi> What follows will have a more particular regard to <hi>England;</hi> where, tho the Power of the Barons be ceaſed, yet no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Troops are yet eſtabliſhed. The Reaſon of which is, that <hi>England</hi> had before this great Alteration loſt all her Conqueſts in <hi>France,</hi> the Town of <hi>Calais</hi> only excepted; and that alſo was taken by the French, before the Change was thorowly introduced. So that the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had no Pretence to keep up Standing Forces, either to defend Conqueſts abroad, or to gariſon a Frontier towards <hi>France,</hi> which was their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Enemy, ſince the Sea was now become the only Frontier between thoſe two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh ſeems to have perceived the Alteration before-mentioned more than any Prince of his time, and obtained ſeveral Laws to favour and facilitate it. But the ſucceeding Princes were altogether improper to ſecond him: For <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was an unthinking Prince. The Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were ſhort, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> loved her Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple too well to attempt it. King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt was a Stranger, and of no Intereſt abroad. King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt did indeed endeavour to make himſelf Abſolute, tho ſomewhat prepoſterouſly; for he attempted to ſeize the Purſe, before he was Maſter of the Sword. But very wiſe Men have been of Opinion, that if he had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of as numerous Troops as thoſe which were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46820:7"/>
afterwards raiſed, and conſtantly kept up by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, he might eaſily have ſucceeded in his Enterprize. For we ſee that in thoſe Struggles which the Country Party had with King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and in thoſe Endeavours they uſed to bring about that Revolution which was afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by a Foreign Power, the chief and inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Difficulty they met with, was from thoſe Forces. And tho King <hi>James</hi> the Second had provoked the Nation to the laſt degree, and made his own Game as hard as poſſible, not only by invading our Civil Liberties, but likewiſe by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to change the Eſtabliſhed Religion for another which the People abhorred, whereby he loſt their Affections, and even thoſe of a great part of his Army; yet notwithſtanding all this Miſmanagement, <hi>England</hi> ſtood in need of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Force to ſave it; and how dangerous a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that is, the Hiſtories of all Ages can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'Tis true, this Circumſtance was favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Nation, that a Prince who had married the next Heir to the Crown, was at the Head of our Deliverance; yet did it engage us in a long and expenſive War. And now that we are much impoveriſhed, and by means of our former Riches and preſent Poverty, fallen into all the Corruptions which thoſe great Enemies of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue want, and Exceſs of Riches can produce; that there are ſuch Numbers of Mercenary Forces on foot at home and abroad; that the greateſt part of the Officers have no other way to ſubſiſt; that they are commanded by a wiſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46820:8"/>
and active King, who has at his Diſpoſal the formidable Land and Sea Forces of a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nation, the great Rival of our Trade: A King, who by Blood, Relation, other particular Ties, and common Intereſt, has the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> moſt of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the North, for his Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; who can, whatever Intereſt he join with, do what he thinks fit in <hi>Europe:</hi> I ſay, if a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Standing Army be kept up, (the firſt of that kind, except thoſe of the Uſurper Cromwel and the late King <hi>James,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> has ſeen for thirteen hundred Years) I deſire to know, where the Security of the Liberties of <hi>England</hi> lies, unleſs in the good Will and Pleaſure of the King: I deſire to know, what real Security can be had againſt a Standing Army of Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, backed by the Corruption of a Nation, the Tendency of the way of Living, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Age, and the Example of the World.</p>

But we are told, that only Standing Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Forces can defend <hi>England</hi> from the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Standing Armies of <hi>France.</hi> However fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous this Aſſertion be, as indeed no good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can be brought to ſupport it, either from Reaſon or Experience; yet allowing it to be good, what Security can the Nation have, that theſe Standing Forces ſhall not at ſome time or other be made uſe of to ſuppreſs the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People, tho not in this King's time, to whom we owe their Preſervation? For I hope there is no Man ſo weak to think, that keeping up the Army for a Year, or for any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time than the Parliament ſhall have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Publick Faith to make good all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies of Funds granted for their Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is not the keeping them up for ever. 'Tis a pitiful ſhift in the Undertakers for a Standing Army, to ſay, We are not for a Standing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; We are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only for an Army from Year to Year, or till the Militia be made uſeful. For <hi>England</hi> cannot be in any hazard from <hi>France;</hi> at leaſt, till that Kingdom, ſo much exhauſted by War and Perſecution, ſhall have a breathing ſpace to recover. Before that time our Militia will be in order; and in the mean time our Fleets. Beſides, no Prince ever ſurrendred ſo great Countries, and ſo many ſtrong Places, I ſhall not ſay, in order to make a new War; but, as theſe Men will have it, to continue the ſame. The French King is old and diſeaſed, and was never willing to hazard much by any
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46820:9"/>
bold Attempt. If he, or the Dauphin, upon his Deceaſe, may be ſuſpected of any farther Deſign, it muſt be upon the Spaniſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, in caſe of the Death of that King. And if it be objected, that we ſhall ſtand in need of an Army, in ſuch a Conjuncture; I anſwer, that our Part in that, or in any other foreign War, will be beſt managed by Sea, as ſhall be ſhown hereafter.</p>
            <p>Let us then ſee if Mercenary Armies be not exactly calculated to enſlave a Nation. Which I think may be eaſily proved, if we conſider that ſuch Troops are generally compoſed of Men who make a Trade of War, and having little or no Patrimony, or ſpent what they once had, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that Employment in hopes of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance during Life, not at all thinking how to make themſelves capable of any other. By which means heavy and perpetual Taxes muſt be entail'd for ever upon the People for their Subſiſtence; and ſince all their Relations ſtand engaged to ſupport their Intereſt, let all Men judg, if this will not prove a very united and formidable Party in a Nation. But the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers for a Standing Army will ſay; Will you turn ſo many Gentlemen out to ſtarve, who have faithfully ſerved the Government? This Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I allow to be founded upon ſome Reaſon. For it ought to be acknowledged in Juſtice to our Army, that on all Occaſions, and in all Actions, both Officers and Souldiers have done their part. And therefore I think it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46820:9"/>
that all Officers and Souldiers of above forty Years, in conſideration of their Unfitneſs to apply themſelves at that Age to any other Employment, ſhould be recommended to the Bounty of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>But the Undertakers muſt pardon me if I tell them, That no well-conſtituted Government ever ſuffered any ſuch Men in it, whoſe Intereſt leads them to imbroil the State in War, and are an uſeleſs and inſupportable Burden in time of Peace. <hi>Carthage,</hi> after the firſt Roman War, found how dangerous they were: And <hi>Holland,</hi> in the Year 1672, how uſeleſs to defend them. If ever any Government ſtood in need of ſuch a ſort of Men, 'twas that of antient <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were engaged in perpetual War. The Argument can never be ſo ſtrong in any other Caſe. But the Romans well knowing ſuch Men and Liberty to be incompatible, and yet, being under a neceſſity of having Armies conſtantly on foot, made frequent Changes of the Men that ſerved in them; who, when they had been ſome time in the Army, were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to return to their Poſſeſſions, Trades, or other Employments. And to ſhow how true a Judgment that wiſe State made of this Matter, it is ſufficient to obſerve, that thoſe who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that Government, the greateſt that ever was amongſt Men, found themſelves obliged to continue the ſame Souldiers always in conſtant Pay and Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:46820:10"/>
There is another thing which I would not mention if it were not abſolutely neceſſary to my preſent purpoſe; and that is, the uſual Manners of thoſe who are engaged in Mercenary Armies. I ſpeak now of Officers in other Parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and not of thoſe in our Army, allowing them to be the beſt; and if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ words">

By which means the Officers become inſenſibly engaged in numberleſs Oppreſſions and Cruelties, the Colonels againſt the Captains, and the Captains againſt the inferior Souldiers. So that there is hardly any ſort of Men who are leſs Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour than the Officers of Mercenary Forces: and indeed Honour has now no other Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt them than Courage. Beſides, moſt Men that enter into thoſe Armies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers or Souldiers, as if they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſhow themſelves new Creatures, and perfectly regenerate, if before they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt or ſober, immediately turn themſelves to all manner of Debauchery and Wickedneſs,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46820:10"/>
committing all kind of Injuſtice and Barbarity againſt poor and defenceleſs People. Now tho the natural Temper of our Men be more juſt and honeſt than that of the French, or of any other People, yet may it not be feared, that ſuch bad Manners may prove contagious? And if ſuch Manners do not fit Men to enſlave a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Devils only muſt do it.

So that whatever be the Conduct of a Mercenary Army, we can never be ſecure as long as any ſuch Force is kept up in <hi>England;</hi> and I confeſs I do not ſee by what Rules of good Policy any Mercenary Forces have been connived at either in <hi>England</hi> or elſewhere. Sure, 'tis allowing the Diſpenſing Power in the moſt eſſential Point of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The Subjects formerly had a real Security for their Liberty, by having the Sword in their own hands. That Security, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all others, is loſt; and not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ht diſaffected to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. But ſure it muſt not be the antient Limited and Legal Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> that theſe Gentlemen mea It muſt be a French Faſhion of Monarchy, where the King has Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do what he pleaſes, and the People no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for any thing they poſſeſs. We have quitted our antient Security, and put the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia into the Power of the King. The only remaining Security we have is, That no Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army was ever yet allowed in time of Peace, the Parliament having ſo often and ſo expreſly declared it to be contrary to Law. If a Standing Army be allow'd, what Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference will there be between the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſhall then live under, and any kind of Government under a good Prince? Of which there have been ſome in the moſt deſpotick Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies. If this be a Limited and not an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, as there are Conditions, ſo there ought to be Securities on both ſides. The Barons never pretended that their Militia's ſhould be conſtantly on foot, and together in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in times of Peace. 'Tis evident that would have ſubverted the Conſtitution, and made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them a Petty Tyrant. And 'tis as evident, that Standing Forces are the fitteſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to make a Tyrant, tho not of ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Prince as we now live under, yet, to be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46820:11"/>
ſure, of ſome of his Succeſſors. Whoever is for making the King's Power too great or too little, is an Enemy to the Monarchy. But to give him a Standing Army, puts his Power beyond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, and conſequently makes him Abſolute. If the People had any other real Security for their Liberty than that there be no Standing Army in time of Peace, there might be ſome colour to demand it. But if that only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Security be taken away from the People, we have deſtroyed the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>'Tis pretended, we are in hazard of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by a powerful Enemy; Shall we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſtroy our Conſtitution? What is it then that we would defend? Is it our Perſons, by the Ruine of our Conſtitution? In what then ſhall we be Gainers? In ſaving our Lives by the Loſs of our Liberties? If our Pleaſures and Luxury make us live like Brutes, it ſeems we muſt not pretend to reaſon any better than they. I would fain know, if there be any other way of making a Prince Abſolute, than by allowing him a Standing Army: If by it all Princes have not been made Abſolute; If without it, any. Whether our Enemies ſhall conquer us is uncertain. But whether a Standing Army will enſlave as, neither Reaſon nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will ſuffer us to doubt. 'Tis therefore evident, that no Pretence of Danger from abroad, can be an Argument to keep up a Standing Army, or any Mercenary Forces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46820:12"/>
Let us now conſider whether we may not be able to defend our ſelves by a well-regulated Militia againſt any Foreign Force, tho never ſo formidably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Nation may be free from the Fears of Invaſion from abroad, as well as from the Danger of Slavery at home.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known, that after the Barons had loſt the Military Service of their Vaſſals, Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's of ſome kind or other were eſtabliſhed in moſt parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> But the prince having the Power of naming and preſerring the Officers of theſe Militia's, they could he no Balance in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as the former were. And he that will conſider what has been ſaid in this Diſcourſe, will eaſily perceive that the eſſential Quality requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſuch a Militia, as might fully anſwer the Ends of the former, muſt be that the Officers ſhould be named and preferr'd, as well as they and the Souldiers paid, by the People that ſet them out. So that if Princes look upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Militia's as not capable of defending a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Foreign Armies; the People have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to entruſt them with the Defence of their Liberties.</p>
            <p>'Tis as well known that after the diſſolution of that Antient Militia under the Barons, which made this Nation ſo Great and Glorious, tho, by ſetting up Militia's generally through <hi>Europe,</hi> the Sword came not into the Hands of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; which was the only thing could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

And indeed they have ſucceeded too well in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: For the greateſt part of the World has been fool'd into an opinion, That a Militia cannot be made ſerviceable. I ſhall not ſay 'twas only Militia's could conquer the World; and that Princes to have ſucceeded fully in the Deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, muſt have deſtroyed all the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Memory of Antient Governments, where the Accounts of ſo many excellent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of Militia are yet extant. I know the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Ignorance of the World concerning the Art of War, as it was practiſed by the Antionts; tho what remains of that Knowledg in their Writings be ſufficient to give a mean Opinion of the Modern Diſcipline. For this Reaſon I ſhall examine, by what has paſſed of late Years in this Nation, whether Experience have convinced us, that Officers bred in Foreign Wars, be ſo far preſerable to others who have been under no other Diſcipline than that of an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46820:13"/>
ordinary and ill-regulated Militia; and if the Commonalty of <hi>England</hi> at their firſt entrance upon Service, be not as capable of a reſolute Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Action, as any ſtanding Forces. The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Naſeby</hi> will fully reſolve this Doubt, which is generally thought to have been the deciding Action of the late Civil War. The Number of Forces was equal on both ſides; nor was there any Advantage in the Ground, or extraordinary Accident that happened during the Fight, which could be of conſiderable importance to either ſide. In the Army of the Parliament, nine only of the Officers had ſerved abroad, and moſt of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were Prentices drawn out of <hi>London</hi> but two months before. In the King's Army there was above a thouſand Officers that had ſerved in foreign Parts: Yet were they routed and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by thoſe new-raiſed Prentices; who were obſerved to be obedient to Command, and brave in Fight; not only in that Action, but on all Occaſions during that active Campagn. The People of this Nation are not a daſtardly Crew, like thoſe born in Miſery under Oppreſſion and Slavery, who muſt have time to rub off that Fear, Cowardice and Stupidity which they bring from home. And tho Officers ſeem to ſtand in more need of Experience than private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, yet in that Battel it was ſeen, that the Sobriety, and Principle of the Officers on the one ſide, prevailed over the Experience of thoſe on the other.</p>

'Tis well known that divers Regiments of our Army lately in <hi>Flanders</hi> have never been once in Action, and not one half of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thrice, nor any of them five times during the whole War. O, but they have been under Diſcipline, and accuſtomed to obey! And ſo may Men in Militia's. We have had to do with an Enemy, who, tho abounding in Numbers of excellent Officers, yet durſt never fight us without a viſible Advantage. Is that Enemy like to invade us, when he muſt be unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſitated to put all to hazard in ten days, or ſtarve, unleſs we will ſuppoſe we are to have no Fleet at all?</p>
            <p>But to come to ſome of the Capital Errors committed by thoſe that eſtabliſhed the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Militia's, beſides what has been already mentioned; One of the chief was, the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to exerciſe the whole People, for which there were many excellent and wholſome Laws in this Nation, and almoſt every where elſe. Another Error was, the taking Men without diſtinction, and, for the moſt part, the Scum of the People into that ſmall number which they liſted and exerciſed. Whereas if a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber only was to be exerciſed, no Man of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Riches ought to be excuſed from that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus it was, that theſe Militia's fell into contempt; and Men of Quality and Eſtates hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power to ſend any wretched Servant in their place, became themſelves abject and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46820:14"/>
by being diſuſed to handle Arms, 'Tis well obſerved by a Judicious Author, that 'tis eaſier to exerciſe a greater Number than a leſs; and conſequently all that are able to bear Arms in a Nation, than a ſmall Number pickt out of a wide Country; who muſt march far, and be from home ſeveral days at each Exerciſe. And perhaps it might be found an unneceſſary trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and burden, to have certain numbers of Men liſted and formed into Bodies in time of Peace, if the whole People were exerciſed, and an eaſy Method laid down, by which ſuch numbers of Men as ſhall be thought convenient, may always be drawn out, even upon the moſt ſudden Occaſion. For by this means the Choice will be greater, as it ought to be, that ſo Trade, Manufactures and Husbandry may be as little diſturbed as poſſible, ſince the Impediments of the ſeveral Conditions of Men are ſo many and ſo various.</p>
            <p>'Twill be ſaid, That I inſiſt much upon the Errors of the preſent Militia, and do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a new Model by which they may be amended. I anſwer, A Parliament only can do that. The People are to tell wherein they are agrieved, and what is amiſs: It belongs only to that Wiſe Council to apply ſutable Remedies: Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be difficult when the Cauſes of the Diſeaſe are diſcovered. And there are many Models of Militia, both Antient and Modern, from which divers uſeful things may be taken.</p>

Of the Fleet I ſhall ſay little, having chiefly undertaken to ſpeak of Militia's and ſtanding Forces. But ſurely <hi>England</hi> cannot juſtly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend an Invaſion, if the Fleet alone were in ſuch order as it ought to be. And it can never be the Intereſt of this Nation to take any other ſhare in preſerving the Balance of <hi>Europe,</hi> than what may be performed by our Fleets. By which means our Money will be ſpent amongſt our ſelves, our Trade preſerved to ſupport the Charge of our Navy; our Enemies total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven out of the Sea, and great numbers of their Forces diverted from oppoſing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Allies abroad, to the defence of their own Coaſts.</p>
            <p>If this Method had been taken in the late War, I preſume it would have proved, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more advantagious to us, but alſo more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to our Allies than that which was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And 'tis in vain to ſay, that at this rate we ſhall have no Allies at all: For the weaker Party on the Continent muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to accept our Aſſiſtance in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we think fit to give it, or inevitably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. But if we ſend Mercenary Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas to join thoſe of our Allies then, at the end of every War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the preſent ſtruggle will recur, and at one time or other the Nation will be betrayed, and a Standing

Army eſtabliſhed: So that nothing can ſave us from following the Fate of all the other Kingdoms in <hi>Europe,</hi> but putting our Truſt altogether in our Fleets and Militia's, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other Forces than theſe. The Sea is the only Empire which can naturally belong to us. Conqueſt is not our Intereſt, much leſs to conſume our People and Treaſure in conquering for others.</p>
            <p>To conclude;</p>
            <p>If we ſeriouſly conſider the happy Condition of this Nation, who have lived for many Ages under the Bleſſings of Liberty, we cannot but be affected with the moſt tender Compaſſion to think that a Country, whoſe Fields are every where well cultivated and improved by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of rich Husbandmen; Her Rivers and Harbours filled with Ships; Her Cities, Towns, and Villages, enrich'd with Manufactures; where Men poſſeſſing vaſt Eſtates, are not hated and abhorred as in other Countries, but deſervedly bleſſed, by the poorer ſort of People; whoſe Merchants live in as great Splendor as the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of other Nations, and whoſe Commonalty not only ſurpaſſes all thoſe of that degree which the World can now boaſt of, but alſo thoſe of all former Ages, in Courage, Honeſty, good Senſe, Induſtry, and Generoſity of Temper; in whoſe very Looks there are ſuch viſible

Marks of a free and liberal Education, which Advantages cannot be imputed to the Climate, or to any other Cauſe, but the Freedom of the Government under which they live: I ſay, it cannot but make the Hearts of all honeſt Men bleed to think, that in their days the Felicity of ſuch a Country muſt come to a Period, if the Parliament do not prevent it, and his Majeſty be not prevailed upon to lay aſide the Thoughts of a Mercenary Army, which tho it may ſeem a Security in his time, yet by being continued, as will inevitably come to paſs, muſt produce, under his Succeſſors, thoſe fatal Conſequences that have always attended ſuch Forces in the other Kingdoms of <hi>Europe;</hi> Violation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, Decay of Trade, Oppreſſion of the Country by heavy Taxes and Quarters, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Miſery and Slavery of the poorer ſort, the Ruine of the Nobility and Gentry by their Expences in Court and Army, Deceit and Treachery in all Ranks of Men, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by Want and Neceſſity. Then ſhall we ſee our once happy Commonalty become baſe and abject, by being continually expoſed to the brutal Inſolence of the Souldiers, our Women debauch'd by their Luſt, ugly and naſty through Poverty, and the want of things neceſſary to preſerve their natural Beauty. Then ſhall we ſee that great City, the Pride and Glory not only of our Iſland, but of the World, ſubjected to the exceſſive Impoſitions
